Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week at Google. We're in some strange surroundings.  Jason Howell is sitting to my right. I've got Jeff Jarvis to my left.  And floating in the air where she belongs, the angel Stacey Higginbotham.  We've gathered together to talk about Google IOs keynote for 2017.  Lots of announcements we're going to go through one by one next on Twig.  This is Twig.  Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by Cashfly.  C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.  This is Twig This Week in Google.  Episode 405. Recorded Wednesday, May 17th, 2017. Google IO.

It's time for Twig This Week in Google in a little  bit of an unusual circumstance because today was Google IO, their developers conference, and  we were down at Shoreline Amphitheater for Google IO in Mountain View, California, joining me in  a beautiful studio provided by Google. Thank you, Google, and our good friend Chris DeBona.  We'll talk to Chris in just a second from Google's open source software initiative.  First, let me introduce our panel. Of course, Jeff Jarvis is here, unusually next to me,  which means I can do and he can do. That's great. I'm not sure. We have figured out the technology  to do that with the TV avatars that we use in the studio at home, but I'm glad we could do that here.  Google is amazing, really. They're just amazing. They are. They are indeed.  Also here, Jeff from our All About Android show and Tech News Today, Jason Howell. Good to see you.  I am doing great. Three of us sat together in the box seats, the press box seats to watch the event,  but Stacey Higginbotham probably had the best seat. She was back in our studios watching the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stream with Nathan Oliveris-Giles. Hello, Stacey. Hello. Yes, I have the same seat I have every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good seat. It's a comfortable seat. What do the dogs think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The dog was under the bed. She didn't have any opinions. She's not in the room today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Usually, I am where you were, which is watching the stream of a keynote and then commenting on it.  Thank you for doing that this morning. I appreciate it. But I thought for once, maybe the last time,  I thought I'd come to one of these events in person. Actually, it was kind of fun.  Shoreline Amphitheater, as you may or may not know, is a concert venue. It's the same place  Google did this last year. It's open air and we were sitting right underneath the edge between  the sky and the sheltered space, just waiting for the sun to come over and start broiling us.  I guess last year you never came. We froze. Last year you broiled. There were cases of sunburn  out there. They gave us Google a sun lotion. Oh, that's nice. I'm going to follow Ron Amadio's  live blog at Rars Technica as he went through the event so that way we can chronologically cover  and make sure we don't miss anything that Google announced. But before we do,  I'm curious, Stacey, what you and Nate thought of it from your vantage point. Was this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  an exciting, gripping keynote? So I was going to ask you guys if it was different for y'all.  So on our end watching it, we were not super pumped. None of the things made us go wow  to the extent. And most of we noticed that the two themes that emerged was context,  which is really exciting, but it's really hard to show. So context was building on AI  and giving people, giving AI context about where we are to give us better suggestions,  which is awesome. And then two, none of it's going to be out now. Nothing that was super exciting  seems to be available. And of course, I was thrilled about the TPU stuff, but that's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll get to the TPU real soon because that was very interesting, I thought. In fact,  that was part of Sundar Pichai's context, as you say, talking about how it was a mobile first world  until recently, and now it's an AI first world. This is not something new. Google said this last

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  year at Google IOT as well, I think. No, I mean, I think the whole thing was incremental.  They took the base they had last year and they added considerably to it. The problem is, as Stacey  said, it's quite right. The things that are impressive are not things that you hold in your  hand as a consumer and say, well, that's a great new gadget. The AI work is phenomenal. I think that  the photo recognition stuff, Google Lens, is going to be really important because what it says is  that Google will know the context, as Stacey said, of where you are and add value to that.  That's a big deal. So there's a lot of big deal technical stuff underneath. The tensor  new stuff is great. But in terms of if I were trying to write a consumer story about,  there's a lot of German journalists who are here. One guy has to write like 15 stories. I  don't envy him trying to figure out what stories to write for a consumer audience out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. How about you, Jason? Well, I think obviously there's a big  kind of dedication to, like you say, moving from mobile first to AI first, which we've seen in the  past year and a half, especially everyone is buckling down on AI. And I think the challenge  that Google had kind of going into IEO with an event that is so heavily focused on AI is that we  almost have been inundated with AI as it is already as the answer to everyone's prayers for  all of these different things. So when Google comes out and says, look, what else we're doing  with AI, it's a what else instead of you've never seen this before. You know what I mean?  There were few announcements this time that you could easily point at and say,  oh my God, mind blown. That's amazing that you can even do that right now. There's some really  impressive things, but we've already kind of bought into the idea that AI is this grand  savior and is able to take computing to a next level. So it's kind of like, oh yeah,  I could have assumed that they'd probably go there next. There were a lot of things missing. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we wanted to see Google Chromebook Pixel, maybe at least some mention of Chromebooks, Chrome OS,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  no mention at all. No new Pixel C, C to C. No new tablet. No tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say Nathan was upset that there was no VR stuff, but going back to this AI concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Before you say that, there is a VR keynote tomorrow. So there was VR stuff at the end.  I don't know. Maybe you didn't get to the end. No, I was there the whole time. I promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was sad that they didn't have a dedicated AR device that they could show on stage that they  introduced this. What they did is they introduced a reference design and said HTC and Lenovo,  we're going to build a dedicated AR. I'm sorry. But this is a big deal. This is a standalone VR

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to date. No one makes this even HTC with the vibe is tethered to a PC. Oculus without all the crap.  And imagine, I mean, I don't know the price. You're right. We don't know anything.  It's not here yet. Yeah. And we just want to put that in there.  But well, but I don't think Google announces something like that unless they believe it can  be made and made in a, I mean, it would be embarrassing if it weren't made this year,  for instance. So I, I think it shows Google says we now have it. This is somewhat similar in my  mind to what they did with the camera. They had this great technology, this image processing  technology they've developed using TensorFlow and AI. And then they had the pixel phone and they  said, well, we have limitations in the hardware that's in the phone, but what if we applied some  of this great software and AI to what we're doing, the process we're doing something,  frankly, that Apple has been doing and had scooped everybody with for years.  And suddenly the Google pixel is the best camera phone on the market. And I think what they're  saying it as I interpret it, I admittedly, they said nothing is we figured out a way to take  consumer hardware, something that's going to be relatively affordable. It's going to have,  has to have some battery life, right? It has to have decent screens. It has to, you talked about  latency, head latency is a huge problem in VR. It's what makes people nauseous.  And they figured out a way to use some form of motion sensitivity in this device to reduce  latency. They've done some stuff and I suspect a lot of it is done with existing hardware and  as, as with the camera applying some great software smarts based on AI to it. So  I'm reading well between the lines. I understand, but I think that there might be something of great  interest there. And to be fair, we won't find out till tomorrow. That's when the, or is it tomorrow?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tomorrow's the VR kind of keynote. Yeah. I'm very curious to see of the standalone, like the  question that I've had about the idea, cause this was a rumor that wall street journal had,  I think early last year, and we've kind of been waiting for the standalone VR headset to happen  is okay. If Google's doing a standalone VR headset, is this mobile VR, but without the  need to put your phone in or is it HTC Vive slash Oculus Rift level VR, you know, kind of like the  premium level of VR or is this somewhere in between and kind of explaining why that's necessary. If  it veers more for the mobile side, which is what I worry it might do. Well, what if you could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  daydream without buying it's look, it's gotta be less than an Android phone, right? Cause daydream  could be done right now with a $700 Android phone. So let's say it's a $500 or $400 price point,  but it's as good as daydream VR today. Would that be worth it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is that going to be worth it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd be very mad about that. Mad about that.  I'd be very mad about that. If their whole idea is here's a dedicated device that allows you to  do VR in the same way that you already can with the device that you have and a very inexpensive  viewer, but you don't need your phone anymore. That really does very little. That's little extra

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  weight. You're not thinking about the market, the classroom for instance, right now,  they wanted to do daydream VR for 30 kids in the classroom. You'd have to buy 30 high end

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  smartphones. Okay. All right. And so there is a market there, but I think, I think what we're  really dancing around is how today, how big is the VR market? I think it's a lot smaller  than anybody wishes it were. And who was it was telling this? Levy was telling us that Sundar  put up a, or somebody put up another post separately today saying, be patient with VR. It's not there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yet. We know, but it was, I think the VR guy, uh, is relieving lunch. It's like, it's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was it clay? Is it? Yeah. Okay. I put a post. So, so, but, but the, but the, but the, but the,  B A V O R. Yeah. So anyway, the problem is $500 divided, let's say it's 500 bucks. Um, is it right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we bringing it by that Christmas? That's, that's wild speculation. I don't, yeah, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it's designed for that. I don't know that there's a, there's a consumer market  for VR as a device yet. The advantage is you add a hundred bucks on your phone. Okay. Yeah,  that's a hassle. Yes. It doesn't come with the full capability, but to buy a separate dedicated  advice device for VR at, at pick a price, well, pick a price is good for schools because I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that this is where it could Google. I mean, schools are poor. It's a real add on for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A Chromebook they can, they can afford because it does curricular material and, and it makes them  more efficient to buy an extra device to show VR in a school. You've got to be a private school

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to afford them. We're talking a little bit in a vacuum. We'll find out more tomorrow and maybe  more later on. And there's really nothing to say until they ship a product. And then, but you're  right. I'm skeptical about the VR. I think, I think it's not, it's not surprising that clay would post  a something that says, Hey, you know, everybody expects so much VR. They're asking for, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  our stuff. I mean, Facebook has, has, has, has gone so to voce on VR and loud on AR. And in a way,  I think what we saw today from Google with the photo stuff with the, here is your environment,  here's that restaurant. I will understand the image of that restaurant and I will give you  data based on that. That's, that's an AR world. So the answers are going to come in AR first, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they're going to come through your camera on your phone. I think my plan to do this in  chronological logical order was just completely blown away. We've actually jumped to the end of  the keynote somehow. It's like we started at the end of the book. Yeah. But that wasn't the payoff.  There was a lot of stuff. Sundar Pichai took state the stage at the beginning, two minutes  past the hour, which was pretty timely for any keynote and gave out some numbers that were pretty  amazing for any company. 1 billion active users a month, 1 billion monthly active users  for Gmail, for Android, for Chrome, for Google play and for maps. How is that? That's a pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  good coincidence that all be exactly 1 billion. Yeah. This is, this is an AI world where you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with round numbers, approximations. Okay. Here's another round number. 500 million active. I'm  sorry. I just, I just lowered my seat. 500 million active users on Google photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With 1.2 billion, you're taking all the numbers. 1.2 billion photos a day. That's amazing. That is  2 billion active Android devices. I turn toward each other in this moment. Imagine if they started

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google plus now Google plus, what's that? Nobody mentioned Google plus. No, no, no. If you had

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  functionality when the photos and everything would be an entirely different effort. It might be. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  might be. 2 billion Android devices, active Android devices is, you know, I mean that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  dwarfs anything else. There's nothing even close. That's even worse. The sheer numbers of that. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hard to even understand, but. And a little later on we'll talk about it, but they announced something  called Android Go, which is a low cost version of Android designed for phones with less than a  gigabyte of memory. Lower processor speeds, lower cost obviously is key to that. And that's the key  to getting, as they said, to the next billion, 3 billion active users by next year. We'll see.  Let's see what else search maps and other services all use machine learning. And actually we've seen  machine learning already in Google's assistant, which has some smart reply features, but Chai  announced that smart reply is going to roll out to all Gmail users today. So smart reply I like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and I use it, but every time I use it, I feel guilty. I feel like I'm saying I feel like,  well, you're not good enough to respond to myself. I'm going to let Google respond for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just had a few exclamation marks. Maybe some happy faces. Well, the problem is you're still

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  here. I thought you left. No, it's very hard to like jump in on such a. Harder than usual,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey, right? It's always hard. I'm so sorry. Yes, no, it's okay. So smart reply. So etiquette

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  master here, Jeff, I think you're fine because smart reply really only works well when you're  trying to convey super basic information. Like if someone tells you their kid is dying, you're not  going to get a great smart reply, right? Then you, that's when you craft the heartfelt message. So I  wouldn't feel guilty for just replying to something like I'll be there later or let's set a date. I  think it's better than what probably happens now, which is you like put it away and you never

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  answer the email. So there were two Googlers in the room who laughed at that line. Is this something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that struck true to you? No, I have to say though, even the smart reply they showed on the screen  wasn't that smart because the question was, hey, let's go to a show. You want to go Saturday or  Sunday and the three smart replies were either one is okay. Saturday or whatever. No mention of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sunday. Sunday. Because it knows you're busy Sunday. It knows. Yes, context. No, I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that either would not be available. Yeah, that's cute. Yeah, no, one day. One day. So here's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  other thing, Stacey. So the other problem is that the replies add more bangers as we say in the news  business. More exclamation points that I would ever use. Now, is that because Google thinks that  I use a lot of exclamation points or does it do it for everybody? I don't think it's customized.  It's not customized to you yet. But it's not customized to me. So the whole world is going

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  crazy with exclamation points. Everyone loves exclamation points. I use them all the time.  They're awesome. What's wrong with you, Jeff? Oh, he's a professor. He probably uses the Oxford  comma. Yeah, you do use the Oxford comma and so should you. Two spaces or one. No, I don't want  to even get into it. No, no. So I would love smart reply. That's Oxford comma. Could one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  could smart play add emoji replies? You know, I find that the emoji replies. So the keyboard  auto connects or auto doesn't correct, but it suggests emojis. But it always does it way too  late for me. I've already typed the word and then it's like, oh, would you like an emoji?  And that totally defeats the purpose of an emoji, in my opinion, of not having to type the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, pre literate emoji is pre literate, not post literate. Exactly.  Image recognition. Wait, I'm sorry. I'm going to say this. Wait till Trump discovers emojis.  He's never used an emoji. He's never used emoji. Can somebody research that?  If you imagine Wolf Blitzer having to speak what the president said today,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if he's broken emojis. Has Donald Trump ever used an emoji in a tweet?  He won't know that. How could it possibly know that? She's thinking. I've never seen her think  this long. You think she's actually going through the tweets? I don't think she's thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think she's done. That's a stupid query. I think she did what a lot of people do when  you bring up that topic. She just like. I don't want to talk about that. I'm not going to talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about it. Let's talk about image recognition. This was a very interesting slide. Vision error  rate for image recognition has now improved so that it is better than human beings for image.  What does that mean by the way? I don't know, but it sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what that is. Oh, I do. I'm Google. What does it mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is speech recognition, not image recognition. No, it's image recognition.  Image also. Okay, I was like the chart you're showing says speech and I remember them talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about speech, but I did not remember image. I'm not showing it. That's the problem. And so  Karsten's looking very quickly for the image. It's a graph showing how algorithms have gone from  30% error rate to less than zero error rate. I don't know how you can let us go. How do you do  that? So it's a no, I'm sorry. Approaching zero error rate. There is this kind of a standard human  error rate. I guess humans, what could you look at and you would go, I don't know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And think about any optical illusion. Oh, maybe you look at, or, you know, or think about how bad  we, and I don't know if this messes with this, but think about how unreliable witnesses are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or, I mean, how many times have you, maybe it's just face recognition. Yeah, it might be better.  Okay. We have found this. Google has come up with the, I don't know if you can see this at home,  but these are the emojis that Donald, stop that. Jeff, you're trolling me and you're even here.  So the reason he mentioned this image recognition improvement is to announce a new project called  Google lens, which I think is very exciting and very interesting. It's initially going to come  with Google assistant, which by the way is now going to be in the iPhone as well as, you know,  more places than ever before. You can hear the cheers in the room or from like the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  front most biggest Google executives. They are all the iPhone users. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I love this. Yes. I have been wanting this forever since we had smartphones that were  smart enough because I like constantly do things like walk through my yard and I'm like,  ooh, is this a weed or is it a plant? Can I eat this? That's something that a human would

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  be not as good at. Right. If you show that weed to me, I'd say, yeah, eat it. Well, let's see what  happens. But Google would know Google lens would know if you could eat it. Exactly. So I'm excited.  Don't listen to Leo. He's trying to kill you. I like the image he showed. He showed a flower.  I do this all the time too, Stacy. He showed a flower. I say this all the time. I'm looking  out the, we're taking a walk. I'm looking out the window. What is that? And he showed a flower and  it actually figured out what the flower was. And then assistant offered you more things you could  do with that, including buy it, which I thought was really interesting. That's going to be very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  very valuable. You, you, you always Google goggles. I was just going to say, you remember the old  project product. I'm, I'm looking at an article from 2011 Google goggles gets faster, smarter,  solves Sudoku. It can scan barcodes, but it can also take a picture of a bridal dress and be able

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to go to everything. It's advanced a bit at a time. Yeah. Exactly. Google goggles was an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that you could install and use and do a lot of this. So at least some of this stuff, albeit now,  I mean, with the power of, you know, the technology nowadays and AI working on the back end, this,  it's like this on steroids. I think they had to program the data from Google goggles. What

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is different here? This is my, this is what I vaguely remember from Google goggles. It had  to be already entered in some sort of image database. So like it had to be a famous monument  and things like that. What's cool here is the image recognition is doing the work. This isn't  like a predetermined database. Does that make sense? Yes, absolutely. That's exactly the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  difference. I think you nailed it. He pointed a camera, you know, barcoded wifi credentials and  it said connected. It logs you in automatically. That was awesome. Right. That was, that was the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  biggest cheers I think of the day. Yeah. Well, everybody in the audience has crawled under

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  furniture and looked under the bottom of routers and tried to figure out what the lock-ins are.  That would really be fantastic. So all of this is being, all this is being improved over time  with the kind of massive training that Google did with, with, for instance, AlphaGo, they mentioned  in the go winning the go matches, beating the go master using tensor processing. And you got,  I love it, Stacey, you got excited about the tensor processing units. As old as you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, this was, this was exciting. So what was one of the big challenges in building specialized  chips for machine learning is that they've used GPUs historically because they need a lot of  fast IO and they need to do a lot of things in parallel. And so that's why you've got these  dedicated chips. What's been a challenge is you've only been able to run jobs on relatively small  clusters of GPUs because you can't distribute your job over like, when I was last reporting  deeply on this, it was like eight. So you couldn't go beyond eight different GPUs. What Google's done  has done 64, which is eight X the power is it eight X is it exponential that way? Anyway,  so that's actually a really big deal because that just means you can do your job. I mean,  it's like Moore's law for machine learning in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They showed little, especially engineered units that had there were quad core units, right?  And each one, I can't remember, was it 180 teraflops? And then they showed larger TPU units  that combine many of those 11.5 petaflops. Yeah. So the, if you could show the rack,  Karsten, that has the slide that has four of these in a rack, each of the units in this rack,  did what was it? A hundred, how many petaflops? It was 11.5 petaflops. So what you were looking  at is four racks, each could do 11.5 petaflops. You're talking, you know, 46 or 40. I don't know.  That's kind of an unimaginable amount of processing power, but that's also on the cloud. So if you can,  you know, you're using the Google compute engine and using tensor flow, suddenly you have devices  designed for both parts of machine learning, the training, which is massively compute intensive,  you're showing it a lot of images over and over and over again. And then the actual learning that  there it is. That's the, that's the slide inference. And the meta part of that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that the learning systems test the learning systems and there's the meta learning that goes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yes. The neural networks train the neural networks. And yes, when he was doing that, I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dying. So if you're a machine learning, you know, student or a guru, they had in the audience, a  17 year old who had built a process to do this. It was just amazing story. If you're, this is now  online for you to use for free. It's open source. He said that the tensor flow is the number one  machine learning program on GitHub. Thank you, Chris, to Bona. I'm sure you helped. Oh, the other  that helped put that online. That's really remarkable to offer that kind of thing. And of  course, Google benefits for by it, but we all benefit by it. I think that's one of my amateurish

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  questions. Yeah. So the processing power you get from this is just for learning systems. It's that  kind of, it's a different kind of logic, different kind of programming, the speed and everything else  is a, is a kind of a parallel universe of computing versus straight computational work. It could do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  standard. It could do van noymen stuff, but it's optimized for this kind of massively parallel  technology. It's designed for 180. You know what? We should bring Christa Bona over here.  This would be a good time to get some of those. You happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't go too far, Jeff. Now I get confused by the headphones and the rest. It's great to, by the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  way, great to see you. Don't be confused because the sound is going to be weird, but great to see  you. Christa Bona is an old friend. I mean, you, you started floss weekly probably 12 years ago,  10 years ago, something like that. At the time you were not at Google, you were doing some game

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  saying, yeah, I know. So that was about 13, 14 years ago. Yeah. We did floss weekly and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it can't be that long. Google's only 12 years old. I mean, Google tweet, tweet is only a 12  years old. So, but you've been at Google. How long now? 12 and a half years. Well, so it was  before you went. Yeah, you're right. It's before you went to Google. We did a few floss weeklies  live in studios here. And I thank you for that. And I thank you for arranging this year and last

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  year as well, a place for us to do the show. Well, I mean, and I don't want to take too much credit.  I mean, Richard did a lot of the work, you know, last year and this year. Well, thank you, Richard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People run the studios here. So tell us you are in charge of open source at Google. What's that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I look after all the incoming and outgoing open source code. I look after the health of the open  source community in general so that we can continue to draw from it and release to it. And I also look  after a small science education group called making in science. We'll be at Maker Faire on Friday.  We'll look for you. Great. As we have with there. And then I also do some funny sort of government

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  relations and stuff. I do some unusual things. The process of taking tensor flow, which was an  internal project and making it open source and putting on GitHub. Tell me what that involves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Will, who's my my compatriot and runs my my compliance and outreach team. And I,  we try to have a really greased machine to help people release software from Google.  But TensorFlow is really special. So there's a there's a couple of engineers here,  one by the name of Jeff Dean and another Rajat, who really, really wanted the world of machine  learning and convolutional neural networks to develop the way we've been doing. Right. And so  there was sort of a danger, but there was a likelihood where they wouldn't  develop neural networks the way that we are doing it here at Google. And so we're like,  those other methods are OK, but we think this is a better way. And so Jeff very wisely said,  we should open source this technology, we should get people developing the way that we're developing  so that we can all move forward in this technical direction. Set a standard. Well, the set of  standard and also to have like a nice, frictionless place where we can all work together  on this technology. Right. Because, I mean, TensorFlow has been incredibly popular. We've  taken probably thousands. Will can confirm how many patches we've taken from outside Google into  TensorFlow, at least hundreds. I think thousands, though. And and it's it's become a really great  way to move the technology forward. And remember, you know, it's under an Apache license,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  correct? Why don't you double check that? Yeah. So you know, that's interesting. So you'll use GPL,  you use MIT, you use different licenses, depending on. Yeah. So for instance, when we release a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  JavaScript tool, you know, we'll use BSD or MIT, because that's what JavaScript people like,  you know. And if releasing something for, you know, Linux, it's going to be, you know,  GPL for the kernel. If it's going to be, you know, so we try to help the software find its  developer community. And so we're not too dogmatic about licenses. Right. But yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what's nice is now you've taken TensorFlow, which is an open source project. And now you're giving  people the hardware, some very sophisticated hardware, these new TPUs to work with. And I  presume works in conjunction with their TensorFlow projects. Yeah. So if you're using TensorFlow and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you push that load to a cloud TPU like that, you know, you're getting an incredible efficient,  incredibly efficient way of doing your inference and training. You know, so this is the same chip  that we use for the AlphaGo win with least so Dell and, you know, a rack of those TPUs replaced,  I'm not kidding. A hundred thousand machines. So it was an incredible savings of power. It was an  incredible increase in efficiency and speed of the inference and training models. And it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, can I, can I just ask you, so when you're talking about the way people are wanting,  you wanted people to do machine learning, are you talking about like, as opposed to using something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like CNTK or cafe or is it partially? Yes. And also, if you look at cafe and torch and Tiano's  licensing, you know, we're using the Apache license, which provides, you know, so any patents that we  have that reads on TensorFlow that we've released, you know, we're basically giving you a license to  that. We're saying we're not going to rent seek. We're not going to go math for you. And the other  machine learning tools do not have that assurance. So, so that was another thing that we were really  sort of worried about that machine learning would end up getting locked up in sort of this world of,  you know, pay, pay me it's open source, but you still have to pay me. And we didn't want that to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, so are we going to see a vertical integration from the processor to your framework language  and then onto like cloud? Like what is it? What is the optimal way you think this should

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  could or would develop? So I think the way it's going to happen is that, so right now you can  download TensorFlow and pointed at a zillion GPUs or, or whatever you might have at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you do pay for the cloud, Google compute cloud. I mean, it's not free. Yeah. I think we

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have like a free tier, you know, that we do so that you can try things out for students.  Well, yeah. Get your feet wet. Kind of. Yeah. I think it's limited to your workload type of,  like, but yeah, once you get serious about machine learning, though, the thing that happens is you  end up using a ton of compute resources. Right. And so we're saying, listen, you can go out and  go buy a zillion GPUs and, and go to town. But the power costs, the actual cost of the GPU  and the rest are actually, you know, they're, they're really considerable. So instead you can  just literally, the ideas that eventually you'll be able to just point your, your, your model  and your training set at a cloud TPU. And it'll just get done cheaper and more efficient and faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The rest. So Shazam says they're doing this in using Google compute cloud to do their  recognition. That's pretty impressive. So is this a business for Google? What's in it for Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously, there's a business there. So I look at it on two axes. Right. So Jeff and Rajat's goal  with open sourcing, TensorFlow is to keep people developing neural networks the way that we've  been doing it. Right. And also the way we justify all of this, and it's, it's not cheap to develop  a team that size and deploy these kinds of chips and, and all the rest is that, you know, people  will pay to use the TPUs when they're doing inference and training. So yeah, so I mean,  there's a very clear business case inside our cloud business for this. So, and I think the,  the pricing is actually very aggressive and good. Yeah. So yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chris, can I thank you once again for bringing us here? You're a great guy. I'm glad to have you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  here. So thank you. We miss you right here. And I want to tell your, your, your listeners,  your viewers, what do you call them? Oh, people watching and listening. Okay. The people on the  chat line. It's such a treat for us to have Leo and Jeff and Jason here. So, you know, and like,  you know, Googlers, can I come? Can I go? Like we had a couple of people hanging out. It's really,  it's really great for us. So, so thanks for coming. You know, we're really glad to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll come anytime. This is a great studio. This is actually, you must do other things in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is, oh yeah, this is where they film all the developer videos, like a ton of things that were  shown on the screens. Yeah. This is, well, I don't know if Matt did his here. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I get a Johnny Ive, white room look. Can that be done? Can you do that here?  I'd love green screen right behind me. All right. I actually, I'm kind of partial to Charlie Rose.  Look, I'm getting right now. He's really liked that. Leo's really liking that.  We're going to take a little break. We'll come back with more, uh, uh, smoke them if you got them  or whatever it is people do these days, vape it if you got it. Uh, but we'll be back with more.  And I really want to thank, uh, as I said, uh, the folks at Google for making this possible.  Of course, Jason Howell who came all the way down and you're going to spend the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  three days, uh, here at Google. I'm here till the end. I'm here till Friday

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and watch all about Andrew on a Tuesday because on Friday you are doing a very special series  of interviews and we'll be airing that on all about Android and I don't want to give away anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. We'll, we'll, we'll go ahead and keep that, uh, a little bit of a secret, but, uh, absolutely.  I'm really looking forward to Friday. That's all I'm going to say. Oh, my goodness. That's going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  be great. Uh, so watch all about Android on Tuesday about 5 p.m. But you and flow will be down  Florence Island. It's also be here for that. Jeff Jarvis. It's nice to be in the same room with you.  It is. I love it when that happens. Yeah. Uh, I appreciate that you came out for, uh,  this conference, but you're going back home. We will have you on Twitter on Sunday. Yes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but back from the usual, my usual den where I will be all pink as opposed to anywhere. I look

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like human and Stacy, thank you for doing double duty today. You did that keynote, that long two  hour keynote and you're back here for more, but I'm glad you're getting a massage afterwards.  Indeed.  Our show today brought you by upside the smart new way to save money on business travel. You,  of course, have heard of Priceline, right? The guy who founded Priceline, Jay Walker, is a legend  in the travel industry after he sold Priceline and got out of the travel business for a while.  He decided he wanted to get back in, but he wanted to do something kind of different.  He wanted to address business travel. See, there's a real gap in business travel. If you ever worked  for a big company, I did for as if Davis for years, you know that there was a travel department,  you'd call the travel department and they would arrange your travel. And that's that you don't  book your own travel and you don't get to choose. You just, they just do it for you. But if you're a  small business or a medium business, I know when we started Twitter, it was like, well, I guess  I'm doing that, that you don't get the deals because they don't have, you know,  you don't have any negotiating power. You're really, it's a lot of work and it's not much  fun. Well, this is upside is the way to do business travel from now on. It just takes a  couple of minutes. You can do it right now at upside.com. It actually used the promo code twig  and I'll tell you why in a second. The way it works is upside has already negotiated great deals  with not just flights, not just airlines, but also with hotels. Now this isn't Priceline. You're  going to know the name of the hotel. You're going to know the name of the airline. You're going to  know the time you're traveling. There's no mystery here at all. They will simplify the choices.  They'll give you the top six flights and hotels. You choose what you want. You get all your frequent  flyer miles just as always, but they will give you a may at your business anyway, amazing savings.  And then there's a little reward for you because every time you book a trip at upside,  you're going to get a gift card that's worth one to even $300. And these aren't, you know,  this isn't some junkie gift card. These are Amazon target 50 top brands Nordstrom. You get to choose.  They even have a page dedicated to your current status with gift cards. So you can keep track of  it. After you book your travel, your gift card arrives via email. Just 72 hours later, you'll  get even more on the overseas trips and there's no limit on trips or gift cards. Lisa and I are  booking our own travel for our own business. We just, and I, this was cool. We were at least  the right, I'm not making this up. We were able to apply the gift card immediately. Instead of  getting an Amazon deal, we just applied and saved $300 on our flight and our hotels. $1,300. Wow.  Where are we going? It was our trip to New York. Wow. That is fantastic. So I want you to try  it upside.com. If you're booking for your business, you get to save the money right up front.  Just apply the gift card to the travel. And if you're booking for the company you work for,  they get a great discount and you get some nice gift cards. And I think that's a great win win  for everybody all around. Jay's really figured out a sweet spot for upside.com. The best way  to save big money on business travel. And don't forget to use the offer code twig. Now here's why  you're guaranteed at least a hundred dollar gift card. When you book your first trip,  you might even get more. You got to use the offer code twig though, to guarantee at least a hundred  dollars minimum purchase required. You got to see the site for complete details upside upside upside.com  and use the offer code twig that does two things, guarantees you a hundred dollar minimum gift card  and lets them know that you heard it right here. And that helps us a little bit with the show on  with the show we go. And I want to thank also John Slanina, who is our studio manager, Colin  Goldstein, who was our offsite production booker and one of the best producers I've ever worked  with. One of the best studio engineers I've ever worked with who worked very hard to set this all  up. And of course, Karsten Pondy and Burke McQuinn back at the studio. It's a hard thing to do.  Yeah, because we didn't bring, you know, studio cameras and big elaborate satellite trucks and  all of that stuff. We don't have that stuff. We brought Skype. Next time satellite trucks come  with us. You know, I've gone that route and it is no, it is no, is a no better and B a lot more  expensive. Yeah. You know, the tech TV spent a million dollars every time they hit the road to  do one of those CESs or COMDEXs. A million dollars. You witnessed there was amazing.  Well, it was seen there basically. Yeah. The guy who had the money could afford it. Yeah. But we  really probably should have paid more attention to it was Paul Allen, of course, because eventually  he got tired of losing money and said, yeah, I'm done. See you guys. Bye bye. Let's see. We are  going to continue on. We stopped. We got very excited because Stacey got so excited like that  about the Google cloud TPUs. Have you, have you now learned everything you wanted to know, Stacey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about those? I will continue learning. But for me, the big question when we think about  AI being the future, right? Everything's going to be built on some form of machine learning.  Do you have to own the hardware all the way through? And are people going to move to a cloud  to get this service? Probably. And then how are you guys, how are the big companies going  to differentiate themselves? So Google has their TPU based stuff for the clouds that also works with  like GPUs from Nvidia. But Amazon also has like a machine learning platform as part of  Amazon Web Services. So I'm just kind of thinking about how that's going to evolve, I guess. My

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  brain's always looking ahead for. Clearly for Google, this is a way to assert themselves in  this very competitive cloud computing field. I mean, Amazon's the king. Microsoft would love  to be huge here. Google, I think has some great offerings and this is a unique offering as far as  I can tell. Didn't Amazon announce some stuff fairly recently, Stacey, as well? It feels like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they're doing some machine learning stuff. They don't have their own framework. They don't have  the equivalent of a TensorFlow or a TPU. They are reselling, let's see, machine learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they're reselling Nvidia based GPUs. This is where Google is like the king. They're  well ahead of everybody else, in my opinion, in machine learning. If the war is over machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  learning, Google is ahead not only in that, but also he or she who has the most data sets  has the advantage when it comes to machine learning, right? The more data you have to  train the systems and who has more data about the world's knowledge than Google.  Facebook has some that Google doesn't have about our behavior. Amazon has strictly our commerce.  Apple doesn't have much of any of that. So even though Google, on some matters,  we've seen kind of catches up on the front end hardware, on the back end, they're way ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, sorry. No, well, there's a question here.  And this is really subtle and kind of geeky. So we may not want to get too much into it.  But when you train, you can train generically for images, for example, like here, do you recognize  this? But when you start using machine learning to do things like predict, if I show you these,  if you've bought this, are you going to buy that? Then you actually need to optimize your  machine learning right now very specifically. So it's not as general as language processing  or computer vision, which are kind of the two big leaps. So we're going to have these massive,  and we are experiencing these massive leaps ahead in computers that can see and computers  that can understand us. But when we start trying to make that a little more granular for circumstances,  which inevitably we will want to do, there's a real open question if we can do kind of general  machine learning, right? Does that make sense? Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go ahead. A lot of what we saw on stage today, and of course, this is very, this is not deep  learning for us. This is shallow learning. What we saw on stage today was in very specific domains,  things like reading a biopsy slide and not improving necessarily on a pathologist, but being  a backstop and additional point of information for pathologists. They showed this 17 year old,  this high school student who developed a better tests, better ways to read mammograms, which I  thought was for a high school kid. He taught himself how to write machine, how to learn,  how to do this stuff by watching YouTube videos. I mean, it's kind of a side testament to YouTube.  So I love the idea of making this available. You can find out more. Google has set up an  informational website at google.ai. They also have announced that they're going to make 1,000 of these  TPUs, these 180 teraflop TPUs available in the cloud at no cost to machine language researchers  via something they call the tensor flow research cloud. You can find out more tensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of cool. There's the philanthropy of processing power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think Google has to do that because there is also the optics of building Skynet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. They have to balance the idea of all of this AI slurp. You know, there are AI computers  in the background, slurping up all of your personal data and using it. Yes, for things that are  convenient for you, but for, you know, in ways that allow them more access to you. On the other  hand, it can be applied to real world, real problems that need solving, that need, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  need smart brains to tackle it. And that will contribute to the issues. There were three  cases. We'll get to a couple of them later. Three cases where I saw Google using corporate  responsibility as part of the announcements. Right. One was this. One was what you mentioned  earlier, Leo, in terms of the inexpensive phones to make the phones to get more connectivity  worldwide. And the third we'll talk about later, I assume, is facial recognition and how they,  how they pitched that. So there's a way to try to think about these things responsibly as they go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Facial recognition, as we know, is very high at the creepy scale. And potentially,  I think it's great. In fact, I wish Google had released it for, but I understand why they didn't  allow me to just arbitrarily put it in front of anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They wanted to not be the first ones to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All these companies have a big PR issue. I think, I think they're genuine in their desire to push  the world forward. Yes. And, and better than anyone, they understand the potential of the  technologies that they are offering and that they are improving on and that they are helping  others work on. But they realize that the general public is becoming increasingly  antsy about privacy and security. And, and in order to get people to use things like the Google Home  and the Google Assistant, which we're about to talk about in just a second, they've, they've  really got to do, I think, some work to make sure people are comfortable with this, are comfortable  with the rules. And I don't, I don't know. Do you feel they're doing a good job of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're trying what they're trying. Oh, sorry. Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just going to say, I think about this a lot. And I think this is where actually,  don't hate me y'all, but we actually need a, we need a civil debate over this. We need government  to actually, we need an agency or lawmakers to actually start this conversation. And I,  I mean a real deep conversation, not regulate the internet type of conversation, but  really understanding what's at stake in talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are our present lawmakers capable of doing that, Stacey?  I think so.  No. And that's what's frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just one of many fields, bioethics. We're about ready to introduce the CRISPR gene to the  world and, and, and real true genomic splicing. And that has a, that's a huge conversation we  need to have about what it's okay. What's not okay. What we want to allow, what we want to happen.  Do we want people to be able to select the sex of their children? They're going to be able to  do that easily and simply. Do we want, I would just forgive me, just finished Daniel Suarez's  book about CRISPR, about genetic modification. It's called fate. What is it called fate? Say again,  change agent. And, and you know, it starts off, you can go to the store and buy a stamina for  your kid, buy 30 extra IQ points for your kid, whatever you can afford. What are the, these are,  there's so many things coming down the pike, autonomous vehicles. Do we, who's responsible  when a car's driving? Do we want to let cars drive that we are just ill-equipped? And I have,  I have to say, let's be practical. I agree with you, Stacey, the same sensible thing to do would  be have a Chautauqua and let's all talk about it. That's never going to happen. Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Brad Smith just released a statement saying that we need a Geneva conference.  From Microsoft. Yeah. From Microsoft on, on, on these issues. And it was partly, it was also about,  it was after Microsoft. It's about cybersecurity because the NSA. The NSA's stuffed. Yeah. Cracked

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  windows and then it leaked out because they didn't, they weren't good stewards of the cracks.  And then everybody got, want to cry over the weekend. Not everybody, but 200,000 people did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Stacey, so what you're saying Stacey is that we, we, you want this conversation.  We should have this conversation, but we're probably not equipped to have the conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right now. Well, we, you know what? We're going to have it. And I think that one of the things,  and you should tell your students too, that journalists are going to have to do is we're  going to have to bring these issues to the forefront in a way that people can understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other place that does this, and you can make fun of me for this, but, but the,  the Royal Economic Forum Davos. Fine. Right. It does indeed convene these people around these issues  and they've opened up a Silicon Valley outpost in the Presidio where they're trying to bring these  folks together. And I think there's an opportunity to convene, as you say Stacey, it's a, it's a  civil conversation as in all of society and the various constituents. You need business there,  you need technology there, you need academics there, you do need government there,  find the good people. And you need educators there. And, and, and this is our rulemaking  for society. Yeah. Little less, we shouldn't stop the progress. Stacey, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I am agreeing with you. I was thinking about the future future tense, which is a  New America Foundation, Arizona State and Slate do a good job from a journalistic  perspective, talking about these conversations and, and this is, this is far beyond Google IO,  but these are things that if we don't talk about them now, if we don't find a way to develop  a moral and a cultural consensus, which is admittedly going to be hard,  we're just going to basically what we're doing now is shrugging our shoulders and saying,  ah, capitalism will take care of it, which just means that people who are have money will be  further and further advanced beyond in the divide just continues to grow. That is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Meanwhile, let's talk about some other great things you can buy. Google home, octopus  dumplings. Let's talk. And I got, I really got a yen for octopus dumplings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does look really good. I was like, yeah, you don't want to just go up and eat Japanese

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  street food without having an idea of what it is. Scott Huffman came up on stage. He's a lot of fun  and really great presenter and, and demonstrated some of the new features of the Google lens in  assistant, including taking a picture of Japanese, a menu board on the street and finding out what it  is. And not to not only did it define what it was, but it showed him, you know, information about it,  like what, you know, pictures, he said, can I see some pictures of those and, and where you can buy  him and fascinating things. He then showed, uh, using a Google assistant, apparently with,  you could turn on word lens in Google assistant or will soon be able to at some point in the next  few weeks. And he showed a theater marquee that had a stone Fox's concert coming up May 17th,  9pm. It not only interpreted that it said, do you want to hear some stone Fox's? Do you want to know  more about the stone Fox's? Do you want to buy tickets to this show? Would you like to add this  to your calendar? It added it to his calendar perfectly. Although it did say it was only going  to be a one hour concert. And I thought that was a little, a little short, I'm noticing the mistakes,  right? Uh, anyway, I can't wait. I think that'll be great. These features are really cool. Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sometimes you run the risk in, in Google events of seeing these features and going, wow, that's  really amazing. That's going to change how I use my device. And then flash forward six months later,  you've lived with the device, you've used it a handful of times and nothing. However, the same  time, really cool technology. And you know, it's important to Google because it kept coming up.  They mentioned it at the beginning. It found its way into all of these other topics. This is a  really good representation of kind of their ability of leveraging, you know, their theme of AI and  turning it into something that consumers might, that might pull consumers in and allow them to  kind of warm up to the idea of letting Google in more and more and getting more access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's really true, Jason. And if you compare it to Facebook's presentation, where  they're going after the same tools of AI and AR, but Google has so many more practical ways for  you to use it. Hey, we can have sharks swimming around your cereal bowl. Oh, I can't wait.  Versus here, I can make a, I can, I can, I can make a concert, uh, buy tickets to a concert that I  happen to walk by and I can converse with the machine with my images of what I see. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really powerful. Lots of new, lots of new languages, like a lot of new languages.  Everybody will be pleased to see that that you'll be able then, uh, Valerie demonstrated buying  something from Panera, which was kind of amazing because essentially she said to Google assistant,  I want delivery from Panera. And then a male voice took over, uh, saying this is Panera, although it  was clearly a machine voice, right? It wasn't an actual clerk. They had a conversation. She ordered  and paid there's voice pay. Now she was able to pay entirely without leaving a Google assistant.  Um, or, and I presume you could do that on Google home as well. So assistant has a lot of nice, uh,  new features. I thought one of the most interesting features, we're going to have to move it along a  little bit. So I'm going to kind of skip through some of the, uh, little details, but I think one  of the nice new features in the, uh, in the Google home and it's not here yet. Cause I kept trying to  call my mom is hands-free calling. And I just, I looked back at Jeff and I said, we've come a long  way. They announced, they announced, you could say call mom. They said hands-free calling for free to  any phone. We're not talking to another Google home. We're not talking to a computer to any phone  in the U S for free. Remember when we used to have to, uh, are you on the phone still at long

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  distances cost us a fortune. Can you get off the phone? Exactly. Or my mom was saying, get off the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  line. I want to talk or me being on a modem and my kid picking up the phone and disconnecting me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in the middle of my Dungeons and Dragons game. And you can sync it to your own number too. So,  so technically I could take my number and make it so that if I make a call through my Google home,  the number that they see on the other end is my actual number and not some random number sync  through the home. I wonder, I wonder at what point you're able to receive calls through your  Google home as well. At some point have your phone connected so that someone calls your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It turns out these had Bluetooth all along. We didn't know it. They said that'll be turned on.  So you could pair it to your phone. So I guess you could. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacy, did you get excited about that? I did. I got excited about two things related to that.  Well, one was this, this is just thinking ahead because if you can have people call your Google  home one day, then that becomes, and the echo suddenly becomes your home phone again, which  means you need a number for it. That's not your mobile phone. So I started thinking about that  just because I've already had to get my Google home, its own email address. So now it might need

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  its own phone number. Can you pretty soon it'll need its own room in the house. Can you call from  the Amazon echo? Can you call a phone or I think you can only call another people who have the  Amazon echo. So this is really, it's kind of fun because Google just stepped up quite a bit. We  call it the echo app here because we don't want anybody to get upset. Yes. Sorry. Incidentally,  the phones in the audience were going off right and left because they said, okay,  all the time. And my everything was waking up in my pocket. They, I think this was like  their way of thumbing their nose at Amazon. Oh, echo can make phone calls to other echoes.  You can call any phone in the U S or Canada for free. They also came. They also made good on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  video that they launched six months ago with this, which had notifications by saying, Hey,  here's some more stuff about the notifications we're going to have. I don't remember. Is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what they call it? Yeah, I thought about that. And I think that they really couldn't do it until you  could have separate accounts. So they, they recently added the ability to have more than one  account up to six accounts on any given home Google home device. So I think that that was,  if you think about it, if only one person's getting notifications, that's ridiculous. So  that was a differentiating voices too was critical. Yes. It could tell who was talking to it. It could  see who I wonder if it could tell who's in the room. Well, it was also, they said that through AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  when they originally designed Google home, it had eight, sorry, it had eight microphones, but they  only needed three because of the AI processing that was the learning system processing was  allowed them to see where the voices were. It seemed right. That wasn't the only shot across

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon's bow though. Remember Amazon released and I immediately ordered the, uh, uh, the,  what do they call it? The echo show. Is that show home? Which one? The one with the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  show is the one with the screen. Look at the camera. What's the one you want your closet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the look. You got the look. You got the look. I like to know better. Um,  I'm sorry. I don't know what happened there. I just channeled 1974 blacked out. I blacked out.  No, the Google, so the Google home has a screen on it. So, I mean the Amazon home has a screen on  it. So Google says, well, we could do that or don't you have screens all over the house? So what we're  going to do instead, and I thought this was wild. You can send your calendar to your TV.  If it's chrome, if it's chrome cast enabled and now, and now the other key is the installed base

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of chrome cast has to be much, much larger than Amazon fire. Well, almost all the, we just bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a new Vizio TV cast enabled. You seem to have a built in it's built in. It doesn't have to have  a built in. If you have a chrome cast plugged in, I'm sure that works as well. Uh, but you could  send photos. You can send YouTube videos. That's not new. Uh, what was there was something else I  thought was really cool. Well, so I would, well, are we talking about telling the home to send

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  something to your screen? Yes. If you're watching a show across devices, it would know where you left  off because it knows it's you. So when you say show me whatever, as I remember, they said it would  pick up where you last left off. HBO does show you any YouTube stuff and they added partners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HBO, Hulu, YouTube TV, Google play, CBS, food network, the CW, HGTV, Red Bull, travel, crackle, DIY,  Vicky. So glad they finally have the Vicky channel and the cooking channel. So that's,  I mean, look at it. It's not my, well, if you subscribe to YouTube TV,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what's the recipe on the food network right now? That's what he asked. That was, I don't know if  that's what got you excited, but I was like, who, I'll tell you what got me excited. If you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you have YouTube TV and your DVR, you could watch anything that you've DVR'd. You could just  say, Hey, show me last night's, uh, late show. And it would just pop up on your TV. I just,  I think these are all in the videos that we saw last time, but I think they've really,  they're starting to really, it shows the weather. Um, I guess what Stacey said before too, it's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  context and intent that comes from understanding the antecedent. Right. You say, buy me tickets  for that. It knows what the context of the conversation is. And that's, that is, that is  they showed that leap a year ago. Now they're showing the application of it a dozen ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you what, I ordered another Google home actually, or two, uh, at the keynote. Cause I  thought I'm going to, I'm going to use this more. And I, and I have a lot of Chromecast enabled TVs.  And I think this is just really going to be a very useful, um, I also, uh, I'm excited about the new  photos features. They added two interesting features that I think people will like. I think  this is, this is the kind of thing Google does that people, normal people will go, Oh, I can use  that. And I think they've surfaced it in a good way. They're suggested sharing and shared libraries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was a little worried about sharing at first because it reminded me of when we first heard  about, uh, the photo, the shared events that you could go to an event, open up a shared event,  and everybody would share their photos from like at a wedding or whatever. I was like, okay,  if you're doing this sort of sharing, which essentially with suggested sharing allows you  to kind of share photos from your, from your camera roll, uh, that's stored in the cloud or  a full album or whatever with somebody else, the receive on the receiving end, they have to be  using something that they already have, hopefully. And thankfully they've tied it into the Google  photos app. So as long as you, the person you're sharing with it with have the photos app installed  on the device and you pretty much just pick the people or, and I thought this was really cool  matching because there's already the face matching aspect of Google photos. You can,  you can do that. You've been able to do that for a couple of years. Now it will detect who's in  your photos from that event and offer those up as options to share to direct. This is what I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is so critical. We mentioned this earlier in the show, but I think this is so critical that  Google's been talking about facial recognition for years and, and, and it's near the creepy line.  So they stayed back from it. Facebook announced it. They were going to do it and didn't kind of  acknowledge this creepy line. But what happened today was they said, well, you're going to love  facial recognition because these are people you already know who are already in your photos,  who you want to share with. And it's with your permission and it, it makes facial recognition  cuddly and okay. Exactly. Exactly. It's around people you do know around your family and friends.  It's for utility. It's the other story that I, that I always tell the Germans. Oh, and it's easy to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  use. And it just kind of shows up if you're using Google photos is right there. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At least to a function. So the story I've told many times is that is the journey went nuts over  everything about privacy and Google except for priority inbox. Google's reading my email. Yes,  thank you very much. And it helps me great appeal. So as long as the utilities are orderly people,  the Germans, they are, they are, they're also grateful for good features and good services.  There are a lot of German reporters here, man. They love covering Google. But, but, but, so,  facial recognition now becomes okay. Right. The creepy line has been fudged. I think it was very

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  important to them. I think we're going to use it. I wonder, Stacey, did you run to Andrew and say,  Hey, honey, look at this automatic sharing of my photos of the kids with you and you share your  photos of the kids with me suddenly we'll have like an out a joint album automatically. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no, I didn't because I still, I'm a little creeped out by Google photos. I'll just be honest. I'm  sorry. And I actually share, I have an automatic upload folder and Dropbox set up on my phone and  I shared that with my friends who love seeing. It requires effort. It required one time effort  for me. But here's, here's what I was looking for. And I want to know the answer to. So ask around,  how do you turn it off in the case of divorce or a breakup or something? And then what happens to  the photos that you shared? Do they pull them off the device? Do they keep them? Oh, I think we've

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  talked about that before. The precedent is there, Stacey, when they talked about photos originally,  if you shared a photo with someone and they already have it, it's, it's, it's like sharing  anything. They have it, right? And pull it back. And the precedent there is if you gave a print of  a photo to somebody else, where are you going to go? You know, unless you're OJ Simpson, are you  going to break into their house and steal it back? Right. And that's my assumption. But then there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  are also, it also needs to be easy to unshare with people. Well, yes, it does. And also when you start,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he didn't, there was the unintended joke on stage when he said, um, I'm sure here was the issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because he started sharing with his wife, but you also, and this, there was no accident here,  can set the date. The sharing starts and he says, I'm going to start sharing with her from the time I  met her because obviously it's not going to share earlier photos or, you know, who knows who's in  those photos, right? Someone else in your life, honey, who's that strange woman in your picture?  But I don't think it's for that purpose. I think it's really going to be mostly used by  couples with children who will, and, and, you know, he made an excellent point. I, I have not in any  of my kids' pictures ever, any of them, because I took them. And so now, you know, your, your spouse  can share the pictures that she took of you and the kids. You can share your pictures that you took  of her and the kids and you'll get a unified album that'll have every, that's just one application.  Tammy, hand me the book too though, cause I want to, they also say who's, you only share pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of your husband. That's it. That's really cool. Especially pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My husband's going to hate my gadget picture. Actually, my daughter, she'll goes through and  she's like, who's that man in the photo? I'm like, Oh, that's the FCC commissioner. Just ignore that.  Why is there a picture of Agit Pai in your photo stream? Former, former FCC commissioner. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know we all loved him. I did, I was a little gratified when the Google photos guy showed his  photo stream because he, his stream looked much like mine, full of kind of some nice pictures and  then pictures of receipts and then pictures of whiteboards and menus. And, you know, just kind  of the cruft, the random cruft we use our camera phones for. And I thought, well, at least they're  acknowledging that that's what's in there. And they're giving you ways to not share, obviously  your receipts and things like this. They look, they're the last to the party with photo books.  Apple's done it. Adobe does it. But I have to say, we, we actually have some physical examples of  these photo books and they're well printed. They're well, high quality. This is the paperback  version. It's perfect bound. They have some in the paperback version, some full bleed. And then  they did one thing, which I really liked. It must've been, yeah, it must've been with a pano.  It went across two pages and I'm going to try to find it here. Can you find it while I show the  other one? This is the hardcover. This is $20 or starts at $20, which is very good price,  something like this, but more importantly, because photo books, everybody's got photo books.  More importantly, the, the automation involved in making these photo books is really neat.  You know, it basically may, the idea is anyway that, that Google photos chooses the best photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just deselect the ones you don't want. You can put text on the cover. It doesn't seem to be text  on, on the pages on captions. So it's a pure photo book. Well, and that's cause I think that's an

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  acknowledgement that it's a pain in the butt to caption every page. It takes a lot of time. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  work. It's all post work and especially around photo, especially our, our huge photo libraries.  That's why that's one reason why Google photos as a product, it has consistently been one of my  favorite Google products that maps because they're, they're constantly rolling out new features that  actually make it enjoyable to do something that was so painful before managing those large libraries,  building a photo book. Like what I really like about that is they showed the idea like you're  talking about in your photo roll, you have receipts and all this other kind of cruft,  you know, litter scattered throughout. They kind of showed the example of just highlight a bunch  of the photos. Doesn't matter if that other stuff gets in there. Our AI, you know, our machines on  the backend are going to analyze those pictures and we're going to realize, we're going to understand  that you don't actually want to print that receipt on page 22. You know, we're going to pick the very  best things, put it up there. And it just lowers that bar so people can act on impulse because  how many times have I looked at the thousands upon thousands of photos in my photo roll  and thought to myself, wow, I've done absolutely nothing with any of these moving on with my life.  You know, it's just too difficult for me to like think about jumping through those hoops to do  something like that. Now that the bar is much lower, I might actually consider that.  I'm sure that would be the same for a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My wife did the yeoman's work for years putting photos into an hour.  And now I could imagine saying that you'd order a whole series of these with it. If you had a young  kid for six months, for six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Do your yearly thing. Yeah.  And put them on the shelf and they're keepsakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I always used Apple's because Apple's is a photo books. They use a very high quality  service to do it. And I think Apple and Adobe, of course, are probably the best to breed. There's  blurb, which does a very good job. I don't know who's sourcing these. I think they're very high  quality. The page stock is good. It's coded. It's thick. They're screened. Any printed photo  is going to be screened so you can see dots if you look up close. But I think the quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in the sample they provide to improve the quality of the photo before this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting. I wouldn't be surprised. Would you use these, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sentimental. I don't keep anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, there's nothing in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how you do that. Now I get it.  Let's see. Can you see my photo board? That's my photo board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Wow. You'll be sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the extent of photos that I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're old like me and you want to look back and those golden years you had with your beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  daughter, you'll be sorry. I don't even have a baby book for again. I'm not the right person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a woman who had I've been working on the railroad plate at her wedding.  I'm just saying.  So there was a little bit of stagecraft in this particular. There wasn't much stagecraft in this.  I have to say it was just it was very, which is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It disappointed Jason terribly. What did Jason want to walk across the stage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm always holding out hope for Boston Dynamics Robot, but that never happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was hoping Sergey Brin would break out the blimp and floated over  shoreline amphitheater. Wouldn't that have been awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With the longest pass ever made to Sundar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really could have been good opportunity miss Sergey. I'm just saying.  But there was a little stagecraft because the photos guy brought out his.  Can you what is his name? Because I want to give him credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, Anil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anil, that's it. You're right. Boy, you're good.  So Anil brought said my kids are in school, but he brought out a cardboard cutout of his kids  to do the selfie and demonstrate how that picture in real time would be shared to his wife's album,  which it did. It was really cool. And so that she would see that picture of him with  cardboard cut set cutouts of his children. There was a second attempted stagecraft that I  personally don't think went quite as well.  Susan Wojcicki was on stage. She's the in charge of YouTube and then.  Introduced a YouTuber.  I don't know what her name was. She sure was Peppy McDonald.  Last time chat super chat bar chat Barbara super chat McDonald's super chat and two guys,  the slow mo guys, apparently YouTube stars who were out on the, you know,  we are sure line amphitheater, which is an open air concert venue that has a lawn, you know,  and they were out on the lawn surrounded by a bunch of people in blue jumpsuits who had a  role we would find out later to demonstrate a feature that isn't that new actually has been  around for a few months. It's a little creepy chat. It's actually a follow on on what twitch.tv does.  Twitch has really done well by letting its presenters make money on their channel through  donations from the chatters. And so super chat was added to YouTube as a way for chatters to gift  $5 $10 $1 $500 to the presenter in during live streams. So they use super chat to raise money  for I think a very good cause a group that's printing with 3D printing prosthetic fingers,  which is OK. That's great. So so Barbara asked everybody to participate. They turned off the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  chat about halfway through it. At some point, the chat stopped moving. Yeah. But they had to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  turn it back on because she was going to give them a super chat of $500. And that meant that  500 water balloons would be thrown at the guy. I just this was they cut the whole segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, I wasn't thrilled about the segment. But here's the one thing I thought was cute  slash cool, not OK, cool, interesting. Let's go with interesting. It's this idea that through  super chat, they were tying it. Did you notice how they said they can tie it to things like  light bulbs and other stuff in the real world? And that that's like a little glimpse of it.  I've got to organize my thing here. It's a little glimpse of where Google can take us  once we have all of this stuff connected on the back end. And that is really compelling.  In the same way like last year, I was super excited about instant articles. And then we  saw nothing from it ever. Not instant articles. I'm sorry. No, not. No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was it? What Google product were you excited about that didn't emerge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Instant app, I think was what it was called. Oh, and Android, Android, Android,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  instant apps. Yes. There were a lot of hits from last year that never emerged. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, no, but you saw it this year. You saw Android instant apps, which was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know, this promise that you could not have to download a full app. You could just go some  place and grab something. You saw it in that Panera demo. That was. Oh, was that was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if it was the same back end architecture, but that that was the promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The promise is you could do things without going to other places. And what we're seeing is they're  building this infrastructure thanks to AI, thanks to the contextual awareness they're showing off  that you're going to be able to tie now. And Super Chat was cool because you tied the real world  to what was happening online in the virtual world. That's awesome. Yeah, actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry Ellsworth, who created Cast AR and is a good friend of the network. I love Jerry. She's a pinball  wizard. She would do live streaming from her laboratory while she was soldering and doing  stuff. And she'd set it up so that people in the chat room could make things happen  in her physical space. Like, you know, the thing you want, Stacey, the punching bag that comes out  and hits for the boxing glove that comes out. So that is something they said they weren't. They  didn't give any details about how that works, what kind of programming we need or anything. So,  but yeah, that's what you're talking about though, right? Yeah. Yeah. And imagine I bet I've got at

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  least three people in the chat right now would pay like a dollar to punch you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we found a new revenue model, Lisa. Maybe we could just, you know, raise money that way.  I know, I know at least two people who want,  they're doing it for you, Stacey. How much would you pay? Let me ask the chat room. How much would  you pay? I did order Toots the Unicorn. You're right. The geek's reminding me. I ordered a little  unicorn that when money was paid somewhere, somehow we hadn't figured it out or you tweeted  me or whatever, it would fart a rainbow. Is that close? I remember that. That was impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still hasn't arrived yet. All right. Super chat. By the way, this wasn't on the stage, but someone  in chat that just posted this in, who was it? ScooterX, Android Instant Apps now available to  all developers. They did a trial run in January and now they're rolling it out. So developers  have some work to do to make their apps more modular, but they can get in on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's wrap this up with Android because now we really have come to that portion of the show  where they talked about Android, 2 billion activations. They announced the preview is  finally available today and both these guys on my left and right immediately signed up to get Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  O on their pixels and you're using it now, right? Did you get it yet? I did. I finally got it. Yeah.  So this is, there was a developer. I don't know what to do with it. Yeah, exactly. I got it. It's  going to take me some time to run into the little pieces throughout. What were some of the things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's oh. What's that? What were some of the things? It's supposedly, and I'd like you to try

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this right now, boots twice as fast as Android N. In fact, they divided it into two different  particular areas, one of which is really more of a branding area where they're going to  kind of surface security. This is called vitals. They're going to surface security.  That's already there. Things like the fact that people don't know it, that the Play Store is  scanning your apps regularly to look for malware. So that, oh, so I long press on a, an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and so I long press. So if I have a notification from Twitter, I don't have to pull down the  notification and do all the McGill. I can long press on the Twitter icon and it will show me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all the notifications there. Right. Yeah. Notification dots was another part of that,  right? Like I can see on my Pinterest app, apparently I have an update on Pinterest.  I don't know if it comes through on the screen at all, but probably not. But there's a little  dot above Pinterest that tells me I have a notification there. There is tap and hold and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get the notification as a pop up window. Yeah. I'd also like you to try out a new feature. They're  using some of this AI in messages, uh, in text, whether it's email or whatever machine learning,  they say will pick out business names. So when you, normally when you tap on a word,  it will select just the word. Now it'll say, Oh, that's part of a business name. It'll select  the whole business name. Uh, and then you can use this tap feature. Look at my hotel last night.  It's curious. You could, for instance, say, I want to navigate there. It'll also recognize addresses  and phone numbers tapping on them will highlight them. And then if you long press it in the pop  up, for instance, because it says, Oh, that's a business or an address, it'll show you maps  is when instead of cop just, you know, cut and paste, he'll show you a maps is one of the options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So smart tech selection, smart tech select. No, the promise is already just trying to open. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on. They call it a neural network specifically for your phone because all of this is done

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  apparently on phone. This is an on server. Which was a part of their announcement also around  TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite for, um, on device kind of neural network processing. So we're going to  see more and more of that happening on the device instead of relying on the cloud. They even said

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that they expect machine learning specific processors in the phone, which I think is a  variant would be very important. My email for something that has a business name or has it,  maybe try it in text. There's something for you can you to play with. You just play with  you can shrink video. If you're watching, if you're in a video chat and, uh, and access, uh,  you know, other applications, you know, YouTube as well. Yeah. Picture in picture. Yeah. Uh,  anything else? What else? Uh, security, the whole thing. There's one other thing I think is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  important. Yeah. So at the end, uh, Sundar came back on. Oh, no, no, no. Let's finish. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I saw. I said the whole thing. Oh, not the whole thing. This is the whole Android,  as it were better. They say better battery life because they're finally doing something  Apple did from day one, which is they're going to limit how long you could sit in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's a really important component. I feel like I've been very actually envious of that  aspect of iOS and how iOS operates. Obviously they're, they're two completely different ethos  as far as how Android is very open and giving to developers access to the underlying architecture  versus iOS, which locks it down. But then you get, you know, kind of better background management  on iOS. As a result, the apps can't go rogue, let's say, and kind of terrorize, you know,  your device performance in the background. So apparently Android O is going to, going to  make some big steps to kind of rein in the stuff that's happening in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say that, remember Doze, they say that every, but it is the one thing you can want.  And incrementally it does get better and better. Yeah.  And it is better. I have to say Doze worked. If you want Android O, you can get it at  android.com slash beta, but you'll have to have a Pixel, I think, maybe a Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of the Nexus devices, the Pixel C you can, you can do it on. So the Nexus 5X, 6P, Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Basically Google device. Yeah. Right. At least for now. This is the,  this is the first time they've done a public, the, the public beta, I guess. Google is adding  Kotlin as a equal peer to Java as a programming language for Android. Must be a good thing.  The developers cheered Kotlin as a language, a fairly young language that was created by  JetBrains, the folks that do the IDE that Google bought and later made the very nice IDE, I think,  for Android development. They've been working on that for a while. It's a strongly typed,  statically typed language, kind of like Scala, they say. And I think developers were mostly  cheering because they just hate Java and are excited. Ooh, look, you got the mini, the mini  window on there. Show the, show the folks at home. So I got the picture. So that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, picture in picture. Yeah. Down there. And I can think I can move it around. Yeah. I can move  it around the screen. I can't tell my directions. Right. So, so picture in picture. So I can be  doing other things while the video is open and let it roll, which Facebook's talked about as  well, which is a problem. You want to, you want to, you don't want me to just, you don't want this  to turn into a TV. You want to be able to do multiple things and, and two big screens. I  don't think it's sufficient. So this way it's a, see it there, see what's going on. And this,  that's the first time that the notion of video on Twitter makes any sense to me.  Yeah. As if you can break it out. You don't want to turn it into a TV,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but you don't mind turning it into a PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next, next, next. They talked about VR, AR and Tango. Tango is getting smaller and smaller.  We already mentioned the dedicated VR headset. I think that's potentially very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll learn more about that. They also mentioned with Tango that I've been waiting for this is it.  I'm surprised we haven't seen more application of this. The godsend this could be  for this, the scene impaired to be able to navigate an environment and have you give audio  or other cues about how to go around. It would just be, would be key to me. And I think we

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  haven't seen enough of that yet. Yeah. So, and then Sundar came back and I, at that, I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we missed one. We missed a pretty big one actually was Android go. We talked about that earlier

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  briefly. Yeah. What is Android go inexpensive version. Yeah. We mentioned it briefly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but just to kind of dive into it a little bit more, it's not a separate version of Android.  It's basically a minimized, let's say version of Android that's tailored to let's, to devices that  have a gig of Ram or less. So when you're talking about, well, I guess we did kind of dive into this  somewhat earlier, didn't we? The kind of emerging markets, the emerging markets, but there's a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of things they're going to do. They're going to limit the apps that you can use. The apps will in  themselves, developers will be able to creating their own versions of the apps. Yeah. Yeah. YouTube  go a great thing. And as, and this is the thing we did mention it with 2 billion active users. Now  this is the next billion, the next billion active users. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. My apologies. I  forgot about that. Google C I should remind people, this is no longer a everything under the sun  keynote because Google is now just a part of alphabet. This isn't an alphabet  keynote. So for people who are interested in, you know, flying cars, blimps, contact lenses  that can read your future. That would be for a keynote that doesn't exist. Maybe it should.  I kind of miss the days of shooting in. I didn't write this. I was trying to write this tweet and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't remember how to say it, but, but, but back in the, in the wonderful days of bell labs,  when we were kids and we get the movie projector was wheeled into the classroom and you see this  guy with his tentorian voice telling you about the wonders of the universe, that, that, that bell  labs was the closest thing we had besides universities to a pure science operation. Now  Google is the closest thing we have to that, I think. And there's things that are happening  in this company that I think are important to get excitement about science, excitement about  technology, excitement about, about what can happen. Now, you know, then you get, yeah, Larry  building his own Island where I'll move to, which we have in Toronto very soon.  But I do wish there were this opportunity for Google to G-wiz this a little more. Maybe they  don't want you right now. Cause I think this goes to the very final point. Are we, are we there now  that, that Sundar came on about jobs? Sure. I think that was critically important moment because  basically it was, it was the other point we mentioned earlier about how Google was being  sensitive around these other issues of corporate responsibility. Well, the final one was jobs where  I think what's going to happen is that the unemployed in America are going to wake up one  day and realize that it's not strangers from across borders who are causing their change in  their job situation as technology. And as Eric Schmidt has always said, when it comes to wanting  to fight technology, who do people go after the largest guy in the field? And that's Google.  So I think what we saw was a preemptive strike by Google saying that we're going to, they're going  to come up with functionality to help you find the right jobs down to a far more granular level  so that you can, you can even check on jobs that are within and minutes of commuting time for you  and things like that. And that's Google trying to help people with jobs. Now, does it go far enough?  No, what we have to do is try is have more education as a society. We have to do a far,  a great deal more. But I think it is an acknowledgement that technology in general  and Google in particular will have an impact on jobs. It also struck me and people have already  yelled at me in my Twitter feed about this. That's what newspapers should have done years ago. And  people said, well, newspapers did, they had classifieds. Yeah. And they made a fortune out  of them. They charged for them. And they really didn't see that as a service. Google now sees this  idea of getting people jobs as a service that they need to help accomplish for people as part  of their corporate responsibility. So I think it was a big deal at the end. Good point. And the  fact that it came from Sundar said this is a corporate responsibility. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's wrap this up. Stacey, what was the high point? Was there anything we've left out,  something you thought was really cool? No, we talked about it all. Thank you very much for  joining us. We'll get to our picks in a second. How about you, Jeff? Anything?  No, I think we pretty much. I think we left out one thing, which was a big ah,  ooh ah moment. ScooterX pointed that out in our chat room. Unfortunately, I don't know if this  will, how this will work or how it'll work, but Google Photos is going to add automatic  obstruction removal to the pixel camera. And one of the things they showed was a picture all of  us as parents have taken of our kid in a tee ball batting, shot through a chain link fence.  And there's a chain link fence in the way of the shot. And magically he pushed a button and the  chain link fence just disappeared and the kid was. This is where journalists freak out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. You worry about fake news. Yeah. This AI has the potential to create fake news that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  unfreaking believable. Well, or believable actually. So that's the problem, isn't it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. This, this particular photo, like object removal from, from Google Photos is interesting.  It reminded me immediately of, I found a video here. Maybe I can get it to Carson. It was a  SIGGRAPH 2015 paper where they showed how you do obstruction free photography. And I think what it  is, it's less about, it's less about taking a single picture. It's more about taking potentially  a series or a movement. And because of that, it can match the patterns that exist behind the object  and track the object in front and then fill in the pieces and give you a single image  based on those images. So, but that's super cool. It's a really cool kind of feature to roll in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There it is. Carson's showing it right now. I don't, you know, we'll have to wait and see  how well that works. That's a, that's a, that's a lot to promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That got an ooh from the audience. Like nobody's business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we know how hard that is to do, particularly because the things that are behind the chain link  things don't exist for the camera. And so you have to replace pieces of the picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  by extrapolating what's there. Does it, does it not just extrapolate the pixels,  but does it know that's a person and this is where a person's body goes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's more like that. What you were talking about, Jason, which is it's going to  gather information over a longer period of time and the micro movements in the background. And  then the kid will help it fill in the blanks, but it's still, it's not an easy thing to do.  And you know what, if they can do it, that just shows you how powerful their AI is.  Stacey, you had a pick of the week before we let you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really, it was not a pick of the week. Exactly. It is something I found.  Do you want to go to an ad or do you, I still have time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, go right on. Do it, do it to it. We don't need any more ads.  We've had enough ads. It's an all Google show today.  Where'd you get a speaking spell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We found it in my husband's attic, but the best part ready?  It still works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. You can rewire that and build the first prototype compact computer.  Oh no, wait a minute. That that already happened in 1982.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was really excited because this is like my childhood right here. And the fact that it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  worked was awesome. Are you going to give it to your daughter and see if she gets smarter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She, she, she's already been playing with it. She, she just makes it say, are you okay? A bunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's, it's just, it must, you must think it's so primitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's like, this is lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mom, how could you think that was cool? That's so funny. But you know what, Stacey,  you're a smart cookie and we can thank Texas instruments and speak and spell for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anything you'd like to leave us with a final number?  No, I have no number. We went through all the numbers possible. They were all in the billions.  But they were all billions.  I just want to reiterate thanks to the Google staff for making this possible. And it's, and  it's, it's really great. I just want to say this. So there've been three Googlers sitting in the  room and it's, it's interesting to do this show. Cause when I wrote a book called what would Google  do, I came to do a talk here. I thought, Oh, they're all going to know how full of crap I was.  And we can say things here as we always do every week. And we had Googles looking at us. And I  was kind of watching your eyeballs thinking, well, if they rolled like, like Anderson Cooper,  you pull in as a Cooper, I think, Oh, I got that wrong. But, but they're good actors. And so,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but I'm grateful. Thank you. That's nice. How about you, anything you want to say, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I will go ahead and give a quick app to check out if you, if you don't mind. It's totally  I have not checked it out myself yet, but today, right when I was starting Google released a new  app to the play store called audio factory. And apparently it's meant for daydream and it's an  representation of kind of some of Android owes new developments around spatial, um, audio, uh,  experiments or whatever. So I don't know. It's we're checking out. I'm curious to dive in there  and see it kind of sets up some scenery. I have to imagine there's a little bit of kind of  three-dimensional, you know, surround it, the surround sound sort of thing. When you've got  the headphones on, I honestly don't know what it's all about, but it looks very intriguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And speaking of which, I completely dropped the fact that at the beginning of the event before  Sender put shy to the stage, we had two DJs. I don't know if they're brothers or sisters.  Yeah. Performing on the left and the right using little tap boxes and little percussive devices  attached to their Android phone. And I think that that was Google's very subtle way of telling  musicians it's okay to come into the water. Musicians have, I think I'm right at Jason,  you correct me on this, but I musicians have eschewed Android because it's famous for,  and this is a problem really in the Linux kernel, a 10 millisecond latency in the audio channels  that no one has ever been able to get rid of. And it really, any latency really impairs live  performance. Absolutely. It's one of the reasons there have been a dearth of musical performance  apps on Android while there are many, many on iOS. And it's not just the 10 milliseconds, it adds,  it adds and adds and adds and adds. And eventually you can get a significant half second delay or  more, which really makes it unusable. Those, those guys were playing in sync in time on different  places on different Android phones with no appreciable latency. And I have a feeling that  that has, that there was a reason why they put that up on the stage. They had mentioned that they  thought that they had solved this with Android O. So maybe that's part of what you should try out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. They're going to have the space here to go in and play around with it.  Last year they had, they had kind of a dedicated music production area to kind of play around with  it. And they really have touted at least as one of the, one of the features of O is improvements  around professional audio and getting that latency down. So, you know, I don't, I just don't wonder  if it's a little too little too late because a lot of the musicians have just kind of gone full board  on iOS at this point, but I rather have it than not. And I'm curious to see what it's all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you got everybody else? Did you sign up for O?  I did not because I'm going to travel with my pixel. I use Google fly and it's going to be a  great traveling phone for me. And I don't want to mess it up right before we hit the road.  Speaking of hitting the road, it's time to say goodbye. Thank you everybody for being here.  Stacey Higginbotham is at Stacey on iot.com also iotpodcast.com. You'll find her on Twitter at  gigastacey. You really worked hard today, harder than me. So thank you for being here both times.  In fact, get yourself a massage. Yeah. And it's, and it's charge it to uncle Leo.  Like it's, it's my mother's day present. Nice. Have a great time. Thank you very much for coming  all this way. Thank you for the show. I know, but I, it's always, it's always, it's always the, the,  part of the reason to be out here. Professor of journalism at the city university of New York,  the blogger at buzz machine.com and the other great books like what would Google do public parts  and uh, should I mention geek sparing gifts? You always, you always laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got through the show without crossing a bridge. There you go. Let's be happy. There you go. How

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  nice is that? You're right. Just go down from the airport. It's no, no problem. You did across the  peninsula. Is that okay? You don't mind peninsula? Bridges. Okay. Bridges that fall down.  We'll see a lot more of a Jason Howell. Um, of course, Monday through Friday, 4 PM, not today,  but, uh, but most of the time 4 PM Pacific, uh, uh, 7 PM Eastern time, 2,300 UTC on TNT and every  Tuesday 5 PM Pacific, 8 PM Eastern time on, uh, all about Android and a reminder once again,  something very special on Tuesday. We won't say what, but he's got some big interviews here at  Google IO and you're going to see the results of those interviews. I want to say it. I want to,  I want to tell you, but I'm not gonna. You're such a tease, Jason Howell, such a, such a tease. Uh,  we're going to be at the, uh, maker fair on Friday. If you're in the Bay area, the San Mateo maker  fair, uh, we will be Friday afternoon from one to five. Uh, father Robert Ballis and I'll be down  there. We're going to bring our cameras, right? Colleen. So if people have some projects they want  to show us, bring them on by no projects too small or silly, and we'd love to see it and  meet you and say hello. So come by one to five Friday afternoon. If you're out in San Mateo,  California for the, uh, that's the mothership of, uh, of maker fair. I'm Leo Laporte. We thank you  so much for joining us and we will see you next time on this week in Google. Bye bye.
