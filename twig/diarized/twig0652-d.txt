Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But well, I, you know what?  I might lend it to you, because you're very unhappy with the pixel six.  And I like the pixel six pro.  It's very similar.  Just the software.  It's very similar to the picture six pro.  But I want to see what you think of the, of the camera.  So I'll, I'll, I'll let you, uh, I'll let you borrow this so that you can, you can  take some fine pictures with it.  It's I tell you, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You ever use pens when you have to see the various devices you've had over  the years and that kind of thing.  Do you use them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  I mean, I was a big note fan, but mostly I like to know because of the big screen.  There's some things you can do with a pen.  That's kind of cool.  Even while the phone is locked, you can write, uh, you know, Jeff  Jarvis, his name on here and what's, what's it doing clip web pages.  Yeah.  I don't need to know.  That's why you don't want to, what a good demonstration.  That's a very, uh, that's a very Sam thung.  Sam thung thing to do, but they always are, they're always popping up little  things, oh, you know, you can do this and that, you know, isn't it annoying  that Amazon's Echo is now doing that.  After you say set a timer for 20 minutes, it says, did you know it's like,  it's like so annoying.  It's like, uh, yeah, it's like, um, some old guys in the things, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are they trying to get more use out of the platform?  So they decided to put more tips in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they figured out that nobody does anything but set timers.  Yeah.  And so they've tried to get them to do something else, anything else.  That's 80% of what people do.  Anybody join truth social.  It was out on Monday.  President Trump's, uh, I already get his time to email.  Yeah, but it doesn't work.  It doesn't work.  Yeah.  People had a hard time getting into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's, it's kind of a buggy, shall we say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they had a lot of time to, uh, to, to work it out.  It looks just like Twitter.  I mean, it could not look more like Twitter, right?  It's mastodon.  It's mastodon, but he, but mastodon doesn't look that much like Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and so you have to make it look like the app and sign up and he wants to get  publicity and people will read it.  Why can't you just get it on the web?  Yeah, I don't know.  Good question.  Cause mastodon is what I hear is he wants your email addresses so he can send  you the requests for money.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was wrong when I said last week that it was $5 a week.  Snopes actually had to debunk that.  Uh, there was a lot of people had that story, but apparently it  doesn't cost anything, but you're right.  They're getting other value out of it.  Uh, well, it wasn't there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They, they, they basically forked mastodon, but then didn't  right.  Maintain the open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so they have a page now that celebrates open source at the truth  social website and has a zipped file of their source code that you can download  because they're so hit with the kids and all this open source stuff.  They put it in a zip.  Right.  Um, apparently they also, according to the Washington post borrowed their logo,  the, uh, broken capital T with a period.  It's identical to the logo of a British company called trailer.  Um, oh yeah, there's the broken T trailer says we're going to court.  Good.  Yeah.  Good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  British seller of truck solar.  The first time he's done something like this, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I forget what was, what was it?  And it was like his campaign took something too.  Yeah.  I'm can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can't remember the site's terms of service, uh, or show that free speech  isn't that free.  Uh, you, you cannot try to trick or mislead other users.  You may not dox anybody.  You can't violate anybody's privacy or publicity, publicity rights,  privacy or publicity rights.  That's a very Trumpian phrase.  When have you taught, you know, you're violating my publicity rights.  Why is defamation?  Right.  I don't, what is your publicity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's, it's, it's you can't use my image, right.  Promote your stake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Neil Young actually used that to try and get him to take down a song that he was using.  Right.  You have a right of publicity to your name and you can't post messages that depict

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  violence or include messages related to sexual fetishes, sugar babies.  They explicitly call out sugar babies.  It specifically says sugar.  Yeah.  Or is it, or is it serious?  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What even is that?  I don't know.  You know, you really get the sense.  I don't want to ask.  No, don't.  I don't, I don't want to know.  Do we Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we have the courage to Google it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, don't bother.  Didn't Dr.  Who give everyone a sugar baby on Dr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who?  I think he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's sugar babies and sugar daddies, but it's for mutually beneficial

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dating.  All right.  But you're not allowed to do that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The way they're sugar, they're under prohibited activities.  There are, it's a long list.  Jelly baby.  That's what it was.  Yeah.  Jelly baby.  Yeah.  26 things.  Yeah.  Sugar babies right there.  Context in which, context in which sexual acts are requested or offered including  pornography, prostitution, sugar babies, sex trafficking or sexual.  I think this tells us something about Devin Nunes or Donald Trump.  Who wrote sugar baby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet they copied that.  Somebody added that.  Do you think they copied it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably.  Some intern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think any of this is original.  So I'd be surprised.  Oh, this is getting worse.  Sugar baby and daddy arranging.  Oh, this is getting worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sugar baby and daddy arrangements are becoming increasingly popular worldwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they don't ban interestingly sugar daddies, just sugar babies.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they don't want to reduce the user base too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's quite a long.  Namely, it's not all about the financial benefits.  You'll, since you'll need a partner who shares your opinion and respects.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We, we know enough now.  We don't need to know anymore about that.  No, that's enough.  You can't post anything false, indecent, mislading, profane, obscene, filthy,  or otherwise objectionable.  You cannot disparage tarnish or otherwise harm in our opinion, us and, or the site.  They did already ban the Devin Nunes parody account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Devin Nunes cow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they already banned it.  Already banned it.  Nice.  That's all right.  You know what?  Everybody deserves their own little clubhouse.  I think it's fine.  I thought I did his puzzling because wasn't there gab and parlor.  There were all these, um, other people are still going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they still exist.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still, you couldn't get email addresses to go find shops that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The site was unavailable for most of its first day.  President's day and its operators reported that overwhelming demand  had triggered an outage lasting more than 13 hours.  Even the terms of service were offline during that time.  Um, uh, there were a lot of people, uh, trying to sign up.  Some were reporting that they were 300,000 in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I sent some, some, I don't know, bots with an accent.  Oh, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Maybe a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, uh, it's here.  If you've been waiting, it was number one app on, uh, on the app  store on a Tuesday.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it were only a web application, I would have signed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know that's it's a odd thing that they didn't have a web version of it.  You could still get email addresses from the web.  Anyway.  Uh, boy, that's it.  That's our top stories.  Thank you everybody.  We're going to have to rehash some stuff from last week, I think.  Well, oh, wait a minute.  This really is I'm stealing stuff now from Jason and all  about Android, the first details of the pixel seven and the pixel seven  pro are coming out this one, this actually, I guess it is getting to be next year.  Yeah, it is.  I just got my pixel six.  I know.  Uh, when it'd be the F it'd be come out in the fall usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, it's usually around, um, October usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, so according to nine to five Google, it's going to be a second generation  tensor chip, um, there will be a pixel six a and apparently pixel notepad devices.  I'm not sure what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Notepad devices like a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's see what that rumor is.  I'll go backtracking.  Oh, that's the foldable.  Oh, right.  Foldable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually saw in the code that it looks like it's something that could be  foldable.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The pixel notepad.  Yeah.  Anyway, I actually sent my fold back to get this fine.  Unfoldable, unfolding.  What does it think of the foldable one?  You know, it's not quite ready for prime.  I really like the flip and I actually, that was my Samsung until I got the  ultra and I'm sending that to Stacy.  So when Stacy's on next week, she will have had some time.  I think with the flip, I think the flip three was pretty good for somebody  who wants a small phone.  This thing is heavy and big and you know, I think this actually, the ultra  actually would, I don't know, you might need to hold it for me.  Make sure I warm up before I grab it.  Yeah.  It's heavy.  You need some pretty hefty forearms to hold that thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's premium.  You can't bear floppy wrists.  Yeah.  But that's the thing.  You remember the time when phones came out and everybody said, well, this  phone feels cheap, even though it costs $600, $700.  So they're making them heavier.  This does not feel cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it isn't by the way.  It's actually a little, it feels like it's a little heavier than the Pixel 6.  So Stacy, yeah, she wouldn't even want, I don't think she'd want this.  It feels solid though, right?  Um, I got a question for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, go ahead.  So Meta has lost half a trillion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What a tumble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the question I have for the imagine, I know you don't invest in tech stocks.  You don't buy tech stocks.  You're not an investor that way at all, but just imagine for a moment that you are  all greedy investors and all you care about is money.  You don't care about principle.  You don't come by anything else.  All you care about is money.  Knowing the stock price of Facebook now.  And I don't own any, would you buy it?  Just if all you care about is money, that is to say, do you think it's going to go  back up or do you think Facebook has found a new seller?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would because they're going to have a hot spot and just in the near future,  I think they will have a hot spot where it's going to pop up and then that's  when I'd sell off pump and dump kind of thing.  I don't see.  Yeah, you go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, Matt.  I, I, yeah.  I was just going to say that, um, regardless of what you think about Facebook,  there's no way that it lost $500 billion worth of value.  In the last couple of weeks, I think that's accurate.  It's just not possible.  So in fact, Ben Thompson has a good piece on this and strategic arey talking about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  cause Facebook's half a billion, I'm sorry, half a trillion dollar slide in value.  Um, that's a lot.  Uh, you know, they're, everybody's attributing to Apple's ATT.  Uh, you know, that, that switch.  Oh yeah.  I find it hard to believe that it could be that have that much  impact on Facebook's business.  It's not just that.  I put a story up in the rundown about that.  Their user base fell for the first time.  Yeah, but not by a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But still, they're always bro, bro, bro.  First time it fell.  Yeah.  There's a growth premium, but is it $500 billion?  I don't think so.  I doubt that.  Um, yeah, I, I would, I, you know, I guess I would say that, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  again, like you, Jeff, I don't invest in tech stocks.  I'm not allowed to.  Um, but I think that if you, if you believe you should buy low, sell high,  this is a good time to buy.  I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I do not plan on buying Facebook, but that would be my strategy.  If I were, this is the time.  So another way to ask this question back up is Facebook past its prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's clearly what the market's saying is, uh, oh, you know,  Facebook is the next my space stand back because tick tock or  whoever is going to beat them.  Um, I don't know.  I find that hard to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, I do too, because you, you don't see a lot of things that are  saying, Hey, sign in with your tick tock to use it.  You know, that Facebook is a daggum platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unfortunately, Facebook is still a great place to buy ads, right?  Especially Instagram.  Everybody I talked to, uh, says Instagram ads work.  Everybody who uses Instagram ads.  Well, they work on you.  They know, but as I can speak for myself as a buyer, but people were buying ads  also say, you know, no, that's those are the ads that work for us.  Yeah.  And I don't think that's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I put a wall street journal story into the rundown that does get down to  the brass tacks of individual businesses and the impact of the Apple change on  Martha Krueger runs a gift basket business called gift and market.  Yeah.  She spent her entire ad budget on meta platforms.  When Apple made the change with the privacy feature for mobile devices, she  said her cost to acquire customers rose 10 fold.  It used to be she had a $14 customer acquisition cost increased 10 fold.  So she shifted her whole ad budget to Alphabet's Google AdWords.  That's just one case.  That's one point.  Ben Thompson makes in strategic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that Google's search ads are still the perfect ad because you  don't have to track anybody.  They came and they searched for something and you put a related ad in there.  It's interesting.  He says that the next best thing is Amazon's ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because of course they're search related as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it may be really, that's what the market is, is responding to.  The future of advertising isn't in tracking.  I think really that's the really the real message from the stock market is  not so much, oh, you know, app transparency, Apple's app transparency  is killing Facebook, not at all, but just that it's very clear consumers  no longer want to be tracked and they're going to take steps not to be tracked.  And that companies are going to give them that build it in.  In fact, we talked about this last week, Google has announced that  Google is going to be the first company to have a Google AdWords ad.  They're going to in the next two years, they're not rushing to do it, but they're  going to add application tracking transparency to Android phones as well.  But that's really more a reaction to the fact that consumers are saying enough.  And so I think the market is responding to that, not necessarily ATT, but they're  responding to that and saying, you know what, in the long run, customers are not  going to, don't want this tracking.  So yeah, let's favor.  Now did Google go up?  Did Amazon go up?  And I think all the tech stocks are down.  So you can't even, you can't even judge.  That's another reason you can't say, Oh my God, you know, this is  good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The NASDAQ was down like 2% today.  Yeah.  Um, yeah.  Now, meanwhile, Brian Morrissey, the founder of DigiDay who's since left has a  piece down on the rundown down online, some brother one, one, one, um, in which  he's arguing that the pendulum will swing back toward context.  That is what we do.  Right.  Environment lost to data.  I don't care where the ad goes, as long as I know you're interested in boots and  data, data, Uber, Alice.  Uh, now he says, well, now the data is getting cooties and nobody wants data  anymore and data is bad and days not working.  Then does context come back?  I think for some things you never lost it Leo here, but does it come back to your  basic publication?  I'm not so sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He also says, and I love hearing this primary engagement media will gain the  next phase of digital publishing will favor quality over quantity in terms of  audiences.  Those publishing brands that put community at their core will thrive since it  easily lends itself to a direct relationship.  Community today and here community.  That will make those audiences far more valuable than a random collection of  people.  This is what we've been saying all along.  And I hope that's true.  Of course, Spotify is meanwhile investing, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars  in ad tracking and all the, in all of the things that into data and all the things  that the communities are rebelling against.  It would be really ironic, wouldn't it?  If Spotify's half trillion dollar investment in this stuff turned out to be,  uh, the badly timed that like they bought into it at the, you know, at the peak and  now it's going down.  I'm gonna make me happy.  It would make me too.  You also put an article in, you also put an article in here, why podcasts are  becoming Netflix is the New York Times.  Podcasts have been a freewheeling corner of digital life, but the potential for  profits is changing that.  And this is all based on the Spotify acquisition of a chartable and pod sites.  We talked about last week where they're, they're getting into the direct ad  insertion.  They're spending a lot of money on content.  They're doing all that targeted stuff.  Boy, that would be ironic if it turned out that, no, that's not the way to go.  Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was just piggybacking off of the Facebook discussion a minute ago.  Um, is you talking about the consumers are starting to just throw their hands up  and say, Hey, we've had enough of all of this tracking and, and we're, we're  concerned about our privacy and yada, yada, yada.  But yet at the same time, the masses are also still latching on to these different  podcasts and shows that are just spewing out interesting information.  That's not necessarily true.  So I'm like, where, where does all of this even begin to match up?  Uh, I, it just doesn't make any sense to me.  Cause I think that's why I say, I think Facebook is still going to be quite all  right because there's still like a zillion people out there that will just continue  to do whatever Facebook says is good for them, regardless of privacy or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I generally agree with you, although also I think the market sometimes is,  uh, you know, it's the wisdom of crowds is, is accurate on this stuff.  And maybe they're really saying this is, this is a trend, a, you know, the  trend is away from that kind of tracking.  I don't know.  I think that's a very interesting question.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think that that yields then a very different internet, which  could be a very good thing.  Um, and, and advertising and content and, and, and the notions around this, we  still need advertising to support media or else we're bored.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to, um, I don't want to like burst any bubbles, but I don't think any  of the stock trading and Facebook had anything to do with advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good.  It was more about the declining, uh, enrollment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it was users and I think it was fear about the future and those things  combined and obviously fear about Apple's impact on their ad growth.  But just, but Matthew didn't, regardless of that future of the company, then  people are worried about the future.  That the future is the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I agree with you, Matthew, but, but, but, but, but isn't it also the case though  that Apple, um, screw it over Facebook and its data leads to bigger questions  about, about, um, uh, user data and advertising as opposed to context and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  environment, do you buy that?  Yeah, definitely.  I just don't think that's why people trade stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I agree with you.  But do you, I, tell me what I want to hear.  You do think the content is coming back and communities based around content?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's all I want to hear.  Yeah.  To me that that is exciting because, uh, you're right, Jeff, we want to support  journalism, but that's the best kind of journalism is journalism that serves a  community that's a, it's either local or, you know, it's a community of interest.  That's the best kind, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'll say something called QAnon that's doing really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I don't want to weigh in, you know, Ant was talking about, you know,  whether it's true or not, I don't want to weigh in on the content itself.  Yeah, absolutely.  Some of these communities, you know, are flat earthers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a very powerful community.  But it's a powerful community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know an advertiser.  I mean, I guess maybe there's some banner makers and hat makers, but there's not a  lot of advertising.  Pillows.  That's all right.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, but I think that goes to your point.  Like I don't actually think QAnon and those types of things are about the facts at all.  That's not, yeah, but who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's, you know, I'm not part of it.  Yeah.  I'm not one of those people that wants stuff to be shut down because it doesn't  dispel something I believe to be true.  Um, I guess if it's dangerous.  But you don't have to support it though.  No, but I want, but that's fine.  That way I do my thing.  I don't want somebody to shut me down either because, you know, I think, uh, let

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a million flowers bloom and since Matthew's here, let me, let me, let me go off your  point, uh, for something maybe provocative.  Um, if so, so what's happened in the news business is that, is that they've given up  on advertising because advertising all went to digital space.  Let's just imagine that some advertising started to come back in the meantime, major  publications, especially the big three newspapers in the U S have not abandoned  advertising, but they are now majority supported by their users, which many  celebrate, but I, I, I'm, I'm constantly more disappointed.  I'm my favorite three papers were Washington Post, New York Times, The Guardian,  and I'm getting more disappointed in all three.  And somebody asked me on Twitter, why do you think that is?  And, and I was Kate day now Politico.  And I responded with something that Jay Rosen said some time ago that when the  New York Times thinks that it's, it is paroled with its users, that it's  users control everything.  The one hand, they want to pander to them.  On the other hand, they want to say, Oh, we're independent of you.  And we're going to piss you off regularly by doing both sides, ism and so on and so  Right.  And I wonder whether, especially for the top three, since they get two thirds of  all the paywall money in news in America, whether this dependence on the users has  skewed their mindset a little bit.  And we were better off with something that was half advertising, half consumers.  Something that didn't care what people wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  That is a risk.  I think if you, I actually like to think about the 10,000 true fans, I think it  was that Kevin Kelly came up with musicians that have pursued those types of  models have found success, but they also have a community that wants to tell them  what to do.  So the sort of, the more you cater to your community, the more they become the  boss in a way.  And they can, I think it is a risk.  If you have a purely subscription driven model, you're going to cater more and more  to those readers because they're paying the bills and that could be a good thing or  it could not be a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And everybody says, Oh, Twitter doesn't represent the society, but Twitter is 330  million people.  It represents a lot of things.  The subscriber list for the New York times, the Washington post does not represent  society at all.  It is privileged people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My attitude, of course I'm a small timer, but my attitudes from many years in  broadcasting is you don't ever want to chase an audience because that's a moving  target.  So I come from the opposite direction, which is build something I think is good.  I have kind of the auteur theory from my gut that is good and hope that that will  generate a community around it and then continue to do that if it does.  And if it doesn't, then you've got the wrong, your guts wrong.  I suppose that only works on small scale.  You can't you can't build a giant business that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, I think I think I go back to I'm thinking about magazines a lot right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also the it was EW when you planned EW.  That was your gut, right?  You didn't have or it wasn't audience research saying, Oh, you got to have this much.  Well, that's the interesting thing, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then audience be timing being timing.  Then audience research was done.  That was completely wrong.  Right.  The audience research said that the audience for EW was going to be mid thirties to  forties.  Yuppies very busy.  Not enough time for their entertainment.  Want some help.  In fact, the actual buying and everything I have heard every day since it was  teenagers and people in their early twenties who said, finally, a magazine for  me that has my attitude.  They were enthusiasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Cater to enthusiasts.  Yes.  Because they're loyal.  They'll stay there as long as you serve them.  And so that's what I've learned in broadcasting over the years is if you chase  an audience, it invariably fails.  You have to you have to, you know, love your topic and go dive deep into it.  And it does well.  That was happening at Tech TV.  They wanted to broaden it and broaden it.  I said, it's like ESPN doesn't do shows about for people who don't like football.  That's just not, that's not a good topic.  You know, here's how football works.  They don't do remedial shows either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not a good topic for them anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  They don't say, well, here's the rules of football.  No.  In fact, the shows that are most successful in sports talk radio are the ones that  assume knowledge on the listener's part.  Assume enthusiasm and knowledge.  Yeah.  I think we're kind of like that.  And that's always the way I've gone.  So yeah, I think it's a risk if you start chasing the audience, but I think the  risk is more to you than anything else.  It's the risk to your business.  Yeah, I don't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still a balancing act too, even with the community side of things.  Like Mr.  Ingram was saying that to an extent you don't necessarily want your community  telling you what to do from a creation standpoint.  Yeah, but you do listen.  Yeah.  But not too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the hard part.  Um, you know, it's true of anything.  It's true of running a school too, right?  So the early days of our school, well, the students say this, the students,  well, the students one year say something and the students the next year say  something exactly the opposite.  Totally different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you've got to have your own, as Leo said, you've got to have your  own vision of what you're doing and people gather around it or they say,  I don't care what he cares about.  Nobody gathers around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then, you know, you did the wrong thing, but it's too late, but okay.  Well,  next time better luck.  But I always said, I always told people getting into broadcasting.  Don't try to be something you're not just be yourself.  You might not make it.  You may not make it, but if you don't, you don't, you're not going to make it  by pretending to be something you're not.  Right.  Um, but at the same time you do have to, it is, you know what?  This is true of life.  Everything's a paradox.  Everything's there's no black and white.  There's no hard and hard and fast rules for anything.  Of course you have to listen to them and let that inform your gut.  Uh, you know, if you're going down a rabbit hole, you got to listen to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah, you got to hear good suggestions and good ideas, but you can't pander.  You can't pay.  I remember a timing.  Yes.  A woman who, uh, Harriet fear was her name.  She was a brilliant editor.  She worked for a while in their magazine development department, the one that  also tried to kill the W and, um, she said she was appalled because there she  said the men of time, Inc.  Looked at women from neck to knees.  And, and so they created, uh, one of the things that they tried to create, in  fact, they, they almost launched it was a magazine called picture week.  It was the time for women because it had pictures instead of those nasty words.  That is the worst of.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  They also wanted to make a women's magazine that was per size, which did in  fact happen later glamour and a company that have smaller versions.  Um, but yeah, yeah, it was, it was, it was picture week, quietly  parenthetical that'll attract women.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, my computer's just died, so I don't know what the news is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was afraid you were coughing.  Shoking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it running windows, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Let's go to the terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I know.  I knew it wasn't running windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I knew it wasn't.  I must've kicked something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, um, I can look for something here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I gotta take a break anyway, but I Chris, my ads on the computer too.  I know I can, I can, I can, I'll read it off my Samsung galaxy S 22.  This screen is so high quality.  Not the note.  It's practically a note.  Our show today brought to you, but we're going to more with that.  Matthew, thank you for being here.  This is kind of what you write about at CJR, right?  Is the whole media thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I'm really, please, uh, correct us if we're, if we're  wrong about this whole thing.  Oh, he will.  Yeah, he will.  Well, and that's, is your, your Bailey wick is apologize for it because it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Canadian, but, uh, the truckers apologize by the way, Matthew,  apologize.  Have they done the Canadian thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause they're not Canadians.  No.  Yeah.  Most of them are Canadian.  That's the, that's the irony of the whole thing.  They're all Americans, Americans.  Um, our show today brought to you by new relic.  I am a fan of new relic.  You probably heard of new relic.  They were, uh, really big in the, in the early days of Ruby on rails.  Now they've combined all the tools, all the tools you need for something  called network observability.  Now put your picture of this.  It's 3 a.m.  You've just gotten in bed.  You're happy.  You're relaxed or you're asleep and the phone rings and something's gone wrong.  The network's down or the software is crashing.  Something's gone wrong.  Now what do you do?  You jump up, you're, you're running back and forth.  You're trying to figure out, is it the backend is the front end?  Is it global?  Is it the servers, the network?  What is it?  The cloud provider.  You've got your team going from two to two.  They're messaging each other back and forth.  Everybody's awake now.  And we still don't know what's going on.  A slow running queries is at the database.  Is it blocked?  Did you introduce a bug in your last commit?  See, if you had new relic, you wouldn't have all those questions.  You'd have the answer at 3 0 1 a.m.  And you'd be back in bed by 3 0 5.  According to new relic, only half of all organizations are implementing  observability for their networks and systems.  That means half will be able to get back to bed.  The other half, they're still up 3, 3, 4, 5, trying to figure out what's wrong.  Maintaining network observability is a big issue for companies all around the world.  But if you get new relic, your life just got a hundred percent better.  New relic combined 16 different monitoring products that you'd normally get separately.  But they're all working together.  It's a single platform that gives you complete observability across your  entire software stack in one place.  16 different tools.  I'll give you some examples.  There's APM application monitoring, which is unifying monitoring for your  apps and your microservices.  If you're using Kubernetes, you'll love Pixi.  You must've heard about Pixi.  I mean, that's just the way to go.  Observability into your clusters.  Distributed tracing.  You can see all your traces without management headaches.  So you can find and fix issues fast.  Network performance monitoring.  You can stop guessing where the performance issues are starting and dish those data  silos for the first time ever.  You'll get a system wide correlated view.  Imagine that.  And that's just four of the 16 tools.  And now here's my favorite part of this whole ad.  The best part.  It's free.  No credit card needed.  You can try it right now for free.  You get all the tools, full access and a hundred gigabytes of data free per month.  Forever.  You don't have to give them a credit card.  They're nothing.  They're nothing.  Whether you're a cloud native startup or a fortune 500 company, it just takes five  minutes to get new relic going and you will be so glad the next time that phone  rings at 3 a.m.  You'll go, hey, no problem.  I got it.  And it's fixed and you're back to bed.  No credit card required to sign up right now.  Any w r e l i c dot com slash twig new relic.com.  Please use the slash twig so they know you saw it here.  Please.  Pretty please.  Sugar on top.  New relic.com slash twig.  I just love that offer free forever.  A hundred gigabytes of data a month.  All the tools for one user gets everything.  The rest, but you still have other users.  It's just amazing.  I have to say, there's no reason not to be using this right now.  New relic.com slash twig.  Get there and do it.  Somebody say I'm starting to talk more like Beverly hillbillies.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess I have get a little colloquial in my speech.  I don't know why that is.  I just like, I want to be more down home.  I don't want to be a preppy.  You don't hear it?  Okay, good.  No, no.  Good.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Pick picks.  You really want to run this show anyway.  Go ahead, pick something.  Hey, hey, hey.  I know you, I know you do.  What about Mr. Ingram's story?  Yeah, Mr. Ingram's story from CJR dot org.  Matthew, I had it right in front of me a second ago.  What did you write?  What did you write about?  That's about, you know what it's about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The earn it act.  Oh, that's son of a resurrected earn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's back, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Dick Blumenthal.  And is this Marsha Blackburn?  Can I just say this is a Lindsay Graham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the thing I hate the most about US legislation.  So you have a serious bill and you're talking about serious topics, but you have to come  up with an acronym.  Yeah.  In some cases, a retro, you know, bending over backwards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just to get, so this one's the eliminating abuse and rampant neglect of interactive  technology.  First of all, I would submit there is no rampant neglect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Quite the opposite.  I mean, there might be neglect, but is it rampant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there might be neglect, but is it rampant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I neglect our forms, but that's something different.  I don't think they're talking about me.  Is it rampant?  Is it rampant?  No, just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, it's a resurrected bill from 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which, thank God, we got rid of in 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But now it's back and it's worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is one of the bills that attacks 230, right?  You have to earn.  What you have to earn is the right to have protection under 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they're trying to go after child sexual abuse material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, they're not.  They know better than that.  They just pretending that's what it's all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say they're trying to, but it could result in-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just like the lotto is for the school system.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Our kids win too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or like SOPA and PIPA.  Right.  But it could end up with, you know, mass withdrawal of content just in case it's,  contravenes the act and also an end to encryption, which is pretty serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Blumenthal says, what are you talking about?  This has nothing to do with encryption.  Why is it, why does it attack encryption?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it doesn't specifically say that you can't use encryption, but the way it's  worded and the way it hands over power to the States to come up with whatever  baddie rules they want, I think people are afraid that it's going to, it's going  to become like, if you're using encryption, then that's a red flag.  Right.  The fact that you're even using it and that you should know if there's child  sexual abuse material, the platforms are responsible for knowing what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going on on their platform.  So if there's encryption, they're obviously not.  So no encryption.  I mean, it's just kind of work your way backwards from the requirements of it.  Now there's also-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike Masnick pointed out that it's actually, this provides an incentive for  platforms to moderate their content even less than they already are, because that  way they can claim they didn't know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty much what they want, right?  Just sort of wash your hands of all of the gibberish that's going on right now.  But they'd still wind up in court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how does this compare to the Nudge Act?  Which is Senator Klobuchar's act that, which is kind of funny, that says that  the NSF and NAISM, the National Academy of Sciences have to decide what best  practices are for restricting misinformation and then the government's  going to enforce it, which of course it's kind of a non-starter in the US with  this thing called the First Amendment.  And there's been a whole bunch, there's been a whole bunch of things that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's been a whole bunch of proposals and attempts by various Congress people  and senators to find A, an end run around Section 230 and B, an end run around  the First Amendment.  And, you know, those might be good things to have, but it's going to be incredibly  difficult to make that work.  You might get a sort of carve out from Section 230, but that doesn't mean that  that content still isn't covered by the First Amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's, is it safe to just ignore everything that comes out of Congress  these days, because they're not going to pass anything, are they?  Well, probably not.  No.  It'd be a shocker if they did suddenly, though, then we're stuck with our, you  know, mouths open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think Leo actually, I think this could be the one thing they do pass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they have left and right.  The peaceful movement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From the left and right, all trying to, it's moral panic, blaming moral panic.  I said it, Ant, moral panic.  I'm trying to blame technology for all of our ills.  And thank you, Ant.  And I need a theme song for moral panic, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ask Pete Dominic if you need a theme song.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pete's good to me.  Pete gives me jingles.  So here all I get is a 10 second choir.  Quiet iceberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the Republicans and Democrats, they're, you know, one side thinks the  platforms moderate too much and the other side thinks they don't moderate enough.  Well, they all just like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They think both, right?  Because you shouldn't have taken President Trump's account down, but you  should take Devin Nunes' cow account down.  So it's not clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you should remove misinformation, but only the stuff that we say is misinformation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Which is why I get very nervous when people talk about banning Joe Rogan and stuff.  Even if it's something ridiculously wrong, people have the right to say stupid things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not banning Joe Rogan.  It is saying that we have a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People do want, some people at least want Spotify to cancel Joe Rogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to, I'll go this far.  I don't want to patronize Spotify when they have Joe Rogan.  Oh no, this is our choice.  That's totally fine.  That's a choice.  I made a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, they keep trying to argue that they're just a platform that hosts content,  but they paid them $200 million.  No, that's more than just, hey, come use our platform.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That might've been their tactical error right there.  I think I'm really liking this whole new narrative that we've come up with, that Spotify  got into the targeted ad game at exactly the wrong time.  I'm loving that.  Let's go with that.  That's a good one.  That's a good one.  Let's see.  Meta is no longer in the top 10 even of market value.  That's how much they've plummeted.  513 billion in market cap.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.  Speaking of laws aimed at platforms, according to one of the recent laws,  Facebook's fallen so much in market value that it wouldn't even be covered by one  of the laws that was aimed at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blumenthal's law requires a $600 billion market cap.  $600 million market cap.  And they only have $565 billion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe Mark tanked the stock so that they would be below the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you get out of the limelight.  I think Blumenthal was looking at this, in fact, top 10 most valuable companies,  because to get into the top 10, you need $600 billion in value.  Well, 10 cents squeaks in with $589.  But I think that's probably what it is.  Apple is slowly pushing the top limit.  They're now $2.8 trillion in market value.  But nobody's going after Apple.  That just shows whether you believe it or not, go for privacy.  That's what people want.  They really do want that.  But you don't have to offer it to people in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Oh yeah, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So don't worry about that.  Follow all the laws of every country you're in, except the United States, then you're golden.  Or something.  Or something.  Apparently, the Astro robot that Amazon was flogging, the little weird spy robot for $14.50,  actually there were 300 of them sold, but that's it.  And so you're starting to see now some videos going around of Astro.  I'm surprised there were that many.  I know.  That's a lot.  At that price.  Is it for the people that work for Amazon that the family is going to be like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the people that work for Amazon that the family members bought it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, here's a fifth grade teacher from Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would have to drive my car and go to the store and get all my groceries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matthew Nairam.  He got his Astro a couple of months ago.  Here is a video of Astro delivering a beer.  Wow.  Just like the commercial says.  Moving fast.  $1400 beer.  Beer coaster.  And you only can get one beer in there, by the way.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, somebody has to put the beer in for you to get it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is ridiculous.  Now it's lost.  Let me turn up the sound because yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute, it went to the wall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's your beer.  It's lost.  Turn up my sound, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guys following it.  Give me my beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good he has the hardwood floors.  That's Astro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Find Celeste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Celeste is his wife, I presume.  I hope it's not his fifth grader.  He's looking around.  This is very weird.  Oh, I think he found her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had a voice on Toya Celeste, but I'm only a dumb robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there she is.

Transcript:  I think those are Celeste's scams.  Astro, like the editors of Entertainment Weekly,  thinks that women are just neck to knees.  Are just neck to knees.  There he goes.  He found it.  Editors of Time.  So she got her beer, though.  I guess so.  He doesn't really deliver the beer.  He just kind of stands next to you till you take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  Where's Boston Dynamics when we need him?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the dog will get it to you, man.  He only pays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  The lasers come out.  Yeah.  Amazon does not release sales data, but a company spokesperson told The Verge,  they're seeing positive feedback and learning a lot about how customers want to use a consumer robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are also known as bug reports.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He also said it's too early to say when we'll have more available.  I don't think Amazon ever expected to sell these in quantity, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all about the learnings.  Maybe this is a pilot for something bigger and better, like DoD stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Amazon's not too smart to get involved in that.  Remember all the brouhaha over...  Of course, they did want the Jedi contract, though, didn't they?  Yeah.  They wanted that bad.  That's true.  Yeah.  We now know who was behind QAnon.  Do you like this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Person named Q.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we know who Q was.  So computer scientists using machine learning have done linguistic analysis of the posts  from QAnon.  This is always a question.  Who is Q?  In fact, there was a good documentary about the whole phenomenon,  which fingered a guy named Ron Watkins who ran...  He was at 4chan.  He was a moderator there, opened up 8chan.  Q mysteriously followed him to 8chan.  According to the linguistic analysis, Ron Watkins, who is now running for Congress  in Arizona, incidentally, yes, was one of two.  Two people.  Before Q moved to 8chan, in the early days,  a South African software developer and tech journalist named Paul Ferber.  Paul Ferber was apparently the first Q.  He was long fascinated with American politics and conspiracy theories.  In an interview, recent interview, he clung to the idea of Pizzagate,  the story about the Satanists who were trafficking children from a Washington pizza restaurant.  He was also among the few understood an obscure reference in the message to  Operation Mockingbird, an alleged CIA scheme to manipulate the news media.  Two teams of two independent teams of forensic linguists say  their analysis of text showed that Mr. Ferber  actually played the lead role in writing the earliest messages.  Ferber is not a name that I've seen mentioned before.  But I don't hang out with that group.  Right.  Well, they don't know and they don't want to know.  I think they'd prefer to...  They don't want to be some guy from South Africa.  They want to be somebody with deep connections to the...  I've read about the Ron Watkins theories before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But not Ferber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Watkins appears to have taken over from Ferber in the beginning of 2018.  Of course, both deny it.  Apparently...  Well, there you go.  They said it's not true.  So...  Yeah.  In a telephone interview from his home, this is the New York Times,  near Johannesburg, Mr. Ferber did not dispute the Q's writing resembles his own.  Instead, he claimed the Q's posts had influenced him so deeply that they altered his prose.  Right.  I am your father.  Q's messages took over our lives literally, Mr. Ferber said.  We all started talking like him.  Linguistic experts said that is implausible.  Said that was implausible.  Implausible.  And their analyses included tweets by Mr. Ferber from the very first days that Q emerged.  So how could he have been copying Q?  Ron Watkins consistently says, I am not Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he also praised the posts for being super smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like Q.  What was the name of the documentary?  That was a good documentary.  And in that...  Oh, I forgot.  He kind of smirkingly basically, not admitted to it, but kind of implied...  Credit for it.  Yeah.  And then he backed down.  It's called Q Into the Storm.  It was an HBO series.  But if you get a chance, if you're an HBO subscriber, it's a six episode series that's  worth watching.  And I think pretty much fingers Ron Watkins.  But there's enough there that Colin Hoback's documentary...  Enough ambiguity that it's not sure.  But that's interesting anyway.  Anyway, tickets for what it's worth depends, I guess, on how much you believe linguistic  forensic analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Q shut up lately, right?  Q hasn't been...  Oh, yeah.  But people are supposedly following Q.  But the problem is for any of this, for truckers and vaccines or any of this, what they say  is the point is not the point.  And that's the point.  Right?  It's that we're going to pick a target.  It doesn't matter what the target is.  Our aim is to destroy institutions.  Our aim is to disrupt.  Our aim is to piss you off.  Our aim is to own the libs.  And it really doesn't matter what the target is.  But media will take it seriously.  So media said all the truckers care about the vaccination.  They're not truckers.  They don't care about the vaccination.  But you got used media.  You got used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alex Jones said his strategy was flood the zone with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  How was coverage of the trucker stuff in Canada versus US, Matthew, since you watch media in  both places?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's quite interesting, actually.  We were just talking about that at CGR this morning because the New York Times had a couple  of people reporting on it.  And there was quite a bit of sort of pushback against the Times reporting because the Times  story, even in the headline, I think, said that protesters were being removed and arrested  at gunpoint.  And a whole bunch of Canadian journalists and others said, you know, that's an inaccurate  way of reporting it.  And I watched hours of video of the protesters being removed.  And I saw guns, I think, twice.  So out of 170 arrests, it appears that there may have been two in which guns were used  because a tactical team had to go into a vehicle or whatever.  So, you know, is it fair to say in a headline that people were being removed at gunpoint  if it only happened twice out of 170 times?  Maybe not.  But then the New York Times got all defensive and said, you guys just don't like to think  of yourself as having guns.  And so we're telling you the truth, the uncomfortable truth, and you just don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the Times does not take criticism well.  Me in third grade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's for sure.  Was that what the teacher said?  He does not take criticism well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, they found a folder of old report cards.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  And there were moments of hilarity for my wife and sister at my expense.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does not take criticism well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine was, Matthew doesn't apply himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that was mine in every single time.  He has so much potential.  Why?  He's so lazy.  He doesn't apply himself.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Daydreaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a little break.  Actually, this one is this one.  My kindergarten report card.  Yeah.  So that I respond to his group critically.  And this is the best one.  Quote, seems to be emotionally stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are all just stupid.  And that was in the 20s.  That's not writing.  That's typing.  Red pencil.  Red pencil.  I could just see it.  You should, they should have written, he will be an editor someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got scared.  This is, this is, this is true.  You remember the jungle gyms, right?  They had an indoor kindergarten jungle gym.  It was just a wood across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's basically a bridge without a river.  Jungle gym.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got trapped in jungle gym.  I was trapped in crying because I couldn't figure out how to get out of the jungle gym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you are the least athletic person I know, sir.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes, I am, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trapped in the jungle gym.  I am.  You're kind of trapped in the jungle gym of life, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kept on my way out.  Was that before or after they abandoned the Palmer method?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What kind of Palmer method?  My handwriting is awful.  That was, that was, I didn't, I didn't have either the Palmer method or grammar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was the Palmer method?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For, did you learn, you learned, Matthew had a cursive.  Right?  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Well, the Palmer method was very, it's actually quite beautiful.  I wish we had learned the Palmer method, but it got replaced in schools, I think in the 20s,  by what I learned for handwriting, which I can't remember what it's, what it's called.  No, in the 50s.  In the 50s.  Yeah.  Eventually, according to Wikipedia, it's planted by the Zenerbloser method,  which I'm sure we didn't learn, but this is what Palmer, this is what Palmer looks like.  And I actually got some books to teach me the Palmer method.  Can you see my screen?  There you go.  That's what it looks like.  It's pretty, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should point out someone's.  That looks like what we learned.  Sort of, yeah.  Trapped in the jungle gym of life.  Trapped in the jungle gym of life with the Palmer method.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty good.  And a quill pen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seems emotionally stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did have an ulcer in first grade after I moved from that school to Iowa.  Yes, I was an erotic.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that even possible?  Yeah, I did.  You were like an old man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You were like a little sympathy for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Moved from Elmhurst, Illinois to Burlington, Iowa.  And I didn't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the 20s.  This is what, this is what you learned, Ant, the Zenerbloser.  I didn't know it was called the Zenerbloser method, but this is.  I never knew that.  This is what we learned in, here, show this.  This is what we learned.  That's what you learned, right?  Yeah.  It's much simpler.  Well, it's simpler.  Oh, okay.  Not as much curling and.  Not as much curly cues.  Well, my favorite is the Spencerian method.  If I could learn that, I would be a happy man.  No, it's like what Lincoln must have written the Begettisburg address in.  I'll show you a Spencerian.  Actually, this is, I think this is what I have.  This dude has Spencerian.  Oh yeah.  Look at that.  Don't you wish you could write like that?  Yes.  That's how everybody wrote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually did calligraphy for a while.  Yeah, it's like calligraphy.  Yeah, I like calligraphy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spaces between the words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you don't need spaces when your letters are that beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you guys remember the Evelyn Wood speed reading?  Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Remember that?  My sister took the course.  Apparently, there's a podcast out based on a book.  The whole thing was just a gigantic scam.  It doesn't work and never has worked.  Of course not.  Of course not.  Evelyn.  Pretty much proven that it doesn't work.  But she was such a nice lady and she looked like your grandma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had to move your hands.  That's right.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guide your hand down.  Run your hand down the middle of the page.  Anyway, it's all garbage and the whole thing was a scam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And actually, that's the pun because they call her a scan artist.  Right.  That's right.  Scan artist.  Yeah.  Evelyn Wood convinced the world that speed reading worked.  Wow.  And here's a lesson.  It's actually on YouTube.  Really?  Yes.  Is it her doing it?  No, I think Evelyn's long gone.  This is Evelyn's granddaughter, Pat Bean.

You're just rushing through.  I got nothing.  I got I really have nothing.  Why not?  Let's do it.  Yeah.  The Google change log.  The long drawn out death of Google Hangouts continues.  Google again this week?  Google Chat is going to replace Hangouts.  I didn't even know Hangouts was still around.  It is.  In Workspace, you'll have to go to chat.  You're just going to have to go to chat.  The switch was delayed.  They wanted to do this back in October.  Get this 2019.  Then they didn't really get started until last June.  The final phase.  When I say last June, I mean 2020.  The final phase is now set for late March.  Beginning March 22nd, we'll turn on the chat preferred setting  for any customers who haven't already done so, making Google Chat the default chat application.  So if you go to Hangouts in Gmail on the web or in the  Hangouts mobile apps, you'll be redirected.  Google says not possible to opt out of this change.  However, because Google is not exactly committed,  hangouts.google.com will continue to work for some time.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That explains it because I'm looking at my phone right now in the last two messages.  One's from December 28th.  One's from February 3rd here in Hangouts.  I thought it was supposed to be dead.  It's not quite dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's mostly dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember Princess Bride?  Yeah.  It's mostly dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in fact, now Google Messages is even the default on Samsung.  So I think they're really just kind of, you know, I don't know what's going on.  I don't know.  If your workspace organization's admin console setting is still set to chat and classic hangouts,  the automatic upgrade to chat preferred will occur over the course of three weeks,  starting on March 22nd.  Organizations with classic hangouts only will see the transition commence over a five-week  period starting April 4th.  But it's going to happen.  It's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm looking at this and I'm not in workspace.  This is just my personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  I gave it up finally.  I'm on FI and I gave it up finally.  I'm using Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't use it hardly ever.  Those two messages that I did receive were a bit of a surprise.  And I want to say one was, hey, are you the only person still using this?  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a new build for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.  The February update, which came out early in February, has a new update, an update to  the update.  Same February 2022 name, but a new version, .004 versus .003.  I don't know if...  I moved to 12L, by the way, finally on my Pixel 6.  I don't know, Andrew.  Oh, I was supposed to do that this weekend.  Yeah, you could just go to the beta page and say yes.  They'll say your Pixel 6 is eligible and just do it.  I haven't had any problems.  So I don't know.  In fact, I was listening all about Android and none of them have had problems with their  Pixel 6s either.  But supposedly there's now the Wi-Fi problem with the update and so forth and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would it be that like ANS operates differently from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I honestly...  I've got...  Nobody agrees with me on this, but I honestly think there's hardware problems.  There's QC problems that some pixels don't work well.  Some pixels.  Mine has worked flawlessly from day one.  Love it.  Burke has Pixel 6 5G problems.  I was able to get that new 5G UC.  Oh, but that was on my T-Mobile.  Never mind.  That was on my...  It's very confusing being here.  It's very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I see the little 5G logo on the phone, I sort of laugh at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, turn off 5G because you'll get battery life anyway.  And I don't know 5G.  In most areas, it's not much faster than LTE.  No.  It's coming.  It's coming.  It's coming.  Do you have it in Canada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but I really would like to have it because...  When it's fast.  I signed up for Starlink and Elon has been hosting me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you on Starlink yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  It said that it was supposed to come within a year and that was about a year and a half ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just checked mine and said someday in 2023, maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Google has introduced Lite Mode for Android.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  They're killing it.  I had never heard about it.  So that's why I thought they were introducing it.  It will be removed.  It's not like Torx Mode, but better.  They are.  Not LRGHT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then they're going to kill it.  They're introducing it.  But then they're going to kill it.  That's the fun part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As usual.  Google has announced with its...  This is from 9to5Google.  With its upcoming Chrome 100 release, the company will discontinue Chrome Lite Mode,  which had been available on Android for years, formerly known as Data Saver.  Maybe you recognize that.  Data Saver.  So if you had a low or limited data connection, you could use that.  Google says, you know, we notice not a lot of people use it anymore.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a meme for reporting these sorts of things.  Google is killing Lite Mode.  In other news, Google had a thing called Lite Mode.  Yes, that's exactly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They also have a password manager in Chrome.  And now you can put notes in there, which is nice.  That's good.  Paralleling kind of the capabilities of other password managers, secure notes.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To remind you of why you made the password?  No, no, but also other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I store my social security number and the family social security numbers in the...  Backs.  It's nice to have a place where you can store secure notes.  I mean, that's what a password manager is good for, but...  Yeah.  If you're using Chrome as your password manager, there you go.  And this is just for Jeff Jarvis.  Google Search's dark theme goes fully black for someone on the web.  It's evil.  More gray.  More black.  Blacker than black.  It's emo.  Yeah.  So...  Sometimes dark mode is just gray, which I like.  I want it to be black because it's better for OLED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's an emo song called...  It has lyric, I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google does say if you're having Wi-Fi issues  with your Pixel 6 that they will fix that in the March update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said that in the February.  I know.  They said the December update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, I know, I know.  And they still mean it.  I know.  Are you ready for a new font?  Roboto Serif.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This disappointed me a little bit.  I'm not a Serif person.  I love Roboto.  That's probably my second favorite font.  After what?  Babus.  Who is this?  Interesting.  B-E-B-A-U-S.  Babus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't tried that one.  I never heard of it.  I'm more of a Garamond guy.  Look it up.  It's beautiful.  It's from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here it is from dafont.com.  Oh, it's nice.  Yeah.  This is the font.  It's beautiful.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  Yeah.  A display font.  Do you use that on your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I just use it for if I'm creating content.  That's the only way I go because it's so readable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what's funny?  I associate it with you.  Seriously.  I said that looks like Ant.  That's it.  I'm a Helvetica fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  You should consider Garamond.  Bless your heart.  Takes me a while.  Garamond too.  It depends on what I'm using it for.  So my literary agency...  Serif fonts should go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like Serif fonts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love Serif fonts.  I love Serif fonts.  My literary agency is the Garamond agency.  And then I had fun telling them actually it's Cloud Garamond  with a T.  And by the way, he didn't really design it.  Somebody else designed it.  But never mind.  I just like to ruin their fun.  It doesn't matter.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  Janssen is my favorite font.  Beautiful.  The first real Roman font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  J-A-N-S-E-N?  That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was getting confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to give you my tip.  This will be a tip.  Janssen.  I like fonts too, but I always...  Programmers want fixed width fonts.  And there's a great...  There's a whole lot of programmer fonts out there.  I guess it's one of the things  programmers do when they're not programming.  They like to design fonts.  Programmingfonts.org.  It's a really great way to look at quite a few fonts  and just kind of compare them side by side.  I wish they had this for all kinds of fonts.  So you can see how they're looking at it.  So you can see...  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  So that's a fun...  I'm an Io Sevka kind of guy.  A lot of people like the Fira code.  It's a pretty good font, but I like Io Sevka.  It's kind of a narrow font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it Garmin?  That wouldn't work in an IDE for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are people who say you should...  There's no need now to use fixed width fonts anymore.  But I just can't code in a...  Regular font.  What's the opposite?  I have to use Comic Sans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't work.  Variable font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a Comic Sans programmers font.  Of course.  Yeah, I think it's called...  What is it called?  Code Sans.  It's really cute.  Here it is.  Well, here's one called Comic Sans.  It seems friendly.  Is that...  It's friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually a great programmers font.  That's meant to be a programmers font, yes.  I like that.  It has found its home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I might be my new font.  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jensen.  Not Jensen.  I was wrong.  Jensen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That does read nicely though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Might change my font to this.  It's pretty.  It's a pretty font.  And that's the Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That segment was for you, Joe Esposito.  Oh yeah, Joe likes that segment.  Yeah, he was...  I was on his podcast a couple of weeks ago and he's a graphics guy so he loves talking...  Oh, he loves talking about fonts.  Yeah.  Jensen.  He's also one of our members.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, welcome.  Good to see you.  Oh, it's an Adobe font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  It's a fascinating font because it became kind of the sword and the stone for later  font designers.  It was the...  It was the one who we believe passed through Gutenberg's workshop on his way to Italy  and there designed this in Venice and it's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a very lovely font.  Jensen.  It reminds me of Garamond a little bit actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, all of them kind of come from Jensen.  It was the first real Roman font and there's this great story about a beautiful font that  was done in copying it for the Dove's Bible.  It was a handmade, magnificent, one of the most beautiful books ever made.  And the designer of the font was so afraid it was going to get misused in other books.  He was an old man.  He took like regular walks to the Thames to throw all of the type in the Thames so it  couldn't be replicated.  And then a later font designer recently decided to try to redesign it and did redesign it,  try to recapture the Dove's font.  And then he hired divers to go into the Thames to find the letters and found them.  Yes.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And thus Comic Sans was born.  Wonderful story.  That's wild.  It got a little soggy.  Yeah, Garamond looks very much like it.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Garamond's a very nice font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I like them both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Oh, yeah, we got nothing of the show today.  It's such a light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on, come on.  What about that story about people's bionic eyes who stop working because they're not  supported by the company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a huge number of people, but imagine getting surgery and spending thousands of  dollars and now gaining some form of sight because of these implants, kind of like cochlear  implants for hearing, bionic eyes.  Then the company goes under.  And then the company goes under.  Your eye stops working.  This is from IEEE Spectrum.  The story starts with Barbara Campbell walking through a New York subway station,  enjoying a nice little walk home.  When her world abruptly went dark, for four years she'd been using a high-tech implant  in her left eye that gave her a crude kind of bionic vision, partially compensating for  the genetic disease that had rendered her completely blind in her 30s.  I remember exactly where I was.  I was switching from the 6 train to the F train.  I was about to go down the stairs.  All of a sudden I heard a little beep, beep, beep sound.  It wasn't her battery running out.  It was her Argus II retinal implant system powering down.  Can you imagine?  Second Sight Medical made these and implanted them in people's eyes 15 years ago,  10 to 15 years ago.  They've been relying on them ever since.  The problem is they've been superseded by better technologies.  However, if you spend a lot of money and got the implant, that's kind of the way you see.  Russ Dorr, another Second Sight patient, said it's a fantastic technology and a lousy company.  It does seem like this is 350 people.  It's not a huge number, but 350 people around the world have these implants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Their lives are profoundly affected.  Some of them think someone could help them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Second Sight discontinued the implant in 2019.  They raised money in 2021, but they changed their focus to a brain implant called Orion.  Maybe don't get Orion, just a little tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the Google of eyes.  We're going to kill the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does raise a really interesting issue.  Now we have these things that we can do, maybe.  I wish Stacey were here because we talk about IoT failing all the time.  This is another kind of IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When a V-Line must get a brain implant and then business goes under.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Once you've got this implanted in your brain, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even to get it taken out is expensive and risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was selling for about $150,000 and still the company was losing money.  Once you get the implant, you still have to learn to see again.  Not suddenly the lights go on.  One Argus II patient estimated the cost of the device surgery and rehab was  close to half a million dollars.  Typically about 80% covered by insurance, but still very, very, very expensive.  It's really an interesting technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know this isn't funny, but Steven Wright used to joke about walking downtown with his  glasses on and then his prescription ran out and he couldn't see anymore.  This is a little worse than the prescription running out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a classic Steven Wright gag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  I haven't heard from Steven Wright in a while.  Is he still around?  Is he dead or Canadian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question.  Yeah, I'm not sure.  Maybe he just stopped being funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He always seemed a little depressed.  His deadpan delivery.  He's still alive.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember he hit on one of my colleagues at People magazine when she interviewed him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's the 15th greatest comic of all time.  Wow, 15th, that's pretty good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who says?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rolling Stone has a list of the 50 greatest stand-up comics.  It was funny.  Did you see the stories about Jerry Lewis being a serial harasser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a notorious bad person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you watched the Cosby series?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I started it so hard to watch.  So difficult to watch.  Hey, I don't have a sample.  I wish I did, but Apple is going to offer a less gendered voice for Siri  in an updated version of iOS 15.4.  Now, as of last year, Siri doesn't default to that female voice we all know.  You can pick your preference.  I actually have a Siri voice that I really like.  Is it you?  No.  Where did you get it?  Apple doesn't give you a choice.  You can't go to outside.  Let me play you the Siri voice that I use because I'm a fan.  I use American Voice 3.  But you have to choose when you first install.  Let me turn the volume up so you can hear it.  So that's the male standard voice.  Kind of jaunty, right?  This is my favorite voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's got a little attitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's what I kind of imagine Salt Hake sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, I'm Siri.  Choose the voice you'd like me to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they actually brought in an LBGTQ Plus voice actor to create a less gendered voice.  Apple confirmed the new voice was recorded by a member of the LBGTQ Plus community,  but did not offer further details.  We're excited to introduce a new Siri voice for English speakers,  giving users more options to choose a voice that speaks to them.  Why does it have to be male or female?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm kind of surprised you can't get celebrity voices.  You did at one point.  Could you?  Not for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon, I have Melissa McCarthy.  I have so many voices.  And you can actually talk so you can say to Samuel L. Jackson,  you tell me the weather, or Melissa McCarthy, you tell me the weather.  I can have both.  But this is interesting.  I don't have the voice yet, but it will be available, I guess, in the next version of iOS.  So fascinating.  Yesterday, AT&T pulled the plug on 3G service, beginning a transition that's going to happen  throughout the year with all the major carriers.  2, 2, 22 for AT&T.  T-Mobile's coming up sometime in July.  And then Verizon at the end of the year.  But a lot of things use 3G still.  Cars, burglar alarms.  As many as 10% of all the public school buses across the country  will lose communication services.  This is the worst one, though.  The Muni in San Francisco.  Had signs that say the next bus will be here in three minutes.  650 prediction display systems at bus shelters rely on AT&G's 3G service.  Stopped working yesterday.  No more.  2 million devices powering burglar alarms and fire alarms will go offline.  This is just AT&T.  That's just AT&T.  But they'll all be going down now over the next few months.  Now we've known about this for a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not unlike the eye story.  It's very similar.  Should there be an obligation to, should you in a way have to put up  a fund of money to keep it going if you choose not to?  Is there some obligation you would have?  I'm waiting for Klobuchar to start doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This also reminds me of the FAA versus FCC battle over altimeters.  Who's responsible for you updating these altimeters so that they  aren't interfered with by 5G signals?  It's complicated.  T-Mobile, Sunset, it's 3G.  July 1st, Verizon, December 31st.  But they're all 3G.  So some people are going to have to get updated hardware.  And I don't know what you do in a car.  The Winter Olympics ratings, terrible.  A new low.  Why?  You think it was politics?  You think it was Beijing?  Hosted by a dictator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so.  I mean, I have to say I found myself in a moral quandary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you?  So what did you?  Okay, well, where did you come out of the quandary?  Now I have to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I watched...  You watched curling.  You had to watch some things with Canadians in them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, and slope stop.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I didn't feel good about it.  Did you guys watch Ant?  Leo, did you watch any Olympics?  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I watched.  Yeah, I like the figure skating.  I watched some of that.  I love seeing people strap themselves to metal platforms and slide down ice at 80 miles an hour.  So I watched the luge, the bobsled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A guy said he liked watching all of the Winter Olympic sports.  The one where you hurl yourself down a hill on one piece of wood.  The one where you hurl yourself down a hill on two pieces of wood.  Love those.  And the one where you hurl yourself down a hill inside a piece of wood.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I watched exactly two female bobsledders.  That's it.  That's all I watched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know which ones you watched though.  Because those are good.  Those are exciting when the former Canadian who got dissed by her Canadian coaches  and switched to America and she got a gold medal.  Yeah.  Hey, take that Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say that did you guys watch any hockey?  No.  Negative.  So that there was a quote unquote Chinese hockey team and it was 80% Americans and Canadians  and they didn't even have to make them citizens.  They just gave them fake Chinese names which the announcers then didn't use.  No.  Oh man.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was just a travesty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also think the IOC's complete, you know, just letting them off the hook of the Russian  Olympic Committee slash Russia.  It's crazy.  I mean, it's not even a slap on the wrist.  Oh, you can't compete under your flag.  You just be the ROC.  And oh, you're 16 year olds on heart medication, performance enhancing drugs.  Well, I guess we can't play the national anthem if she wins a medal.  But she can still compete.  But she can still compete.  You know, I think that tarnishes the whole thing to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a joke.  Good old IOC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to go to Qatar for the FIFA the World Cup, another upstanding fine country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then you have golf.  What's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mickelson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mickelson.  What happened?  That was pretty.  So he, Mickelson, who makes a fortune in golf, came out and said that he was going to support  a Saudi backed.  Oh, right.  A new league that would compete at Donald Trump's clubs.  And yeah, he acknowledged the Saudis are bad and they kill reporters.  They do terrible things.  But we got to shake up the PGA.  Give it 24 hours that he has to apologize for all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, that was the thing about these guys on the Chinese, quote unquote, hockey team.  A couple of them said, yeah, I'm proud to represent China.  I'm like, really?  You're proud to represent China?  Like, have you read any of the news or why not just say I really want to be in the Olympics?  I really want to be in the Olympics.  I don't care who I represent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I understand the qualms about Mickelson, but you know, the sovereign fund of Saudi Arabia  funds many of the technology companies in Silicon Valley.  I mean, nobody's trumpeting this, but they're big investors in Silicon Valley.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know companies that can only get the money from there and they made a decision and said,  okay, we'll take the money and we'll try to make something good out of it.  Yeah.  But yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's getting harder and harder in this world to have a moral standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And have any money.  And have any money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, you can do that.  You can be poor and have a moral standard.  Probably going to be broke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's what finally changed Phil Mickelson's mind is long time sponsor.  The money.  He said, hey, we're not going to sponsor you anymore.  And he said, oh, you know, this was a terrible idea.  I changed my mind.  I changed my mind.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John Cena, I think it was had to apologize for suggesting that Taiwan was a country.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he even apologized in Mandarin, correct?  In Mandarin, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's getting, yeah.  Is that what they call situational ethics?  No comment.  I think it's called covering your ass.  I think it's appropriate to have, I think it's appropriate to consider the situation  in your ethics, but at the same time, you got to have a moral compass that stands up  to the winds a breeze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm prepared to have ethics, but as long as it doesn't cost me.  They're expensive ethics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so expensive.  This looks like a Jeff Jarvis keyboard that makes my hands hurt.  Just looking at it.  Oh, that is terrible.  Isn't that awful?  It's ergonomic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's like, it's like real.  It's being sold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course it's real because that's good for you.  Oh, God, no.  That's ergonomic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get a headache looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just never move your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the Salvador Dali keyboard.  It's melting.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it leaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's leaking.  Now I want to, it's the Angry Meow.  Or Mio.  Angry Meow's Amhatsu.  It's a wireless ortho linear split ergo keyboard with an aluminum body.  Ortho linear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's ortho 6.1.  I like it better now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it will, it's wireless charging.  But if you want for an additional $380, you can get the company Cybermat, which charges it  automatically.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or you can buy batteries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they'll throw in one of Amazon's robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, it is Angry Meow as in cat because look at their logo.  It's a cat's paw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did it have another view of it other than top down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's go to the website.  Maybe the Angry Meow website will have more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the time we're done, Leo's going to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's probably a Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sites not coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've slashed out.  There it is.  Here we go.  Wireless charging, connect, split ergo.  Oh yeah, you're right.  That's painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who knows?  300 people may like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a very personal decision, your keyboard.  What do you use, Ant?  Do you have a special kind of keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I go back and forth between just a standard Cyberpower,  keyboard, and this MX keys from Logitech.  I do like this a lot when the Bluetooth acts like it has a brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an article from The Verge from last week.  Designers spend months making custom keycaps.  Then the counterfeits arrive.  Talks about an artist named Olivia Briggs who designs these beautiful  keyboards, the colors and all that.  And then of course, before she can even produce them,  there are Chinese clones that are available.  How about this?  Would you like that with no letters on it?  Oh, I like that.  Isn't that pretty?  It's art.  A work of art, but I don't know if I could type on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who here is a touch typist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nope.  None of you?  Wow.  I look down every now and then because I have hotkeys for stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I'm in Premiere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was stuck in the jungle gym when they taught typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'm a touch typist in the sense that I touch the keyboard when I type.  Yeah, me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are some passwords I can't type if I look down,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I can type it with my eyes closed without a problem.  I've noticed that.  Yeah, me too.  At the same time, there are certain, those F keys up there,  I don't always know where they are and they're useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody gets those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I only use four fingers, but I can go really fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they didn't teach the Palmer method.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My excuse was I moved in the middle of it a few times  and my eye ray is just off.  My parents insisted that I take typing lessons before the seventh grade.  You should have become a doctor.  Yeah.  Well, my family was all doctors before my mother married an engineer.  I was fortunate to have a computer in our home in my 10th grade on up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some old, I think it was,  something other and had a typing tutor on it.  I played around with that because it was like a video game.  And 11th and 12th grade of high school, I took typing class and I'm really glad I did,  even though I was the only guy in there.  Because when I went to college, I made extra money typing papers for my idiot teammates.  They didn't know how to type.  Smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they do Mavis Beacon or did you do something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was something else.  I did hear of Mavis Beacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, she taught probably more geeks how to type than anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wrote papers for people, but they had to type them themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wrote them by hand.  Long form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not have to use a typewriter for those classes,  but my mother and grandmother had typewriters and I did type on them just  at my leisure from time to time.  And that was the hardest thing because it's like you need biceps on your fingers to type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love this.  The strongest man we know is complaining how hard it is to type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe he doesn't do finger exercises.  Yeah, I don't exercise my fingers.  There's no lifting for fingers.  Jesus, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When have you gone to a gym and seen someone doing finger curls, man?  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have a dream about I want to get an old, like a really old typewriter and hook it up  to the computer.  I know you can do that.  Underwood?  Yeah, an old Underwood because I've got a bunch of old Underwoods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.  So you know there's no real Mavis Beacon anymore than there's a real Betty Crocker.  What?  The original photo of Mavis Beacon.  Let me see if I can find one.  Here it is.  She's a Caribbean model named Esperance, but the name Mavis Beacon comes from talk show  host Les Crane.  Remember Les Crane?  Negative.  No.  He discovered Esperance, Renée L'Esperance.  While he was shopping at Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills,  Les Crane was then a partner in a company called The Software Tool Works.  He said, we're going to take a picture of you, put your picture on the cover of our  new typing tutor, and we're going to call you Mavis Beacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope she made money for this.  So we don't have to pay you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they paid it for her image.  Although, you know, her image is in a lot of the boxes ever since.  So maybe that, you know, let me see if she's still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope she got her royalty.  I hope she did.  Yeah, see, she's still on the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  100 bucks.  She's still on the box.  There she is.  The anniversary edition.  40 bucks.  They still sell it.  They still sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like her real name better.  Yeah, Les Crane.  Yeah, me too.  She's made real money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Here she is.  I wonder if she could type.  Wouldn't that be ironic?  Now, if she couldn't type.  Yeah, I can't type, but I can pose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I came across a, speaking of photos of people, I came across a fascinating story.  I can't remember how long ago a woman did a photo shoot and got paid for it.  And then I think it was a couple of years later, her friends started saying, I saw your photo.  And she had become a stock photo.  And so she showed up in like everything from, you know, taco, taco ads to like,  and so she started seeing billboards of herself.  You know, web ads of herself.  And she got like a hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, no royalties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait here, Matthew.  Pronounce T-A-C-O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Taco.  What did he say?  Taco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said taco.  Taco.  I don't think I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think I did.  I think if you rewind the tape, you'll find I didn't say that.  Check the tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm just asking, is that the Canadian way to say it or?  T-A-C-O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we don't talk about them up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, last week was it was a day I learned I didn't know that in French,  Vladimir Putin is spelled French fries and cheese curds and gravy.  Poutine?  It's spelled Poutine in French.  I did not know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Vladimir Poutine.  I'm going to call him Poutine from now on.  That's good.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a popular name in Canada to call him Poutine.  Poutine.  Just to make fun of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fabrizio Rinaldi.  I love that name.  Has created a new way to tweet typefully profiles.  They give new life to your tweets and threads,  turning them into a beautiful blog automatically, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you can do it right here in front of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should I do it?  I've set up my typefully account.  I'm just going to start.  I've set up my typefully account.  So let's edit in high fidelity mode.  It's dark mode though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're ruining it with dark mode.  Jeez.  It's called typefully?  Typefully.  Yeah.  Typefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't want it to connect to my Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to create an account just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are many like it,  but this tweet is mine.  I don't know.  I don't get it.  Did you put this in here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.  Because actually what it does instead is it imports all of your tweets  and then makes them...  You can put threads in there and make them posts to make them pretty.  I started doing it and I got distracted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I should import my...  I should import my tweets, I think.  Yes, that's what I was trying to do.  Let me press the import from Twitter.  Loading your recently posted tweets and threads.  Okay.  And then it gives you...  It's just a better editor.  I think that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, an edit display.  So publish tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is 10 years ago I wrote this.  I wrote, the first person who will walk on Mars is probably a high school student  watching this right now.  No more true then than it is today.  Tweet it.  Tweet it.  Publish tweet.  Okay.  It's published.  Add it to your profile.  So now you have your profile.  There it is.  10 years ago today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't really get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't get it either.  I put this here, I don't get it.  Let's view it on Twitter.  Does it look prettier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not in dark mode.  Nothing looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the original tweet.  Apparently I was using something called Oosfora to tweet.  I don't know what that is.  Back in 2012.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did it pick that one up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, nothing went out again on your feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I feel bad because astronaut Abby answered me 10 years ago.  You should have me on your show.  I will be the first astronaut on Mars.  And I didn't pay any attention to her.  You never responded.  Look at you.  And won't I feel terrible if she is?  She's an author.  She's an author.  She's a scientist.  She's a pilot and aspiring astronaut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo.  You ignored her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I just ignored her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tweet her back right now.  Tweet her back right now.  Apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to say, I'm sorry.  I saw your tweet 10 years later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Please don't judge me.  What you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey.  So it's funny because she does want to be one of those people on Mars.  And you know what?  She's probably going to.  I'm going to give her that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She would have had a better shot at it if you made her famous.  I wouldn't even have known about it except for typefully.

Transcript:  Thank you typefully.  She's a great follow on Twitter.  ScooterX knows who she is.  Wow.  So I should tweet back and say sorry for the delay.  Yes, you really should.  I'm so sorry.  I just now got your tweet.  The mail's been slow.  Hello.  You're on Mars, I could say.  Wow.  No, that's embarrassing.  Have you seen the rover?  Are you on Mars?  Did you get there?  I could say that.  Did you get there?  I'm just checking back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's living in a trailer somewhere.  She gave up after you didn't respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's right.  That's right.  No, no.  She didn't.  Far from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's done a lot more since.  She lost her will to live.  Yeah.  So I don't know, understand typefully at all.  You put that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to look at it.  I put it in and then a squirrel went by and then I didn't come back to it.  Yeah.  That's pretty much the story of this rundown.  Well, it is.  I got to say.  Normally I think, is this for a top story?  Is this a quick take?  Now, is this good enough for other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just like a salad in here.  It's just like there's fruits and nuts and flakes and I don't know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Reddit's five community values.  Now there is.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are there five of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Published there are five community values.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see what they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember the human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember the human.  Empower communities.  Keep Reddit real.  Privacy is a right.  Believe in the good.  I like it.  I'm going for it.  I'll say I agree.  This comes from Steve Huffman who's wrote Reddit in the first in the early days.  Found it with Alexis Ohanian and has came back as CEO a couple of years ago.  And I think he's done a good job.  Reddit is still my favorite social media platform.  I don't post there, but I read only.  We respect Redditor.  That's good.  Good for you, Steve.  And it's about to go public.  Okay.  Ah, Condi's going to spin it off.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Condi already kind of spun it off and created created equity,  but now they're going to actually go public.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  TikTok can circumvent all the privacy, all the privacy protections on Apple's iOS,  on Android.  This is from two different studies that were conducted last year.  Didn't Trump warn of this?  Yeah, he was right.  TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, ByteDance.  This comes from The Wrap.  According to summaries of two major studies obtained by The Wrap,  conducted by White Hat security experts that hack for the public good.  It's interesting.  The program's written in kind of an unusual way that help it avoid code audits on the  Apple and Google app stores.  The research found TikTok's capable of changing the app's behavior  as it places without users' knowledge and utilizes device tracking that essentially  gives the company and third parties an all-access pass to user data.  This is highly unusual, they write, and exceeds the abilities of US-based apps  such as Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms.  Frank Lockerman is a cyber threat engineer at Conquest Cyber, a cybersecurity firm,  who reviewed the studies.  He said, these dynamic properties, the way this is coded allows TikTok  carte blanche to access your device within the scope of what the application can see.  The TikTok browser not only has access to convert from web to device,  but also has the ability to query things on the device itself.  TikTok says that this is standard for social media apps,  but both the researchers and independent experts who reviewed the research say the app's code  makes it much harder to monitor.  So, consequentially, just because the app doesn't do something bad today  doesn't mean it can't do or won't do bad things in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could say that about any app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, except the TikTok is apparently, if this is to be believed,  designed in such a way that it can modify itself on the fly.  TikTok says, we work with the ethical hacker community through HackerOne,  which is a bug hunt service.  Uh, you know, it's funny, you see these stories and I don't, I just don't know.  I don't know who this cybersecurity firms are.  I don't know who the firms reviewing it are.  I don't even know who the rap is.  So, the rap is a Hollywood thing.  Yeah.  So, I don't have the expertise to really vet this.  So, I don't know.  But, you know, I would hope, I mean, what happened to all that?  Weren't we supposed to like review this and the commerce department?  Weren't they supposed to get back to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was December, right?  Something like that.  Yeah.  It all turned into nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2020, turned into nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  December of 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oracle was going to buy them.  Yeah.  Never mind.  Never mind.  Smoke and mirrors.  We talked on Sunday and I want to kind of, just kind of keep aware of all of this.  The US intelligence community is saying, we're okay.  Mandy and who consults on this good security firm said, just keep your guard up.  We're okay.  But there's some concern that there'll be back splash from the Russia-Ukraine war,  especially with sanctions from the West on Russia, that Russia might use  its cyber warfare capabilities against the West.  And there's some concern, I think, that this could be the first cyber war.  Russia has used-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I hear stuff like that, I wonder, okay, who are they attacking?  Are they just attacking like SSA?  Well, there's lots of things they could do.  I mean-  Ant Pruitt in general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not you, Ant, but maybe your grocery store or your power company or the stock market.  They have these capabilities.  They did a DDoS attack on the financial services in Ukraine last week.  Seventy-  It's estimated 75% of all ransomware comes out of Russia.  And the question is, does Putin know about it?  Or not?  Now he's going to hit me, isn't he?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's just call them cheese curds and gravy.  Oh boy, my email just went down.  Yeah, sorry, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So-  My lights are flickering.  Article in the New York Times this week about Kazakhstan.  In Kazakhstan-  As a warning and a lesson.  As a warning and a lesson.  They blocked the internet.  The government, in the face of protests over rising energy costs,  blocked the internet.  First, they tried to ban access to some news sites, social networks, and messaging services.  Then, as activists bypassed those curves of software that masked their locations,  these authorities shut down almost all connectivity in the country.  Payment apps, point of sales machines, ATMs, all going down.  Families could not communicate with loved ones.  Taxi drivers who relied on ride-hailing apps said they can't drive.  It's impossible to communicate.  The lack of information multiplied the chaos and disinformation,  according to the New York Times.  This week, the Ukrainian government said the websites of two banks,  its Ministry of Defense, and its armed forces have been briefly taken offline  by a series of denial of service attacks.  That's kind of what Russia's been doing to the Ukraine for years,  which is these little probes.  Not necessarily long-term shutdowns, but little probes,  which our intelligence services say are rehearsals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I just...  They also went after social media.  When I went to Ukraine, Russian actors would use social media rules against  legitimate actors in Ukraine and just mess with them to get them taken down off Facebook.  Facebook didn't have people who spoke Ukrainian and understood the subtleties of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's apparently quite a social media front, effectively.  The Russians using sort of dummy accounts and trolls and astroturfing.  They're posting what appear to be faked videos of shelling that they claim is occurring.  Right.  It's their...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Matthew, are you, as a journalism man,  are you as upset as I am that all the news networks are using Russian propaganda video as B-roll?  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's pretty reprehensible.  Do they identify as such?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it's a little tiny thing at the top, but you don't know,  like, oh, that's really going on, a lot of tanks coming in.  Yeah, it's...  They could go to Belly and Cat and get actual video.  People are really shooting in Russia.  This gets verified, but this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not going to get the masses to respond, Mr. Jarvis.  That's not going to get everybody...  I know.  Oh, hey, that's cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And?  There was a little clip of these two Russian guys ducking and running and covering,  and this alleged shell goes off and it looks like a firework, like some kid, basically,  let off, but they're pretending that the whole town is under attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that is news, isn't it?  Anybody who's been in a natural disaster knows that it looks a lot worse on TV than it does.  All right, I just had something to be aware of, and we'll keep our eye peeled, but  I wouldn't put it past Russians to do some sort of collateral attack on the West.  Cyber attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you remember the story about the guy who was hacked by North Korea?  Yes.  Took down their internet?  Yes.  That was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, one guy took down the whole Korean internet.  Admittedly, they don't have the best...  No.  Yeah, they don't have the best...  Full hearted take our internet down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, let's take a break and come back with your picks of the week  as we wrap the slowest week in history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We haven't even gotten a summer yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is scary.  Yeah.  Well, it just sometimes happens.  Maybe it's my fault.  I don't know.  I blame myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think war has something to do with it.  You think that, yeah, nobody...  As always, I go through, I search on all the company's names in news.  I look at Axios, I look at Benedict Evans, I look all over just because this is my discipline  to be able to keep up on technology news.  When I find stuff, I put it in the rundown, irritating you.  That's my fringe benefit is that it irritates you.  And so, yeah, I couldn't find a thing.  It was boring as heck out there without you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jason says he's scoured.  He's scoured.  It's just been slow.  That's not that much to say.  That's okay.  We don't have to always...  Pick some stuff up.  Yeah.  Well, what do you think we've been doing for the last hour and a half?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what the news is doing.  We go off on tangents about fonts.  I was struggling.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Struggling.  The more tangent the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Normally, Leo would have yelled at me for bringing in Nicholas Jameson from 1730  but no, today he was glad to have some more words to finish the show.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm glad we had a keyboard that makes your hands hurt just looking at it.  I'm glad, I tells you.  Yeah.  Thrilled.  Couldn't be happier that we have a Twitter prettifier that doesn't seem to do anything  at all except find 10-year-old tweets.  I'm glad, I tells you.  Thank goodness.  Our show today brought to you by Imperfect Foods.  Actually, Thursday is my big day.  Thursday, our box comes from Imperfect Foods.  I just look forward to it all week long.  It is such a great source of grocery.  It's a grocery delivery service that's unlike any other.  It helps you fight food waste.  A huge amount of food in this country is thrown out or fed to the hogs  or just rotting on the vine because it's not perfect.  Because the apples are a little too small or the chicken's breasts are a little too small.  In fact, I love my heritage chickens from Imperfect Foods.  They're fantastic.  Combating climate change feels big.  It feels overwhelming.  What can one person do?  Well, you can start by doing your shopping with Imperfect Foods.  They offer an entire line of sustainable groceries.  It starts with the fruits and vegetables.  Stuff that is actually great.  It's delicious.  It's super fresh.  Grocers just reject it because all the apples have to be the same size.  The pomegranates have to be as big as your fist.  So these just fall through the cracks.  I think, honestly, a lot of times the smaller vegetables,  smaller fruits are better tasting.  They're kind of traditional.  They're old-fashioned.  They're not these crazy hybrids.  But then there's more because Imperfect Foods also  has all of the other grocery products you might buy.  And you might say, well, what's imperfect about them?  Well, there's nothing imperfect about any of them except that these are,  again, overages.  There's too much of them.  People don't buy as many of the heritage chickens as they will of the big birds.  Oh, man, we had a heritage chicken last night.  It was so good.  They got all sorts of stuff.  Yogurt-covered pretzels with sprinkles, man.  Eat delicious food and feel good about it.  First of all, I should have said this right up front.  Check to see if they deliver in your area.  They do not deliver everywhere.  Go to Imperfectfoods.com and enter in your zip code.  See if they deliver in your area.  If they do, then you can personalize your weekly grocery order,  fresh seasonal produce, pantry staples, yummy snacks.  Your order will arrive on the same day every week.  As I said, ours is Thursday.  One of the reasons, actually, the main reason they do that is to combine all deliveries  into one so that they save gas as well.  In fact, Imperfect delivers weekly on purpose by neighborhood  to produce 25 to 75% fewer emissions  than if we were all to go on individual trips to the grocery store.  So it's the same day every week, which is great.  You can go online.  You can say, I want this.  I want that.  I want less of this, whatever.  On average, Imperfect Foods customers save six to eight pounds of food with every order.  Food waste is a disaster in this country.  So do something about it.  Do something about it.  Plus, you could say goodbye.  I know one of the things I don't like about the delivery service is  we had a grocery store.  We used to get stuff from a local grocery store  and then we'd come with dozens of plastic bags.  Say goodbye to packaging guilt.  Imperfect Foods is the only national grocery delivery company  that makes it easy to return your packaging after every order.  I collapse the box, leave it on the porch.  They pick it up when they come get the next one.  They don't use a lot of plastic.  It's cardboard boxes.  They make it as simple and easy as possible  so you don't feel guilty about wasting packaging material either.  They take it all back.  Right now Imperfect Foods is offering listeners 20% off your first four orders  when you go to ImperfectFoods.com and use the promo code TWIG.  We've been very happy.  We've been doing this now for some months.  Very, very happy.  Love the broccoli.  I don't know what it is.  Their broccoli is so good.  20% off your first four orders up to an $80 value.  ImperfectFoods.com when you use the promo code TWIG.  Their hamburger.  We only use their hamburger now.  It's incredible.  Join the movement.  ImperfectFoods.com.  Do use that promo code TWIG to get 20% off your first four orders  up to the $80 value.  ImperfectFoods.com.  I think they're perfect, personally.  I think they got the wrong name.  But I got the idea.  ImperfectFoods.com.  Remember that name.  Please use the promo code TWIG so they know you saw it here.  Matthew, did we steal one of your picks of the week?  Well, you got two.  Actually, I've got two.  I want to talk about the first one because we talked about the marshmallow test  on Sunday, coincidentally.  Really?  Okay.  Yes.  So apparently, what?  It's bogus?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  In fact, one of the guys who was involved in the original research that led to  everyone thinking that would determine your child's life was involved in this  attempt to replicate the research.  And it appears to have no predictive value whatsoever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So tell us, how did the marshmallow test work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the marshmallow test, I'm probably going to get this wrong, but  the sort of short version is you would ask kids...  Four and five year olds, little preschoolers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do you want a marshmallow now or you can have two marshmallows when I come back?  And then the person would say, I'm going to leave the room.  You can have a marshmallow now or you can have two when I come back later.  And the theory behind the research was kids who said, no, I would like two later  were better at sort of thinking about the future instead of just wanting marshmallows now.  And that translated into more success and more sort of that they would have better lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Translated into crypto miners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The context we used, I think it was Amy Webb used it on Twitter, was just this idea of delayed  gratification that we're not very good.  We're impulsive.  Give me the marshmallow now.  I'm not going to wait for two.  But that hasn't been debunked.  Just the idea that that's predictive on the outcomes as kids grow up  of what they're going to be like.  The original study said kids who couldn't hold out long,  generally grew through their teens, 20s and 30s quicker to frustrate, weaker in academic  and social skills, more drug use, mental health and weight issues.  No, not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is kids who quickly gave in to marshmallow temptation and said,  give me the damn marshmallow right now are generally no more or less financially secure,  no more or less educated or physically healthy than their more patient peers.  No relationship with BMI.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Marshmallows suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any kid who wants a marshmallow has no taste.  You know what?  They should have used something really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should want Reese's Pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like candy corn.  That's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh Reese's Pieces.  Yeah, candy corn.  Yeah, candy corn.  Crack.  Give them some crack.  See how long they hold out.  Yeah, now we're talking.  Initially the study wasn't to see the longitudinal effects, right?  They were more interested in how kids managed to defer the gratification and things like that.  And I think some of that stuff is still applicable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The interesting thing is this is kind of dictated, or it's been a shorthand for 30 years.  It's not like this just came around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's so much like that in social sciences.  There's so much, you know, the Dunbar number.  And people like Malcolm Gladwell made millions writing books with really kind of flawed  assumptions and things.  Do you remember Stockholm Syndrome?  Yeah, that doesn't exist either?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, so I read this long piece debunking it that the whole concept was invented by a  cop who was mad that the hostages wouldn't turn in there.  Holocaust stuff, right?  No, no, no, no.  The people who were, no it was bank robbers I think.  But he was just mad that these female hostages weren't cooperating with him.  And so he effectively created this idea of Stockholm Syndrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were held hostage for six days.  And so his theory is, oh, you know, basically because they were held hostage for six days,  they became loyal to the hostage taker.  But really it was just they didn't want to talk to him.  It was Patty Hearst.  Was it Patty Hearst originally or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was an argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the argument for her later.  So that's not true either.  There's probably a lot of that stuff out there.  But don't use marshmallow tests.  Moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm too slow on it.  There you go.  That was pretty quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's whole books written on this stuff and wow.  Jeff Jarvis, do you have a number for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you know, everybody thinks the kids today are just dumb and they do all these stupid  things on TikTok.  And somebody tells them to do stupid stuff on TikTok.  But Lifehacker put together a nice summary of dumb things that we did in our day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  13 challenges that prove older generations were as stupid as TikTok teens.  Streaking was big when I was in college.  Did you?  Yeah, we had mass streaks.  This is a Yale University freshman year.  The entire freshman old campus took off their clothes and ran around naked while the campus  cops tried to do what?  I don't know.  Stop it.  And in fact, I got caught.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  I'm running around naked.  Oh, mom.  I'm running around naked.  No, wait a minute.  And I see that they're starting to bust people.  I ran into my dorm building, Durfee Hall on the old campus.  Start running up the stairs.  Here was my mistake tactical error.  I thought on the second floor, I'm safe.  So I stuck my ass out the window.  I thought I'd moon the cops.  I gave them enough time to catch me.  But then they made a tactical error because they asked me for ID.  I don't have any.  Your honor, I am naked.  And as far as you're concerned, I don't even go to school here.  Thank you very much.  I could be anyone.  So yeah, you're right.  I didn't need TikTok to do something dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's next in here?  Evil Knievel.  That's pretty obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're still jumping over.  Whole cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tide pods, I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Flagpole sitting.  Well, that goes back to Stylates.  Yeah, back in the Roman era.  Ancient Greece.  Goldfish swallowing.  Or I think next is going to be phone booth stuffing, I'm guessing.  Here's the streaker at the Oscars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of marshmallows, do you remember the Chubby Bunny challenge?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the Chubby Bunny challenge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I had never heard of this, but a couple people have actually died  stuffing their mouths with marshmallows and you have to try and get as many in as you can.  I'm telling you, marshmallows are awful.  Peeps.  People have died doing that?  Chubby Bunny.  Yeah, because they suffocate, basically.  Yeah, it's not good.  So don't do it.  Peeps.  Isn't it Peeps here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, panty raids.  Remember panty raids?  Panty raids was big in the 50s.  Yeah, young men, usually frat boys, running around trying to get into girls' rooms and  take their panties.  I remember those.  When I was a kid, we lived in the female dorms at Brown University.  Brown University at the time was segregated and we lived where the girls, where the women  lived and there were constant panty raids.  Constant.  No, I had nothing to do with it.  I was only eight.  The jaw wiring challenge in the 70s and 80s.  People were wiring their jaws.  I remember that to lose weight.  That was a terrible idea.  The limping challenge.  Adopting a bizarre fashion because I'm famous to do it first.  Back in the 1860s, women from London to Edinburgh began limping.  They called it the Alexandra limp because Alexandra of Denmark, the pride of the Prince  of Wales, was left with a limp by an illness in 1867.  But because she was so famous and stylish with her ornate walking sticks, others copied her.  I did hear once, I don't know if this is true, that that's why Castilian Spanish  has a lisp.  Really?  Because the monarch had a lisp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've always wondered that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find the genesis of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like the marshmallows things, it's going to prove not to be true,  but you've always believed it, but that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is it true, according to the Guardian, is it true the pronunciation of Spanish changed  because the King had a lisp?  So Barcelona, it is widely told but cannot be genuine because if it were,  S would be lisp as well, but only C and Z are.  Good point.  Great point.  It's because they speak Catalan and Catalan does not have a C, it's pronounced as a F.  So that was, yes, another apocryphal myth.  Nothing is true.  Nothing is true.  What else?  I'm going to go back to these challenges from Lifehacker.  You know that Gina Tripani founded Lifehacker, so we have a license to quote that.  That's right.  Quote Lifehacker.  The macaroni challenge, that's from Yankee Doodle, stuck a feather in his cap, called it macaroni.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Macaroni was very bougie food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's right.  Here's the phone booth cramming challenge.  People actually did this.  They tried to get as many college kids in a phone booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's a phone booth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they would still be doing that if they could get a phone booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's where they had the Wi-Fi today.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, that's the phone booth stuff and challenge.  Oh yeah, of course, dance marathon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think people died doing that, or at least became.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Became kind of a sick.  They shoot horses, don't they?  Remember that?  Right, exactly.  Movie with, was it Jane Fawn?  It was in the, they shoot horses, don't they?  About dance marathons, the poison eye drop challenge.  Let's not.  I don't think I want to know about this one.  What?  That's using Belladonna.  Anyway, there you go.  13 stupid things previous generations have done, even without TikTok, so there's no excuse.  See?  Yeah.  Aunt Pruitt, what's your thing?  I don't remember.  It is the, it is the Andy, Andy Ciney, Andy Ciney, Magnelenium case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  What is this?  This one, this, this came from that rascal known as old doctor.  I was talking.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Andy Ciney lunchbox.  If you have an Atomos Ninja video monitor to record externally.  Yes.  Well, if you need more storage, you probably have something like this here.  I have this Samsung T5 SSD.  I have one of those.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ridiculously cheap per gigabyte versus everything else that's out there.  Yeah.  Well, you can cannibalize one of these and put it in the lunchbox and mount it  to the back of your video monitor to give you way more storage to record raw footage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so you would hook it up to your Atomos.  Yeah.  Smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just take it out.  It's got a little video there.  You just take the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that a proprietary interface on the Atomos?  Is that why you have to buy something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it just uses the standard-  Is this USB?  It's SSD stuff.  Okay, cool.  But I saw that and I was like, dude, that's brilliant because those AngelBird cards,  they're expensive.  Expensive, yeah.  Do you have an Atomos Ninja?  Do you have one of those?  No, I don't.  I don't have to worry about recording raw externally as my camera does it internally,  so I'm fine.  But I know a couple of people and they bought all of those AngelBird cards and they spent  a great gazillion dollars and then they lose one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you've got one of those Samsungs, this thing's only $30 is the case.  I could scavenge.  I have some old, the old Samsungs I could probably scavenge.  It's pretty slick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought that was a great idea for 30 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And lastly, because I'm always late to watching all of the hot television shows,  which I've probably seen a gazillion times,  I started watching Welcome to Earth on, I think it's Disney Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't seen it either, but I've heard very good.  This is Will Smith's show, right?  Yeah, with Will Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I started watching it like two weeks ago.  I turned it on one Saturday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, I can't watch.  Oh, I'm so scared of heights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, it's great.  I turned it on one Saturday afternoon and I had to stop it as soon as I turned it on  because I was like, my family's going to sit down and watch this too.  It's beautiful.  The sound design is great.  The story is great.  I was like, we're going to wait until it's dark and we can turn all the lights out  and have a nice theater experience with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm so jealous of Will Smith that he gets to do stuff like this and he gets paid for it.  It's so jealous.  That's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a really, really good show.  Really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, really neat.  Welcome to Earth.  I'll watch it.  Thank you for the recommendation.  Was it Disney Plus?  It's Disney Plus.  Yes, it's Disney Plus.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watch now, are we done with people in heights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you better not.  He's climbing down a glacier right now.  Oh, it's a long way down.  Are there any bridges in this?  No, that's the worst part.  They don't have no bridges.  You just got to go, man.  You got to walk across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, they went up a dad gum volcano.  Oh, stop it.  Just making so much noise and rumbling.  Dad gum volcano.  One of the guys going up the volcano is blind.  Geez.  Crazy.  It's such a good show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I am ordering this, so I won't have a review yet,  but this is a little $350.  Zoom is doing better and better stuff.  I got the podcast, the P4 podcasting thing for my kid,  but I'm thinking I've got microphones.  I should just carry this around.  It's the size of like an Altoids tin.  It's got two mic interfaces.  Small enough you could strap it to your boom  or put it on your camera even.  See, there it is right in the back of the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dude, you know that's going to sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have very good DACs, very good amplifiers.  Obviously microphone not included.  Runs on two AA batteries, eight hours of recording time.  I think this is really an interesting idea.  Yeah, you could wear it on your wrist.  What's the price on it?  I'm more and more thinking about how I could do what we do  kind of on the road, on the fly, traveling around  and stuff like that.  And I think this would be a good thing to have my kid  with an inexpensive like a Shure microphone.  It uses micro SD cards.  So yeah, you can record hundreds of hours worth of stuff.  Those are a down a dozen.  Yeah, yeah.  If it weren't for the size of the plugs, it'd be even smaller.  Yeah, I know.  It's the plugs.  And I love this.  There's an actual wave form, real time wave form on the front.  So you can see also it has anti clipping technology.  So you can't overdrive it.  So you can see the wave form as it's recording,  which is a really great way of doing that set of meters.  I like that price.  I'm all about audio, as you know.  And so this would be cool.  This would be cool.  Zoom Corp.com, not Zoom the, you know, conference and software.  Yeah.  You can also use it as an audio interface into your computer.  So if you want to have make your mic a USB mic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the thing, because their previous models,  I think like two models before that, they were great.  But after about, I think it was about 20 minutes or so,  you had issues with drifting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's always a problem, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Regardless of how you set it up, far as the frame rate,  it just still continued to drift.  So a lot of people went away from it, but that looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This apparently has some sort of time code system in it,  which would help with the drift.  I don't, I can't remember reading about that.  Let me see if I can.  180 hours of recording if you got a terabyte SD card.  So these cards get bigger and bigger.  Man, tackle AA batteries.  Well, I ordered one so we can.  The other thing I ordered, Doc Rock pick of the week  from yesterday on MacBreak Weekly.  I think you'd be interested in this.  It's a device that you attach to your camera via USB.  And it works with your cameras, works with a big variety of cameras.  Let me see the name.  I'll look it up because I can't remember.  He always has nice pick.  Was it Doc Rock?  No.  Oh shoot, it's not in his picks.  Maybe he was just talking about it.  What was the name of that thing, folks?  Do you remember what he was talking about?  Chat Rooms is.  Yeah.  They're emptying your trash.  I can hear it in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried to mute it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well.  Oh, what was the?  Oh, well anyway, I'll save that for another day.  When it comes, then it's better.  I can show you and all that stuff.  I'll show you the F3 when that or the F6 when that comes.  Thank you.  You survived two and a half hours of nothing.  Absolutely nothing.
