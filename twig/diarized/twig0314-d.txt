Transcript:  It's time for twig this week in Google Jeff Jarvis is here Matt cuts is to from Google and we're going to talk about all sorts  Of things including I think a very interesting conversation about Larry pages motivations  Why does he do what he does? We'll talk about it next on twig

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Netcasts you love from people you trust

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is twit  Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly ca ch e fl y.com  This is twig this week in Google episode 314 recorded Wednesday August 19th  2015 no more wet napkins  This week in Google is brought to you by fresh books the super simple cloud accounting software  It's giving thousands of freelancers and small businesses the tools to save time billing and get paid faster  Try it free at fresh books comm slash twig and by  Legal zoom protect your family with a last will or living trust today  Legal zoom is not a law firm but can connect you with an independent attorney  Visit legal zoom comm and use the offer code twig in the referral box at checkout for your special discount and by  Smart things smart things lets you monitor control and secure your home from wherever you are  Using your smartphone right now smart things is offering this week in Google listeners 10% off any featured smart things kit and  Free shipping in the US when you go to smart things comm slash twig and use the offer code twig at checkout  It's time for twig this week in Google the show where we cover Google Facebook Twitter the cloud  Journalism whatever anybody wants to talk about because when you have a panel as good as we have on this show you just let them go  Partly that's Jeff Jarvis's fault. I blame you professor Jarvis  City University New York. Hey, hey  Buzz machine comm is his blog. It's getting of an intelligent conversation. Hey, hey  There actually is I want to talk about journalism, but we'll do that in a little bit  And I'm so glad to have from the from alphabet comm ABC dot XYZ no  Hello, can I say again can I say formerly of Google yet?  No, no, I'm still at Google on leave on leave from Google and it you're on leave from Google not alphabet. Am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right Google is the search part alphabet is not the search part, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  everything but  That makes sense since since Jeff we should say Matt cuts is always welcome here. We love Matt  He does not speak for Google, but he has is was an early Google employee for a long time  Did two things of great import one is keep the spam out of Google search results  That was his day job and by night he did the great webmaster videos at webmaster tools  They've changed those a little bit haven't they since your since your leave

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've changed them a little bit, but they're still doing some pretty neat stuff for example  They've been working on something called  Hashtag no hacked or something like that to help webmasters make sure that their site is secure  And you know, they're not reusing passwords and stuff like that  So there's there's actually some some great new stuff that they've just pushed out recently. So nice. That's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I when I was at VidCon, I met some of the guys who handle that channel on YouTube. I said, oh, yeah  I'm on you know, I'm on twig randomly with Matt cuts was like it was like I said VEGER  They love you they love the Matt

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who doesn't everybody loves Matt cuts  I was shocked that you weren't made CEO, but that's I I mentioned you today teaching our whole new class. In fact that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think you know, we talked a lot obsessively last week about alphabet because that had just happened on Monday

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm curious what you think as somebody who works at Google  Well, tell us what why what's going on  Well, I'll preface it again with this is just my personal take but you know Larry is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fantastic at seeing five-year trends, you know, and that's the sort of stuff that he's interested in, you know moonshots big bets  You know, he doesn't just want to come in and and you know necessarily cross the border  He's interested in you know, you know, he's interested in you know, you know, he's interested in you know  You know  he doesn't just want to come in and and you know necessarily cross the t's and dot the i's and so I  Think this new structure is kind of nice because alphabet, you know can concentrate on some of those moonshots  And yet Sundar at the same time by becoming CEO of Google is recognized and is able to you know  Help make sure that things work. Well employees are happy, you know  We can work on you know  all kinds of stuff all the way down to the nitty-gritty details like  Diversity or inclusiveness stuff like that and so that hopefully you get the best of both worlds you get Larry able to think about  How do we you know reinvent cities and you also get Sundar who is able to you know work at that level?  But is also happy to go down to the micro level details as well. That's my hope at least

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll see how it works out over time. Yeah, I think it makes a lot of sense in that like Sundar is a great choice  Right. I mean he's he's been just a superstar last few years

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he's fantastic  And especially from you know his DNA of you know coming up from the chrome world  I have a lot of faith that you know the open federated, you know decentralized web  he understands the importance of all of those things and  Whenever I've had any experiences with Sundar, you know, whenever there's been some problem or some feedback  He's always taking it very seriously. And so that gives me a lot of confidence  You know that he's gonna keep trying to do the right thing and hopefully represent those old school Google values  You know, even as Google tackles whatever the next big set of challenges is that's great to hear. Yeah, and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Making Sundar CEO is really one way of saying it's business as usual. I  Mean, it's not like you brought in Carly Fiorina to run the company, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean things are going pretty well at Google overall and it was funny because I did a 12 mile run this  This weekend and I listened to this week in Google the whole way, you know, cuz you had a long show  And I was nodding and laughing along I was like, yeah, okay, they get it  You know and and it's kind of funny because I think last week Leo you said well  This is Larry's chance to retire and I don't think Larry wants to retire  But it might be indistinguishable from working on the big things that are fun to you  That you don't have to do versus retirement. And so I don't I definitely hadn't thought of it in that sense  I don't think of it as a retirement at all  But it does free him up so he doesn't have to go in and go to the weekly meeting about whatever  Subject he doesn't care about and if he's excited to tackle the next big challenge  Then that's good for everybody and hopefully good for society as well. That's what I would say

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean if there are two people you want to have  Have plenty of resources and plenty of time to focus on challenges. It'd be Larry and Sergey. I'm thrilled and  Sundar is  Exactly the guy you would want to put in position for day-to-day operations  I think this is this this all works very well Ruth pour out. It is great as well  I think you've got a good hell of a good team and it does make me think that this is probably been in the works for  some time  No comment  Knows how to use silence as a tool silence can speak volumes. All right, let's talk about some new stuff from Google  You know, we'll talk about projects on roof we'll talk about Google curing disease  We'll talk about hangouts in its own site, but I gotta say the thing that most excites me is this new Wi-Fi router  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I immediately got on an ordered one. It was sold out for me at Google. I had to order through Walmart

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When is this it when is Walmart say you're gonna it's interesting because Google didn't make this available everywhere including Amazon  It's called on hub  And it I can't think of a more unlikely sudden announcement from Google yeah than the $200 Wi-Fi router and  yet  when you read the specs you realize oh  this is the first AC router to really use some of these features of AC and of course hidden in here is the key which  is it supports weave and  That is the that is the mesh network that I think is gonna be very important to the Google home automation  play  So I'm surprised though. It was that it's not like from nest. It feels like this should be a nest  Product but maybe it is I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Smooth I don't think it's nest. Yeah, but yeah, it's that's one of those things where they'll have to figure out the right branding  But my favorite feature is that it has a baker's dozen of antennas so it literally can you believe in different in 13 antennas so  Go ahead  What I well there's just the neat thing to me is normally when you have a Wi-Fi router it reboots it picks the channel  That's the least congested and then it stays with that channel until it reboots again  13th that extra antenna lets you scan and every five minutes if it finds a channel  That's less congested it will switch to that channel without you having to do anything  So it's always going to be looking for the most capacious channel to use for Wi-Fi gigabit ethernet port on it one when one LAN

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got a USB 3 port on it, which is kind of intriguing  When they've got the speaker built in I don't know why you have a speaker in a router  I'm sure we'll find out and an ambient light ring in fact  What what consumer electronic device has a speaker in an ambient light ring and kind of looks like this the echo I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got a wonder there was there was a story about the echo, but but it doesn't seem to have any functionality

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's anything close to the echo currently. There's a lot of when you read the specs. There's a lot of no a  Lot of ready, you know, it's weave ready. It's  802 dot 15 dot 4 ready. It's Bluetooth smart ready  What I really get the feeling is that this is something ready for the future  You use it to you could figure it with an app on your Android or iOS device  I  Just I feel like there's there's a lot here by the way enjoy it with your Chromecast nescam nest learning thermostat and your nexus 6  Okay, I'll enjoy it with all of those  Devices, I just feel like there's more to this we haven't  It's dual core 1.4 gigahertz processor you don't normally in commodity devices like routers put fast processors  There's something going on with this one and and it's got

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of flash, you know 4 gigabytes of flash  Memory and so it does feel like it's ready to be really not just a great router today  But a great router tomorrow and next year  I will just say though  I think it's only intended to be a router for the for example, the speaker is 3 watts  So you're not gonna get you know a lot of it's just a ball you matter that for example  Maybe it could well  Yeah, maybe it or maybe it could send out some signals that another device could hear and then use that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one problem is that it's set up to be to be  In your room and they made it cylindrical so you wouldn't put things on top of it and it's been to be out there  But of course everybody's connection is some in some closet somewhere right behind me is my closet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but you they want they say hiding a router weakens its signal on hubs tidy cords and tucked away antennas  Mean you can leave it out in the open for the best possible coverage. It is a challenge  I have an air it's gonna replace my Airport Express  similarly expensive  and kind of  Attractive enough to leave out in the living room, but this will look a lot better  I'm a little worried though because I use  Use other airports to extend it throughout the house. I'm worried about that, too  I'm not sure exactly how this is gonna  Work, but I'll give you I'll give you a way. I look at it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Googlers have big houses  That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is not made for people with small walk-up flats my friends

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think that's true, but it's probably also true that you know  If I wouldn't be surprised if you could have multiple ones of these devices and have them work pretty well together  You know that seems like a pretty I might buy another one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I almost bought two just on the presumption that Google would do that both both of them hardwired to the ethernet  No, one is a repeater. So you could use one as a repeat. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you could I think you could you could do it that way Jeff  You could do it connected to ethernet on both and then they could we talk to each other look at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've never seen this it says limit reached. It doesn't say sold out  It says limit reached  Why is that out of stock when I went there? Yeah limit reached. I don't know. I'm not sure exactly what that means  Comes in blue and black. I of course ordered blue because well if they're gonna make it blue  I might as well make it buy a blue one  So I did order it I don't know when when I'll get it they don't you think it will do Leo in the next year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What what are the what are the well? I'm interested. It has so many antennas

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm wondering if it does be a CB beamforming which is one of the things that's very cool about 802.11 AC that  Very few routers do which is aim  AC has built in this capability to kind of aim at hooked up devices to beam form  Target the beam and then as a result have a better  performance  this 802  and they do  Go ahead Matt

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, they they do talk about that  Do that they to talk about the fact that you can designate one device like a Wi-Fi device and say I want the best quality  Of service for this device, right?  And so that would be kind of nice because if you're surfing on an iPad or whatever you really want to prioritize that and not you  Know a firmware or you're really  Redownloading all your apps on some phone that you're not using so it's easy to provide an even stronger signal a front-facing antenna

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that doesn't necessarily mean beamforming then I was curious about this says 802 dot 12 dot 5 ready  I thought what is that?  What is that  It's a standard. I looked it up because I had never heard of it. Remember 802 dot 11 is  What we're using for Wi-Fi 802 dot 15 dot 4  Specifies the mat you're gonna have to explain this the physical layer and media access control for low-rate  wireless personal area networks, it's a pan ah  Zigbee uses it  This is a home automation spec  It can be used with six low W pan and standard internet protocols to build a wireless embedded internet  I think that's probably part of weave  And I would guess that it's for home automation or possibly Brillo and Brillo slash right, yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, so it's kind of nice because it is designed to be pretty future-proofed as far as I can tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was really blown away  It seems to me something I just you know, I bought on faith basically, it's like you getting yours  That's a good question. I thought I should look at take it away from my screen for a second  I'm gonna check my email I because I thought I got an email that said it's on its way  But they said it wouldn't be for a while, right?  Yeah, I think my mindset September 1. I think that's pretty quick. You got yours at Walmart, which is bizarre  very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's it sounds like it's sold out at the Google Store in like less than half an hour  And then I was checking it sold out at Amazon new egg and fries. So mine it might arrives August 21 Friday  Okay, nice, oh great well and it also sounds like it's got a  TPM which is a trusted platform module  So for example with Chromebooks, there's a sign to bios so that when you boot your you're sort of guaranteed that some malware or virus  Hasn't taken over your bios because it's cryptographically signed isn't that awesome?  So, you know you want that same level of security from your router as well. Yeah, and and you  We're used to routers having to reboot whenever you make a change  So it's designed to not have to reboot whenever you make a change as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So mine says aug October 1st through 5th what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm arrives by Friday, August 21 and I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Friday August 21 August 21 is three days from now  I know well, you're gonna have to tell us what you think we need a review from you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Jake's not happy because Jake's basically the assistant man here. He's not happy. I believe or not  Well, because it means this is what you know what it is. The family comes to him and says you do this  Yeah, we need you to do this and then it's it's like volunteer work, right?  So I I said, I you know, usually when gadgets come out I email them and I say oh you see this excitedly  He came back and said it's not broke. Don't fix it. We have problems five years

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, that's true, but our Wi-Fi drops a lot  We have lots of issues  And I think it's been the router so I'm just I'm very hopeful that a router do you have now the high-end Apple Airport?  Express or extreme I should say yeah, and it's a it's the router. I generally recommend  I mean, it's almost the same expense as this. I'm very intrigued by all of this. I feel like they this is  as  Often as the case with Google, this is not a product they intend to  Make a business out of this is pointing the way to what a router should be  Does that make does that make sense Matt that that's kind of?  Because I mean, there's no business here. They already ran out of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think there can be a good business here  the the thing to bear in mind is  One way to understand how Google thinks about things is we're trying to make it easier for people to get on on the net  And that can be Chrome which is a bit on the web that can be at Android which is a bet on apps  It can be Google Fiber  Which is making it you know easier to get connectivity and all of that stuff just kicks the you know  Gooses the competition a little bit and makes the market more competitive  So that's good for absolutely everybody and and I think you know routers can be so much better  So I absolutely hope that it's a huge hit  I hope that Google makes money and TP link which is the partner that Google did with on this on for the hardware  Makes a lot of money as well, but even more. I hope that just routers in general realize hey you can raise the bar a lot more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that another version coming from Asus? I think oh I see that somewhere. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I saw that somewhere. Yeah, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you right now?  What I love about it is that they took something that that nobody likes that doesn't really work that has no glory and said

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This could be better. That's essentially a commodity product right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it is but well, I imagine this I would think this gets supplied with Google Fiber

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting maybe that's why they have it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know think about Gmail right?  You know mail was thought of as a commodity product before Gmail came in with lots more storage and threaded conversation  So I think over and over again if we can find something that we think is a better way to to do it  Then you know it's it's on the table

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and Jeff what you're saying about fiber that actually makes a lot of sense because from what I read  This was developed by the chrome team and the team behind fiber

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In conjunction, so maybe this is what they were giving people and now they said hey we really should probably make this  Just good, you know so Matt clarify for me  This hardware business is kind of new for Google. Although they've always made this stuff you you see this is  How does this fit into Google's?  game plan I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think this goes back to the Google alphabet split, you know Google people think about as a search company  Organize the world's information make it universally accessible and useful and that's a great  You know that's ambitious enough for a very large number of people to work on but Larry's ambitions are not limited to just information  You know, he's interested in energy. He's interested in transportation. He's interested in all kinds of different topics  And so alphabet I think you know, there was an article in the rundown about how life sciences has been split out into alphabet as well  and so  You know whether it be hardware hardware is a great lens because if you can do commodity hardware  You can really think about project aura  You know the ability to have  Accelerometers and all of these components driven down by the prices of commodity phones means now you can do all kinds of crazy weird new  You know hardware related things simply because you're writing the curve that the phones are on and so I think  for a long time Google might have been reluctant to get into hardware because you know  It's difficult to do and you know, we did the Google search appliance and stuff, you know more than a decade ago, but  At some point you have to say look if you want to affect change, maybe you're working with partners  Maybe you're doing it on your own but hardware is a great way to start to take a step in that direction

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what devices do you wish Google would tackle next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'll just say I posted on internal Google Plus, you know  I was like man, I left my printer, you know in this other place and is there a good fax printer scanner?  All in one that you can use cloud print and can just be on Wi-Fi  You don't need a computer attached  Man, that's hugely annoying right and the computer goes to sleep. You can't print anything even over a cloud print  So to be clear, I don't think that Google is building anything like that  And I love the I think it was Epson just announced that they have like the tanks of ink that will last for a long time  Tanks of ink that will last for  Four or five years. I think that's fantastic  Yeah, but like man if you think about the peripherals that are attached to a computer  Printers and scanners and fax and all that stuff is still pretty annoying at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have I have a Google print and and by the way mine when it's the old problem is the printer when it goes off  When it goes to sleep  I have to turn the thing off entirely to wake it up to get it to print again. However  printers print jobs queue up on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google print yeah for me right on the cloud not even on your computer on the cloud, which is awesome  Oh Google prints fantastic. So the chat room has told me that the  Router is made by TP link, which is a Chinese  Manufacturer and in fact if you go to their website it says meet on hub  They're not hiding it and they make a bunch of other stuff other routers  Here's a their Archer tri-band router a wireless dual band gigabit router the AC 1900  So I'm wondering this is interesting. I feel and here's a Wi-Fi extender. I'm wondering if this extender would work  With the on hub get to buy more. I'm gonna buy more and just see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one thing I saw did I see  Jason on one of the stories in the rundowns is something that's so speculation that Google wants to throw some love  China's way on one of the new neck size and speculation and this always been also being Chinese  They done stuff with China Chinese harbor companies before my crazy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you talking about the the Huawei Nexus potentially? Yes. Yes. Yeah, I mean I  Well, they've used my memory. I can't remember they use a much they've used a sis before

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true with the Nexus 7, right? It's Taiwan  Leo you're about to get bombed. That's not China. That's not China. No, it's not China. They  Know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean the you know that the rumor mill if the rumor bill can ever be trusted  Has LG coming out with the Nexus five ish phone and the Huawei coming out with the Nexus six ish phone  So that would definitely be a first as far as I can remember  As far as that's concerned particularly with with a company like Huawei  Which I feel like kind of flies under the radar in the US by large two memes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm waiting for I've seen the first meme I've already seen of course is yeah, just what I want Google know it absolutely everything  I do. Yeah, and then the second is Oh good  China will now have direct link to all of our communications through the back door. Those will be coming soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. I'm sure you saw  Jeff did you see where we you know, we specifically called out that you know  The on-hub is not going to be looking at that sort of stuff and it's hilarious because you can throw that  You know FAQ or whatever into the middle of an online discussion people like I don't care of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to do whatever, you know, they're gonna say that that's exactly what you would say if you were Google  Yeah, they're not one but you know, it'd be very it'll be very easy to see what it's doing  I mean all you have to do is run wire shark  Well, here's just as they have with Windows 10 and you can see exactly what's going on in the back  Here's my real question. Can Google in turn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I dare use the verb snoop on can it watch  What's happening back up my files or your Comcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but Comcast can Verizon can know but I'm sure your ISP knows everything. That's what gets me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm asking the way around can Google see whether by files and Comcast are blocking certain things or  governing certain things  Does this give them a window on the behavior of ISPs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a really good question Jeff and I hadn't thought about that and I have no idea  And I assume if if that sort of capability were to be offered it probably be the sort of thing you'd either opt into

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or if they do that that yeah, they'll have to tell you they're doing that. That'd be pretty damn nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you had a router and it was you know, it could check all these connections it could tell you you're not getting  This sort of connectivity that you thought you were paying for and it could point out where the problems are and maybe help debug  You know when people have misconfigured, you know their stuff upstream and you know, why aren't you able to stream this YouTube video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, call this number and talk to this guy kind of thing. Yeah and also compare and see oh gee across these, you know, these  Customers of this ISP. They all have slower YouTube  Yeah  Gardner check on net neutrality. That would be a wonderful thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is scooter X and our chat room is giving us this  Section from the Google agreement the Google on app and your on hub  Do not track the websites you visit or collect the content of any traffic on your network  However on hub does collect data such as Wi-Fi channel  Signal strength and device types that are relevant to optimize your Wi-Fi performance  Google policies in terms of services apply as normal to any Google services you use like Gmail or Google search  Whether you're using it on an on hub network or not  That makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right  And this goes back to the fundamental principle that anything any terms of service when you read them sounds very scary  You know, it's not it, you know, oh now Adobe owns anything. I made in Photoshop  Yeah, that kind of thing. So hopefully Google will act quickly to you know, debunk any misconceptions

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't yeah, I mean it's it's not worth it's not it's not worth it for Google to mess with that  right  the the the cost  In public relations alone, let alone governmental interference would be way too high  Anyway, I don't care because I love Google and I'm going to give them all my information anyway  So I'm just I'm getting the router and that's all I care about and if someday on that three watt speaker Google says  I will listen and obey  So there I just I I think it's great that Google just out of nowhere  There wasn't a Google I O or anything just said oh by the way you want to hub and then literally if you didn't if you  Didn't see the story. Yeah broke what last night. I mean, did you have it on all about Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You did. Yeah, we talked about it. I mean, but it broke late. Yeah, it was late. It was after our  Google's getting really good at keeping secrets  It's amazing  I like the sense of surprise. I don't like  Leading up to these Nexus Nexus phones every year  I feel like we know everything about it before, you know a week before at least and I like being surprised. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think it's awesome  It's funny because there's a couple people that I really know and trust  Who have worked on this product and who make me think that it will be a really good. Okay nice  It's also interesting to watch the discussions about I hope this doesn't leak and will it leak and a few people checking to see  Whether it leaks and we're all like, please don't leak please  Oh, and so it's it's nice to get a couple clean launches and and hopefully we'll keep doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said, let me ask this why don't I mean I can understand why don't you want it to leak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll just say from from Google's philosophy at least in the early days  The idea was don't launch this until everything is perfect until it's completely ready  And of course, you know as you get to be a bigger company people like oh we have Google I Oh or we have various  Partners that we're working with and so you can't prevent leaks and so you have certain deadlines  But I think that's a really strong philosophy to say wait until something is completely ready  And then you know, once you're ready like Chrome for example  once you know, it's completely ready then you can launch it and and that just gives you the freedom to polish like  You know Google Photos for example was the sort of thing where it was like  There's always gonna be a pressure to launch it early and get it out  And I think that team probably took a little bit longer and tried to polish it and make it really really exceptional  And you see that reception people love it  You know a lot of people really enjoy using it and I think that's a great way to do things personally

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get all of the good PR all at once instead of dribbling it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what? We're gonna call her cuz I don't know if she'll do this  We're gonna ask her to we want to cover Maker Faire in New York. Oh  Just go over the bridge  Yeah  MakerBase. Yeah, so I yeah MakerBase MakerFaire seems like a logical thing. I  was a big fan of field trip when it came out and then Google surprised everybody with ingress a  Game wild game that some of our own staff have become addicted to some have lost weight getting better shape going around  taking over  public buildings  In in you know weird way this was these were both created by Niantic labs, which was I think an acquisition  And pretty much ran itself right they were pretty autonomous I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Think they were autonomous. I think I think there were there were people within Google, you know  They were joined keyhole for mapping all this stuff. Okay, and they wanted to do Niantic and Google said, okay  Try it within Google first. Oh, I see but yes, so now there's spun out there on their own

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Their own company. Hey, by the way drew all enough by line on tech crunched  That's Drew's new job. So proud of you drew good friend. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's nice to see him doing great. It's so great. Yeah  important account information  Niantic labs is becoming an independent company  We'll be taking our unique blend of exploration and fun to even bigger audiences with some amazing new partners joining Google as  Collaborators and backers Niantic will be building on the success of ingress which has been downloaded more than 12 million times

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was not the first first spinoff. I thought we'd see from alphabet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's that's a good the question that I have when you say spun off from alphabet  does that mean that Niantic is a  component of alphabet now or I  Interpreted this as spun off as in see you guys later  You're an independent company  But we'll still kind of work with you a little bit in a collaboration with Google is and we invested in yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they are completely independent now  So they're outside of alphabet Google funded the spinoff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I guess it's kind of a it's a computer. It's a murky situation consider what we know about alphabet. They didn't sell it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but but they're they're independent now, I believe independent outside of alphabet  But the nice thing is that you know this kind of a structure lets you say okay you can work within Google  in theory you could acquire companies and you can have the CEO stay the CEO or you could you know have CEOs within the  alphabet sort of you know umbrella or you know if you try that and for whatever reason it'll work better to  Be completely independent than people can always spin out that way as well  And you know I love ingress even my wife plays so I wish them wish them well  But it's kind of nice that they people have a lot of different options  And they can try all of those and see what works best for them so these were Googlers originally or some Googlers  I believe they came in I  John Hinky and and these these folks yes who I believe came in via the keyhole

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were keyhole so keyhole was the mapping satellite imagery company that was bought for maps  So they were keyhole

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think you know John is one of the the main people and I think there's other people as well  But I you know I know that all the geo folks you know Brian McClendon all these folks wish them well meet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So yeah, they were keyhole because ingress is all about maps

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right exactly yes interesting this also allows them to have their own equity  It's in essence what advanced did with reddit they bought reddit whole and then so we want to motivate the staff  executives with equity so we'll spit it back out again, but still own  I don't know what Google owns of they I think I would guess it's a considerable chunk

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know exactly either, but you know if you can have folks like John Hankie Brian McClendon Michael Jones come in  Do great work at Google and then as it makes sense have them spin off or do other things and then maybe come back again  It's all to the good and you know I I'm glad that they're gonna try this approach now and see  Hopefully this will have even more fun things in right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but now you've read raised a lot of issues because of this alphabet thing because a  Spinoff would be a separate is it a separate stock issue is it what happens to people who are Google or now alphabet stock?  shareholders and this is part of it what what it I  What goes  Usually there's some sort of  Compensation I don't understand how it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and sometimes if if a company is going to do their you know  If somebody's gonna do their own thing it might be the case that you know the the parent company can fund them and some you know  Become a little bit of a stakeholder so that might be what's going on and maybe they're getting a lot for that. Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure it'll be this close

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean this also allows you to give equity to founders  If it's a wholly owned subsidiary got no equity you got your stock your stock options are in are in

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Parent company well yeah, but it depends what the structure is yeah of this new company, too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all very did you see the interesting thing that Nikesh Aurora did for equity in his company  What do you do apparently he so he you know?  Nikesh was at Google for a long time and sort of in charge of revenue and the business side of things and he went over to  Softbank apparently he just bought  483 million dollars worth of shares in Softbank  Isn't that impressive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  almost half a billion dollars  Every investment advisor in the world would say do not concentrate your treasure in one stock, but he believes in soft  It shows confidence  Shows confidence soft bank also upped its stake in sprint. I think it's now 80%  Which is good because they sprint needs that money to  build up their LTE infrastructure and  And boy are we seeing the benefits we talked about this a little yesterday of competition in the mobile space  It's great right so now yeah sprint joins T mobile and Verizon in eliminating  Early termination fees and contracts you buy the phone outright or you amortize it, but you know what you paid exactly for the phone  The competition has been to the prices have gone down. It's just been great in the mobile space  This is one you can't say Google Phi did it but  Are you using fine man by the way Jeff and I owe you a debt of gratitude? Oh, yeah big regret big  You got us invites to find

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm just happy to try to help but yeah, I am using fine  I really like it you know the Wi-Fi calling is is the audio is really good  So it is use it over. Yeah cell phones and landlines, and you know that's kind of nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's again sprint is one of the carriers on Phi along with T mobile and Wi-Fi so a stronger sprint is good for  So it all comes around right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and you have to give T mobile a lot of credit for oh yeah taking that under approach and  Getting you know rid of the contracts and stuff because I never thought I'd see Verizon say okay  We're getting rid of those two-year subsidy kind of things. Yeah, just stunning

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff did you ever think you'd see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, and I'm still waiting to connect my Nexus 7 did you ever go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

So how much shadow you're going to have and then they say, okay  Where's the sun going to be all year? Where's the clouds historically the temperature patterns?  The temperature patterns and so massive level of processing and it turns out the vast majority of people  uh, you know in the next few years will benefit from switching to solar and  The the main limiter in switching to solar these days is less and less about the cost of the modules because they're getting cheaper  And more about the cost of the solar providers finding the customers  And so if you can push that down a little bit you get more solar solar gets cheaper  You know and and people just get you know better renewable energy and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's it's one of my favorite 20 projects that i've ever seen. I don't know where I am. I'm trying to get something more here's a house  something more residential  So this house  It has 1,833 hours of usable sunlight  1,739 square feet available and would say 14,000. I mean, this is real muddy  And then it gives you more information about  You could say what your monthly electric my monthly electric bill is 250 bucks  Uh record recommended installation size average annual savings. I mean if you go to san francisco go go go to the richmond district in san francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's where I am somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm somewhere else. There's no sun there  Uh, yeah, it's of course the picture shows a sunny day and beautiful  I don't know where this is. It's a lot of houses. Oh, you know what I could do  Oh, you know what I could do. Let's go small  Wow, this is cool  That's as small as I can go  I think  Is that sf or is that the yeah, this is still san francisco. I just scrolled away from uh, just go to the upper left

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's the piers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And here's go all the way to the left. Yeah, we're going to go to the richmond district the fog belt

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's twin peaks. It's always fog. It's always always here's the ocean

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, so there we go. Let's go down here. Let's pick somewhere right on the ocean where it's foggy  Right. There you go. Yeah  All right  Oh crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thirty eight thousand dollars and that's not it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh well, I anybody want to give me a an address, uh  Oh, I know wait a minute. I I know I used to live in san francisco. Hey, let's do this again  I just thought of this I could give my old address  I used to live on moraga street. What was that? Let's say 2400 moraga. This was out in the uh  Out in the avenues. Yeah the sunset. That's that's not one of the buildings. Here's a here's a home  Drag this over here. All right. Well see it's thirteen thousand dollars still  Um, that's uh, that's pretty good and that's based on 125 bucks electricity if you use more  And then they show you lease  Loan and in both cases zero upfront cost after incentives  Or buy which cost you twelve thousand  But you'd you'd save  Thirty-six thousand so it'd pay you back in eight years

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do either of you have solar in your houses? Not yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about you man thinking about pulling the trigger? I am too and uh,  There's this great, uh author ramez nam  He actually used to work in the search division of bing but thank goodness now  He he's like a futurist and write sci-fi thrillers and all these things. I'm like, yeah don't work at bing anymore  uh, but he has this great stuff where he talks about solar and  You know in the next decade or so it's going to be half the price  Or or it's trending toward half the price of fossil fuel and in california  It's already basically economically viable to switch over to solar and you'll see money pretty quickly because we get it's going to be  Yeah in a lot of states though faster than people expect  Uh, and so what I what I really like is if you scroll all the way down on a given address it will it will even  Show five or six different solar providers. Oh, this is great. Oh, wow  I mean the main reason why I haven't pulled the trigger is it's like you got to do the research and find out  Yes, like and this way you can just instantly kind of take you to the people who can help you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is I think sun power is the one you want  You know what I want I want somebody that can give me elon musk's battery  Solar city. Yeah solar city is not on this list oddly now. That's weird. Well, this is just well  Oh, these are sponsored  Our service is free to you, but we may be compensated by some of these solar companies

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a profit thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, even if you make money at it, you can still get people on solar  Get people on solar a lot more. That's fine  And uh, and I suspect that's why they haven't rolled it out to the country is they have to find people who can be solar  Providers in each of these regions which takes a lot of elbow grease

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is exciting. This is really cool. Yeah, we've been wanting to do this  We have absolutely a perfect property for this  And I we're already on a well  I would love to get off the grid and have battery see so I could just really  when the zombie apocalypse hits

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't care of course that means I feel a 30-foot wall around the building and arm myself, but hey what the hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Ozzy will protect Ozzy will do it  Uh, we we had to spend we spent 15 grand  On a whole house generator  Oh, wow, because you were worried about storms. Well after sandy we were out of the house for two weeks  Uh really was getting yeah it was it was and so uh, and I was very lucky very very lucky to have gotten rooms at marriott  Were you out of the house? Because there was no power. There's no power and it was cold and plus we're on we're also on well  Which means there's no toilet, right?  When the power is out, right? No water, right? And so the cat was here  It was getting to the point where it was cold enough that it was gonna be unsafe for the cat and the cat doesn't want to move  and then  Um, so of course all of all of the east coast can thank us dearly for having put the generator in because now since then of  Course, there's no storms and it never will be because you bought a genesis  I'm gonna come out to california and wash my car. So it'll start raining for you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm very intrigued. I think this is again. This is  This is an example of a virtuous circle because yeah, there's advertising on this page for these solar companies  but  Because of that, this is probably makes money for google bravo  Because this is a great resource  This is uh, i'm thrilled. This is fabulous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a 20 percent event

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a 20 project I it's more than one person  I think the team is based or it started the project in boston, which is why they also show solar in the boston area  but what really  just hugely surprises me is  You know within five years this will make sense in a ton of different states in the united states, right? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, it's just really cool. So we're getting there  Do you want to answer that?  While I do an ad. All right. No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, I have to buy a phone twist my arm. Oh, no, do you know how many numbers I have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can give one to you don't want to get a phone call anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I you know what? I don't answer the phone. That's the irony of it. I don't even answer the phone anymore  I really don't unless unless it's like my daughter my son  Lisa, I don't answer the phone  because uh  It's too much. It's for half the time. It's the democratic national committee trying to get money out of me  Don't ever if you ever ever give money to a political campaign, you will never hear the end of it  So but I see I I still will give but I just don't want to do it over the phone  That's too much pressure  Uh drones in space  They're using the nasa exception  Uh us uh airspace  Of course there are limits on what you can do with drones  Uh, but and in fact, I think if you're a commercial enterprise  It's uh, it's even more limited  but what uh, they're doing is they have uh, as you know a deal a land deal  For something with nasa let me see let me read this out loud because I they struck a deal with nasa  They're testing drones capable of speeds up to 100 miles an hour. They weigh less than 55 pounds  Uh, there is a blanket on the commercial operation of unmanned aircraft in the us thanks to the faa, but google, uh  project wing  Uh take is taken to the air  Because they have they're over private lands, by the way, they're not over you  Because they have a certificate of waiver or authorization from nasa  The certificate lets public normally lets public organizations like the military state universities police or fire departments  expand experiment with unmanned aerial systems  Uh, but I guess uh  Google has made a deal of some kind it's over private land for crying out loud

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They're trying to see whether cell phone signals

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can be used by low-flying drones for automatic air traffic control  I you know, I love the rnd stuff at google. This is mind-boggling  When matt was talking, I just had this vision of of of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Larry sitting  In a room probably no desk because he wouldn't have something standard like that just thinking  How does that work matt dude does I okay, that's not how I imagine it jeff  I imagine larry sitting in a chair something like this chair

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With his fingers steepled  I imagine it's all white and he's wearing entirely white and there is one door in the room through which comes an infinite procession of engineers saying  You have and larry says  Okay, mr. Page i've got this idea we're gonna put some drones up in the air with cell phone technology  They'll fly off flight plans receive directions from computerized air traffic control systems  and  It's a very interesting idea  I think it's a very interesting idea  I think it's a very interesting idea  I think it's a very interesting idea  I think it's a very interesting idea  Receive directions from computerized air traffic control systems  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll make money for everybody and larry says larry says ah, but you forgot about this and this and this and this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, sir. Mr. Page, sir  I i'm right. I'm on it  Isn't that how it works matt?  You nailed it  No, but I do I don't think larry has to generate all this himself  He probably does but I imagine there are people constantly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Coming to him with great ideas, but he's also looking at big problems, right? That's what jazz is everybody  That's what that was one. That's what the whole amazon story fascinated about is that  You know the new york times can't understand that somebody cares deeply about big problems and the big problems are hard work  Um, and and so yeah, certainly people come to larry page and say i've got a great idea  I've got a great problem, but I also but he has that's the point. He has the freedom now to say  What if I tackle diabetes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  And larry is a um, he's a scientist and he gets excited about reasoning from first principles  So, you know if you say this is how much the phone costs, you know, he might look at it  He doesn't care. Well, how about the raw materials, you know, why does it cost more than the raw materials?  You know and and so he does get excited about those kinds of things like uh, you know  Makani is this uh wind energy company that's sort of in google x and the idea of like oh what can you do with  You know with wind energy and kites and and so anything that's got an or when he gets really interested  You know meetings tend to just like spill over long because you know like street view  What sensors can you put on a car and what kind of data can you get and and?  All those sorts of things reasoning from first principles like how long does it take and how much money would it take to scan?  All the world's books, you know, those are the sorts of things that are like catnip for his mr  Bigelow man. I'm so jealous

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that not the I mean that's the dream that is the dream really? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why you know, I wrote a post a long time ago  What I wish google would do for news and I wish you were excited about this idea  But if you get to the first principles you you you absolutely ignore everything that we know today about how it's done  It's it's it's a hundred years old 150 years old instead if you get to the first principle of saying what does society need to know?  And how do we help them know it how do we gather information?  I mean, that's the kind of thing that the google attacks. That's the way to look at read look at big problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that a first principle and you'll see um, it's interesting because like how how do you support?  You know good media, you know and and so uh,  Udi Manber had done some really interesting analysis about like how much money do you need to pay someone's salary?  Okay, how many page views do you need at what ad rate?  At what ad rate and it's that sort of stuff that leads you to things like google contributor, which by the way is open without any  Invites now and now anybody can subscribe to it. And that's the sort of thing where it's like, okay  We're what are the different business models? How do you play with that? And that's very fun to think about. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you  Think see I would all right. So if I made an infinite amount of money  And 20 30 billion that's as good as infinite  Yeah, I would feel responsible  Did like I now have a response. I have a duty  not to  Just get in the boat and go and screw you guys  I would feel I have now a duty because I have these immense unimaginable resources to use them wisely  Is that kind of I mean, I don't know if it's I don't I doubt he thinks it's a burden  It's probably a joy, but I think that there is a sense of responsibility. You must have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, i'm not sure he thinks about it as a sense of responsibility so much as it's really fun  Yeah, neat to do and wouldn't it be great to do this and you know like serguey, you know  A lot we often joke that he's you know, well between larry and serguey. It's kind of like batman and iron man a little bit  They do enjoy the gadgets as well. You gotta enjoy doing all that stuff  But the the chance to do something that nobody's ever done before I think that is so appealing  What what drives them though? What drives them? What drives larry?  I mean he is fundamentally interested in how the world works and why it doesn't work better and you know  he's got some large interests like energy and transportation and and  those sorts of things but  You know he he's very well read on a lot of different topics  And so the science of it and why things work certain ways  And why can't we experiment more and I think he's also fascinated i'm guessing right? This is all my personal opinion

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, and by the way, we should i'm putting you in a terrible position because I mean  Larry's gonna be like what are you telling people my motivation? You don't know a thing about me  You haven't seen me for this long, yeah, but but but you you're the closest thing to somebody on the inside that we got so  And i'm just and I don't mean and I don't mean in any way a challenging thing either  I'm just really interested. You know, you feel like I think Steve jobs said and I thought this was really  Interesting in telling that there was a point where he realized that everything around him was made up by somebody  Probably somebody not as bright as him  And so when he realized that he said I realized I could this is not this is written in stone  It's all made up by humans and I can do whatever I I can change it in any way I want  It's all clay  And so that was what motivated him was this thought that I can you know  What maybe there's a better way to do something and I can only only your your point about the kind of responsibility

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've had jobs where I end up unhappy and I can't get anything done  I go home with you know the day and I think it's not my current job. Just be clear  I think you know, I I cost them n dollars today and I didn't actually get anything done  I went to stupid meetings. I got nothing accomplished of value. I didn't increase the value for the day  It's the worst the worst feeling there is for work. I think is to do that  When you're larry page  You know you sit there and say  I just thought about you know marshmallows for an hour. I could have I could have I could have solved a v.a  You know, I I could have done something. I  There's got to be a little of that, right?  I think I think because that's well  That's the way because that's the ethos of google that people don't understand. I think about google that's because because you know  When people were starting to get the second day angle on alphabet was well, let's be let's not trust larry page  It's a cynical act right here. I said, what have you seen the man act cynically, right?  He doesn't act cynically the company doesn't act cynically really doesn't all in all. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, it'll do some crappy stuff and butt up some bad ads or whatever fine fine fine fine  Never is a company but but all at all it acts trying to solve problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's what has to be done. And then there's there's people like larry ellison as an example  Yeah  For him billions of dollars means i'm going to build a bigger yacht

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and i'm and i'm a higher up on the rich list than either. I'm a three comma guy. I'm in the three comma club

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, I shouldn't I don't know larry. I maybe that probably is not the case either  I know he actually has done some amazing things  But uh, I feel like larry and serguei  And people like elon musk is I put them in the same category which is  Mm-hmm  and we think of them as supermen we think of them as starks because  their  Areas of concern are so different so much more lofty than i'm just worried about the groceries and what i'm gonna make for dinner  And uh, and larry's starting to think about well, if could you know, how could we how could we end death?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can have plenty of time to decide what to make for dinner

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, i'm sure larry still has to think about dinner, I don't know everybody does but  It I just it's where we live in remarkable times and it's wonderful that we can celebrate people  Uh like larry page and serguei bren, um, uh and what they're doing  And so I just wanted to get some insight. I wasn't trying to pry or be nosy or gossip, but I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no  It I think it's good because  Google also provides a good structure where people can keep larry and serguei honest if if they're you know  If they get too far off kilter, you know  You've got a lot of people who can push the big red button and say oh  I I think google is doing something wrong here  And larry and serguei also rely very much on people who are you get some really really really smart people who are doing?  Deep thinking in areas, you know nothing about and then they can bring you proposals like  What would you do with a depth sensing camera and you know neat things you could do?  But one of the more inspiring things i've heard like I say is is essentially  You know the worst thing to do is to just come in and automatically do what you did yesterday  Yeah, you kind of need to always be thinking about not just inertia, you know, you have a limited time on earth  So so what is the biggest impact thing you could do?  And if you just are doing the exact same thing you did yesterday  Then you're probably not thinking about it hard enough in some sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's why i've always thought of myself as lazy because I just you know  I just want you know, i'm getting a comfortable pair of slippers  A good chair and something on tv that's really  Unreal that's what you want to watch i'll watch it. He said for hot chocolate and you know a blanket  So i'm not you know, and that and and then I look at people like larry page and I just feel terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like this guy. He does not think that way. It's a responsibility of a generation, too  I'm right this week. I'm brainwashing our entire class of 110 students at our our new class at cuny  And I love doing this and hope that i'm i'm giving some value  But what I keep pushing and do is saying you're you guys you guys have to invent the future  I'm too old and it happened and we were doing what we did in the past our generation  You have to question and so what I do is spend all this time getting to understand why we do stuff the way we do it  So they can question it so they can say well, that's a dumb way to do that  Why you know, there's no reason to keep doing it that way  What's our our our first principle what's our real goal here and reconsider it from the ground up  And and I say, you know you you if you don't do it nobody's gonna do it. So it's your job man. You gotta do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, that's enough I mean we don't have to belabor it I just it's fascinating what we do is belabor things  All right, let's talk about this amazon thing because I have to I have to say  This there seems to be an a continuing trend at the new york times  To pursue an agenda  To not try to get things right but often to get things wrong  Um to it almost is it feels like it's turning into the wall street journal to me  Jeff, is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I worry about. I I admire and love the new york times. I think there's a great deal  I'm unhappy about their hillary clinton coverage. Okay, that's politics the story that they messed up  I've been happy about some other things recently, but the amazon story  I read i'm sure you all saw it on monday this huge long story  Just torturous detail about about working on amazon and I had the same reaction everybody I know had at first was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh crap. Well, that's no place to work. Yeah, and we believed I initially believed it because of course I believed it too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and and and and I have you know for the individual anecdotes and that's the point. It's all anecdotal  It is entirely anecdotal for the individual anecdotes. I have no doubt that those individual anecdotes are  Well reported from their sources  But as I thought about it my first thing I tweeted and I did a joke and I thought you know  Well, let's think about what it's like to work in newsrooms where you work ridiculously long hours and people abuse you  But you also have a lot of passion for what you do  and um  And and and you get you know rotten treatment  Um, so what's the difference and I thought well how many places are are like that works not wonderful  The world isn't google  Um, the world isn't facebook and amazon's more like the real world than the rest  So as I thought about this and then and then of course  a rebuttal from a an engineer at  At amazon came out very lengthy. I loved it because it was really really you could tell this guy's really a corporate guy  My favorite verb was about how we're going to action things  Um, so he talks like a corporate guy and and and said this is not the amazon. I know i've been there a year and a half  I haven't seen people crying at their desks. I didn't see abuse if if they saw the abuse  I think they'd do something about it  So I wrote about this journalistically saying my problem with the story in the end was this  That it didn't have enough context number one, and I can't believe i'm saying this but balance  I don't mean the fox farron balanced way, but context what I mean by context is how does this compare to other workplaces?  You're writing this whole thing about how amazon is this horrible thing. Well, how is it really worse from working for goldman-sax?  then balance is  Okay, so you found all this bad stuff  The only good things are said by hand-picked people given to them by amazon and they are obviously discounted the way  This is written because hey, those are the corporate stooges  I find it difficult to believe that in their in their six months of reporting interview 100 people they found no one  Who likes working there?  No one who really pushed back very hard against this  If they had shown more of that and if they had left it to me as the reader to decide whether amazon's an awful place  To be that's journalism  That would be journalism. So there are things that I think are are obviously worrisome about this piece  yellow  Someone coming up with you know  Coming back to force back from working for miscarriage and and being forced to make a trip like if that happened then then yes  That's awful. But is that systemic in the whole company? I have no evidence by which to judge  a system of anonymous  feedback about people  Uh, whether or not it's used well or awfully I would find that abhorrent. I I can't stand anonymity in a workplace  I think that's just awful. You know every every system can be gamed

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So i'll i'll count that on the by the way jeff bezos's response said if you if you know this, please use that system  Tell us who's being who's making people cry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he didn't deny that that system exists. So so he said I don't want that to see that spread elsewhere  So the times could have been better the next day they put to the story basically giving the context and saying  Oh, yeah, a lot of other workplaces are really crappy too  Then margaret sullivan who is the magnificent wonderful brilliant ombudsman or public editor of the times  Uh wrote a piece and of course, she's brilliant because she agreed with me  I was just gonna say she she quotes you and says he's right  And and said this this didn't go far enough. This wasn't good enough  And and so it's it's it's to me profoundly disappointed when our pinnacle of journalism does something like this  And yeah, I think it is to an extent  It's not yellow won't go that far but but but the times this is an important thing for business

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're talking to the students about it all stopped. It's more polemic than reporting though. It's more taking a point of view

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always say look at the business model and and no one of the things I did say by the way is that they should have  Been clearer about the disclosure that bezos owns their primary competitor to the washington post who many say is jumping up on the times  I do not believe for a second that the new york times did this as an agenda against bezos in the post  But some people there do have a a a jones for amazon they've been doing other  Overly tough reporting on amazon as far as i'm concerned this the paper allowed this to go in my last point is this  The paper is now supported  In a majority by subscription by the public who buys it  And people think well, that's good because advertising corrupts  Well, we have pretty good systems for keeping advertising walled off from influencing us  But when we want to appeal to the public  We end up doing things that I think yes do tend toward the sensational  And this isn't a headless body found on a topless bar  But in a sense, it's a new york times version of that  So the nail salon story was very good, too  But they're trying to go for and i've been there  I know the business when you try to push up your circulation and push up your numbers  You try to get the stories that are really going to grab people  Yeah, and they tried to grab them with amazon and I think it went too far now having said all that i'm really eager to hear  Matt's perspective on this having worked at a tech company don't speak about talking about that one matt  But just what's the view of people working in tech companies and how hard they work?  i'm done

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man, that's a great question  I mean google uh, what's interesting is I remember the cultural shift from the early days of the startup to the days when people  Didn't come in on the weekends anymore because I came in one weekend and I was like wait, where is everybody here?  but  Yeah, what's this is? Oh we can we work we don't have to work on the weekends anymore, you know  But but google from the beginning was always a very polite very consensus driven place  You you occasionally have you know, somebody would would get into a rumble  But it was very rare and people would apologize and try to make way for everybody else's feelings  so um, it's interesting to read how  amazon of course you've got a lot of hard working people but also this uh, you know, and maybe microsoft has a little bit as well  People will sort of have it out a little bit or try to come to uh the right decision through socratic discussion  Or maybe arguments or or maybe you know, uh kind of verbal combat but um  I sort of i've talked to a few amazon employees and and I think there might be a kernel of truth in the new york time  Story, but I think a larger part of it might also be that there's probably a trend in which you know, uh,  Probably a few years ago some of the things in the new york times article might have held more true  But it sounds like amazon has been trying to do better about not burning out their employees and just churning through people and having  People stay for a year or two or three and then leave so, you know  It's it's like the uh parable of the blind men all touching an elephant and they're all seeing different or they're all touching different parts  you know one touches the tusk and one touches the  The scales and so they all are are sort of it's too big for any one person to necessarily accomplish, uh,  to understand completely

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one thing I want to  mention because we talked about the story on sunday as well on twitter is that the amazon employee, uh,  Nick, uh, tubatario who wrote the linkedin piece  Saying i've never seen any of this  Said in the piece that I tried to say this in a comment in the time story and I was the comment was moderated out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which sounded like a smoking gun frankly. Well, did you see well so so margaret sullivan addressed that exactly  Go ahead and it was a ridiculous response. I thought because the saying that well  He just he just said a little bit then linked to his piece. I don't know if that's the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I kind of understand that um  Bassy atim who is in charge of the comment moderation said  Mostly was just a link to his piece

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With that all the time leo  I do that all the time where i'll see something on facebook and somebody will say I just did it yesterday  It was really about the facebook piece somebody said well about facebook, um roger black a big designer says about facebook  I said well here roger. Here's what I had to yeah  I thought that at first too, but I ended up changing my mind. Here's what I had to say boom click and link  Why should I reproduce the entire thing there?  Yeah, I think that's you know, this is the the they said it's it may be more of a policy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you could debate the policy  They said if there had been a substantial commentary that with the link it would have been posted

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That that fundamentally misunderstands the architecture of the web and that's possible that the times did that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just I think the point is that you can't impute it to malevolence or a slant  An old-fashioned thinking but but certainly you can impute it to just not getting it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, somebody should have somebody should have clicked on that link as a news judgment  You should have clicked on it as a news judgment and said oh man people will want to read this right in fact  I would argue that at least digitally you don't just leave it in the comment  You put it up the top saying wow here's some important stuff that happens  So the times came back today and they did another follow-up piece  Quoting from from comments on their site and I think also at hacker news where there was a huge discussion so on  But again, it was front-loaded completely with  Slam slam slam slam slam. Oh, by the way a few good things. Yeah  And it really just doesn't look good for the journalism of the times and that is what upsets me because I think the story  I think that's right. There are kernels in there that I fully believe  Um, but I don't think it it for six months a hundred interviews and all that it wasn't diligent enough in its journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well good news according to the onion jeff bezos assures amazon employees that hr will be working 100 hours a week  To address their complaints. This is the greatest. So that's a relief  They're taking this very seriously  It made the last the kicker too. Yeah, jeff says I heard your grievances  I promise hr is toiling 16 hours a day plus weekends until the problem  Is solved bezos adds any employee not fully committed to ensuring a healthy work-life balance should look for a job elsewhere

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Our

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  HR staff will continue to work their fingers to the bone not seeing their families or friends or anything at all outside the offices for  As long as it takes to make this right. So I I feel like amazon's addressed this  You know, I bet there's truth to both sides, but I also think it's a startup and that's not unusual  It's a 10 year old startup  15 year old startup but  Uh more power to jeff if he wants people to take it seriously  And work as hard as they can  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well matt and if i'm prying  Please please tell me to go right away  You worked really really really really hard for the first few years anyway, well  I'm sorry  So is this is this whole leave thing that leaves us all befuddled?  Is that kind of trying to like catch your reward? Yeah, it's it's not just reward  Is it also kind of say try to re reset your balance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, I am trying to recalibrate a little bit because uh, you know whenever we  I went from grad school straight to google and at the time my my girlfriend  We I got married three weeks before I joined google  You know my wife and I agreed let's try google for four or five years  And at some point you turn around and it's been 14 14 and a half 15 years. Yeah, like  Okay. Yeah, that's that's not work life balance. That's work work work worth and no life and no balance  And so it is an attempt to try to get a little bit better balance that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What you're also seeing by the way is the is the university heritage of google you jeff, you know about sabbaticals  Universities do this routinely after seven years. I'm stupid. I haven't done one. Yeah, are you probably way overdue for your sabbatical?  I am  in fact ziff davis had a sabbatical part of policy as well after  Uh, I think it was after seven years you get a year to pursue whatever you want  Wow, um, and I thought that was really good  I mean they try to encourage you to pursue it. Maybe it wasn't a year. Maybe i'm inflating it  But they encourage you to pursue something that will make you a better employee when you return  paid  Yeah, I think it was paid  Our sabbaticals are paid, right? Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean ours are if I do it, I think for a year i'm paid at not a full right full rate

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's the genesis of that. That's a very common thing in university in academia  M is marshmallow m is for the many things she it's marshmallow  Pushed me does that mean anything that that it's marshmallow? It means that they didn't get a deal with mars bars. What does it mean? Nothing  Nothing it means that's the name. No, but we did see this  Does it well how important are those statues on the lawn at google? Is that something everybody pays attention to I bet you an email circulates  They're putting the statue up tomorrow. I I think people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They enjoy it. Yeah, they they have a lot of fun with the marshmallow and all the other statues that they do  I have to say my favorite part of uh, android m is the app permissions because  For the first time you don't have to pre-approve a big laundry list of stuff  Not knowing what the app is going to do and whether you can trust the app instead you you can start to say  You know open the app and then it wants if it wants to know your location  You can choose at that point  Yeah, and if you say no, then they have to decide how to get around or not get around but how to deal with that back  And uh, and so it's just a much better permission model. Hopefully, uh, you know every every app developer should be paying attention to this and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Working on getting ready for the new m release one of the that's one of the weird things about this one plus two in the lollipop  It's pretty pure  5-1-1, but there is a section the settings app permissions. So they're taking a page from  uh android 6  And they do warn you, you know if you turn on this is this is the you know unapproved version  But you can turn off some of these permissions. They say you may break the app but you go have at it  Have fun. Here's the marshmallow video  the statue  Revealed google does this  every uh every update  There's cupcake. There's kitkat  There's something under a a beautiful by the way last time when they did this with kitkat didn't we see the nexus 6  Look carefully. That's right. Somebody somebody's right. That's right carefully  There's the ma. Oh, it's a little robot with a marshmallow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I mean take a look at the marshmallow and then the body of the android it so could have easily been the body of the android  Why not missed opportunity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I know maybe you could be holding a bowl of little marshmallows. What's what's the marshmallow man in ghostbusters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stay puffed. Oh, it should be the same. Did an android man dressed up as stay puffed. Oh that would hurt. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or android probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whoever owns ghostbusters though, like Sony or something. It does be a perfect time for the new movie chat room. It's interesting  Uh, cheeto says that it's interesting. It's 6.0 and not 5.2. Right. What does that say? Does that mean?  Uh, is that a major revision?  As opposed to a minor revision

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It either means a lot or absolutely nothing, right?  I'm not sure but I mean, you know what what you said matt as far as the permissions, uh aspect  That's a pretty significant change. So i'm sure that's kind of part of it  But yeah, we were talking about this last night on all about android about how the major point updates in in previous history  Seemed to be tied to very obvious visual changes to the android os  And this time and then the the incremental changes seem to be like refining on the underneath  I like this is a little bit different than that. But personally, I mean if you're rolling out a major update a year  Why not just bump it up a version like you know, it's it's less confusing that way  What would you know what would windows do next year seven? I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you can skip a number just arbitrarily for no reason. Just  Go to 10 everybody's on 10 these days. Let's just jump to 10  I'm looking there's a lot of uh, it looks like there's some nexus sixes in five cases. That's a five case right there  Uh, that looks like an lg  That's an iphone clearly another iphone  There's of course, we don't even know if these are all google there. Are they all google employees or  Or they just could be random people in map view. I don't know. Yeah, i've i've i've played tourist with with  Yeah, I wouldn't want to miss it. Are you kidding? That's a great uh, all the phones  I don't see a new phone. Okay, we do have uh leaked it must do  We have leaked nexus 5 stuff but it's uh only a leak  You probably talked about I don't want to repeat too much of what you did on all about android because you do such a good job  With android and thanks. We're not just android. We have other things we can talk about. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we are we are seeing plenty of nexus leaks whether they are real or not remains to be seen  But we're totally in nexus leak territory on the calendar year

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is your advice to jeff to not get one of these other new phones but to hold out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. You can always wait like you can wait forever. I guess is my advice as far as that's concerned  It's not one of my great skills there, you know, no exactly. Um, you know  So if you feel the need to buy something right now, hey, guess what? There's a lot of really good stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Perfectly good wonderful magnificent phone right here. That's what I do. I do want my spy. I want to do that  Yeah, but I I just here's the thing if I if I if I went out and I spent because the other problem  I have is I think to test a lot of things  I bought, you know my ipod  Nano

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I can't do something. Yeah, you gotta get an iphone. I have my old iphone  It's not doing it. But I know I don't want an iphone get an iphone because you're going to get on google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm in facebook mentions and then you want to stream pictures of your kitty

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't use it  and so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm excited about the moto x that's coming out september 3rd

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the question is do I buy so so but then if I there won't be a lose five with it, right?  Yeah, three night. No, you can't use five with that. Well, we don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We don't even know if the next is five will be five compatible. Yeah, i'm sure the new nexus is I would have to imagine  Why do that, but maybe they don't want that many customers. Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good way to make sure your your new service that you're really excited about doesn't go anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what do you think about comcast's watchable platform?  jeff  Comcast has decided it's going to launch a major video platform called watchable to rival facebook and google  So what little difference you have to have a comcast cast x1 cable set top box to watch it  Geez, so it's not it's not on the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but let me ask you this is this a platform you want twig to be on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would imagine well, I you know, I love our shows to be everywhere. In fact, we're on tv people can use tv to get it  Um, so yeah, I mean if they called me and said would you like to be on here? I'd say yes, but it's not  The thing is if it's not on the internet is it important?  Did you see the most recent statistics on cord cutting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is not good for these guys. Never mind michael wolf who says television is the new television

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, let me see if I can find there it is that's the graph  Um this this is from a business insider the scariest chart in the history of cable  Uh cable tv subscribers are actually plummeting  Especially in the last year it's suddenly gone the year-to-year growth has suddenly gone negative as of the fourth quarter 2014  Uh, this is it's this is not good  It is it is a down down down and i'm kind of surprised  Because there's no real financial advantage to cord cutting in the long run. It seems like you'd have to pay  A lot for internet access plus, you know channel by channel access  but boy people just  Penetrate household penetration of cable down from 88 percent in 2010 to  uh 80 percent  in the last quarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so google's attacked this this horrible business model with fiber  If you look at business models that are that are based on imprisonment. The other thing I want is google air  By that I mean an airline  Really?  Yo, i'd kill for it because they treat us decently  They figure out that we have value or valuable people in there. We have information and there's other things  um  Uh, I wrote about a googley airline and what will google do?  Uh, but I think that the the cable business is also just we resent it so much given the chance to escape

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's what a lot of this is. It's not to save money. It's just I hate you just hate them. Yeah  Uh, and wearable is their response. Well, what if we  What if uh your set top box had video on it?  They are going to give content creators 70 of ad revenue  But uh, that's taking a bigger chunk than we give so that's the problem i'd have with it  And I bet you they wouldn't let us put our own ads on there, right?  Right, here's a couple of short good news some happy news  uh  The fcc is finding  um  smart city, which does the wi-fi at at uh conventions  Smart city, which charges 80 dollars a day  To get wi-fi at a convention had been blocking personal mobile hotspots to force you to use their wi-fi  FCC said that's a no no  750,000 fine. It's the second time they've done this remember  They went after marriott for doing the same thing and reached a six hundred thousand dollars settlement  Uh for doing kind of the same thing interrupting, uh, why uh wi-fi at their conference facilities in nashville  The fcc has said why?  Unequivocally wi-fi blocking is prohibited. You may not block  wi-fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, well according to smart city, we always acted in good faith  We had no prior notice the fcc considered the use of this  Standardized available out of the box technology to be a violation of its rules

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  80 dollars a day  Just just evil drew fark.

So he's got 5 000 signatures  He's been certified by the secretary of state or whoever and uh, he will be in the next debate  And so, you know in case you think that you can't make a difference  He's registered as an independent and his he's actually polling pretty well considering that he hasn't even really started any advertising yet  So it's it's pretty exciting if you're a kentuckyian you might go check it out. Tell your friends about it  Let's uh, let's see if we can get a tech savvy governor going, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's so great. It's so wonderful at curtis for governor  If you want to follow the twitter account of the campaign and drew curtis.com and this site is drew curtis  Nationbuilder.com where he's doing the fundraising. I guess heather's his wife. I don't know. She's running for lieutenant governor  I don't know.

Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I don't think this is a joke. I think drew's very serious about this. So good for you drew. So that's a happy one  Um  And another happy one, uh, because we are big fans of jerry ellison  She's been here many times showing off jerry ellsworth. I'm sorry showing off her, uh,  Really interesting name  Really interesting inventions. She's always stopping by to show us pinball games and things  You may remember the last time she was here. She showed us a really cool augmented reality system  Cast ar she had developed it  At steam when she was working there  She told the story of how?  uh when she and her partner  Uh were told that  By gabe newell that the steam was going to kill the project jerry  She's very gutsy said  Well, can I have it and gabe said yeah?  So they spun it out. They just took it off. They started to cast ar  Really cool originally called technical illusions  Jerry and rick were here rick johnson were here to her partner. We're here to show it off  We should dredge that up because they've just received a very significant investment not just money but support from andy reuben  Former android and you know guy the guy who created android  Joined google when google bought android and only recently moved on from google. He's invested 15 million dollars, but  Jerry and rick are quick to say it's a lot more than that when you got andy reuben saying  This is a real technology. This is going to take off  That is important  So nice work jerry. We're very very happy. There you go. That's me  Trying a product very early prototype glue gun prototype  Of the cast-air goggles  Yeah  This is ar.vr  ar  So what happens is you have to put down a um, uh a special screen  And you can see 3d games on it 3d jenga you can it's very cool and you still see the world around you and  Unlike microsoft's uh, hololens. You have a full  field of view  Uh, the key the game is on this piece of uh on this is on this fabric  What you're seeing is not anywhere near what it looked like to me. It was very vivid to me  That's a triangulation episode 124. Wow almost two years ago now good job jerry  I love love jerry elsworth  I'm really glad she's doing well  And uh, you know what? I I bookmarked this because I just think this is an important article to read  By matthew green who is one of the great crypto guys. He's really become I think matthew in many ways has become the voice  of crypto and security  He's at johns hopkins  uh, and this uh in the  light of the article, uh  that was published by pro publica and the new york times about how  Happy and willing att wants to cooperate  With the national security agency and giving information including wire tapping the entire un  For the nsa  He wrote a really good blog post saying you know what the network is hostile  Anyone who has taken a network security class? He writes knows the first rule of internet security is there is no  internet  Security, there's only one solution. We've said this time and time again end-to-end encryption, but that's hard  And even if you do achieve 100 encryption  Metadata leaks a lot of information  so, um  You know he says this this nsa at&t story yet another snowden revelation  we kind of knew this didn't we and um  You know he says if you believe that uh  Someday a large portion of the world's traffic will flow through government networks, not just our own but china and other governments  And some of those governments hostile to the core values of western democracy  Uh, then the answer isn't going to involve legislation or politics the nsa won't protect us through cyber retaliation  If you're concerned about the future the answer is to finally truly believe our propaganda about network trust  We need to learn to build systems today  That can survive such an environment  It's good article highly recommend it matthew green's blog is on blogger blog.com cryptography engineering.com  The network is hostile. He wrote it on sunday  Let's take a break  and uh when we come back  tips tools tricks ideas thoughts i'll give you a little tour of the  One plus two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I had a very strange experience recently, which was my niece came up to me and she said matt  I want to write an app  And I was like, oh man, I really haven't prepared for this  And so the tip or the tool that I would recommend is app inventor 2  So if you just search for app inventor, it's it's uh started at google  But now it's at mit and they're doing a fantastic job with it  And I didn't realize this but  You can now do it where you can make a draw a drag and drop app and it works pretty well  And you can install the app on an android phone using a helper app  And you don't actually have to you know  If you're like me  You might have tried to set it up with android studio and java and you know adb and all these kinds of things  And I spent like three days trying to get the environment just right  instead  Now in less than an hour. I had a little tiny app, you know, it's a button, you know  which she put a german shepherd on it and you can say pet the dog and  Ah, that's cute  So android uh app inventor has this thing it's called hello purr and they start with a cat and it and it you know  Sort of meows whenever you press this button  Which is a picture of a cat and she changed it to a dog because she likes german shepherds  And so, you know in less than an hour we were sitting together  I did the first little bit to make sure it worked and then she took over and changed the dog  You know the cat pictures and meow to a dog picture in a park and it's it's pretty incredible. It's so gratifying  You know, she was like showing it to people and she was  Planning what her next app was going to be and I was just like I could just feel like jeanah trappani  Just like you know smiling at me, you know across the internet felling as we say  You know when we grew up it was all commodore 64s and go to and peek and poke and now kids want to write an app  And so app inventor is a great little way to start trying to do that. That's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want uncle matt too. You want to you want to see how easy it is to do because I actually wrote  I just like you matt except this was for me  I wanted to write a countdown timer for my radio show  I'd written one before an apple script and I thought i'll be good to have it on a mobile app  And so I wrote it what you do is you design as you know, you design the user interface  First you're in the designer and then you go over to blocks and you write your code  There's your code  And uh, it's very easy. Yeah, give me the time, but it's very easy. I'll show you how to  So you get the app inventor app on your um, the companion app on your android device and then you can connect it  So i'm going to say  connect  To the ai companion and it gives you a qr code. I'm going to enter in that code  Right now. I don't know if I should show this on the air. Is this going to  Is this going to everybody going to be using my app now? I don't know  Now, uh, I can scan the qr code or I can let's scan it here. Make it easy  And then uh, it's entering the code and then let's connect and now app inventor on the screen  When what is what's cool about that? So there's the app and then if you make a change to the app it immediately  Changes on your um phone  Wow  So you get instant feedback, you know, i'm i'm actually this is the app here running  On my device because I tied the two together  That's a pretty simple app and it's not going to let you to write, you know the next uh,  Gmail inbox, but it's going to it gives you some some real capabilities  What this one does is it knows what time it is  It knows how many seconds are left before my commercial break and it can it reminds me it blinks in front of me  Uh during the radio show when I should shut up you'll see in about 10 seconds. It's going to blink  Yellow at me saying you've only got 30 seconds left and then it blinks red saying you've got 10 seconds left  And then just says shut up  It's very it's very easy  You're absolutely right man easy enough that a kid can get great satisfaction out of it right away  And for a kid to see the to see these things running  Um is uh, you know so quickly and easily is really exciting for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, even a year or two ago  It was pretty wild because you know, you'd have to plug in the usb card and you'd have to do a lot of installation  Yeah, and now the fact that you can do qr codes  Yeah, just makes it so much easier and the gratification gratification is right there  And for me, that's the main thing is it's enough to get them hooked where they're like  Oh, I want to do that a little bit more commercial breaks over

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We are now in the show and it went green and that's how many seconds before the next commercial break  And so it's it's very simple. But boy, actually, this is really incredibly useful  It's really fantastic. The other thing I love about you can see the plug and play  Interface is fairly simple to learn and this is how a lot of programming environments for kids work scratch  You know alice  uh, so they get they're gonna see this in school too these kinds of  Modules and there's really there's a lot of them. I agree with you. This is just a  Really fantastic tool even for grown-ups

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, totally free  You know, I was like she had an she had an iphone and I was like  Oh, do I have to pay 99 dollars so she can write an app and instead, you know in under an hour  She's happy. Oh this works on an iphone, too  Well, I think this only works on android but I thought about what do you have to do to write and it's a lot harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On an iphone. There's nothing like this. Yeah, unless you jailbreak your ios, right?  Now this is really neat and yeah, it was developed at google  So kudos to google and thank you mit for taking it over and I know there are a lot of curricula  School curricula that use this as a teaching tool. It's really good  Jeff you have a number for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, yes google went public 11 years ago today and the stock is up over 1500  Do you remember that day matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do remember that day  You probably remember it pretty well  Yeah, um, you know, but the nice thing is, you know, they did the dutch auction  So anybody could get in at the ipo price and it's gone up pretty well since then so google's such innovators

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They even innovated on the ipo didn't they? Yeah, pretty cool. The other number I want is 30  What's your 30 day challenge matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh  My 30 day challenge is uh, there's an article in the new york times about it  Uh, it's called 30 20 10 intervals  You you run normally for 30 seconds and then you sort of jog a little faster for 20  And then you run full out as hard as you can for 10 seconds  And then you loop back around and you throw and you do that and that's a five minute cycle  And then you do that three times so in like 15 minutes you get yourself a crazy hard, you know  Your heart is just like pounding workout. Um, and so far this is not my favorite 30 day challenge  Even compared to cold showers, i'm not really a fan of this one so far, but yeah, it's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they say this is the best intense  Brief workouts are the way to do it. You want to really stress your body in effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, high interval intense or high intensity interval training high intensity interval training

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's an app that will do this for android from johnson and johnson of all people called the seven minute workout  That is the original, uh high intensity  Training so they they it's seven minutes. Of course, you're supposed to do it like more than once but you don't have to  And uh, and it and it gives you the timers and tells you what to do and  If you really want to make yourself sick

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, you know it the point is it's not fun  But according to the studies it actually really really helps in terms of cardio fitness and all sorts of stuff  You can either run for two hours or you can do 12 minutes of health, right?  And it turns out 12 minutes even though you procrastinate is still better and faster and all that good stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this app is free and I and I really like it. It's called. Uh, let's see. I think it's from how do you time yourself matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, I I literally  Count to 10 three times and then I count to 10 two times and it's actually nice because then you count to 10, you know  One more time and that's when you're doing full out and uh, it distracts you like 40 minute or 30 minute workout is done before  You know it. Uh, you just have to make sure you don't run so hard. You give yourself shin splints or something as a result, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, uh good good good. That's a good 30 day challenge  good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. It's a good 30. It's a good. Well you you now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is your commitment to yourself? Do you if you say, you know after day 10 i'm done  Do you have to like put money in a kitty or anything? What do you how do you punish yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if it's a normal challenge like you're supposed to meditate and you miss a day  I'll normally just tack that on to the end of the 30 day challenge  So sometimes i'm doing a couple at once  This one's weird because I I normally am a slow runner and I haven't really been doing  All out running and so I actually am kind of giving myself shin splints. So i'm like  I this today I did it as a bike instead of a run. So I just you know, I did it as as a biking  You can't take it too seriously, you gotta have a little bit of fun with it. So, uh my uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tool is actually a couple of them and you probably have some ideas as i've been talking about the entire show  Two new phones both came in the last couple of days  I was a fan of the samsung, uh note series from day one  I've had on every note the one two, three four and now this is the samsung note  five and uh  There's some changes here. First of all, they've they've abandoned the crap plastic back  For a glass back kind of like the iphone  If you've if you played with the samsung galaxy s6, you'll recognize this immediately as being  um, just kind of a giant version of this  It's 5.7 inches very high res screen  The battery is smaller than the note  Four which worried me a lot. And of course you're losing the sd card and removable battery  That's kind of scary  But i've gotten so far pretty good battery life. You see I haven't I got up this morning at 6 a.m  And here we are at local time 3 30 and it's 76 percent. So that's that's a good sign i'm  Getting I think about yesterday. I got about 16 hours. I think about 16 hours of battery life. That's close to what I need to get  Uh for me to consider a phone if a phone only gets eight or nine hours and a lot of the latest crop of android phones do  That that eliminates it. Of course where this phone excels much like the galaxy  S6 is in the camera. It is easily the best camera this and the s6 same same camera ois  16 megapixels  Incredible. This one adds one little feature and it shoots raw as well in the pro mode. So  Uh, you this is this is the camera phone  That if you're serious about camera phone photography, this is the one also shoots 4k video  Which the new iphone is rumored to do this one already does it's  This is a beast  Um, and I so far I really really like it fast  It doesn't have the hesitance that the s6 edge kind of started getting a little laggy for me  Probably because it has four gigs of ram  So that's the note 5 I'll have a full review uh soon on before you buy and then today, uh,  This is a embarrassment of riches. This is the new one plus two  Which jason also got kind of similar to the old one plus two no nfc, which is weird  Uh battery not removable no sd card  I got the 64 gig version and as usual you have to get through an invite process to get it  Uh, we were lucky thanks to jeff that we both got the invites jeff picked up a couple in the line at the announcement event  screen you immediately see is not nearly as good as the oled screen on the  On the uh galaxy note 4. I mean the note 4 has the easily  You know the the s6 and the note 4 have the best screens note 5 I should say have the best screens on the market  They're just stunning oled screens  This is only 1080p. It's not quad hd. It's uh lcd  I think it's ips. It's a little feels a little washed out. Frankly. The blacks aren't as black  The whites aren't as white  Uh on the other hand if I get better battery life and I expect to I got 20 hours on the one plus one  I expect to get similar battery life on the one plus two that may make up for it good fingerprint reader  Uh really like that. Um  So and it's a lot less this is half as much as the note 5. It's only uh, it's under 400 bucks  That's there's a lot to be said for uh that on the other hand  And uh, you may end up buying another one because support is almost non-existent  For the one plus they do maybe they say they're going to try to do better this time around  But the one plus one a lot of people had trouble with the one plus one  We're very unhappy with the support on that. I forgot  There's one other feature that makes the note 5 if the note 5 battery life is decent  I'm going to stick with the note 5. I think watch this the screen's off. This is cool pen  I don't know if you're going to be able to see this or not, but I can still  Yeah, we see that right on the black screen  And save it  I haven't turned it on. I just popped the pen  Um, also, I don't know if you know but notice but the latency is zero  So some some pen phones have not been great because you know, there's a little lag  There's no lag here and I can save that up and now I have that note, uh for future reference  That's really cool because if you know, you're you're in a bar and you meet an attractive  Young person and you say let me get your number  Why you just pop that out and you can write five five five one two one two  And you know the napkin will never get wet  You will always  Have that number although you may shed a tear when you realize it's the number of the local directory assistance not hers  Uh, so that's kind of a nice nice kind of a tip for ashley madison users. Yeah for ashley madison users. Yeah  Yeah for ashley madison users, yeah  This is definitely the phone
