date=2009

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is Twig.  This is Twig This Week in Google.  Episode 3 for August 15, 2009.  There's a command line for that.  This show is brought to you by listeners like you and your contributions.  We couldn't do it without you.  Thanks so much.  It's time for This Week in Google.  And joining us, a wonderful group, as always, starting with Gina Trapani of a smarterwear.org,  former founder of Lifehacker and a wonderful person who obviously rides a bike.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Howdy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because the bike is behind her in the image.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually took it out this morning.  It doesn't just hang on my wall.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also here, Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com, a great commentator on journalism and all things new media.  Great to have you once again, Jeff.  Always happy to be here.  Third time.  The plan is to have you on every show, but if you tire of it, let me know.  And for the first time, a fourth around the table, Anil Dash, who is vice president at Six Apart, writes an amazing blog.  We've quoted now in both episodes of This Week in Google at Dash's D-A-S-H-E-S dot com.  Hi, Anil.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Hello. I'm really excited to be here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Great to have you.  Great observer of this whole scene.  Of course, Six Apart is one of the big movers in this scene, but you've been around for a long time, blogging since 1999, longer than any of us.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  I guess so, yeah. Ten years. Time flies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina was telling me that she and Jeff started their blog in 2001. I did too.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  It was a good year for blogging.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess it was. And you've been doing it since 1999, ten years.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  So before we get into the meat of the matter, I thought I would bring up one thing that was blog post.  It's a little bit personal. It's Jeff Jarvis's blog post.  Jeff, you reveal on your blog that you have prostate cancer.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. The doctor said that if you're going to get cancer, this is the one to get.  So I feel as if I got the upgrade on cancer error.  But it was very early. I'm very lucky. I know it.  And living the public life that we all do, how could I do anything else but blog it? I had to.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, no, you didn't have to. But I think it is true. We live in public, don't we?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's such benefit that comes out of it. I've gotten incredible outpouring of support and advice from friends and from people who have had the procedure.  And only one nut came out from the results. So it's not bad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You lost a nut?  I'm sorry. You had the Lance Armstrong version, eh?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, we hope not. Other things I will lose.  I apologize.  You don't know what I'm going to lose.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I totally, totally apologize. So good. So you'll have an operation or will you have treatment?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I hope to not miss a single show, my God. I'll be here. You won't want to know what's below the camera, but everything will be fine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They called Walter Cronkite old iron pants because he never missed an episode. We'll have to come up with a similar name for Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Old iron balls. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I'm going to cut it out right now. I'm not going to wait, but that's wrong too.  Let's move on, shall we? There's a lot of news. You know, it's funny when I first started thinking about doing a show like this, I thought, well, will there be enough Google News?  Oh my goodness. There's never any lack of news about Google. And of course, this show is not.  And Gina was very quick to make sure of it. Not just about Google, but it's about cloud computing as well.  So we cover Google and the cloud. And while there's been a lot of Google news, I think maybe the big news of the week is that Facebook bought FriendFeed on Monday.  What do you guys think of that? And let's start with Anil, our guest. Give him the pride of place.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  I think it's interesting. I'll have to be honest. I never used FriendFeed that much. I kind of felt like I got Facebook in my life.  I've got Twitter. I got a million other services. It's kind of overkill. But the idea of aggregating all of my different services together is really, really appealing.  And I think FriendFeed got such a great pedigree from day one because of the people that made it.  These were really talented folks that came from Google, came from elsewhere in the industry that had an amazing background.  So that, I think, gave FriendFeed perhaps an elevated place that they might not have had otherwise. And people were rooting for them.  So I think it's interesting to think now all the conversation again is we tend to think about the technology.  We tend to think about how are they going to integrate these different pieces and the cool features that they have.  But I can't help but feel this is the same story it was day one. It's like these are people that have good ideas and that's why Facebook wanted them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Smart engineers are always valuable. Yeah, Paul and his partner, and I forgot his name, started wrote Gmail, right?  Yeah. I think the reason FriendFeed is important, it's not important because of its size. I was a big FriendFeed fan, but I know there aren't very many of us.  But the reason it was important is because they seem to get social media in a way that Twitter and others, including Facebook, didn't.  And I think that's probably why Facebook was interested, although I have to wonder what does Facebook want to do with these guys?  Gina, do you have a thought on it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting. I mean, I would love to see FriendFeed's aggregation capabilities show up in Facebook.  And I think Anil just said earlier that this kind of makes Facebook or gives them the ability to become sort of a widget company.  I don't know. I just recently got into FriendFeed because of you, Leo, really, because we've been doing the Twig stuff on FriendFeed.  I lobby.  It's a really interesting service. I didn't really have a need for it before either.  What struck me about it the last couple of weeks I've been using it is it's pretty geeky.  I mean, it took me a little bit to grok it, which is going to be kind of interesting to see how they integrate certain features that I didn't quite get right away into Facebook.  I don't know. Maybe I'm just daft.  But a couple of other comments that I heard was, you know, how are how is FriendFeed's real time features and their feature set going to scale on Facebook?  That'll be interesting to see. But I don't know, maybe kind of sad. I'm not a huge fan of Facebook.  I mean, it's OK, but I definitely get much more value out of Twitter.  So and I've been really liking FriendFeed as well.  So I'm not sure if maybe I just need to manage my Facebook life a little a little more aggressively or something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, you're a big Facebook user. You support Facebook.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have been. I think the irony here is that Facebook stumbled upon lowercase s, lowercase u, the notion of the live web in what they did.  And the news feed that was controversial when Zuckerberg first did it, of course, became the spine of Facebook.  And I don't know whether it inspired Twitter in any way, but Twitter really kind of follows in as a stepchild of the news feed at Facebook.  But Facebook then fell behind in the live web.  And so the irony is they had to catch up somehow. Whether FriendFeed can do that for them or not, I don't know.  On the wiki, I put a link up to who was it?  Kevin Marks did a great post today trying to analyze the success of Twitter.  And he goes into a lot of things about the flow of the web.  There's no kind of email backup constipation for us.  The notion of publics and following, the notion of control of your society on the web.  And so all of that, if you think about it, Twitter was very early on to it.  I mean, Facebook was very early on to it.  But they try to be 25 things at once.  And Twitter was so simple that I think it lost the focus.  And maybe a FriendFeed can bring that back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is an acknowledgement that the real time web or the live web, as you call it, is something that's happening and something important, isn't it?  I mean, isn't that what FriendFeed is, is the real time web?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. And that's the thing that Google, since this is twig, isn't very good at.  And so Google at some point, I think, is going to have to buy one of these players because they don't understand.  Though one of the founders has said that he wanted to search the entire web every second.  And that sounded absurd. I think we're headed that way.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a really interesting differentiation because what I heard from it, from FriendFeed, was not so much just the real time stream or what Dave Weiner calls the river of news, but much more of the aggregation.  It was assuming that if you used FriendFeed, you probably used half a dozen web services, not one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And FriendFeed brought them all together for you.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that was as important as the real time element.  I think the idea, I mean, the thing I keep obsessing over is the biggest social network is the web itself.  Right. And we're so used to thinking of I'm on this network or I'm on that network.  And FriendFeed to me felt like accepting the reality of we're not choosing one, we're choosing all of the above.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yet the thing that is sticky about FriendFeed, at least was for me, is not that I can port everything in there, but the engagement and conversation that results from that.  And I think that makes sense that this is what FriendFeed is looking for.  It seems to me that Facebook is trying to change it.  And this is a difficult thing to do. I mean, it really is built around a walled garden private model.  You know, there's no public face to Facebook. You can't even Google Facebook entries.  And I think it looks like they're trying to create a public face and open the walled garden.  And in fact, when I look at what they did with CNN during the election with, you know, the CNN election page, which looked like a Facebook page, was actually a CNN page with Facebook widgets on it.  And it seems to me that's at least part of their strategy going forward.  It's a difficult proposition because everybody who's on Facebook right now expects privacy.  In fact, probably that's why most people join Facebook is because it's not Google. It's not public. It's a private conversation.  Can you make that transition from walled garden to public garden? Has anybody ever done that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think Google was trying to get with Kevin Marks there. The irony is Kevin has left Google since.  When he was there, he was looking at the open social efforts. And I forget what they called there. Friend Connect, right?  Where you could leave your turkey tracks across the web and bring them in, whether that was your Amazon reviews or your Twitter feed or your Facebook comments or your YouTube videos or whatever.  That adds up to us, right? My presence online is my avatar. It is my life.  And I think that's where you really want to go. Not at Facebook, but wherever I want it to be.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. And I think that this is going to be where the battle lies is between Google and Facebook to become this.  Or do you think Google isn't going to be a social widget marketer? I mean, that's I think to me, that's a great strategy for Google.  What does Google want? They want to be everywhere. They want eyeballs everywhere, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wonder why Kevin left because Kevin was doing great, great work with Frank.  I know.  And there is an opportunity to do something there.  You know, I always say that Google is not one the entire world.  It's the live web, the social web, the local web and the mobile web are still to be conquered.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  And we'll see. Yeah. Yeah, I think it's very likely everybody with a big network is going to try and turn it inside out.  You know, and that's that's Google. That's certainly Facebook.  I mean, I think even the old school players, if you look at the however many hundreds of millions of people have a AOL and Insta Messenger account,  I think all those networks are going to try to turn themselves inside out.  It'll be a race to see who does it in a way that other sites actually want to use.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the lesson is AOL, which maintained a walled garden and never really did open. And look what happened to them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, is Friend, now that you've started using FriendFeed a little bit,  is it kind of the cloudy use you've been talking about in terms of adding value to an otherwise existing API and feed?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, for ever since I started my FriendFeed account, which I did back in the day when I first heard about it, I use it solely as an aggregator.  So for people who aren't into social media at all, I could say if you want to know everything I'm doing on the web, just go to my FriendFeed account because it's all there.  You don't have to be in one one piece or the other. The functionality that I was not sure about,  I didn't realize that you could forward items to say like the Twig Room, which I didn't realize you could do.  And the conversations are really interesting and cool. I'm still not clear about where all those comments come from.  I feel like some of them come from outside sources. Some of them happen on FriendFeed.  You know, I'm not sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  FriendFeed, you're right. The likes can come from anybody.  The comments can come from anybody. The posts are people you're following or, and this was a very interesting thing.  See, to me, Paul and company, the really the thing that Facebook got was they understood better than anybody the kind of the nitty gritty details of how to make these social graphs work.  They had a friend of a friend feature where if a friend of yours liked something from somebody else, it would also appear in your feed.  And it really helped in discovery. They also have search, which is something else Facebook I think really wants and needs and really where the money is right for for Facebook.  I think FriendFeed is very engaging, but it's very hard to understand and learn.  I think, boy, I mean, if Gina, if you didn't rock it right out of the box, I don't know who would.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like I still don't get it. There's this thing to aggregation that is just hard.  And I look at like 10 years ago, LiveJournal had that ability.  You had a friends page. You could aggregate in all of your friends' updates.  You could pull in RSS feeds.  And even, you know, I look at Tumblr today and a couple of years ago started doing that.  And all of these services have these couple of traits that are really common, which is the friend page, the aggregation of everything your friends are doing is completely addictive.  It pushes towards really very short updates instead of long updates.  But then you have this point of responses and comments and replies being completely disjointed.  I remember I literally I discovered LiveJournal because somebody had syndicated my feed in there and there were comments replying to it.  And I was like, I don't even know what this community is. And here's people talking, thinking they're talking to me.  I still have that happen on FriendFeed today where I don't spend a lot of time in there and people reply to my posts there.  And I have no way to even know that they're doing it.  And these conversations take on a life of their own.  I think that is a fundamentally hard challenge with trying to bring the outside web into a closed, you know, walled garden.  And maybe that's why the networks have to open up to avoid that problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think there are ways to solve it. Disgust and the new Echo from JSKit are interesting.  These are commenting systems that fold the comments from all over the place back into the blog.  Something happened this week, and I think, Anil, you might have been part of this.  Something happened this week, and I think it happened because of the FriendFeed sale.  Dave Weiner sent me a note and said, well, really, you should go back to blogging.  I think what happened, what people did is they abandoned the blog and they went to the microblogs and they said,  well, I have a presence on Facebook, Twitter and or FriendFeed.  That's where I'm and it happened to me.  That was the easiest place to put stuff.  So I stopped blogging so much.  And I think people do you think people are going to come back to the blog, Anil?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, for me, it's almost a political thing.  Like I, I, you own your stuff.  Yeah, it is straight up about ownership.  I mean, I mean, my background before I was really even in the tech industry, I was in the music business.  And I saw the difference between artists that own their stuff and those that didn't and what they could do with their careers.  And so I, you know, and I, you know, I like Mark Zuckerberg fine.  I'm friends with Evan Biz.  Like I admire Twitter very greatly, but I'm not ever going to create the most valuable things that I write.  I put a lot of effort into the things I create.  I'm not going to put them someplace that somebody else owns them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A lot of people put them on FriendFeeders having second thoughts saying, what have I done?  We're all this is another meme that's just sprung up.  We're all investors in these companies who don't get paid when the company liquidates.  You know, we've I felt that with Twitter.  I felt kind of, you know, like I put my heart and soul into Twitter and they abandoned me for Oprah and or Ashton or somebody.  But that's what happens to geeks, right?  We early adopters, we move in and if the company that we support is successful, they go, they go broad anyway.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  But with blogging, when the other people came in, it was still a victory for us.  My site didn't go away.  I overshadowed the importance, you know, of the people using WordPress or TypePad or whatever.  Like your importance doesn't go away when somebody else new comes into the medium.  But aren't you really just another walled garden?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, aren't you?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  I don't feel I mean, I on my site, I'm king.  Right. And I think, you know, I see that on on Gina site on Jeff site.  It's like if they want to do something creative and interesting and spend, you know, days and days on it and tons of time and money at the end of the day, they own it and nobody can take that away.  I think that's pretty important.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you lose all these things that Kevin Marks talks about in his blog post.  He talks about flow where there's just this kind of flow of information.  You see faces of people and that I guess, you know, there are ways to solve that with Friend Connect or blog, my blog log.  There are a lot of different ways to do that.  I know Six Apart has some good solutions.  He's hey, this is an interesting one.  He says it's fatigue.  That's a term I had not heard before.  P.H.A.T.I.C. full of social gestures that are like apes grooming each other.  But all of this stuff is appears in places like Twitter.  But does it appear on your blog?  Don't you lose it?  I think actually the great blogs do it.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  I one of my favorite sites is Metafilter, Matt Howey site.  It definitely is that.  It's been running for 10 years.  And there are a million little gestures you can do there of like you click a little plus sign and you favorite something or you give something a thumbs up.  I think the sites that are really seeing that succeed, I look for the geeky side of things.  Stack Overflow.  My wife runs a real popular food site, Sirius Eats.  Each of these sites, I think, has this amazing sense of like you can make those little gestures.  And I mean, when we have a service Vox, it's kind of like a friends and family blog.  Love Vox.  Thanks.  And that was, I mean, we have this thing that that Mina Trott was really adamant about having.  This is good.  And it was just being able to click a box and say that something somebody did was good explicitly as a gesture.  And I think it has to be lowering the threshold from, oh, I go in to the comment form and maybe I signed in and I typed some text and then I hit post.  Like that's a lot of steps.  And you want people to just be able to kind of give you that head nod of, hey, that was pretty nice.  And then if they want to add more to it, that's great, too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But they're but they're complimentary.  Right.  You know, Jay Rosen uses Twitter to push an idea or to link to something.  People, the New York Times use it to promote their stories.  I think that reporters use it to get to gather data in real time.  I used it today to find out something for a presentation I'm doing this week.  I think they're not either or.  The question is, how do you bring them together more?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I feel like blogs are like islands and they're they're loosely confederated, but they're still islands that are we going back to RSS?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  I think we're upgrading RSS.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought it was dead.  Please.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm telling you, tape whiner.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm going to call David.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  My answer to people say RSS is dead is always the same, which is like, OK, then stop using it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're using it nonstop in every possible way.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  We always say it's dead when something becomes so ubiquitous, it's invisible.  But, you know, I think I think we just upgrade RSS.  We give it the ability to be faster and be part of that immediate real time stuff that you know, like what Jeff was talking about.  I think we put likes into it.  So like a Google reader now, if you view your own feed in Google reader, you can see who has liked posts that you've done.  I'm sure it's a matter of time.  So you can pull that back out.  Readers looking more and more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hate to say it like friend feed.  I'm going to talk about reader.  It's my tool of the week.  But it's looking more and more like friend feed with likes.  And in fact, Facebook, it was pretty obvious was stealing a page from friend feeds a book with likes and commenting.  And that live stream is looking more and more like friend feed.  I could easily see friend feed just appearing as that middle column, that news stream almost intact.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Do you think that this is a lot of this is this discussion is about a battle for who you know, what pages come up when someone searches for a person online?  Right. So you have like Facebook wants to have public pages for people.  They have public search listings already.  I think that they're going to, you know, enhance those with the friend feed integration if they do continue with friend feeds aggregation.  Google profiles, which we talked about last week, is doing a similar thing.  But honestly, when it comes down to it, a blog which you write and update frequently is the best way to get into search results and to get found and to put out there the things that you want to put out there.  So, you know, I don't know.  Sometimes I'm like, this is just a giant people search play.  You know, the friend feed Facebook discussion or sale.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah. Who owns your name online?  I think the conversation and I would delete my account on every service out there before I let them come up ahead of my own site for my name.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we should all get we should all blog.  Well, you all are blogging again.  But everybody else should stop messing around with the Twitter and blog or should you Twitter and blog?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Do both, you know, come together, hook them together, right?  Like get some value out of it so that it's driving people into your.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So how do you hook them together so that you you use you blog whenever you blog, it goes to Twitter.  But then when you tweet, does it go to your blog?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  God help me, but I'm going to bring up wave because I think there's something about that that says that you start to combine set units and flows.  And we try to figure that out.  You know, part of the problem in media is that we have been making people come to us, you know, follow the light children, come to our sites.  You've got to come to us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what I had. That's the problem I have with blogging.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're right there, Leo.  And so what we need is some new architecture that hasn't been invented yet.  That is some combination of a distributed flow and assets.  If a blog post is an asset, how does that fit in with the flow of Twitter, with the ability to comment on it, with the ability of people to distribute it?  I don't think we've seen anything close to this yet.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  We've really separated the act of reading and writing, right?  We've put the part that has to do with interacting with your audience 100 miles away from the part that has to do with creating content.  And we need to bring those things in tighter circle.  I think the problem is right now everybody that's brought real time elements into blogging has done it by saying, well, here's the latest noise about that tag that you're talking about.  Yes.  You know, as opposed to what real time can do at its best, which is here's a shared experience we're having.  I was playing with Chartbeat, which is a love chart, a stats app.  It's a very cool.  I'm partial because they're based here in New York, which means that they're awesome.  And I got that sense of, you know, I wrote a post and I was very lucky.  A couple of people shared it on Twitter and it said, oh, you know, 200 people are on your site reading this right now.  And I thought, one, I've been blogging 10 years.  I've never known that I've never known there's this many people looking at something all at once.  And two, they have no way of telling that either.  You can't tell it to crowded room.  And, you know, to their credit, friend feed room, you know, when there's a lot of people there.  And I think that's a problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You guys must be looking at that at Six Apart.  How do we do that?  What is it?  It's just technology.  Do you have a little dashboard?  I know when we on our video feeds, we used to have how many people are watching and people miss that.  They love that feeling that there was a lot of people there with you at the same time.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  And it makes you feel good about what you're reading or watching, too.  Right. Like I must have good taste because there's a hundred other people here with me.  This is the show to be at.  We're social beasts. We like swarms.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we like swarms. We want to be part of that.  So you think it's just technology?  You think you could solve that just by just by a dashboard or something?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think technology is a tiny part of it.  I think it's mostly social.  I think it's all about like thinking through what are the what are the things that make us have that great feeling?  Like, you know, I went and saw a concert the other night and it was three in the morning.  And everybody was, you know, hopping up and down, totally awake.  And it was because it was a great show.  And it was one of those like, oh, they're they're here for this moment as much as they're here for the band.  And technology, we would literally be looking at that room and be like, well, what guitar are they playing?  What drum kit is he using?  And it's like, that's actually not the most important part.  It's still fun.  Yeah, it was super fun.  But we need to not look at the nuts and bolts of it so much as like what are the behaviors?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Billy gave me a Chartbeat account for this, the page that most of you are watching right now, the live dot twit dot TV page.  And it's really it's interesting.  I would love to surface it.  I don't know how you how you surface it.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  There's a share link on Chartbeat that that you can have this little copy link up at the top of the page, at least on mine.  I have to share your dashboard history, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK.  And that goes, I could put that maybe.  Yeah. OK.  Maybe I could put that at the bottom of the page or something.  Interesting. Yeah.  You could see all over the world where people are watching and, you know, there's people in Australia and Asia and there's some some one person on from Russia.  Hello, Russia.  That is a kind of a neat thing to be able to share with people.  I just that the part of the problem I have with the blog is it just seems so I don't know.  Maybe it's just too personal, so personal.  It's like this is me.  And if I want to see a Neil, I have to go to a Neil.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  How do we we don't have a way to seamlessly go back and forth yet.  Yeah. All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there's a challenge left for the listener.  Solve that problem and you'll be a rich, rich person.  Yeah. Google started at launched caffeine this week.  Gina, what's caffeine?  I can't figure it out.  It looks exactly like Google to me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yet to the end user, it looks pretty much the same.  In fact, when you bookmark this story, I thought, wow, I don't really see the differences.  But can you guys hear me?  OK, I feel like you blacked out.  I blacked out for a second.  OK. But what it is, I just saw that interview with Matt Cutts.  I mean, the search web spam had the web spam team at Google.  It's a total rewrite of Google's not a total rewrite, but a major rewrite of Google's index indexing engine, I believe.  It's really fast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So pops up like instantly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Google generally does, though.  I tried a bunch of searches and I really didn't see that big a difference.  But it sounds like Matt said that it was a pretty big update, as big as an update as I guess they had another update in 2005, which is quite some time ago.  So yeah, but I don't see much of a difference.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Functionality, it's the same, I guess.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Functionality is the same. Yeah, yeah.  It's pretty cool that they're putting the sandbox out there and letting site owners who are particularly concerned with their rank give it a try and send feedback.  That's pretty cool. I think that's the first time they've ever done that, as far as I know.  Nice move toward sort of being a little more open and beta testing search results, which I think they've done before, though they beta other stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what would you do as a site owner? You'd look in and say, so the results change?  Are they different than the other Google, the original?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if you compare them side by side, which I did for several searches, yeah, you can check to see what results are different.  For me, the searches that I tried, it wasn't very different.  I mean, I did several searches for topics that I know are hot on Lifehacker and some other projects that I worked on, and they look pretty much the same.  I don't know. Have any of you guys seen any significant differences?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, but you're going to see it in more big statistics.  I, you know, when Google burps, everybody else gets ulcers.  And I used to consult for about dot com, which gets 80 percent of its traffic from Google and half its ad revenue from Google.  And whatever Google would so much as change the dial a little bit, the impact on the business was big, potentially.  And they monitor every possible metric they could.  And I think this has a huge impact in the long run on companies that have a lot of search.  If you lose three percent of your value in a given Google juice area, that has a big impact on you.  And it's hard to see that in individual searches.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah, it might be certain terms, too, that are really the making difference for certain companies.  They just are terms that might not register for us, you know, things that we don't look up.  My experience in testing a couple of terms is basically it was harder to tell a difference between the two versions of Google than it was between Google and, say, Bing.  And even those two were barely distinguishable.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I mean, Six Apart probably has a lot of interest in this since, you know, how well Google searches your your hosted blogs is probably a pretty big deal to your customers.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  It matters. Yeah, I mean, it matters a lot for that.  Honestly, the thing that is getting a lot more attention from our customers is, and I think bloggers in general, is how quick we're getting into search engines as opposed to ranking.  Like they know the SEO. I mean, the tips haven't changed in five years.  Update a lot, put a good title in. You know, we do all the URLs. That stuff is all automatic these days on any blogging tool.  But we've had this thing for a couple of years that today we'd call a fire hose like what Twitter has of, you know, all the updates and the type that service that we do is how to have fire hose.  And it's funny, it's been running for years and it's been the last six months where all of a sudden it's really interesting to people of how quickly am I going to get into Google as opposed to where do I rank in the search terms?  Because they're like, I know I'm going to rank, but I want to be the newest result, not the first result.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's that real time web again, isn't it?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's a, I mean, that is a radical change. That's as big, I think that's as big a change as like before PageRank and after.  I think, you know, there's no name for like PageRank for newness as opposed to PageRank for authority.  But, you know, again, and we've all been blogging for eight, 10 years, that thing that was new about blogs is like the newest post was at the top.  And now we're finally going to think about like search engines where that's true.  Like the only search engine where that's true right now is Twitter and FriendFeed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is this related to the push button web that you were talking about?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it was one of the things that informed, I wrote a post a couple weeks ago called push button web, just saying there's a lot of really interesting real time tech out there.  I was thinking more about for developers, how do you get a message out there?  But certainly one element of it is search.  It is going to be as important to have search engine delivery as search engine optimization.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, in London, the Telegraph led the way on the story of MP expense scandals.  And they got some crap for not going web first.  But the director of digital there explained to me that they wanted to be on top of Google News at every opportunity.  So they scheduled the release of the stories just to be on top of Google News.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the news cycle begins with Google these days, not CNN or NBC.  How interesting.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Wow.  But I think we've all even known that, right?  Haven't you put out a blog post on a Thursday morning because you know it's a big day for traffic?  I mean, Gina, you live and die in that world for a long time.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that true?  So Thursday morning, that's the time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, for us, I mean, we would analyze our daily traffic, like what time of the day.  So we would publish our features.  Lifehacker publishes its features at 9 a.m., for example, which is 9 a.m. on the West Coast and then noon on the East Coast.  So people are just arriving to work or going to lunch and then that kind of thing.  Normally I would go for like a Tuesday.  You know, if I had a story that I thought could really get legs and it wasn't time dependent, I would go for a Tuesday or a Wednesday.  But yeah, certainly think about that stuff a lot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My wife or son, I mean, was Dane laughed at me because I was going to do a Twitter post that I wanted everybody to see.  And I said, well, I have to wait till five o'clock East Coast.  And he kind of laughed at me and said, you pay attention to when you tweet?  I said, of course, don't you?  You're tweeting the middle of the night.  It's going to be Australia that sees it.  You know, you have to know when you're you have to know where your audience is.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  And I think we've all internalized that without even realizing.  So I mean, I've been trying to do big blog posts every week and I started I did the first one or two on Wednesday, Thursday.  And then I just started doing them Fridays because it was easier to get done for the end of the week.  But it was great because Fridays aren't crowded.  Oh, yeah, there's not as much stuff. Yeah.  And I tended to write the thing where I'm like, well, I want to get the people that are actually going to spend a little bit of time on the weekend looking at this stuff who are a little they're probably a little more hardcore geeks.  Than the people that just do it nine to five Monday to Friday.  And so they get this slow build.  And you also have that that sense of nobody wants to share anything on Twitter or on friend feed if they feel like everybody's already seen it.  They want to be the person sharing that thing first.  The first one. Right.  And that's a lot easier to happen when there's lower noise, lower volume, you know, and there's not such a buzzy environment over the weekend.  And I think this stuff is all directly related to like what Google must be doing with updating their index is thinking about like these behaviors of what you know how sharing and amplification changes what we're writing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You had a couple of home runs, more than a couple, and you know, lately with your blog, we talked about the push button web two weeks ago.  Last week we talked about the web way versus the wave way.  I know you heard that conversation. Is there anything you wanted to add to that?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you all covered it is one of those situations where I did a little bit of work on the writing and then you guys took it into this whole other level.  So it was I mean, it's really exciting. It was like, wow, there's more there than I thought.  I fear people thought I was being very negative about wave and wave is exciting.  Like I'm not anti wave. I just think it's super complicated.  Like as a user, you look at it, you know, like I kind of don't get it.  And I think what Jeff said about this is important enough that we should all be thinking about that as a new way of interacting is absolutely right.  But the actual experience of clicking around it, I felt like was like maybe I'm slow.  I mean, I didn't get friend feed either. So I guess I'm no longer an early adopter.  But like I was like, this is tough. This is tough. And I don't see how this happens.  I think it's a lot more likely we're going to see little bits and pieces of this.  And in the same way that Facebook's not going to do over the whole site to look like friend feed in a day.  Right. They're going to put little bits and pieces out there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's funny because Facebook isn't easier to use than anything else. I don't think.  No. Maybe it's because Facebook gives you little payoffs along the way.  You know, you set up a page and then your first girlfriend says you want to be my friend.  And so, OK. And so there's little hits of payoff along the way, little crumbs for you to follow that drag you through it.  There must be some way of designing this. Say again.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Life knows this, I hope, about your first girlfriend.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm having lunch with my first girlfriend next week. I haven't seen her 36 years.  Was it because of Facebook?  Absolutely. And then my fourth grade girlfriend sent me a note.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Fourth grade, Leo, I'm impressed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, OK. You know, fourth grade, she said, you remember when I used to kick you in the shins?  I said, oh, yeah, that was true love.  In fourth grade, it's just a little more obvious.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  For nine years old, that's pretty good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But, you know, Facebook has trans.  I mean, kind of once I jokingly called Facebook classmates dot com on steroids, but it's gone beyond that.  You have to grow beyond that or you're not going to.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's Google, too.  I argue that young people today won't have the experience that you and I have because they will never lose touch with people.  I, too, lost touch with my high school girlfriend.  And thanks to Google, she found me and I got to apologize for being a cad at age 17.  And for that matter, to find out whatever happened to her and she never would have happened.  You would have gone to our graves never knowing.  And so I think that the impact on friendship and relationships for young people is profound in ways that we can't imagine.  And it's not just Facebook.  It's just the ability for people to have Google shadows and to find them again.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is this brings us full circle to our conversation about who owns your name on the Web and how you can control that.  Because I mean, Facebook's making a play for that.  It certainly did with the vanity URLs, but you still can't Google Leo Laporte and find my Facebook page.  I don't think you can.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  If you have the if you have the vanity URL and you make it public, you can.  But I mean, I think that's a it's an interesting question because why do we assume that an old girlfriend or an old boyfriend is looking for us on Facebook but not on Google?  Like, why is that behavior so normal on Facebook and but creepy and stalkerish if you do it on Google?  No, no, I agree.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There is no, I don't think so.  Well, you guys disagree.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Now I'm curious to hear which one is right.  I don't think so.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's just another way to find people to find old friends and we'll have many ways in the future.  The I'll tell you the difference.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this is exactly the problem.  Facebook faces is that Facebook is all permissions based.  Google's not.  Well, that's the problem.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it's also great asset is you have control over your Facebook.  It is.  And your public.  If you go back to Kevin Marks, it's your public and how you define your public.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yet I think Facebook realizes that that's essentially a walled garden and they don't want to go the way of AOL and Yahoo or whatever.  They don't want to be a content company.  And so they need to they need to somehow create a public face.  I think that's their great challenge.  Google's great challenge is it's all public face.  You don't control it in any way.  They don't have a social.  There's no social graph to Google.  Can Google is wave their attempt to add a social graph?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can Google does Google need a social graph or Gina put up a link to to reader in the social aspects there now.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we have to talk about that because that's a huge shift.  I don't think most reader people will notice it immediately.  What happened there?  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So Google Reader has been adding features.  They've had some social features for a while now, which I have to tell you,  I hadn't used for a while because I spent four years waking up really early when I lived in California to do to write Lifehacker and I would just go through hundreds and hundreds of feeds per day.  And it was a very solitary experience for me.  But now that I'm sort of living a little bit more of a slacker life, I let my friends find stuff.  So I've started following friends in Google Reader, which you can do now.  And it's really great.  I mean, it's really, really great.  And Neil is much more likely to find a link that I'm interested in than if I go by hand through all my feeds.  So this week they added some more social features and you'll see it in the left hand sidebar.  I think it's like one module down.  Basically, people in your Gmail contacts and your contacts list can follow your shared items and what items you liked.  And you can share items with notes.  So it's pretty it's pretty cool.  They are trying to create a social graph here.  I didn't really pay attention to it at first because honestly, I don't think Google is very good at social stuff at all.  They've never really been good at it.  And even this is still kind of awkward.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It doesn't feel right, does it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It doesn't feel right.  It's not it's not fully baked yet.  Part of the issue is that people follow you.  And so the list that you're showing right now on the screen, people follow you.  And on one page you see people are following you and then people who want you to follow them back.  And you have to you can ignore in one list, but you can't in another.  I mean, it's a little it's still a little not fully baked.  We talk about hard to grok.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't understand at all what the yeah, what's going on there.  Yeah, yeah.  And I've been spending a lot of time looking at it.  It is wonky.  It's funny because we say like, oh, they're bad at social.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  But my experience of going into Reader was I already had a buddy list.  It was already populated with a lot of people that I knew that were smart.  There was a lot of good content like you could do a lot worse than than to have that as the starting point, like fixing.  That's true.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's true.  But you know, but it's your it's your Gmail contacts.  So like I don't have contacts in Reader, but I have them in Gmail.  So it connects them.  So that's a little weird.  You're like, oh, and like people are following me and I'm not quite sure how they found me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't even know who these people are.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And you're like, how do they know?  I mean, I have you know, what's missing?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's social without the graph.  It's like there's no connection to my life here.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  These are the opposite experience, which was that my wife was like, oh, Gina shared your post.  She must have liked it.  And I was like, really?  Because I didn't know.  Right.  And you know, we email were connected.  We were on GChat together.  Like, I don't know what some missing part like and I still don't know literally some part  that was missing said, you're not connected and you can't know this.  And so I had to manually go and find it out.  And I think so like those are those are solvable problems.  But like the core thing of are there millions of people here that have already made a list  in GChat or Gtalk or Gmail or whatever G other products there are like that those things  all exist.  I did, you know, briefly have a network on Orchid sometime many years ago.  Oh, yeah.  I remember them.  And I have family in India.  So I actually like they're actually active there.  And yet none of that is tied into it.  And I think part of the reason is the reader team is scared of it because they did share  a couple of years ago.  They had the sharing link and reader and they made it that like you click share and it would  share with everybody that you'd ever emailed on Gmail or something.  And people freaked out.  Right.  It was like this like, oh, you can't scare people's behavior.  And now as a result, they've been so afraid to do that.  They've had to add additional behavior.  So I can go to an individual post that I like and I can star it.  I can share it.  I can share it with a note and I can like it.  And it's gotten.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really too complicated.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  And then and in addition, there's a way to click comment as well.  Like so there's like four different four or five different things you can do.  And I swear to you, I have no idea what they do that are different.  If I like something, I click all of them.  I make them all light up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like share, share with no email.  Let's do it.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  This way I've indicated.  Yeah, I'm really on board with this thing.  But they might as well make them all one switch because I have no idea what they do.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And this week they added Send To this week as well.  They integrated other services so you can send items to.  In fact, that's the real thing that is like that's new this week, the Send To.  And what's cool about that too is that they made it open so you can you can create custom  URLs so you can you can say make this a PDF, for example, and use, you know, service that turns into PDF.  So that's that that was really neat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the first thing I did is I added the Save As PDF.  That was a post.  I can remember the blog, but it was a really great little tip.  And then they've added, you know, they didn't have Friend Feed at first.  They've added Posterous.  They've added Friend Feed.  They've added a few extra sites.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Tumblr's there, which is great.  So so that's pretty cool.  The feature that I really like that that launched this week isn't social at all.  It gives you the it gives you the option to mark all items as red that are older after a certain date.  This is the yeah, this is the feature that I loved in my desktop reader now that I finally have in Google Reader.  So you can say, you know, I've got a news folder that some days I just don't have a chance to look at it.  And I love the idea of being able to say, Mark, everything in this folder that's older than a day, because basically news, it's older than a day.  I'm not going to look at.  So I think it's a day, week and two weeks.  So it's that's awesome.  Really love it.  You know what?  I love the feature, too.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  And I'll disagree.  I think it is a social feature.  I think liberating people from obligation and stress is absolutely necessary as a social feature.  And I think that that's the part with Twitter of like you miss the first page of tweets.  Oh, well, they're gone.  It's OK.  Same thing with Facebook.  And I think I didn't get it like 10 years ago when Dave Winer was talking about River of News.  And I got it much, much later of like being able to have what Kevin Marx is calling a flow that it's OK if you miss some of the flow is essential to social behavior.  If you show up late to a party, you're not like what was every conversation I missed before I got to this party in order for me to have contact.  Show up, you go, you leave, you got to run.  Right.  Something else going on.  No problem.  And so I actually think Mark, all stuff is read is absolutely essential for social features of work.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, this is going to sound funny, but as people reacted to my announcement of my my disease, I found myself letting the Twitter and the friend, the Twitter stuff kind of flowed over me.  Right.  I didn't have to respond.  I was grateful email.  I suddenly felt an obligation to respond.  I don't know why the social conventions of these various media Facebook.  If it was a direct message, I responded.  If it was wall, I didn't.  And and on and on.  I found myself with these built in presumptions about my obligation to respond.  And that's a funny social angle for it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with you.  You know, it's interesting when Kevin Marx did an interesting thing that it makes sense that Kevin would understand how this works better than anybody else.  I don't even know how he did this.  He shared his article that you were talking about, Anil, how Twitter works in theory.  And then he put a little I don't even know how he did this.  A little quote mark that says, I guess that's the note part.  Question for those reading my shared items is sharing my own post like this helpful or redundant.  So there is a social aspect.  I mean, I don't think he's going to get much engagement because of just kind of the difficulty responding to that.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  And here's the bug, too, is that the only reason he's probably even able to share his own post in the RSS readers because there's no way for Google to know he wrote that.  That's a flaw.  It's just another feed.  Right. And that's the thing we have to be able to solve.  Because then then you can actually do some interesting stuff where you can say, I'm the owner of this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They do know, though, they do know through Google through Google profiles.  In fact, this is another feature that launched this week is that you can say, show me all the people in my contacts list and the feeds that they own.  And the feeds that you own, quote unquote, are the ones that you list in your in your Google profile.  So like, Anil, like I was looking at yours and you've got you've got like a buttload of links on your on your Google profile.  That's a metric.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Where do I do that?  Where do I find that?  So that's the other problem is where the hell is there?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  I mean, there's no coherence to the whole Google thing.  And I think this is one of the things they have to reckon with.  I thought about this even if I just want to create content with them, you know, I don't know if it's talk or chat or whatever.  Well, it chats tied into this, too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, somehow, because I see people that are on my chat list.  I somehow are automatically shared or something.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  I don't know.  Go to a wave is yet another one.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Click on browse for stuff and Google readers left hand column.  OK, browse.  And then and then up on the top, which, by the way, what does that even mean?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Browse.  I've got all my feeds here.  Browse what for what stuff?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Imagine the meeting where that came out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you know, we got to add a high level menu item that says under notes, trends, your stuff, browse for stuff.  Huh?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And then click on from people you follow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK, so this is stuff for people I follow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So so there you see a list of people and all their stuff, all their stuff, which they've claimed on Google profiles.  This is the thing.  All these links happen between like disparate products and you're like, oh, these are my Gmail contacts.  Oh, these are links from Google profiles.  But it doesn't even say that.  This also launched this week, which is interesting.  I don't even mean anything.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Right. Like I could claim smarterware.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You could.  There's a way to verify.  And actually, Leo did this.  I haven't done this.  There's a way to claim a site or feed.  Leo, you verified your URLs.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  You've OK.  There's two things you can verify your name.  We talked about that last week.  Google allows you in your Google account to add verified emails.  Oh, email.  Once you've done that, then it knows these domains.  So it's verified domains.  Don't show the email, but it shows on my profile.  Leoville.com, twit.tv and techguylabs.com are verified domains.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Well, and then there's the thing.  Google Webmaster Tools lets you verify that you own a site.  And Google Apps for your domain lets you verify that you own a site.  Those are two completely different mechanisms.  And those are completely untied to this.  I mean, there's just from Google, there's half a dozen ways to say I own this feed.  And even if I've done all of them, which I have, it still doesn't know that reader.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But isn't this, again, whether it's Facebook or Google or someone, the ownership of your  identity is going to be the key hub to all of this idea of getting past Leo's problem  with the blog and having to go there and having to say, who the hell is Gina?  What does she have?  Where is she?  Is it really her?  That's going to be vital.  And no one's won that yet, but it's a huge win if you can get it.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  And the most ridiculous thing is owning a URL and proving you own it is one of the only  problems that is solved.  Like OpenID, you can actually say, I verify, I control this URL.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But can't you say it of others URLs?  Who's verifying that you do in fact own that URL?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  With OpenID, you can't.  It'll actually...  You have to put some JavaScript on it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's only your OpenID canonical URL.  I guess you could put it on all your sites.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah, but you could actually...  There's a thing called delegation where I can say...  So I don't run an OpenID server, but I can say I own dashes.com by pointing it at whatever  provides my OpenID.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I do that with my sites.  So then now that becomes my site because I've put that JavaScript on there.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah, or that little line in the HTML, whatever it is.  But the point is that...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the same with Twitter and with Facebook and with some...  You can't because you don't own those servers.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  That's the problem.  Well, you could even to some degree with Twitter by saying, I'm going to use the authentication,  the OAuth system that they have.  Facebook maybe could do it through Facebook Connect.  I mean, the problem is you're talking about three or four different systems, but it's  three or four.  It's not 100.  And that's the funny thing is that even though we have this ability to say, if nothing else,  I control this one URL where this feed lives, even that ability isn't being used.  And instead, here we are manually typing in, I own this web domain.  And I can still go into Reader and say, I run Smarterware or I run twit.tv and they  can't stop me from saying that right now.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  That's true.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is a huge change, this Reader change though.  It's quietly huge.  It does.  It's quietly huge.  Nobody knows about it.  Well, we're telling them about it.  It's funny because I was moving a little bit away from two things, blogs and RSS readers  because Twitter and the real time web, blah, blah, blah.  And this week, two things, they keep pulling me back.  Two things have pulled me back to the blog and to RSS aggregation.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What do each of you use as your primary RSS reader?  Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google Reader.  Anil?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Google Reader.  And the cool thing about it is it's semi real time now with the PubSubHubbub stuff they did.  Any feed that updates shows up in real time and Reader, it blinks for me.  And I think that's going to be there for everybody soon.  That's crazy.  Pretty cool.  That's actually as compelling as what FriendFeed or Twitter are doing.  Pretty cool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's going to be huge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I use Google Reader also.  How about you, Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm still on NetNewsWire.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I use NetNewsWire too because it syncs with Google Reader.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, now it does.  So you still use it.  It's hard for me to adjust.  I like Google Reader.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm using both NetNewsWire and Google Reader.  But that's good because I can now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The one feature that Google Reader doesn't have yet, and actually this was going to be in our wishlist section, but I'll say it now.  They're adding all these social features, which are cool, but you still can't subscribe to a passworded feed in Google Reader.  It doesn't handle private feeds, which isn't that big a deal to most people, but it is kind of a big deal for web applications you have to log into to get data.  I just don't understand.  That's the one reason.  That's a weird thing not to have.  Yeah, that's why you use a desktop newsreader.  One, hit the refresh button.  We talked about this.  Hit the refresh button.  You know you're getting the latest.  Google's going to solve that, or hopefully Google Reader is going to have that with the real-time updates.  But then the second one is private feeds from your web-based project management app, for example.  That kind of thing.  So I'm interested to see them build that in.  I would imagine they would have built that in before this stuff.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  That one feels like a tech problem, right?  There's a million things that can go wrong with passwords.  You're storing passwords for people's feeds.  People can share items in their public page that were formerly private.  It opens up a can of worms, and it's much easier to say, no, we can't.  Right, right, right, right.  Than to really solve it, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh man, we have to wrap it up because Jeff's got pizza.  But I just want to keep talking about this.  I guess we'll just have to do another episode and another and another and another.  Anil, I want to thank you so much for joining us.  You can stick around for, we do a little thing if you want and throw in some comments.  We do a little thing at the end.  And the last thing we do is our wish list.  So if you have a feature, a Google feature or something that you'd like Google to fix, you can think about that right now.  But we're going to start with Gina's tip of the week, which I think you might have already done.  But go ahead.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh yes, actually, no, I didn't.  So this week, this week, really super simple one to get friendly with your J and K keys on your keyboard  because those move you up and down items in Gmail, Google Reader, and in Google search results if you're in the keyboard extension.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And in search results.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, there's an experimental Google search that you can join.  And in fact, the link to this entire tip is on my blog.  You can join an experiment where if you do a Google search, a little pointer will be next to the top result.  And you can use the J key, the K key to move up and down the list.  And then you can hit enter to open up one of those links or shift enter to open a new tab.  So this works.  So in Gmail, you have to actually enable keyboard shortcuts in order to use the J and K key.  And this has precedence in Vim.  J and K moves your cursor up and down.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, do you think it's really it's V.I. that inspired this?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Geek from Google.  You are a geek.  You are a geek.  That wouldn't surprise me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It absolutely is.  If they start doing EMAX key bindings, then I'm going to be impressed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think so.  I mean, I mean, the advantage is J and K isn't easy to remember for your brain, right?  But it's easy for your fingers, because if you're a touch typist, your forefinger rests on the J key.  And a lot of keyboards, the J key has like a little nub on it.  So if you have your forefinger and your second finger, you can move up and down a list in reader and Gmail.  And if you join that search experiment in search results.  And I have to tell you, once you start using J and K, like you just can't you won't ever go back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is why Gina is the best.  Something that little can make a huge difference.  That's fantastic.  I mean, I knew about it in Gmail, but I didn't realize it extended to reader and search.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  And there's I mean, there's a ton of other keyboard shortcuts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Enter slash escape.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So my blog post has links to all the rest of them as well.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wasn't it control H that backspace from the old backspace?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And and and Bell Bell control G if we can bring back control G.  I want to ring a bell.  That's the one key that's gone.  I guess probably that's all for the better.  Your stat of the week, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the number is two hundred thousand.  I have a project for the with the City University of New York graduate school, the journalism, where I teach in new business models for news.  There are some and the research we did, we're going to present a lot of models at Aspen Institute on Monday.  And you can go to news innovation dot com and watch me do it on Prezi.  I hope if you're not a jinx, Leo.  But the most astounding number we found is that there are hyper local bloggers who aren't necessarily good at business,  who nonetheless are pulling in two hundred thousand dollars a year in advertising.  And we believe that with if there were if a paper dies and there are metro wide networks and smaller networks and other things,  we believe a hyper local blogger could be making up to three hundred thirty thousand dollars a year gross.  So it's a real business in a real new way, as long as the newspapers don't think they own the entire market because they can't anymore.  So two hundred K.  It's a wonderful number.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That was that's kind of the Lou Grant argument.  You're never going to get any blogger to go sit in a city council meeting for every day for three months.  Of course you are. That's exactly what they do.  They love it. They're crazy, but they love it.  Two hundred thousand a year. Is that from it must be Google AdSense, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, it's from selling to local advertisers.  And we think the services they sell to those advertisers.  And if you can bring in metro wide advertising and local networks and a little bit of e-commerce and other revenue,  as I say, after three years, we see local bloggers making pretty easily three hundred three hundred fifty thousand dollars,  which doesn't sound insane when you realize that a community weekly paper in that market can pull in almost a million dollars a year in advertising.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wow, that's encouraging. That's really encouraging.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  At the journalism school where I teach, this made us realize that we damn well better offer a course in how to be a hyper local blogger.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, how do you be a hyper local blogger?  Because I could I could use the money. You go cover that boring meeting.  You got to do your own sales, too, though, it sounds like.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or sell. You go. So we're also looking at the notion of citizen sales that maybe the journalist doesn't sell.  But the neighbor down the way, the real true has extra time on her hands to sell the advertising and make a business out of that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very exciting. Thank goodness. I'm really pleased to hear that.  My tip of the week very quickly, we kind of started to talk about it a little bit.  And it's this new send to actually is my tool of the week.  And Google reader really deserves to be the tool. There's so much in it.  I can't you know, I can't break it down. I mean, it's just it's just out of control.  And this came from a blog. Actually, it's an Indian blog.  I mean, our girl, our girl does it. He's an Indian blogger.  It's an excellent blog called Digital Inspiration.  Kind of is great. Yeah. It's like a life hacker, really. Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. He was great. We we we put link to him all the time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, life hacker link to this. Download your Google reader stories as PDF.  He describes how you can take this new send to button.  This is kind of fascinating because it's only been out for, you know,  what it came out this week, right? I think. Yep.  And already people have got these great things you can do.  And it's partly because Google made it open.  So send to started with a few basic social sites like Delicious, of course, and Facebook.  They've added friend feed, I'm happy to say.  But you can easily add save as PDF using a PDF to mail system that's free.  And and also email this using a system, a free email system that will email,  by the way, even if it's, you know, it drives me crazy.  Hacker News, could you please put the full text in your feed?  Please. All they put is the headline. But if you get something like that,  you use the email this, you'll get the whole blog post, which is really nice.  So using Web to Mail dot com. So take a look at I'll put a link to what's already in our friend feed room  and in our delicious notes, by the way, are delicious tags.  If you go to delicious dot com slash twit slash twig, you'll see what Gina, Jeff and I have tagged for the show.  And we also put it into their conversations room, which is a friend feed dot com slash twit dash twig.  And in fact, your comments would be appreciated if you go in there.  Only Gina and I and Jeff can add stories to there, but anybody can comment on those stories.  And it would really be great to get your comments on those.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, there's an example. If we could just put up one place and it goes to all, wouldn't life be nicer?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's where aggregation has some power. We got to solve this.  In fact, Gina, I think you you you started a conversation there.  Is this the beginning of the distributed social web? I mean, that's really what we need, isn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Some sort of distribution system, federation, reverse aggregation that puts it in our hands.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So take a look at that. The meat does a great job in explaining how to do this.  And it's really thanks to Google because they've they've added some very simple ways to to add features in the settings.  It's in your settings page of your Google reader. And now our wish list.  OK, you've had a chance to think.  And Neil, is there anything, anything at all that you wish Google would do?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  That's a tough one to be on the spot for.  I. I feel like I wish they would bring together the 10 different services that are using my Google Contacts list  and get the one guy or gal on each of those teams that owns the user experience and get them all in a room together  and have them kind of reconcile, have a little group hug and say, this is one great list and you're all using it.  Let's think about how we can have a good experience there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you have any insight into the corporate? Anybody?  You wrote what would Google do, Jeff? Anybody have an insight into why Google is is so kind of schizophrenic and disjointed?  Is it a corporate? Is it is it a corporate culture problem?

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  My my experience is they've chosen to do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what Neil that says that's what they want.  Now, you would agree, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think so. And and they've you know, whether that's a feature or a bug, I don't know.  But they've turned it into that, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it the 20 percent time that causes the problem?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They've all got more about management by chaos.  It's more about allowing creativity to occur.  And with that comes chaos. Right.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the 80 percent time that it causes the problem.  I mean, I think there's there's this willingness to say we're going to let five people run off and be a team and do this,  which is commendable and has great results.  And as a result also has this flip side, which is they're not talking.  They're not talking. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wave was created in Australia.  Gina, is there anything on your wish list?  As if I didn't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  My my my wish is much more sort of nuts and bolts.  I brought up the private fee thing in Google Reader.  There's also and actually, Leo, you and I should talk about Gmail a little more.  There's a weird thing in Gmail.  Gmail doesn't support wildcard search.  So like if I wanted to search for, you know, the subject line, thank you.  If I search for the, you know, T.H.A.N. star, it doesn't come up.  So I'm all about these like little nitty gritty features.  Every once in a while I run across these.  So wildcard search would be good in Gmail as it would be language search.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I hate to tell you, but in fact, this was almost going to be my tip.  There's a new program just came out for the iPhone.  I'm sorry to say called Remail.  It's a very interesting idea.  This is a Y Combinator, a startup.  It downloads all your Gmail under your iPhone and allows you to search it.  Now, I don't know if it does wildcard, but it's very fast search.  And what's interesting is they're not downloading attachments.  They've got I mean, I have several gigs on Gmail.  They got it to a couple hundred megabytes.  Really? Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Does it do like can you search like from Gina?  Does it do advanced operators like just subject?  Does it do advanced operators like just subjects or just from lines or that kind of thing?  Or is it just a general cross all fields kind of search?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It looks like it's a cross all fields search.  So it would be nice to have some Boolean and some wildcards.  But at least I now you know, because everything's stored in my email.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it works with any IMAP server.  I use fast mail, not Gmail.  It works fine.  But now it does take a while.  That first download.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It takes a little.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  You leave it on overnight.  Yeah.  It's funny.  There's so much focus on searching email and Gmail search is pretty good.  I wish I could search my instant messages, the ones that aren't on Gtalk.  Oh, that's interesting.  I get as much information through, you know, instant messenger as I do through email.  And you save all the conversations?  I save all the logs, but searching them is a pain in the butt.  And I certainly can't do it on my phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I bet you Gina could write you a text command that would do that.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  I don't think that solves the problem for everything.  I mean, having a genius at hand doesn't stand a little sad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A little awk, a little grep.  You got it all.  There's no problem.  Can we get a bash shell command here?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'll send you guys a check later on.  You know you could do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're just holding out on us.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  I actually think the convention is when you do a program for me, I'm supposed to send  you the check, but I don't know.  I don't know how your system works.  Maybe Google's got you.  This could be a better one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like it.  It's the new Gina Trapani system.  I got a wish.  I got two wishes.  First, send me this gosh darn wave invite.  I'm ready.  I'm waiting.  Hurry up.  I guess they're going to send out a bunch in September, right?  100,000 in September?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think that they have been sending them out kind of in waves.  I heard there was sort of a batch recently.  Leo, you don't have an invite?  I thought you said you tried it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I tried it with a friend who had an invite.  Ah.  It's not the same.  But the point is, if you don't send out invites to a lot of people, it's pointless anyway,  as you experienced.  Because Leo, we're all in a wave together.  Oh, shut up.  I don't know if you're...  Shut up.  I know you are.  I could just tell.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Except everything is changing so fast, I have no idea what's going on in the wave.  So I'm just going to talk to you guys.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is.  It's like all moving at once.  It's going to be a squirmy kind of feeling when you have 80 people.  Dave, stop those crazy things.  There are going to be 80 people in a wave, and it's just going to be...  That's why I want to see what it looks like.  My second one is, voice is so great.  Google voice is so great.  And those of us who have it have been singing its praises.  I know they're starting to send out invites.  I want to get one from my family, my wife and kids.  I want my kids to have one phone number now that they keep for the rest of their life.  And it sounds like voice would be a good way to do that.  So let's get those invites out to Google.  Let's start.  In fact, you know, you could let us invite friends.  That'd be nice.  Just a little invite button on there.  Jeff, do you have a wish?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I agree with you, Leo.  I want to wave invite.  And then listening to the conversation about Reader,  I think they've got to hire a designer from Apple.  Simplicity works in search, but they've lost their simplicity in other areas,  and they've got to find a way to regain the zen.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  I would rather they hire a designer from Flickr.  I think, you know, Yahoo's got to be bleeding good people.  Might be available right now.  I was going to say, I think that would be too hard.  And Flickr has that, you know, that game feeling to it.  What you were talking about earlier, Leo, of like the reward structure.  You know, Flickr was built on a game platform, and it shows.  There's rewards all over the place, and Reader has chores all over the place.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Flickr was built on a game platform.  I didn't know that.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Game never ending was what Ludicorps built originally  and then turned very quickly into a photo sharing service.  And so its mechanisms and mechanics, its reward structures are all built  to support a game engine.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was as accidental as Blogger was.  Yeah.  Well, they missed a bet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They could have hired Paul and company from FriendFeed.  I think they could have turned Reader into something, but.  Except none of us here could figure out FriendFeed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, that's true.  And we all use Reader every day.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  Isn't that telling?  Yeah, we still use it.  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, what a great show.  Anil, thank you so much for being a part of it today.  Thanks.

Speaker: Anil Dash
Transcript:  This has been a blast.  I've been fans of all of you for forever.  So I'm like, I'm geeked out just to be here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we're going to get you back.  There's no question about it.  We really appreciate you taking the time.  Anil is vice president at Six Apart, and he blogs at dashes.  That's his.  He owns it.  Don't you dare mess with it.  It's his place on the web.  I dare you.  I dare you.  Knock this dash off my shoulder.  Gina Tripani, thank you so much.  Always a pleasure to have you on.  I look forward to doing a lot more with you.  Smarterware.org is a place we can get her to write a command line utility to do anything.  Thank you so much.  Anything.  Anything at all.  This is really fun.  Oh, so much fun.  Jeff Jarvis, thank you for being here at buzzmachine.com.  Go get your pizza.  Will do.  Thanks for being with us.  A little program note.  We will start the show a little bit early from now on so that Jeff does get pizza night  on Saturday.  So if you want to watch us do this live, you can live.twit.tv.  It'll be starting at 2 15 Pacific.  That's 5 15 Eastern time every Saturday.  And we're going to have a whole new studio the next time we're on.  So thank you all for being here.  The audio, the new audio system comes in.  It's all digital.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know if it's going to be better or worse.  We'll see.  It could be the Google reader of audio systems.  I don't know.  Very nervous.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bye.
