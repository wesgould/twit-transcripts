Senior Editor at Lifehacker.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  How long have you been there?  Two years. That makes you senior in the Gawkerverse.  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Boy does it.  You have something on Nick, don't you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, not really.  No, no, no, no.  Jeff Jarvis is also here, author of What Would Google Do?  His blog Smart Machine.  I'm sorry.  I mixed Buzz Machine and SmarterWear.  BuzzerWear.  From BuzzMachine.com.  BuzzMachine.com is the website.  Also here from SmarterWear.org, Gina Trapani, also author of The Complete Wave Guide to Google.  The Complete Google Guide to Wave.  The Complete Guide to Google Wave.  There you go.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  At CompleteWaveGuide.com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yay, I got it all eventually.  Hello, kids.  Now you didn't get your slanket.  I'm sorry to say, Jeff.  No, I didn't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'd be wearing it now, but my postal service is clearly behind.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you actually benefit because Gina and I have had the experience of being slanketed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, we have.  I have a black shirt on right now.  I couldn't put the slanket on because it would be red.  Red fuzz.  Yeah.  It's like a mafia napkin.  Yeah.  It's heavenly though.  The slanket is heavenly.  And it will be in Austin next week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Precise.  Oh, will it?  Good.  I'll bring mine as well.  It's a bit of a thing to pack.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is.  I was like, why did Leo ship this to me here?  I got to get this in my bag.  I should have brought it to Austin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I should have shipped it to Austin, but then you'd have to bring it home.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You should have shipped those things where you can vacuum suck the air out into a plastic  bag.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, good call.  Excellent.  Excellent.  Today we talk about all the Google stories and I guess story number, well, I don't know,  shopping spree, story number one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, can we talk about the Guglurian chant for a minute while we're on the slanket?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have a Guglurian chant.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Did you see that?  That was just incredible.  Are we going to play that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You want me to play it?  I think we should.  I don't even know how to find it.  I guess if I search for Guglurian chant, I'll Google-lurian.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There was something on the friend feed.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's on the friend feed.  Leo, your Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I tweeted it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You tweeted it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I have to thank the guy who sent it to us.  Let me find it and play it.  It scared me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I couldn't listen to it.  I suppose we should do that last.  I suppose the chant is...  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we'll do.  It's Rob Houghton did it for us.  Because we were talking last week about wearing our slankets, which looked like monks robes,  and walking down the streets of Austin humming the Guglurian chant.  I'll tell you what, I'll just play a little bit of it and then I'll play the full version  for you at the end of the show.  How about that?  It is dramatic.  It is beautiful.  It is very, very Guglurian.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You get the idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very good.  It goes on for a couple minutes and it gets very jazzy.  And people have been complaining, and I don't blame them, about the silly music that I started  this show with.  Some silly classical thing.  I had this notion that there would be the three of us and it was kind of like we were  fuging with each other and I should do some counterpoint.  It just was a bad idea.  So we'll find a better theme.  And this might be the this might be ending.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  It sounds very cloudy though, the classical theme.  That was the idea.  It was Google in the cloud.  That's exactly right.  You introduced it as like not just about Google with the cloud too.  I think it works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The problem with theme music is unless you use real music, it all sounds like bad local  news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And now the action news team.  Gina Trapani with sports, Jeff Jarvis with the weather and Kevin Purdy with the news.  Doesn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's feeling very anchorman right now.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Screw you, San Diego.  No, I wasn't quite like that.  Anyway, stay classy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to do my best.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Not that I ever have been.  So you there we go.  You wanted to start with the good Gloria and we have and thanks to Rob for that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Isn't that great?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's we have a wonderful, wonderful community.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And the lyrics are the lyrics are on the drop.  I don't know if we if we if you posted them somewhere else, but the lyrics aren't easy  to hear.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It says in the name of Larry and Sergey and Eric Schmidt, Google will do no evil and will  serve the user.  We will do it quickly and do it well.  All love and consciousness is given to the holy algorithm.  So says this Gugorian chant.  That's the Mustang.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  It's really funny.  It says then it says, can the old farts in the back row get the written lyrics?  Yes.  Thank you.  We got it as one of them.  So Picnic was one of the acquisitions.  What else did Google buy?  Have they been they've been buying a lot of stuff?  Doc verse.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, that's those the two big ones.  What is Doc worst?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Doc verse.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Doc verse.  Not first.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I haven't used it, but I think it's a plug in to Microsoft Office that lets you sync  files to the cloud.  Oh, I was using it.  It's a shot across the ballot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft is what it is.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Sync and edit and collaborate on.  I gave it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So our our chief financial officer here, we were making her use Google spreadsheet and  she said it's too slow.  It's too awful.  I need to use Excel.  So I gave her this doc verse so she could use Excel with Google Docs, which is what  we you know, we all we're all Google Docs, all about Google Docs here.  It's a great idea.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So does it sync the documents to Google Docs or is it a separate server?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's it's that's a good question.  Apparently it's very transparent.  And my sense is it basically.  Let's you use it as if Excel is a Google Doc, although right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Like it's so the documents located in the cloud and you can collaborate and change the sync to the cloud.  This is a lot like Microsoft Live workspace, which actually I which I've been using for my book.  My copy editor said I want to work in Word and we're just you know, Google Docs just didn't have certain  features, advanced features that we needed, like building a table of contents and that kind of thing.  So Google Docs does a lot, but not not all the stuff that word does.  So we started using Microsoft Live workspace, which means that, you know, I download the file to Word, edit it.  And when I save it, it saves back up to the cloud and it worked.  I was surprised at how well it worked.  Sorry, Microsoft.  But it sounds like Docverse is is the same thing.  Right. So this is just Google's way of saying if Docs doesn't do what you want, well, you can use Word and Excel on your desktop,  but you can sync to the cloud.  So it makes it makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Ars Technica says it's a lot.  It's also a direct competitor for SharePoint, which is I guess it's one of the Microsoft products that even open source geeks are kind of like the ones that I know seem to be the most popular.  So I think that's a good way to enjoy SharePoint, at least, you know, find it a pretty good product.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, if you I mean, if Google wants to make a credible sharing system, if it wants businesses to move to Google apps, it needs to have a lot of those features.  And the problem is that businesses use Office.  Right.  Right now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I can save an Excel spreadsheet to my office, I mean, my apps space and and then use it.  So I'm not sure exactly what Docverse does that's different.  I guess it's versioning is the difference.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And also bridging the gap in compatibility, like Gina was saying, you know, there's little and you were saying to these little tiny compatibility problems.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, but I'm saying I can use I can use Excel with Google Docs.  And so I create a spreadsheet with Excel.  So I get all the Excel features.  I save it up to Google Docs and it's there and then I share it.  And so anybody who's using Excel can get it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You mean you upload it to Google Docs as a file like or or you import it into Google Docs and now the spreadsheet is in Docs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can open it. No, no, we continue to use Excel.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm you know, I'm going to have to play with this because she's been using it and I'm not sure how she's doing it.  And I'm not sure exactly how it works.  Maybe somebody in the chat room can give us a tip how this is different from what Docverse does.  But it is clearly the right thing for Google to do.  And it is a shot across Microsoft's bow, of course.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, no doubt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Google Docs lacks the versioning that they're saying the versioning capability of Docverse.  And that's very important.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Very much so, especially when you have a copy editor who.  Yeah, who did what when?  Track changes was a huge thing that I use with my book, you know, accepting those changes and that kind of thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good. So this is I for one am happy about this because SharePoint is expensive.  You've got to run a server. It's a big deal.  It's heavy. And, you know, I don't want to run.  We use we use a hosted exchange server that gives us SharePoint capability.  But it seems like overkill for what we were just so happy with Google Docs.  And it's just a few of us where it's these special cases like your editor who has to use Word or my CFO who has to use Excel.  Those are the places where Google has been a little bit behind.  And I think this is great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it makes tons of sense of Google is trying to hit the enterprise with Google apps of Docs, you know, Docs, you know, apps for enterprise is going to include Docs.  They can say, hey, you can just, you know, install this plug in for Microsoft Office and you're using Google Docs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And as I remember, it was free.  Go ahead.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  They also just introduced the the universal any file upload Google Docs just did.  So that's what I've been using.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's that new feature that I was using that led me to load Excel.  It doesn't matter what file it is.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  You can get a gig of space, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. So basically what it is, is kind of it's like using Dropbox or something as a shared storage, but it's not smart about what's going on.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. I mean, this you're editing the document, you hit control S to save it and it saves it directly to the cloud.  You know, you're not you're not, you know, manually uploading versions or anything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and the simultaneous, you know, even Excel doesn't have locking.  You have to use SharePoint to have multiple users on an Excel spreadsheet.  This does that, too. And that's huge.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's huge.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's really huge.  OK, so the other company they bought is Picnic.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And one more.  So I've been using Picnic on Flickr.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does this leave does it leave Flickr now?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, there was a story about top six questions about Picnic.  Let me see if I can find it again.  P-I-C-N-I-K.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Completely confusing spelling.  But it's a photo editor.  I you know, when you're on Flickr and you want to flip a photo or crop a photo or do some minor touch up, Picnic is a really handy way to do it.  It's not going to replace Photoshop by any means.  But obviously, Google's plan is to make it part of Picasa Web, I would presume, or maybe even I don't know.  What do they need this for?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is a Chrome OS thing.  Oh, this is my this is my theory.  This is this is Google just saying, hey, look, you've got a photo editor right on your on your non desktop.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because every any Linux user, any any OS user, the first question is, can I run Photoshop on it?  Exactly.  Always there are something like Photoshop.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, that's very interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, this is definitely this is a Chrome OS move.  I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So should we expect Google to acquire more web based technologies like Picnic to add capability to Chrome OS?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Is there is there a web based version of Final Cut out there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  Wait a minute.  I think there is.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is there any that's as good as that's actually?  Well, you can't maybe do avatar on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you know what?  You know what? I'm thinking about Picnic versus versus be Photoshop.  This pisses me off every time I launch it because it takes 25 minutes to launch because it's got so much and all I want to do is crop a photo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm really surprised that Google didn't acquire Aviary.  Are you familiar with Aviary?  This is this is like Photoshop.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  This is really powerful for being a cloud based app.  It's it's scary almost.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's an image editor, color editor, effects editor, vector editor.  So it's got kind of freehand.  It's got screen capture.  It's got image markup.  It has now an audio editor.  I think the photo or a video editor is probably just around the corner from this company.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Just last week, Aviary also went totally free.  They had been charging a premium for I think like making your files private and such.  But now Aviary is a totally free online app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, here's the question.  All this stuff uses Flash, right?  Yes, Aviary does.  Does Google Picnic uses Flash too?  Right.  Does Google really want to get in the business of Flash tools on Chromium OS?  That's a good question.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That is how hard is it to port this to port something like this to HTML5?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is it possible?  It's possible, but I don't think it's easy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I think that if you've done everything in ActionScript, you've done it in ActionScript.  It's not.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and the issue is really like support, you know, browser support to right now.  What you'd really want is a JavaScript version of these.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, maybe that's why they didn't do Aviary, because Aviary really is very, very tight.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  We posted on Lifehacker last week an app called Sketchpad, mugtug.com slash sketchpad.  And that's all HTML5.  That's what you want.  Yeah, it's pretty impressive actually for I mean, it's only got 12 tools, a few sliders and a few controls.  But it's a pretty impressive app for, you know, totally coded in HTML5.  No Flash, no Silverlight, no, you know, right on your browser.  Yeah, this is really cool.  Yeah, no question.  This is super cool.  I mean, and Google is a pretty big proponent of HTML5.  I could see them working with the, you know, working with the Picnic folks to transition, or at least I hope.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So am I wrong or is it strikes me that, well, I can tell you one reason I thought Picnic was Flash is because it wouldn't load in my Safari browser, which is Flash is screwed up on it.  Let me see.  It may just be the front page is Flashy.  I don't know.  I'm pretty sure Picnic is Flash based, but maybe not.  Maybe it's Java.  Java is OK to Chrome, Chrome MOS, right?  Or are they trying to do everything HTML5?  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  And is Flash definitely out on Chrome OS?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, you gotta be able to use Flash or else you're in the same boat as having an iPhone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but you would ultimately you'd want...  Yeah, right.  You'd want Lulu and stuff, right?  I mean, that's all Flash.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But what's the problem with that?  I think Google's own apps would make perfect sense on HTML5, but they're not going to eliminate Flash because it'll piss us all off.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Picnic is written in Flex, which is Adobe's Flash based framework.  So it is effectively Flash.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  Now, that's a really interesting question.  I just assumed that Google was as dogmatic as it is.  Maybe they're not.  I mean, wouldn't they want to be standards based?  I mean, you might include Flash compatibility for flexibility, but you really want to be standards based.  Right.  But that's going to be a case with her hiring her team.  Yes, that's right.  Google's done that before.  Yeah, plenty of times.  Yeah, but I think that's a really interesting question.  I mean, I think that's a really interesting question.  I mean, I think that's a really interesting question.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you know, when you have a device like the iPad coming out with video capabilities without Flash, but with the ability to watch video, I mean, you also don't want to ship Chrome OS for netbooks without the ability to watch video or stream audio using Flash.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And I mean, because the only option is Flash, right?  Because there's nothing but the browser.  So it seems like even though Apple made the decision not to include Flash and Google has an interest in not including Flash, I mean, the only option is Flash, right?  It still seems like they've got a really good reason to include it.  So people can play games and watch video.  Right.  Right.  But if they release the Chrome OS netbook without Hulu on it, that'll be the headline for the next three days.  I mean, after they release it, like, where's Hulu?  Where's Hulu?  Yeah.  Oh, man, though, if I were Google, I wouldn't want to support it because it's not going to be a good option.  Right.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I mean, I think that's a really interesting question.  I mean, I think that's a really interesting question.  I mean, I think that's a really interesting question.  So, I think that's a really interesting question.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, man, though, if I were Google, I wouldn't want to support Hulu.  I mean, Hulu is the enemy if you're YouTube.  Hey, by the way, big profits for YouTube, at least according to one analyst.  We're going to talk about that in just a little bit.  Also, the Apple lawsuits.  Before we do that, though, let me mention our friends at GoToAssist Express.  GoToAssist is a product from Citrix, which does remote access, of course, and they're the kings of remote access.  They created it for Windows NT.  Microsoft licensed it.  And in enterprise, Citrix is the name.  But they've got consumer applications that are just fantastic.  They go to me and go to my PC.  This is one not exactly for consumers.  It's for the support professional, the IT person or somebody who has software to support.  I have to say I use it because I am my mother's support person.  And so when mom needs some help, I just fire up GoToAssist.  Now, the beauty of this is she didn't have to have it installed.  In fact, we were just Skyping.  And she said, I got a problem with I think I can't figure out where my Quicken data is.  So I did is I had GoToAssist installed in my system, by the way, Mac or PC.  And I just said, OK, fine, here's a link.  Click this.  Said it in the Skype chat.  She clicked the link.  Within seconds, GoToAssist was installed and I was able to fix the problem like that.  GoToAssist is designed for support for several reasons.  You can do it unattended.  So once she installed it and gave me permission to, I can get into her system any time I want.  Up to eight sessions at a time makes it great for fixing one computer, moving to the next, the next, the next, running the scanner, antivirus.  Oh, this is great. This is so handy.  I can drag a file.  Let's say I have malware bytes or some tool that I need to put on their system.  It's on my desktop.  I just drag it to their desktop and then I can run it on their system.  That's just really a fantastic product.  I want you to try it free.  They do have day passes for people who do occasional support.  But really, this is for the professional.  Go to gotoassist.com slash twig and you'll get 30 days free.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  This is a great product.  I highly recommend it.  I've been using it for years.  And if you're in the support business, this will make you a hero.  Go to assist.com slash twig.  So what was the third acquisition, Jeff Jarvis?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was wrong.  I was wrong.  The point was not that it was re-mailed from a few weeks ago.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, they did buy that a couple of weeks ago.  They did.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the news on it is that they made the re-mail software open source.  I can't imagine Apple's happy with.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  So re-mail, by the way, which I think Apple knocked off the store, didn't they?  I think it's gone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think Google removed it from the app store.  Google did it.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So re-mail was a great program, which I used to download your entire Gmail database,  everything onto your phone.  And since your phone has some memory, everything's there and searchable.  Yeah.  Google said that they didn't really want that capability.  They liked the search heuristics or something like that, right?  Another engineering acquisition.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, this seems like they just really wanted the developer.  I mean, why would they?  I mean, they pull the app from the app store and then they open source the code,  which how many iPhone apps do you know are open source?  I didn't even think that the terms of your agreement as an Apple developer that you could do that.  I bet you that's why they pulled it off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  So they pull it off the app store.  They open source the code and the developer basically says,  hey, I would love to see this code as the basis of new iPhone apps  that do cool stuff with your email.  Grab the code and don't worry about having to do all the work  of grabbing the mail and having it all in a local database.  I've done that work for you so you can make some new cool apps.  So I think that's awesome.  I hope some developers do grab that code.  If I cared about developing for the iPhone,  I would be certainly poking through it.  But interesting.  It sounds like they, I mean, to me, that sounds like they just wanted the engineer.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And the engineer himself, Gabor, was a, he was an intern in Gmail's engineering department.  And he left and then he created this iPhone app and now he's back.  That's a great revolving door, isn't it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It must feel good though to be an intern and then get the job based on what you did.  That's awesome.  That is kind of fantastic.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  He's a really responsive developer too.  So good luck to him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I just found my database was so huge that it took a long time even over Wi-Fi  to get the Gmail database.  It took forever.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So that's some fancy compression stuff, right?  I mean, that could get you home.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It took gigabytes and made it megabytes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Hundreds of megabytes, but still megabytes.  No, I liked it.  I guess I still have it, right?  I mean, you can't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is this the beginning of the solution of the offline email for Chrome OS?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ah, maybe.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what it sounds like to me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Historically, you know, I think about Jaiku, for instance, where you would say,  oh, well, they hired Uri and Petri to do a Twitter clone.  No.  Or they hired them to do this or that.  And historically, it seems like they just hire the talent, not necessarily to do the same thing.  Yeah, it looks like, do I still have it?  Maybe not.  They can't pull it off my phone, can they?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I imagine this compression, this fancy compression magic is available in the code.  I mean, in the code, which is out there and published.  So that's kind of interesting.  Well, I'm sure they're just doing like limbo zip or something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You think there's something better than that?  I mean, it's just text.  Right.  Google doesn't compress it at all, in theory, right?  They just leave it the way it is.  Right, right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But how does it handle like attachments?  It didn't pull attachments.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It only pulls the text.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, OK. So it was just text.  OK.  OK.  So this was an engineer acquisition then.  This was just, you're smart.  We like you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I'm sure he was using limbo zip.  Why would you try?  I mean, how would you come up with something better?  If you did, that's much more important than re-mail.  Right.  Hey, speaking of developments, good news for swipe users.  Thank you, Gina, perhaps.  Thank you, Gina.  Yes, thank you.  Nice job, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know if I had anything to do with this.  Of course you did.  I mean, you know, the CEO emailed me and said, hey, like, you know, maybe let's chat.  And I didn't get a chance to talk to him before the show today.  So the swipe team released a limited Android beta.  So you can go to the swipe.com, you can sign up for the beta and you can download swipe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They send you an email first.  Uh-huh.  OK.  Yeah.  And then you have to, then you have, it's complicated, but it didn't seem like, I mean,  it seemed like it was automatic and instant.  It wasn't like I had to get approved or anything.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So now like a week ago, they're saying do not use the leaked unauthorized version of  swipe because that and that's not even our business model.  We're not even going to offer it in the market.  We're just going to, you know, OEM licensing is our business model.  And this week they're there.  They have this limited beta.  So, so in a way, hey, that's great.  I'm glad for the swipe team.  It sounds like they learned.  It sounds like they realized that user feedback is a good thing and that people who like it.  It's an asset.  It's an asset.  Yes.  I'm not clear whether or not swipe is going to be available in the market.  I can't tell if this beta is just to get feedback to help them with their licensing.  Or to shut you up.  Or to shut me up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They say, they say very clearly when you install it, now there are some features missing that  we can only do on OEM phones.  So I think it's a freemium thing.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Is the annoying beta, you know, this does resolutionism.  Yeah, that's gone.  It doesn't do that anymore.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It just works.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Was that, is that a new business model they stumble into, which is release the freemium  model and create consumer demand to sell it for you to the phone companies?  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it looks beautiful.  It looks better than the beta did.  Right, Gina?  I mean, it's really nice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I have not, I have not installed it.  I switched to Shapewriter.  I was a little annoyed with them with swipe.  I got to say, I have to say, I'm really happy that they, I feel like they, they, they, they  made the right decision.  They kind of, I felt like it was a mistake.  Their initial response.  I think that this is great that they're doing the beta, but I've kind of moved on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh man, don't cross Gina.  She's just tough.  Golly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think, I think it's great.  I think it's great that they did it.  And I think you should, if you're interested in going back to swipe to try it, go for it.  But I didn't, I actually didn't sign up for the beta myself.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It really works really well.  Move on to gestures now.  Yeah, it's, yeah, gestures is, well, yeah, yeah, now I'm going to steal that from my  tool, but you can talk about it if you want.  Cause it's Gina tweeted it and that's when, or buzzed it.  And that's when I found it.  So you get credit for it, but I was going to be my tool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No credit.  No credit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll talk about gestures later.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Let's talk about it later.  You can, you can explain.  Please save my tool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I won't touch your tip if you don't touch my tool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I wasn't going to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you just did.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I said it.  I got, I got no pride.  None at all.  And none of us are going to go anywhere near Jeff's number.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, we wouldn't do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So some of the things that Kevin, when, when you, when we emailed Kevin, he said he'd like  to talk about is one of his rants on life hacker.  Why it doesn't pay to be Google's guinea pig.  Are you Google's guinea pig, Kevin?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Well, on the whole, I'm a pretty big user of Google and whatnot.  I'm running Chrome right now.  What I wrote about was, you know, it kind of built up where things were starting to  rub me the wrong way.  Buzz is, you know, we've, we've covered Buzz.  You guys have covered Buzz quite a bit on here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm still using Buzz.  Aren't you all still using Buzz?  I love Buzz.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Well, the, the issue there with instead of doing a closed beta and gathering feedback  like Wave, which was, you know, really, I think Geno agrees a pretty good way of launching  a product, you know, getting the right minds on it and getting using that feedback and  then, you know, slowly rolling it out to people.  Whereas, you know, Buzz just all of a sudden one day you logged in your email and there  it was.  And with without enough pride with fickle somewhat problematic, some would say privacy  settings.  And I wrote about a few other things that I thought that Google, Google's launch and  then iterate method, which I, you know, usually works pretty well for a lot of their products.  I really felt didn't serve them well, which is basically Android and leaving a lot of  cell phone users kind of unknowing as to whether they're ever going to get an upgrade, what  kind of upgrade they're going to get.  That's and also, you know, Buzz and alienating some people from the launch.  But then a commenter actually pointed out to me that one of the ones I was kind of like  forehead smacking Lee missing was Google gears, which now, you know, I don't think most people  are dependent on Google gears.  But if you liked offline Gmail, I love offline synced Google Docs and even at life hacker.  Some of our editing software uses Google gears in the background.  But now Google gears, I really think is only available basically on Chrome on Windows unless  you hack it together in Firefox on Windows and it might not be available even there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  They've said that they're going to let the sun set on Google gears and transition to  HTML five.  In the meantime, everybody who got everyone who was a early adopter of gears and was into  it and, you know, even based on their, you know, functionality around it now are pretty  much left in the dust and they haven't really said anything about, you know, stopgap measures  for gears or anything like that.  Right.  And that was my main complaint was that there are certain things you have to release like  a product and there are other things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Come on.  They're giving this stuff to you for free.  Come on.  That's true.  It's like that lady who was getting the free Wi-Fi bitched when the guy moved.  That was great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  With your Android phone though.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I mean, with my G1, which is what you bought.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But wait a minute.  You bought the G1 with the feature set it came with, right?  I did.  And so you're mad that they.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So if you bought a razor, it's still the same razor today as it was then.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think the expectation that you're going to get something else is not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Certainly the Toyota is updated a lot less often than these things and updates are good.  Sure.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  But Android is an open source operating system.  I bought it with that, that because it has this ray of sunshine on it from being open  source and backed by Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the issue there is not that you're the guinea pig.  The issue there is that they didn't make it updatable, the phone updatable enough.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was such a crappy phone.  You couldn't update it.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Well, the G1 in that case, that is true.  They didn't put enough memory on it to allow for over the air upgrades.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why I didn't buy it because it was, I could, it was actually I did buy it, but  it's why I didn't use it because it was just, it was clearly too slow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, can you give us a tour of your electronic graveyard someday?  It's all behind me here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Everything.  Look, I got an Asus EPC.  The first one, seven inch screen, unusable.  There's the first iPod, five gigabytes usable, but it's too small now.  There's a Newton back there somewhere.  I got it all here.  It's a museum.  And the G1 is back here too.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  But, and there's the HTC hero, which is on, I think that's 1.5 now.  And then the two point.  That is a little frustrating.  My touch made it to 1.6.  The Droid is 2.0.  The Nexus One is 2.1.1.  And, you know, and now Android and me blog has, has said that they've heard or they have  sources saying that every phone is going to make it up to Android 2.1.  And so you know that there are upgrades coming and you know, it's not entirely Google's fault.  It actually isn't.  It's the carriers and the hardware makers are at some point to blame for not getting their  phones up to 2.1.  But what does everyone know Android phones as though the Google phones?  And I really think it hurts Google's brand when they're leaving phones that could be,  I guess my key is the phones that could be updated that don't get updated.  I think that's frustrating.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree there, but I don't think that's a problem.  I wouldn't want to discourage Google from continuing its beta philosophy.  About as I start to write a book about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that going to be called?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Beta.  Oh, I like that.  That's really great.  In fact, that was one of the complaints people had that they just didn't put the label beta on buzz.  Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All they had to do is put the label.  The point of beta is that it brings us up in the design chain and lets us have more of a voice in what the product is going to be and do.  And that's good.  So I think that the question becomes your arguments.  I think they become matters of how realistic are the expectations you're given?  Are you led astray by the expectations?  I think that's fair.  A and then B, how easy is it to get those updates when they occur?  I think that's also fair.  But the philosophy of beta and the philosophy of enabling people to put stuff up to improve the product as it goes, I think that's sterling.  And I wish other companies would do it.  I think that's true.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And that's why I love Google Labs.  You know, I love the idea of being able to release features.  And I'm fine with them telling me that play with this stuff in Gmail.  It may break your Gmail.  It may break your add-ons.  And, you know, let us know what you think about it.  I think that's a great way to launch products.  Gmail, Google Reader, Google Maps.  I love their labs philosophy on the whole.  But I think that I wonder if sometimes they don't think about the end user's experience with products where they don't give you that easy in the lab or out of the lab option, like with Buzz, like with Android to a certain extent and with Google Gears.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I certainly agree with Jeff, but I also agree with Kevin in that there are risks to being early doctor to Google products.  There are definitely risks like Google Apps, the Google Apps versus Google accounts, Google Apps accounts versus Google accounts issue.  You switch to Google Apps.  They're pushing Google Apps.  You kind of move your email address or even Google Voice to some extent.  You switch your phone number.  These are these are these is a big deal to change your email or your phone number.  And and then you don't quite you don't quite get what you what you expect.  And it's not clear that things aren't going to roll out as quickly.  And it's confusing. I mean, I think that that that advertising the risks clearly is important.  I think they've done really well with wave.  I think they didn't do so well with with Gmail.  Gmail was in beta for how many years?  Five years? Seven.  So it was seven years.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, by the way, my favorite Google Apps feature is you could put the beta back.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Gmail.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, so I mean, I'm all in favor of beta, but let's let's let's be mindful about when the label is on, how long it's on and be clear about what you know what that means.  So I think you're right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think there's a question.  Is a beta baked enough to put it out as one issue?  Is it been baked too long is another issue.  And again, what's the label really bring to your expectations?  And you can't just muck with it to make it meaningless.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Exactly. Exactly.  So like wave is in preview.  That's even that's like pre-beta.  And because it was an invitation only that that made it even even more sort of super early adopter, canary in the coal mine kind of thing.  I think that that's a really good signal.  Lab says very clearly this might break.  It might go away.  We're just trying it out.  I think that's really clear.  The Gmail definitely abused the beta label.  And I just think that Google has to be really clear about.  I mean, everybody wants to try new new Google products.  I think they should just be clear about what level maybe they need like a threat level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  How bad I almost mentioned Google Voice in that piece.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And I actually had like a whole three paragraphs drafted.  And then I pulled it out and I even left a note at the end saying I almost did because I think with Google Voice, they actually have led by making keeping it invite only.  And I think they've done a better job with letting people know like, hey, if you want to change your number and if you want to send that email to your entire family saying this is my new number and whatnot.  I mean, I will still be really miffed if Google Voice somehow doesn't work out.  Really miffed.  But I think that they've done a better job in apps like that of explaining what the risks are to their adopters.  And I still have my phone number if Google Voice goes down.  My actual.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the complaint, the complaint isn't that they try stuff out on us because I mean, that's we like that.  The complaint is that they're just not communicating well enough what the risks are.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Not always. Sometimes.  Not always.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In some cases like Wave, they were clear.  Voice, they were clear.  But you're right.  Buzz was a really is a very good example of Google just because it has salted your Gmail inbox.  And so many people use Gmail in a production environment.  So introducing something that's clearly beta into a production environment is something that you're not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a good irony because the only reason they took off the beta label on Gmail was because they were trying to sell it to enterprises.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then they go, here, here, we'll give you something.  Let's blow up your inbox.  And I think that really upset people.  I understand why that would upset people, you know.  And they didn't make it clear enough that you didn't have to turn it on.  They didn't make it easy enough to turn it off.  They've addressed some of that, though, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I want to complain about my Google slanket.  It sheds.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And if they ever come out with one with a pocket, you won't be able to upgrade.  It has a pocket.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It has.  Oh, it does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the beta blankie.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  With the built-in Y.  You know, it would have been great.  They missed a bet.  It says Google on the pocket.  It should have said beta.  Yeah.  They missed a bet.  There was a real opportunity there.  They're famous for the beta.  You're working, Kevin.  You're working, Kevin.  And I think this is really exciting.  Just as Gina's done the complete guide to Google Wave, you're doing the complete guide  to Google Android.  I am.  Are you going to do it the same way, like an online book and everything?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Well, yes.  I believe.  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I shouldn't have said that.  It says here.  Oh, look at you.  Don't announce this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why'd you put it in there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You don't know me, do you?  I just read what's on the paper.  I'll come back to you.  I'll come back to you.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I'll come back to you.  I'll come back to you.  I should have thought.  I'll cut that out.  Maybe I should have done all caps.  No, I'm actually fine.  You're OK?  I can cut that out.  No, it's fine.  I'm working on a complete Android guide, and I believe it will have similar, if not  the same licensing and release as Gina's complete.  I love that.  I can't wait to get it.  Complete guide to Google Wave.  And if secrets be known, Gina might have slightly pushed it by saying, like, gee, who  really knows Android?  And who on this show might have mentioned really wanting a Android guide?  We do.  We want it.  I want it.  Who referred to it as the operating system of Easter eggs?  I don't remember.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this will actually be a fun thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was me.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  That was Jeff.  Jeff gets credit for that.  So baked up in Twig and hard worked on in nights and weekends.  And I believe it'll be, I don't have any idea of a release date yet, but it's moving along.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, so this is the tease for it.  This is the tease.  This is what you asked for in the first place.  Someday coming soon to a computer near you.  How many people use Android?  Do we have any idea how the adoption is on Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  What was that last number?  Shipping 60,000?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They said 80,000 Nexus ones, right?  But that's only the Nexus.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There was a number on total Android shipments and I can't remember what it was.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I think it was 60,000 a day.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that's what I remember too.  Yeah.  That was at that rate now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A day?  Right.  So it's not just assets or just people downloading it?  What does that mean?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I think that's shipped by manufacturers to stores, carriers, etc.  A day?  A day.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a lot.  That's good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What's that versus Apple?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anybody got any math genes?  Apple's millions probably, right?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Chat room?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Come on.  Chat room?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Do I have the ability to harness the chat room or is that like-

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, you do.  Oh no, no, no.  The ability is extended to anybody.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, they're Leos.  All Leos.  You can't use them.  I give you permission.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I give you permission to harness the vast power of the chat room.  They're open APIs, the chat room.  Yeah.  This is an open API.  We do need an open API.  Actually, we're doing that, believe it or not.  We're going to convert the chat room to XMPP and there will be an open API to our chat  room, believe it or not.  Six percent of the smartphone market, Apple's is 16 percent.  So six is not shabby.  Six is not shabby.  It's not too shabby.  Yeah.  But 60,000 a day, that sounds very high.  Ninety thousand a day for the iPhone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Ten million in 2008 for iPhone, says Miss M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Sixty thousand a day times 365 days would be what, folks?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, come on now.  They don't do math.  What do you think they are?  They're off-hours.  Galley slaves?  Come on, somebody.  Come on.  Let's assign the math problems.  Kyle knows he's in our audience.  How many is it, Kyle?  He says 60,000 times 365.  He's got his iPhone out.  You have to do this on an Android phone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  21.9 million.  Oh yeah, that doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, can't be right.  However, I think Android penetration has kind of reached that critical mass at this point.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm seeing a lot more Nexus 1s than I ever thought.  I was at a geek lunch in Chicago this week with Anil for Expert Labs and there were quite  a few Nexus 1s at the table, many more than I expected.  So I'll be interested to see what it's like at South by Southwest.  I want to know how many folks would be toting the Android phone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I hope it's not taking off yet because I want that spectrum, damn it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, T-Mobile spectrum, is that what we're hoping for?  Oh yeah.  I'm sure Austin's...  And Verizon in the spring, right?  I'm bringing my iPhone, my Droid and my Nexus 1.  I figured one of them is going to work.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  One of them's got to work.  Yeah, we want to be able to brag that we can actually make a call in Austin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am also streaming from South by Southwest via 3G.  So I'm hoping that the 3G networks are all down.  We have this box called a Lifestreamer or Lifestream, Ustream's loaning it to us, that  has slots for eight USB, or maybe they're not USB, but it has eight 3G connections,  two from each of the big four carriers.  And then if AT&T is swamped, it automatically load balances.  So in theory, I can walk around with this thing.  It's a 20 pound backpack.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You're a brave man, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you see a guy, and I have a staff which contains, it has a camera and a microphone  on it and a light.  You're going to have a staff and a robe.  And I'll be wearing the slanket.  I should wear a miter to really complete the look.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So when I was in Vegas this last week, speaking by the way to the National Association of  Truck Stop Owners.  You're kidding.  That was great.  It was great.  I'll stay on that for one second.  So my favorite product discovery was caffeinated beef jerky called, of course, perky jerky.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Perky jerky.  That must be what Gina is living on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Perky jerky.  Truck Drive and Geeks can eat that.  There was another product called Monkey Butt, a soothing powder.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'll let you know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But anyway, so in Vegas they had 4G, what was it?  Not Wi-Fi, but.  Wi-Max.  Thank you.  Wi-Max.  And I couldn't get it to work, darn it.  But I kind of liked the idea that I could say, eh, it had a hotel overpriced Wi-Fi.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We used it in Vegas for a CES and it was about the same as 3G.  It wasn't anything mind-boggling.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what Austin.  If anybody had half a brain in one of those telcos, they should be installing that in  Austin because it's.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's Clearwire, but Sprint does it in Vegas.  I think Sprint has the Clearwire franchise everywhere else too.  So Sprint, if you're listening, Clearwire.  Fast.  Fast.  You got one week.  What is going to be the breakout application in Austin?  In 2007 it was Twitter, 2008 was it Foursquare?  Yeah.  It was last year.  It was 2009 Foursquare?  Yeah.  What will be the two?  I bet Buzz.  I'm sure Buzz was released.  The timing of Buzz's release had something to do with South by Southwest.  Don't you think?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think the snarky geeks of South by Southwest.  They're not going to like it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're not going to use it.  No.  Gowala maybe.  Yeah.  Isn't Gowala located in Austin?  Oh.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So they may be.  I think they may have some plans.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That would make sense.  I'm not going to use it.  I'm going to use Buzz.  There's an iPhone app called Buzzy that is really essentially just a repackaging of the  mobile, but it's a little faster.  My mobile's broken on my iPhone.  It won't load.  I keep seeing the same posts from weeks ago.  I don't understand what's going on.  So I use Buzzy on the iPhone.  And I use the, actually Maps to me is a great Buzz client on the Android platform.  Let's talk about your top 10 Android picks actually, Kevin.  We took a look at those last week.  Great article on Lifehacker.  Thank you.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Sorry.  You go ahead.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How did you pick them?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Well I'm really the only full-time, amazingly enthusiastic.  Am I okay here?  Yeah.  The video?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, sorry.  Don't worry about it.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  If it's bad on your end, it's good on our end.  Gotcha.  I guess my editors kind of left me alone to pick out.  And I also went to the Lifehacker archives and saw what we'd liked before and whatnot.  And I tried to come up with 10 apps that were both useful, mostly useful actually.  And in a few cases, like, Layar just seemed cool and seemed like they were going to get  cooler.  And Layar actually is pretty cool when I walk around.  Even a place like Buffalo, you can walk around and get like, you know, you see like, oh look,  there's a Wikipedia article based on that old architectural building or whatnot.  Frank Lloyd Wright really represents here.  That helps.  I will say that since last week, I did move Task Killer Free, which was I think at the  number three slot.  I moved that up to number six and I left an update in the post because I'd been gently  schooled by a number of really smart Lifehacker readers about task killing on the Android.  And I know you mentioned before, Leo, that there have been times when like an app has  run astray.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do it all the time.  Am I not supposed to do that?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  No, it's not.  But for that purpose, for apps that just go haywire or it seems like something is dragging  your phone down or, you know, doing a huge data push in the background.  That's what I think Task Killer really comes in handy for.  But in terms of I was kind of using it as like this placebo effect of like, and just,  you know, killing apps like stop running, stop running and thinking it was freeing up  memory for me.  But that's a little dangerous to do in terms of, you know, phone functionality.  You never quite know what you're killing and also things like alarm clocks and other  services that are supposed to be running the background you can endanger.  So I think it's still useful for Android users who know that something can occasionally go  awry and wrong.  But yeah, it shouldn't be.  It shouldn't have been such a prominent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Really, I kind of disagree a little bit.  I mean, you have to use it judiciously and almost all of these killers will allow you  to say don't kill this.  So if you have an alarm clock that you keep running, which I do.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Task Killer does have a way you can press it in the setting, open the Task Killer app  and then press and hold on an app and you can set it to the ignore list, which means  it won't kill it ever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I use a different one from the one you use.  I use something called Advanced Task Killer, which is also free.  But I do it prophylactically a lot and I haven't had any problems just because I have had the  phone become sluggish.  You know what my biggest problem, and I think we've all observed this, is that sometimes  the keyboard gets either like this, the digitizer gets completely off.  So you press like this lags board, you press Q and get a space.  And I don't know what the best way to fix that is.  It seems some people say just off and on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I sleep the display and pop it back on.  That often can help.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, not not a full off and on, but just just the off button and then this display  goes off and you turn it back on.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I just found that with using Task Killer and using the widget on the home screen sometimes,  it was too entropic for me to figure out, well, why isn't remember the milk sinking  anymore or why is the music now not responding to my headphones?  Right, right, right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there's little there's little tasks that are running all the time.  You don't want to kill.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Right. And it has and like maybe you've got a really good setup with everything properly  ignored. But, you know, it's still useful.  But the other apps on the list, I think, are just really good.  Either utilities or just kind of cool apps that really make you glad you have like this  little tiny basically computer in your hand or in your pocket.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  All right. I had to look it up.  Entropic. Lack of predictability just for people like who are like me here.  It's a physics thing.  He's showing off, but he showed it because if you know that word, I'm very impressed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, this is a great show for vocabulary.  We learned penurias a couple of weeks ago.  Now we know entropic.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  CS 113, actually, that was a computer science call back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you study at RIT? Where'd you go to?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Oh, no, I wish they wouldn't let me in.  I went to University of Buffalo, UB.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  UB. And what is the mascot of the University of Buffalo?  The bull.  Of course, because if it were a buffalo, it would be confusing.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Right. It's Victor E. Bull.  They've only been a division one 18 for a few years.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You live in a town named Buffalo, but you've got a bull.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there are no actually buffalo in Buffalo.  You know, it comes from French for Beauflot, beautiful river.  Oh, are you kidding?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or the buffalo in Buffalo have wings.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Those are wings that fly, flow beautifully.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yes, this is all accurate history of Buffalo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's take a break. I want to talk.  We said we would, and I want to talk very much about HTC and the lawsuits,  which seems like Google dodged a bullet there with Apple.  We'll talk about that in a second.  But first, I do want to remind you to back up.  Always be backing up.  That's the famous saying from Gary Glen Ross, always be backing up.  If you have a hard drive, it will die.  If you have data, you will lose it unless you back it up.  If you have a laptop, you know the number of laptops that get lost  or stolen every year is in the hundreds of thousands.  It's just crazy.  I get so many calls from people who have lost their precious family photos,  their financial documents, whatever.  Back it up.  And the best way to do it, automatic offsite carbonite.  Just remember that automatic offsite carbonite.  Carbonite encrypts your data using AES 256 bit,  sends it up via SSL so you're very secure,  and makes that data available not only with an iPhone app.  I'm going to talk a minute.  In fact, the last time I met with the CEO, I said,  Android app.  This would be a good Android app.  So I understand they might be working on one.  You can check the data from your phone.  You can check it from any computer.  You can get any file.  If you want to move your data from one computer to another,  you just move the account, restore the data.  It's all there.  Now, of course, you have to have broadband.  And if you have gigabytes of data,  it takes a while for that first backup.  But then afterwards, it's always updating every time a file's  changed so you never are caught with your pants down or something.  Go to carbonite.com and try it free right now.  The offer code is twig.  You get two weeks free, no credit card needed.  If you decide to buy after the free trial,  and I really want you to do the free trial,  make sure it's right for you, then it's two months free.  Less than five bucks a month for unlimited backup.  Carbonite backup done right.  Offer code this week in Google twig.  All right.  Let us talk now about the eight.  You had, I think, a pithy response to the HTC lawsuits by Apple.  Jeff Jarvis, it was pfft.  I'll lead off.  I'm mad at Apple.  What the hell?  Compete.  Yeah, I'm too.  Compete.  Don't litigate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Innovate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't litigate.  Seems like litigation.  I understand they have a right to protect their patents,  and I'm not denying their right to do so,  but is it really the best thing for the world or even for Apple?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, at one point, here you got me, Apple fanboy,  and I got my iPhone, and I love my iPhone,  and you all corrupted me and made me carry the Nexus One.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We made you do it.  Yes, you did.  You did.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  What they say I do, whatever Gina says I do.  It's the slank it.  I am not alone.  It's the slank it.  But yeah, it makes me say, here's the conundrum I get into.  I want to say, F you, Apple, and stop using Apple products.  I'm mad enough, but of course, I'm not going to,  because I love Apple products.  What am I going to do?  Use Windows?  No.  But it's really irritating in terms of the bad citizenship  that it shows when you pull these things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're not alone.  In fact, the New York Times Bits blog had a great chart  of who's suing whom in mobile, and it's just a mess.  I mean, Apple's suing Nokia, Nokia's suing Apple.  Kodak's suing Apple, Apple's suing HTC.  Research in Motion is suing Sharp and Motorola.  Sharp is suing LG Group, who's also suing Kodak,  who's suing Sharp.  Apple's suing Samsung.  Nokia's suing Samsung.  Nokia's suing LG Group, Toshiba, Hitachi.  Qualcomm's suing Nokia, who's suing them back.  It's a mess.  And this is not good for anybody.  Especially Apple.  I'd hope for more from Apple.  I mean, what's the best way for Apple to respond  if they feel that HTC has violated their patents?  By the time this is settled, those patents will be meaningless anyway.  Just move on.  Make something even better.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And they run the gamut, too.  The 20 patents that they're filing,  they run the gamut from very specific things  that I don't quite get, like GSM, signal processing,  and that type of thing.  And then also, but then things like slide to unlock on the iPhone,  just moving your thumb left or right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They claim that the gesture we have on Android,  which is you unlock an iPhone with a number and then a slide.  Oh, I see.  Later, then you get the slide.  That's what they're saying, that slide to unlock thing?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah, that.  And then also the user state awareness,  which means that I'm talking on my phone  and it knows that it's against my ear.  And then I'm putting my phone down  so it knows I want the screen back on.  They're saying that that's patented.  And they have a really goofy patent illustration with it, too.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Was multi-touch in there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is the one.  That's a scary one, actually.  Well, this is the, I wonder if this, I mean, the risk that,  and one of the reasons I think they sued on 20 patents  is because there's a significant risk  that some of these will just be overturned, right?  Yeah.  Or the complaint against the PCC.  I mean, I think that there's no merit in the multi-touch patent,  for instance.  There's demonstrably prior art in multi-touch.  Yes.  So it's a weak patent to begin with.  They shouldn't have gotten in the first place.  And the risk of suing is that the patent itself gets lost, right?  Or maybe not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We need an attorney.  Did I ever say that before in life?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. We need an attorney.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other question I asked, and I didn't get the full answer,  but what is Apple's hypocrisy here?  As I remember the story, Xerox sued Apple but too late  because Apple stole the mouse and stole the GUI from elsewhere.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, but let's say Xerox had sued.  Would that have saved anybody anything?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No. That's why I think the fact that they didn't for all those years  was a smart thing.  And yes, they didn't exploit their own inventions,  and that's their own damn fault, but they added to the world.  They remain legendary to this day and have a little more  credit and creativity as a result than they necessarily deserve  for their actual actions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And isn't that the risk to Apple is that they could do a lot of PR damage?  What if they succeed?  They went to the ITC and said, we want you to stop all importation  of HTC phones into the US.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How many PR would pick it at Apple store?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. What if they succeed and you just can't get it?  HTC makes the best phones out there, period.  Not just Google-based but also Windows mobile-based.  They're fantastic phones.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have this vision, Leo, of you standing in front of an Apple store  with video camera on you and a slinky, a blankie on you  as you smash your iPhone into the ground and protest  and try to set it on fire.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. So it's bad for Apple.  Yeah.  Because potentially the PR, I mean, if they succeed  and the ITC says, nope, that's it, no more containers of HTC phones  enter this country, that's going to be painful.  That's going to be painful.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I agree with you.  And I think that at some point, Apple does risk something here.  We put up with their control-freaky ways  because they're so good.  But it's like the links in Marley's chain.  There's a lot of history here with control-freakishness.  And when it starts affecting others outside of Apple  and it's a, nah, nah, you can't have that  because I want to be mean to Google.  The other interesting thing here, of course, is they didn't have the guts,  editing myself, to sue Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. That's the interesting thing.  Because after all, the multi-touch stuff, especially, is at Google.  Maybe they will.  Maybe Monday they'll sue Google.  I don't know.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I thought, Jeff, you're right too in that previously,  it's been what have been the big Apple things  that have been a lot focused around the app store  and what could you get Google Voice on your iPhone?  And that's pretty abstract for the average iPhone-loving,  MacBook-toting user.  But when you start reaching into people's pockets  and saying, hey, give me back that phone,  or give me back that multi-touch and that slide unlock,  I think that will carry a much,  they'll reach a larger audience, that kind of negative message.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It'll reach just that far, exactly.  Is that imagine a successful court case  in which the court orders Google HTC et al  to disable functions because Apple won the case.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The jailbreak community would be thrilled.  Or the rooting community.  Imagine that we all get this really crippled Android phone  and then have to install custom ROM  and get all the stuff back that we need to have.  And Google will stand back and do nothing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google will say, ah, it's them, not us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, how much of this was brought on by Google  putting multi-touch into its apps, do you think?  Was that with the precipitating act?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  You would assume they had this lawsuit in the works  for a while before Nexus just got its multi-touch,  so it seems like this has been building for a little while.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, that was your scoop that the reason we didn't get multi-touch  at first was that Apple's request to Google  and that's when they were still talking on the playground.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. And the contention of the anonymous person  who emailed me on this was that Apple requested of Google  because they didn't want to sue.  That they knew that if Google did put multi-touch in,  they would have to defend their patent.  And their concern was that the patent wasn't defensible  and it could all come tumbling down.  Of course, by throwing 19 other patents in there,  you're kind of obscure.  Truth is, I did not see the multi-touch in there.  I'm just assuming that multi-touch is in there.  Ours had a list of 10 of them, none of which included multi-touch,  but I haven't seen all 20.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I could swear it was in there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You'd think it would be.  I mean, if they didn't, maybe that would be telling.  And of course, the New York Times blog post goes on to say  that one of the reasons these patent lawsuits,  Nick Bilton writing in the Times this week said,  one of the reasons these lawsuits have exploded.  In the past, patent lawsuits really would be about  kind of licensing and, okay, we'll settle this, we'll license it.  But patent trolling by companies who bought patents  and sued just to make money  has really made this a much more vicious fight.  You've got to think that Apple's not just trying to get money here.  And I don't even think Apple's trying to get licensing fees.  I would guess that Apple wants to,  this is anti-competitive on Apple's part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I mean, that's what it feels like.  What they don't want is another big Verizon droid launch  where someone's going to come out of the gate,  partner up with Google and say, come out with this two-month campaign  where they basically pick on the iPhone.  I think maybe it's a little bit of a shock and awe type tactic  to let carriers and manufacturers know, like, hey,  don't think you can just come out and say,  oh, we do everything the iPhone does.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Maybe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  None of them.  Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I correct myself.  According to Engadget, I guess, Moto,  right notably among the patents,  anything pertaining to multi-touch.  Yeah.  I'm wrong.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Engadget has a very, somebody in the chat room  has sent me a link to the excellent Engadget article,  Apple versus HTC, a patent breakdown,  which is a good name.  Nile Patel.  And he says, yeah, of note, most of the patents  are granted in the past year, but overall,  they span a range of 1995 to February 2nd.  And most of the patents are dry and technical  and none of them cover anything like pinch to zoom.  So maybe that, maybe Apple is kind of gun shy about that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So they go after boring stuff.  They go after a manufacturer.  They don't go after Google, but they end up going after Google.  Is this the shot across the bow?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a weird indirection because yeah,  I mean, clearly these are anti-Android.  It's an anti-Android lawsuit, but it's not an anti-Google.  I don't understand.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Because Palm has multi-touch too.  Hasn't that been an issue as well?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they're not suing Palm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we'll find out.  Maybe next week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Our patent system just to sue.  That's what's really wrong.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just broken.  It's just broken and it's getting worse.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Any other stories we would like to cover before I move on to our tip tool?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You were going to talk about gesture.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's going to be my tool.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's my tool.  Yes, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Can we quote the onion article a little bit?  Because that made me laugh so hard today when I saw it on friend feed.  Please do.  Oh my God.  Please do.  Wait, let me have to, sorry.  I had to hunt it down here.  There are just so many choice quotes, especially after I said that Schmidt freaks me out last  week, which I felt a little bad about after the fact.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, he freaks me out.  So I'll say that too.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You'll say that too?  Okay, good.  Good.  And he's only getting crickets after I said that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's okay because he's only getting paid a dollar.  So it's okay.  Thank you, Leo.  Oh, so never mind.  I didn't say anything.  Nothing.  I say nothing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean nothing.  Nothing is safe around you.  You are the kleptomaniac.  I sweat and I struggle to find one silly number.  What number?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't say a number.  No number.  No number.  Nothing.  Google responds to privacy concerns.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A dramatic reading by Gina Tripani.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Responding to recent public outcries over its handling of private data,  search giant Google offered a wide-ranging and eerily well-informed apology to its  millions of users on Monday.  We would like to extend our deepest apologies to each and every one of you,  announced CEO Eric Schmidt, speaking from the company's Googleplex headquarters.  Clearly, there have been some privacy concerns as of late,  and judging by some of the search terms we've seen,  along with the tens of thousands of personal email exchanges  and Google chat conversations we've carefully examined,  it looks as though it might be a while before we regain your trust.  Added Schmidt, whether you're Michael Paulson who lives at 3425 Longview Terrace and makes  $86,400 a year, or Jessica Goldblatt from Linwood, Washington who already has  well-established trust issues, we at Google would just like to say how very truly sorry we are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The image is great.  So they have a Google Maps image, and it says, for instance,  gives an address in Staten Island,  Apologies to the tobs whose kids are a little too old to be bathed together.  Apologies to Amanda Byrne, we both know why.  Please forgive us, Keith Tompkins, the way you forgave Rebecca even though she rubbed it in your face.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, there are just so many good gems.  You gotta, you must read, must read the whole thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Schmidt apologized to users, particularly the 1,237,948  who take daily medication for anxiety for causing any unnecessary distress.  I mean, yeah, there are just some really good lines about, yeah, I must read the article,  but yeah, laughed out loud in my office today.  So thank you, Leo, for the part.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't put that in there.  Oh, you know who got it in there is a Dane, but you know, there is a link on there to an  earlier video from the Onion News Network on the Google opt out feature.  Have you ever seen that?  Oh, let me play a little bit, just a little bit of this video.  I love the Onion News Network because it really feels like an actual news story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm concerned about your privacy while using Google.  The internet giant says it understands.  Google is now offering users a chance to opt out and live in privacy in a remote mountain village.  Tech trends reporter, Jeff Tate has more.  Thanks, Teresa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call it the opt out village and it's just what you'd expect from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you want to keep your information private, all you have to do is move to our 22 acre opt  out village and not speak to anyone from the outside world.  It's very simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just go to the Google front page, click the opt out button, and in minutes a van will come  to your house and pick you up.  That same day, a team of Google privacy experts eliminates your home address,  guaranteeing it will no longer appear on Google local pages.  And after just two days in the back of a van, you're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In the village, we can guarantee that there's no chance of Google reading your emails because  there are no computers and because they're also monitored and tracked by Google.  There are no banks or hospitals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Residents will be expected to know how to grow food,  suture wounds and bury corpses by hand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You get the idea.  Well worth going to that page and seeing both the article and the apology and the video.  Google is just ripe for this kind of jokes, I'm afraid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, they deserve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a lot of fun.  They've earned it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We tease because we love.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They must have gone up in the Googleplex over that.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They had to.  Yeah, that's wonderful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now you don't have to participate, Kevin, unless you want to.  Yes.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Oh, you got one?  No, no, I have one.  I'll wait till the...  You can do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It better not be one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We'll get you go last.  Okay.  I don't know what he's talking about.  Maybe we better start with Jeff's number so nobody preempts him.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No big deal.  But, and I don't understand this story actually.  Which I'll rarely admit, but I will this time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's from the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wall Street Journal.  Google's top three executives, Bryn, Page and Schmidt,  took $1 in compensation for the last year, did not receive bonuses, took no stock.  That's bizarre.  That usually is the case when a company is messing up and it's horrible,  but their stock gained 85% last year.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why would they not take money?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't get it.  It's like anti...  It's like...  Who are they?  Craig Newmark?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, exactly.  No bonus if you messed up, but you made billions.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  Now, the chief financial officer got a bonus of $2 million.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's face it, they're not poor, any of them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, exactly.  One hand, I salute them just saying, well, it's not about money.  Fine.  But it is capitalism.  I'm puzzled by this one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what happened because Larry and Sergey probably have billions.  As I remember, they liquidated some stock this year.  Yes, they did.  So they've got hundreds of millions of dollars and they both said,  they're in the meeting, Eric Schmidt's sitting there,  we're not going to take any compensation this year.  We're going to take $1 and they look at Larry, I mean, Eric.  They look at Eric.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, actually, Leo, maybe that raises the point.  Because they liquidated so much stock this year, it was bad for taxes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it could be a tax thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Take the income and it's going to go nowhere.  I don't know.  We should be so lucky.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  These are the problems you want to have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  $1 is your number.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Thank you.  I feel good now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina Trapani has a tip for us, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I do.  And I have a quick tip pimp.  I wrote a story this month in this month's issue of Maximum PC.  I love that magazine.  Yeah, Maximum PC is a great magazine and I am really privileged to have the cover story  this month in the April issue.  It's called the Power Users Guide to Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How do you find time to do all this?  Good Lord, you must work 24-7.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There was an all-nighter involved in the story.  Youth, Leo, youth is an amazing thing to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Youth.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's a youth.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There are 45 tips here, 6,000 words.  I learned a lot and there's a lot of good stuff here.  So check out the magazine and I'm going to feature some of the tips  in the next few weeks on the show here.  But you should buy the magazine because they're good people and it's a good read.  It's always been one of my favorites, actually.  My small but relevant pimp.  So my tip this week, this is a new feature that rolled out in Wave, a much needed feature.  It's a very tiny step toward Gmail integration or just email integration.  If you have logged into Wave and looked at it and thought it was kind of cool,  but never went back again and don't know when people wave you,  log back in and click on the inbox on the arrow on the right side of the inbox.  There is now a new menu item called Notifications.  If you click on that, you can get emails from Wave anytime somebody waves you or updates a  wave that you are participating on.  So I think this is going to kind of buzz like, but just let you know something happens.  Somebody said something to you in Wave, which I think will make a really big difference for folks  who use it occasionally or just couldn't get other people to use it with them or  never had a reason to go back.  I've been using it this week and it's looking pretty good.  They really need whitelist.  They need a lot more features, but this is kind of the first step to connecting Wave  to your email inbox.  So check out Wave Notifications.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very good.  Very good.  And finally, you get credit really for this one too, Gina, because you buzzed it or tweeted it.  I can't remember which.  And I immediately, whenever Gina says, oh, check this out, I immediately download it and try it.  And you're right.  It is the coolest thing.  If you've ever used something like Launchy on Windows or Launch Bar or Quicksilver on the  Macintosh, this is the kind of the droid version of those programs.  It lets you, it lets you, oh, I'm holding up my iPhone.  I should get my iPhone out of the shot.  That's terrible.  Terrible.  You don't like the iPhone.  I don't.  Well, I happen to have it around, but I don't, I'm a Nexus One lover.  So it's called Gesture Search.  And it's kind of the same idea as Quicksilver, which is you type the first letter of what  you're searching for.  You got to do it right.  See, you see the lag?  Just kill me on that.  So I touch an H and then, oh, I have to backspace because it has those previous strokes.  There's the H.  And then it goes through what?  Your contacts and everything else and searches for everything from H.  And then the second letter narrows it down and the third level letter narrows it down.  And you're typing below and it remembers your gestures.  So now I've included my music in here.  So I've typed H.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is it searching just the phone or the web?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It searches the web too, doesn't it?  No, just the phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It searches your bookmarks, contacts, music, songs.  See browser bookmarks.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  Apps, music.  And music is not on by default, but I added that because I have a lot of music on there.  And so I was typing H-O-U and I got, you know, burning down the house  and other suitable H-O-Us in here.  I just...  Burning down the house.  House, yeah.  H. Does it do lowercase too, Gina, or is it just all uppercase?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does lowercase.  It does actually very good recognition of letters.  It's amazing.  It's really good.  And I'm curious to know whether or not this is going to become a universal input option eventually.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, why not?  I mean, basically I'm able to...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's the end of the old keyboard.  Is this the death of QWERTY?  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, it seems like Google's going out of their way to make  input methods into your phone, anything but the touchscreen, right?  So you've got like, search by taking a picture,  find something in the market by scanning the barcode,  voiced text input.  So speak your query.  And now you've got this gesture search.  How many ways can we get you to avoid your keyboard?  Which is interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think that that's the future of computing in general is new input devices.  And especially a small device like this.  You don't want to use a keyboard.  Right.  I love it.  You were raving about it.  And as soon as I downloaded it, I saw why.  It's a really useful little tool.  And it's free.  Just your search.  It's free in the marketplace.  And it's from Google.  It's a...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And yet another non-iPhone app.  Let's add this to the list of apps available for Android,  which are not available for the iPhone.  Another shop by shop by bragging right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it goes the other way too, because a lot of iPhone apps that I thought were unique to the  iPhone are now migrating over.  For instance, bump, which I used a lot on the iPhone to exchange business cards,  is now available on Android.  And it bumps.  You could bump with an iPhone.  So if we're at South by, you should always put this on here.  And you have all these snarky iPhone users saying,  well, I guess I can't bump you my contacts.  You could say, well, yes, you can just, you know how bump works.  You go like this and it sends the contact information over.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I have not done that.  That's cool.  Wasn't there one where you shook the phones together?  You took the two phones and kind of put them next to one another and shook them.  Is that bump?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's it.  I think it's bump.  Yeah.  And you can send pictures or other data that way as well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Can we fist bump at South by?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yeah, if you had your phone in your hand and I had mine,  all you have to do is like that.  They don't have to touch.  It's just the, it's accelerometer saying, oh, I got shook.  So shaking would do it.  And there is a, an application on the Android that I haven't figured out,  but maybe it's just cause I don't know anybody that has it.  This week, make another tool called Hawker.  H F C C E R like soccer that lets you throw things.  Oh yeah.  And then you can go like this and catch it.  So I could.  Okay.  That's fun.  Is that fun or what?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I dare you to, to just start doing that on the streets of Austin.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We can play Hawker with each other.  So it's, it's so, uh, it's, it knows where I am.  I have received, but I can also catch to receive a distribution.  And, and I don't, I don't know how you, oh, you select the content this way.  So let's say I'm in my, in my gallery and I want to throw you a picture, Gina,  or I could throw you my contact information.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We are so doing this next Saturday and we're going to play Hawker.  Yeah.  Heck yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'm just going to, let's say, oh, here's my media pass for the iPad.  Announcement.  Maybe you could print this out and use it next time and I'll just Hawker it to you.  Is that weird?  Oh yeah.  I love it.  That's cool.  It's not on the iPhone.  There's no app for that.  And by the way, Apple's annoying smug geeks.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, snark goes both ways.  Let me just point that out.  Apple recently just killed all the today.  I think all the wifi, um, searching tools like Nets tumbler on the iPhone.  They just killed them.  They're gone.  Apps too.  Yeah.  What's with that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait.  They, they're, they got pulled from the app store just today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And somebody says it was pulled from their phone as well.  I don't know if that's true or not.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  I'd read something a little earlier in the week saying that, uh, apps that use,  I'm not sure because it would be crazy to pull all of them, but apps that use wifi to locate you  maybe in a way that without being explicit about it, I think they pulled those.  Like I remember Yahoo maps got pulled because it used, it tries to  geolocate you without GPS or, um, cell signal.  So I think that was a little earlier in the week, but I did read about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Reports came out a few days ago that all the iPhone OS applications that sniff out wifi,  scanning the vicinity for signals and other information have been removed from the app store.  Um, there were dropped because they used a private framework hooks into the operating  system that are not documented, which is Apple's done this before nor allowed for  third party developers to use.  So they got approved in the first place, but as is often the case, Apple after the fact,  uh, said, no, we're not going to allow you to do that.  This is again why I'm just happy that I'm using an Android phone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wow. You know, you contrast that to, you know, I, I maintain a set of Firefox extensions for  Google apps and they're, they're based, it's not, they're not API based, right?  They're based on just the HTML on the page.  They're user scripts, grease monkey user scripts that do things to the page.  I actually got an email from Google saying we're going to change an app that you have  an extension for.  Like the HTML is going to change and we'd like to show you what the, what it's going  to look like so that you can prepare your extension in advance.  Okay. So I'm, I'm using unauthorized hooks.  I mean, unauthorized being just the HTML into their app and they're helping me as a developer  do so.  So contrast that to Apple saying like you're using methods that we haven't published or  API methods.  We, we, we don't authorize, so we're just going to pull your, your app from the, from the store.  I mean, that's the difference.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm told Hawker is also available on the iPhone so we can still throw things at iPhone users  as well.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, thank you all for being Kevin.  Oh, I'm sorry, Kevin.  You said you wanted to add something after our tips, tools and, and a number.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Yeah, actually I just wanted to mention that for all you Google fans out there who use  Chrome and Android and you know, anything else that Google makes pretty much.  I wrote a feature on life hacker this week called the, the easy, any OS, any browser  password solution and last pass L A S T P A S S.  I found that really useful for.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I use it like crazy.  I love it.  Oh, you do.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  It's great.  And it's, it's, it's works for Firefox, Internet Explorer, you know, Chrome Safari on Windows  and Mac and it's available as an app for almost every kind of smartphone there is out there.  And I just converted over to it a week or two ago, but it's, it's a really easy solution  for, you know, keeping your web passwords secure and, but also having them at your fingertips  when you log in.  It uses something called host proof hosting, which I'm not, you know, a security geek,  but I believe it just means that your, your passwords are kept encrypted on last pass  as servers, but they never actually see that stuff.  The encryption happens in your own browser or on your own phone.  I've just been using on my, on my Android phone and Chrome and found it really, really helpful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's on the iPhone too.  And, you know, it's nice as it imports all of your bookmarks from Safari,  Internet Explorer, Firefox, I mean, your passwords.  So if you've already got a large password store, which almost everybody does,  you can.

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  And Gina's a big fan of key pass, which is a right open source.  Right.  And it can, it can take imports from key pass and whatnot.  So I, I really got into it this week.  I agree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I agree, Kevin.  What a great program.  Yeah.  I'm going to check it out.  Our security guy, Steve Gibson has heard us recommend it so many times that he says  he's going to look into its model and everything to make sure it is secure.  And I mentioned on security now, the only thing that worries me is the company's small  company out of Vienna, Virginia, which is just down the road from the CIA.  And I thought, boy, if I were the CIA, I would make something like this,  make it really good, get all the geeks to use it just in case.  You know what I'm saying?

Speaker: Kevin Purdy
Transcript:  Nobody could ever break this encryption.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nobody knows the way in here.  It's just, see, there's, there it is.  They're just down the road a little from the claim.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It could just be me, just my paranoia.  No, I don't want to start any rumors.  They're perfectly fine gentlemen and they make a wonderful product.  Good tip.  Thank you, Kevin.
