Oh, there it is.  Wow, Gina, your hair's gone white.  prematurely white.  That's great, Gina.  Good to see you.  Jeff Jarvis also here from BuzzMachine.com, professor of journalism.  As you can see, we can see the CUNY banner right behind you now.  That's nice.  And a little later on, we're going to be joined by somebody from Google, Ido Green.  He's a Google Developer Advocate for Chrome OS.  And as you know, I've been a little bit baffled by Chrome OS and even more so by these new  Chromebooks.  And he's going to explain to me why the market is demanding, demanding that Google have a  second OS and a browser based laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a hell of a lot more successful than the touchpad.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  That's not saying much.  Actually, I don't know after the $99 touchpad.  Yeah, I tried to buy one.  Nobody can get that.  I don't know why I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's just.  Did you really?  Well, yeah, but then I'm glad I was saved for myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, wait a minute.  I guess this story broke the day after we did the show last week.  So we haven't had a chance to talk about this yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know it's kind of old news.  But yeah, you've covered it on your other shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But any any thoughts?  I mean, HP gets out of the PC business and kills WebOS.  Except wait a minute.  That's not what they meant to say.  This is the funniest story.  They so botched the press release that the story, the whole news cycle for the first  24 hours was HP kills the PC business and WebOS.  And it turns out what they meant to say is, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We're just we don't want to be making hardware for WebOS.  We're going to license it as Microsoft does, as Google does.  And others can continue to make WebOS hardware.  And we don't know for sure what's going to happen with the PC business.  Maybe we'll spin it off.  Maybe we'll find a buyer.  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Michael Dell.  Have you seen Michael Dell in Google Plus?  He was just having a field day.  We're happy to still read the PC business.  Buy HP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good for them, isn't it?  It gives them more market share.  HP.  In fact, Dell has been down, you know, I think they're now third or fourth.  HP is number one.  So I'm sure Michael's very happy about that.  Kind of a misstep, though, because I don't think there's anybody in the world now that  doesn't believe that WebOS is dead, dead, dead.  So these $99 touchpads just add fuel to the fire.  They're clearing them out.  Apparently, according to one of the tear down sites, it cost them $300 to make these.  So they're losing $200 for every one they sell.  There are reportedly a million in the warehouse, a million that were made.  So we're talking a billion dollar write down when you talk about engineering staff and  everything.  Microsoft's going after the developers.  They've had a thousand people respond to their email saying, yeah, let's show us something  about Windows Mobile or Windows Phone 7.  I think it's too late.  I think HP inadvertently killed WebOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, you would never develop for WebOS now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  I mean, honestly, I wasn't really close to anywhere.  To tell you the honest truth.  You know, the Times did a good article called Sell Big or Die Fast, where like Apple's kind  of set this precedent that if you don't launch a product and have this huge uptake right  away that it gets killed.  They were talking about the Kin and the touchpad and they mentioned Wave.  Wave.  The flip can?  Yeah, yeah.  It is kind of interesting and a little sad, right?  I mean, back in the day, like two years ago, you know, you give a product a little more  time to kind of prove itself out, although I have a sad one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The flip cam is wrong though, because the flip cam did become the number one camcorder  out there.  It was big.  It's just Cisco was an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or it wasn't big enough or something went wrong.  It's like the Hollywood thing.  If you don't have a big first weekend, it's very difficult to have a second act in Hollywood  nowadays.  You got to go out big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's like media too.  You have two ends of the spectrum.  The blockbuster economy is still there for movies and things like that, but it's much,  much, much harder and riskier to try to get a blockbuster.  Or the teensy economy.  And the teensy economy works because you have all these platforms and you can do things  really cheap and you can do a physical product even on Kickstarter or 3D printers or blog  software, all kinds of stuff.  So the teensy economy works and the jagundo economy works.  It's the middle, the mitte economy that doesn't work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mitte economy.  It does not work.  It's interesting.  Although again, I think that HP, they claim their intent was not to kill WebOS, but merely  to say, well, our hardware products aren't selling well enough for us and we think others  can do a better job.  But I got to say, I don't think anybody's going to pick up WebOS at this point.  You know, developing for WebOS is not so different from developing for a lot of platforms, including  Chrome OS.  It's just HTML5.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Which is really smart.  So I mean, I wouldn't even think about developing for WebOS.  I would think about developing HTML5 based widgets, which so many platforms support now  and it's a smart move to do so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then it would run, I guess it would run, well, here's the example, read.kindle.com,  Amazon's HTML5 Kindle.  They developed that once.  They do it in standard HTML5.  It runs great on a Chromebook.  It runs presumably well on WebOS and every other HTML5 browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep, exactly.  Who needs an app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Or you could, I guess there's some way to wrap the app on HTML5 apps so that it's kind  of a standalone app.  But it's the same thing.  You don't have to, it's probably not a lot of work.  I haven't looked into it, but I would imagine it's pretty straightforward.  They must have some sort of packaging tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I would imagine they probably do.  But as long as they stick to the HTML5 standard, then that's a smart move and it's less of  a commitment for developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think Android made a mistake by saying you've got to learn Java?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I guess the native app versus the web app on Android and iOS war still sort  of rages on.  I mean, I think that you have the option.  You can go either way.  I'd like to see Android support native web apps maybe a little better, like that they  would act a little more like native apps versus just looking like a bookmark on your home  screen.  I don't think they made a mistake.  It's a lot harder to develop for Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to think that the future of apps for mobile is going to be HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it is, but native apps just give you access to hardware level controls that  you just don't get with HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What could you not do?  Do you have access to the accelerometer?  I mean, isn't this up to Google anyway?  Couldn't they give you access to everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's what they would need to do.  I'll tell you the truth.  I went straight into native app development because the kind of party line at that time  was hey, you know, if you want to make a really great mobile app that doesn't have, you know,  weirdness, just, you know, go native.  So I don't know exactly the differences.  I think that I think that the Android browser and actually hopefully we'll talk about this  in a few minutes in our interview.  I'd like to see the Android browser.  We need Chrome.  More Chrome-ier, you know, not just the Android browser.  I'd like to see it really based on Chrome and some of the edges smooth.  And if Android can get, you know, even better web app integration kind of just in the home  screen and with hooks into the share menu and all those hooks into the search button,  that kind of thing, then I think developers would be a lot more willing to go web app.  But I think for now, really, you want to go the native app.  And I think most iOS developers might say the same thing.  Although I think iOS has some a little better web app integration.  Just that you can make a mobile web app and put it on your home screen and it behaves  really nicely.  That smoothness of all the native apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd love to look into this.  It seems like you could develop once in HTML5, it would work on the web, it would work on  mobile, it would work everywhere.  But wow, wouldn't that be isn't that what you want to do?  Especially if you're a content company.  Maybe not if you want to make, you know, a GPS app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, there's always going to be those advanced, those really cool advanced features like the  accelerometer and the turning that the mobile device gives you that you're not going to  be able to get.  So it feels like a little bit of a trade off.  But that, you know, write once run most platforms is very, very attractive, especially for small  companies that want to get, you know, get an app out on different platforms all at once  and not have to have an iOS development team and an Android development team.  You know, there's there are lots of iOS apps I would love to see on Android.  And if they were HTML5, then and the integration was strong on both sides, it wouldn't be such  of an issue reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw the first research about we go from proprietary research.  So I don't know the numbers and couldn't share them.  But an ad agency in Canada did research on apps and found that most of the activities  people do, some of the obvious like games is on the browser.  The proportion of used versus downloaded apps, you know, they people use less than half the  apps they download.  Yeah.  And the whole notion that apps are going to take over the world.  You have to write apps, you have to have proprietary apps.  I think that it's not just the right once issue.  It's also the issue that people are probably going to start using browsers more and more  and more on these devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  And this is the point of HTML5.  If you can get an application like experience with HTML5, why not?  The chat was pointing out there are a couple of tools that are designed for this.  There's PhoneGap, which is a framework for HTML5 apps that allows your app to run everywhere.  It's a framework like Ruby on Rails.  And then there's Accelerator Titanium, which is a similar idea.  Build native apps, but basically build them with HTML5.  This is an area where third party developers, of course, that's not going to help you much  with the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, the other issue is the revenue issue, right?  I mean, when you have an app payment, so we can easily collect payment for an app through  the store, through the market with this one...  A user isn't going to want to type in his or her credit card details into a phone through  a web interface.  You know?  So I think there are definitely some issues.  Where a developer wants to make money now, they want to go native app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is me classically thinking as a content creator instead of a developer.  For content creators, it strikes me better than writing an app for your magazine.  Make an HTML5 website, then it's standards compliant, it works everywhere, and you can  have that full experience.  Can't you?  I mean, isn't that the way to do it?  Speaking of which, did you see that Zite got sold?  That was the...  Did it finally got confirmed?  Well, CNN, I don't know, confirmed.  Everybody's running the rumor.  Zite was the flipboard style magazine app for the iPad that was getting a lot of trouble.  Time Warner, among others, suing it.  And then the rumor was, and you're right, I haven't heard the confirmation that CNN,  the Time Warner company, purchased it for 20 to 25 million dollars.  That's one way to get somebody to sell, sue them, and then say, or I'll give you 25 million  dollars.  Speaking of the touchpad, you didn't get one, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I saved for myself.  There may be more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There may be more.  And you might want to look at it because there's a project now, TouchDroid, they're trying  to put Android on the touchpad.  Now, admittedly, I don't think you should buy, I don't think the touchpad hardware is  the best hardware out there.  No, that's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I almost wish I could have bought 10 of them for the school.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially if you could put Android on it.  I mean, for $99, you got to know.  Now it's just Wi-Fi, it's not 3G, et cetera, et cetera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give it to my sister, the minister, who's never rich.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not too late.  They say HP says, we got a lot of them in the warehouse.  We'll be restocking soon.  So keep an eye on the HP websites and places like that.  I wouldn't go to Best Buy anymore.  I think they probably aren't going to get any more shipments, but I bet HP made well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're making even less.  What did they have to give Best Buy?  It's $300 teardown cost, right?  They're selling for $99.  What's the margin they had to give Best Buy still?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  HP has said that they expect a $1 billion write down next quarter.  So that's significant.  All right.  This is a test of your literary ability, little Rorschach test.  Go to Google.com and tell me who the hell we're celebrating this today.  I know.  What the hell is that?  You see, you can see Google in there.  Yeah, you can.  The 112th birthday of Jorge Luis Vorejas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Help me alt text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're my only hope.  You're my only hope.  They've picked the strangest things and that is it.  I don't even know.  Is that an illustration from something?  Must be one of his books, but I don't recognize it.  One of my favorite authors, though.  Great Argentinian writer, essayist and poet.  And he always wrote the kind of the magical stuff, magical things happening.  What was it?  The 100 years of what is that?  I can't remember his book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those meetings have to be obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd hate to be in there fighting for Vorejas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got to be showing off.  I'm afraid to say I don't know who the hell that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is the takes the cake for the most obscure Google doodle.  It does.  Is the 112th birthday significant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  No, it's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They pick weird things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do.  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100 years of solitude.  Isn't that it?  I love that book.  Didn't he write that or am I wrong?  That's Marquez.  Well, damn, what did Vorejas write?  He's not your favorite author.  No, I like, you're right.  I was thinking Marquez.  Huh.  Where is the books of Vorejas?  Where, where?  Is he right for Huffington Post?  No, he's long gone, I believe.  At 112, I'd be.  Now there, you deserve a doodle if you're still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I have no help here.  I'm so ignorant here.  I'm showing my ignorance.  Maybe our guest knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can ask Ido.  Why, why Ido?  Why?  No, he's not responsible for the Google doodles.  Let's take a break.  We will get Ido on.  We're going to talk about Chrome OS, Chromebooks.  There's lots more to talk about.  Goodness gracious.  Including this verification badge on Google Plus and Bradley Horowitz's interview with  Tim O'Reilly.  How come Tim O'Reilly does an interview with Horowitz?  It gets all that attention.  We do an interview on the day Google Plus launches Horowitz.  They don't even mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's wrong with us?  Don't you like us?  Don't you like us?  Dutch Court bans the Galaxy S in Europe.  Google TV ad on Android SDK gives developers a path to the big screen.  There's lots of stories in here.  Lots of stuff to talk about.  But we want to talk to Ido in just a second.  First, we're going to talk about Squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.  If you are on Facebook and you say, and I see this all the time, oh, I have a web page.  It's Facebook.com slash my web page.  No, no, that's a Facebook page.  That's not the web.  It always bugs me.  People think Facebook is the web.  I know Facebook wants you to think that.  But truthfully, if you're a business, if you're an individual, if you've got a hobby, if you  want to publicize something, if you want to show people your photos, you have to have  your own site where you control the content.  This is where Squarespace is so good because it's everything you need, soup to nuts.  It's the server.  It's serving best, absolutely best web service out there, plus the great content management  software that's running on Squarespace.  And it's great for so many reasons.  For you as a new, as a designer of a site, it's fantastic.  You get these 60 plus designer templates that are very easy to customize with drag and drop.  If you know CSS and JavaScript, of course, fully HTML 5 compliant and all that, you can  do anything you want.  But you don't have to to make a unique site.  Just look at some of the incredible example sites on the Squarespace site.  If you go to squarespace.com, take a look at the blogs, at the business sites, at the  photography sites, the nonprofits.  So many people use Squarespace these days.  I just love it.  So here's what you do.  You go to squarespace.com.  You see a big green button.  This is the other thing I really encourage all of our advertisers to do.  And they all do it.  And I love it.  Buy it free.  So you go there.  You don't need a credit card or anything.  You just put in the name of the site, the password, the email address so they can notify  you when your site's about to expire.  Now for 14 days, you have the free reign of the place, which means, and I do this all  the time, you can create a site and then just throw it out.  Say, oh no, no, that's not it.  So I actually do a lot of ad hoc site design in here.  And if you like it, then you come back before the 14 days is up and you sign up for as little  as 12 bucks a month.  That's hosting plus the software.  And you know what?  If you use the offer code twig8, T-W-I-G, the number eight all one word, you'll get 10%  off for the first six months of your site.  Makes it even more affordable.  Squarespace is the secret behind exceptional websites.  Always secure, always fast, always fun for photography, for social media integration.  The iPad and iPhone app.  I just love it.  Squarespace.com.  Give it a try today.  Squarespace.com.  Use the offer code twig8.  Let's welcome our guest from Google.  It's Eido Green.  Is that how you pronounce it, Eido?  Yeah, exactly.  Eido.  Eido.  It's a pleasure.  Not Eido.  Eido.  I was going to say Eido.  Is that Italian?  No, no, I'm from Israel.  Israel.  Okay.  Yeah.  You're the Google developer advocate for Chrome OS.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So, in fact, you have your own little WordPress blog.  We've got to get you over to Squarespace.  Greenido.wordpress.com and you're of course on Google+.  How long have you been on the Chrome OS team?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For the past six months, I'm quite new to Google, but I'm having a great time here.  I'm really passionate about Chrome OS and this new platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now we all got one, right?  Well, not we all.  Okay.  Well, not all of us.  We got our beautiful little white Samsung.  This is basically netbook style hardware, an atom processor, not a lot of memory, but  what's indifferent is it's not running Windows.  It's running Chrome OS, which is basically, it's a Linux kernel, right, Eido?  Yeah, exactly.  It's Linux and-  But don't let that scare you because you don't see Linux.  Really all you see is Chrome.  If you've used Chrome, you've used Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  And actually for power users, there's a little nice trick or tip.  If you do want to see the shell just because you want to SSH to another book, so you want  to see what's like beneath, you could do control alt t and then you just getting a shell that  is trim and secure and limited, but let you and Gina and other power users to see more  than just the browser itself that you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of cool.  You do get a full command line, or not full, but you do get a command line here.  But you said the word, I think that this is the word that I keep hearing when I talk to  Sundae and others is secure.  Right.  Is that the primary reason for Chrome OS?  I guess the question that I keep having is why do you need another OS?  You've got Android, why do you need Chrome OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Chrome OS was built from the ground up on the three SS, speed, security, and simplicity.  And like any other things that we're doing in Google, we want to make sure that we're  giving the best experience to users.  And Chrome OS was designed to users that spend the vast majority of their time on the web.  Now in Google, as you know, we really want to foster innovation and we are in a very  lucky position to have those two wonderful ecosystem open source projects, both Android  and Chrome OS, and see what will come up on each and every one of them.  In Chrome OS, what I'm truly passionate about is that at the end of the day, you are dealing  with APIs that are accessible in Chrome.  And for web developers, we have an extra mile, if you will, of APIs that let you deal with  files locally, the file browser APIs and some others that harness web developers with even  more capabilities and power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That kind of speaks to the conversation we were just having about why don't people do  more HTML5 development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So actually, I can see, you know, in the environment today, lots and lots of people, startups,  medium company, and even big companies like Facebook and Netflix, investing a lot of efforts  in HTML5.  And I had the conversation that you had before with Gina, and I'm 100% agree with what you  said that HTML5 harnessing companies and developers with great capabilities to be more productive  and to give more to users on each and every mobile device that they are using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when I complain that I say, well, I just run my MacBook Air with Google, and rather  with Chrome, and now I really have Chrome OS and everything else, that's really kind  of a specious argument because this is not the market you're selling the Chromebook to.  This is for people who don't want to spend as much money.  They want something that's more secure, less complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Correct.  And one of the big promises, and I'm personally truly passionate about, is that I think that  the Chromebook will do the right things in verticals like EDU and BIS, where it's not  only the hardware, it's not only the software that we keep updating.  You have a new version of Chrome every six weeks with more security feature and more  speed and other new APIs that we are baking into it, but the hardware itself is going  to be updated with those new initiatives.  And that's something that, in my humble opinion, is going to change a lot of things in those  verticals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the problem I still have, though, that stops me and I think stops a lot of people,  is the inability to use it offline.  Right.  We're just not as connected as well as Google would like us to be.  We need gears back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we have actually something that is much better than gears, and quite soon you'll see  by the end of the summer with offline capabilities, which will be Gmail, Calendar, and Docs.  And even today, you have more than 100 apps in the App Store that are giving full offline  capabilities.  So just to name a few, Angry Bird will work offline after you install it.  You don't need any connectivity.  You have the New York Times app that will work nicely on a flight when you don't have  a connection.  You have Amazon Reader and Tuduli and lots of others apps that just give you a nice offline  capabilities.  And we're going to see in the near future more and more apps that are supporting it.  And I suspect that lots of companies will harness their web apps with offline capabilities.  It's quite new API that HTML5 harness developer with, and I suspect that more and more of  them will get used to it and will bake it into their apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there are three different ways that, oh, I'm in guest mode.  This is kind of cool because this is Eileen's Chromebook, and it has a guest mode, and so  it's completely private browsing.  It doesn't save anything that I do.  But I can install Angry Birds, but that makes sense because it's not my computer.  Eileen doesn't trust you?  No, if you're guest mode, you can't install extensions, I guess.  Maybe you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Extension and apps.  But if you'll log in with your account, you'll be able to do it, of course.  Obviously, it will sync between all the other...  Love that.  Yeah.  That's one of the very productive features that we have.  You always get what you got used to.  You pin some apps that are... pin some tabs that are actually apps that you're spending  the vast majority of your time of the day, like Gmail or Calendar or others.  And then each and every place that you are logged in, you're immediately getting the  same layout.  Everything is comfortable.  You don't need to do some long setups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks to me like that some of these apps are flash.  Some of them are HTML5 and have dedicated storage, right?  So those can run offline.  Netflix, is that Silverlight or is that its own... what is going on with Netflix, for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  instance?  Yeah, so it's not Silverlight.  With Netflix, we leverage the system of plugins, and we do have several plugins in Chrome OS  that are currently not exposed to external developers.  And things like native flash and Netflix are built on top of that.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you said that by the end of the summer, we'll have offline Gmail, Docs and  Calendar in Chrome OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  In Google I.O., we said that by the end of this summer, we'll have those three with offline  capabilities and we are on track to have them by the end of the summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did that news?  I mean, if I can plow through my email inbox on the plane, that'll be a big upgrade.  That's the whole game.  Is that known?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm with you 100%.  That's news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was announced to Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  So, I think it was last week, we covered a story where we saw...  I think it was a Chromium developer.  I don't think it was actually a Googler, but it looked to be a prototype of a touch-based  Chrome OS or Chromium, version of Chromium.  Do you know anything about that or can you speak a little bit to the Android versus Chrome  question, which I'm sure you get all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, sure.  So, I don't know specifically about what you're mentioning, but I do know that you have today  in JavaScript events that you could hook up and have the touch and you have actually lots  of libraries and frameworks that are giving you the ability today to easily maneuver and  have touch events.  And as you know, Chrome OS is an open source project and I suspect that we'll see it on  other devices and on tablets in the future, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you support WebGL as well in this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some WebGL stuff that just gives me chills.  The WebGL...  Yeah.  Evan Wallace...  Let's see if this will run on Chrome.  I don't know the Chromebook, but this Evan Wallace water simulation with WebGL is absolutely...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's one and another one that will really blow your mind is ROMRO.ME.  It's just showing the power.  This is saying it requires the OES texture float extension.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it looks like that is an HTML5 extension or a WebGL extension that's not enabled or  is it because I'm in guest mode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I suspect it's not enabled, but the best way to check it will be if you are not in a guest  mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I'll have to try it.  And RO-ME.  I'm going to try that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, ROM, ROM project, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's enough hardware in here to do a lot of those kinds of things.  Is there an accelerometer?  There's no GPS.  There is 3G on some models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And one aspect that I really passion about is that the hardware is going to improve over  time, not just the software.  So for EDU and B, like we said, every three years Google will support and will give a  new device.  And that's something quite revolutionary in terms of if you're thinking about those big  organizations, they don't need to hassle and worry about the total cost of ownership of  their IT department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So right now, this is the water running on my Macbook Air.  This is an amazing simulation.  In fact, if I turn gravity on, here let me turn on gravity, the ball will fall.  Let's see, G tackles gravity there.  There we go.  This is an amazing, this is WebGL and it's amazing.  I mean, this simulation is incredible and it just loads in seconds.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's pretty good.  If you can do that, you can do amazing gaming and all sorts of stuff.  This is using ray tracing and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  We have lots of games today in the Chrome Web Store and I suspect that in the near future  you'll see more and more bold examples of what can be done in the browser.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty incredible.  So 20, it's 20 bucks a month for education.  That includes 100 megabytes a month of 3G, which is low, but maybe for education that's  sufficient.  And you're saying, of course you get all the updates during that three year lifespan and  you're saying at the end of three years they get new hardware, they continue to just pay  20 bucks a month.  Yeah.  That's a, I think that's where I really see a market for something like this.  And what kind of uptake are you seeing in business and education?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's too early to say, you know, something meaningful because we just launched it, but  we are very pleased with the current response.  It's doing amazingly well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google is not one of those companies, Jeff Jarvis, that you talked about that have to  have the hit in the first two weeks or they say we're out.  They've got some resources to go with this for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean Chrome is a huge hit.  Chrome the browser itself is a huge hit.  Whatever happens to Chrome OS, you know, and Chrome is already really proven itself.  But I think Chrome OS is the thing that, I think that Chrome OS doesn't really speak  to power users like us as much as it does to a student or in a small IT department that  just wants a really easy way for people to get on, not have to maintain machines.  So that makes a lot of sense.  It makes sense.  We kind of lost on us a little bit, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, we're geeks.  We want more power.  We want, but you know, I think that there's certainly a market for something simpler.  Is that what you were saying before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a developer, if you want light devices with light development, then Android is harder  to develop for than HTML5 on Chrome OS, no?  I mean, if you're a company trying to get really light and once across development,  that's going to be its long-term strength.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Chrome OS will run HTML5 apps and as you're getting, you know, more and more powerful  browser in other devices, it will run on all the devices.  And as I said before, you know, you see Netflix, for instance, it's not a small company and  they're investing a lot in HTML5 to be on each and every device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the Chrome OS development really the same team as doing Chrome or are they separate  teams?  What kind of intersection is there between the two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the team are all sitting together.  There are, of course, devoted people that are specialized in operation systems and doing  very sophisticated stuff.  So we could have the simplest, most useful experience to users, but beneath the first  layer, you have very sophisticated things.  So there are separations, you know, in the small teams because each one got his own expertise,  but overall, they're all sitting together and all working to push that platform in the  same direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have Rome running, but I think I might have something else going on in the background.  This is, there's music on this by Danger Mouse, Daniele Lupi, oops, and that's Nora Jones,  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's like a film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like a film, but you could control the point of view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, how interesting.  So as I move my mouse around, I get different points of view.  Oh, look at that.  Exactly.  Holy cow.  And this is WebGL also?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All HTML5.  That's a new, a film in which you can control the point of view.  Yeah.  Yeah, that is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I like Nora Jones too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the music's great on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife thinks she's terribly boring, but I like her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's Danger Mouse on here too.  Everybody loves Danger Mouse.  Yes.  That's interesting.  So I wonder if you'll see more people, more artists using this as well.  That's an interesting idea.  You have some, it's limited, you know, you can't look everywhere, but you can kind of  look around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the focus of the Chrome OS team continues to be on devices that have keyboards and not  necessarily, not touchscreens.  That's kind of, the separation between Android and Chrome OS is still touchscreen versus  keyboard device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one aspect and you're totally right about it.  We're more looking at people that are producing content and not consuming content, but you  could definitely see other benefits that you have today with Chrome OS and in that, in  lots of cases, you know, less it's more.  So you have less things to worry about.  So it boots much faster.  The battery will last longer.  Lots of things that making people that need this netbook to be productive all day and  can't hook it to electricity.  Just different type of device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you see an OLPC style market, a third world market or an undeveloped world market for  this as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that one of the promising things is that as long as you could lower the price  and make it better and cheaper for people, we could see it going across the board.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I really like that.  I like that difference in differentiating between, you know, productivity product versus something  you consume.  Jeff famously reboxed his iPad here on the show because he said, you know, it's just  to consume.  I can't write a blog post.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He might have been wrong in hindsight on that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got it now.  I like it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, the tablet, the touchscreen is really, I enjoy it most for watching things  and for browsing, but writing a blog post, I'm going to sit at a keyboard or writing  a Google doc or, you know, creating any kind of doc I want to be at a full keyboard.  So I like that kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems to me that the two most limiting factors, well, I guess three.  One is batteries, two is input, and three is ubiquitous connectivity.  If we solved all those three things, right, if we have really easy input from anything  from just fingers or voice, right, if we could use them forever and use them everywhere,  that's the next explosion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and we're doing our best to address it in the Chromebooks.  I mean, you just touched the three points that the Chromebook excel at.  And to me, just the personal thing, I mean, the keyboard was really overwhelming good  at the beginning, not just because of the clicks and it just feel nice.  It's, you know, the caps locks.  I mean, in terms of this, you know, useless key that taking so much real estate, you have  now a search button.  Now for people that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the thing I like the best about the Chromebook.  They don't, because every computer I get, I turn off caps lock and you're playing, it  was so smart to put a search key there instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And actually a nice tip for people that are passionate about caps lock is just to hold  the two shift keys together for two seconds or three seconds.  And then the caps lock, the search button becoming a caps lock button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you really want to shout in a chat room.  Exactly.  Hold down both shift keys.  You can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was refreshing to see someone say this caps lock key is useless for most people.  Yeah, there's no reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we thank you for your time, Ido.  Oh, no, thank you.  It's an honor.  I appreciate it.  I was at Google in December and Sundar Pichai and I kind of got in a debate over the merits  of the idea of having just Chrome on a notebook.  But I have to say, having seen it, it's not for me, but I really see the market for it  as you said, with education, with environments where you want security, simplicity.  And I can see even older people, non-computer literate people might be very interested in  something like this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, personally, to me, it was overwhelming to see my father using it because he's an  avid email user and use Picasso and other photo sharing to send photos of his grandkids.  And it's just an amazing device for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  To me, it makes perfect sense for Google.  I mean, this is obviously perfect for Google.  The only question is, is it perfect for users?  And the market will let you know.  They're pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and we are very excited to see where it goes.  That's definitely true.  Thank you, Ido.  Thank you, Ido.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks for coming on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ido Green is a passionate developer advocate for Chrome OS and the Chromebook.  And yeah, it's great to have him on.  He asked to be on.  He's a fan of the show and he wanted to talk to us.  We're going to take a break and when we come back, we have more of those news items.  We're talking about Google in the cloud.  In fact, Jeff Jarvis, I want to ask you about the big Facebook privacy announcement of yesterday  in just a little bit.  But before we do, let me remind you about Netflix.  You know, I just installed the Chrome Netflix app.  It's so cool.  I mean, it's really pretty much the same as it would be if you had it in the web.  But you can watch on your Chromebook Netflix, which is pretty neat.  Netflix is everywhere.  It's of course on most new TVs, all the new Blu-ray players, PS3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii.  It's on many Android phones, I think 24 phones at last count, iPhone, even Windows Phone  This is a movie I'm kind of, I just like the title of it.  I don't know if I'd actually want to watch it.  Let me see if I can find this.  These are the new movies that have just come out.  It's a Rutger Hauer movie.  Rutger Hauer is hobo with a shotgun.  I don't know, it just sounded interesting to me.  Here's the beauty of this.  This may be a terrible movie.  In fact, with two and a half stars, it probably is.  But I could just watch it.  I watch it for five minutes, no harm, no foul, if it is bad.  I don't have to watch anymore.  There's more movies here.  In fact, I've watched a lot more and I've been more adventurous in my movie selections  I can just watch Netflix streaming.  I can see anything and if I don't like it, I can move on.  So I got to recommend this.  You probably already know about it.  In fact, if you're a Netflix user, just click that watch instantly tab.  But if you're not, you'd be doing us a favor.  If you go to Netflix.com slash twit, you'd be doing yourself a favor too, because you  get 30 days free of Netflix streaming.  Share it with your friends and family too.  It's just incredible.  Mad men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are brave for putting up your cue on the screen, Leo.  You know.  I love it in public.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So far, have you seen anything that I should be embarrassed about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Worst movie ever made.  Birdemic is now on Netflix streaming.  What is it called?  Birdemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Birdemic.  I haven't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of an homage to the birds, but a really low budget, funny low budget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The movies you see here are because of what you've been watching, right?  So I don't know how I got the emotional drug TV shows section.  I mean, they make stuff up by mixing stuff together.  It's like a mashup of categories.  I just watched a Burning Man documentary, so now they say more like Burning Man.  Best of the Beatles, Revolution in Cairo, Inside the Baker Boys, How to Get Ahead in  Advertising.  That was an interesting movie.  More witty dysfunctional family TV shows.  That's because I watch it home with my family.  They know.  So far, goofy French language films, romantic showbiz dramas.  You can kind of tell something about me, can't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always get the cerebral documentary with a strong female lead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get that one a lot too.  I like that.  I like that.  In fact, I think I do have the strong female lead category.  Cult movies, dark movies, foreign movies.  Here it is, foreign movies featuring a strong female lead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  The Piano, what a great movie that was.  Anyway, you can see why we love Netflix.  Netflix.com slash twit if you're not yet a member.  And if you are, tell a friend.  Do us a favor.  We love it.  And now on the Chromebook.  I think that's pretty impressive.  They put it on the Chromebook.  That's wild.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  Gina Trapani as well.  We're talking about Google and the cloud and what's gone on.  Now, Jeff, you got a briefing from Facebook on this privacy change.  It hasn't rolled out everywhere.  I guess tomorrow it's going to start rolling out a small group of Facebook users at a time.  But it's clearly to me a response to Google+.  I know they deny that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they said they've been working on this for more than five months.  So who knows what they knew from Google and leaks or how this world works.  But it certainly looks like an homage to Google+.  But I think the bigger thing that interests me there is I think we're moving toward now  a shared norm about sharing and that putting the controls for sharing when you share appropriate  controls there is the much smarter way to do it.  The one time fits all preferences that you put in and the defaults that become an issue  and all that.  Knowing what you're doing when you're doing it and finding a way to make that easy and  fast I think is very, very clever of both.  And I think it just advances this whole idea and this notion of sharing, which of course  I'm in favor of.  So I think they did a lot of smart things.  I think they also gave you more control.  So it's a normal one when you share, you know with whom you're sharing what you're doing  instead of everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On a share by share basis.  On a share by share basis.  They'll even give you a preview of what it's going to look like to the outside world, which  is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have a sense.  Then you also control your profile page so that someone can't put something there without  you, which is really important and again I think fairly obvious.  So if someone tags you in a photo, you get to approve or not.  You get to approve the tag in any case.  That was a huge problem before.  It was a big problem.  Now of course someone can still write a caption that says Gina Kavani is in this photo.  But they can do that anywhere on the web.  There's no big deal there.  It just means that you're not searchable under that tag for that photo.  And I think the other person still gets to keep their freedom of speech saying no no  no Gina was there.  I saw her with that beer.  They changed the notion of everyone to public, which I think also makes a great deal of sense.  They added, interestingly I forgot this one, they added accountability to tags.  So when someone tags you, you now know who tagged you.  And it says so.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Plus just did that themselves.  It's funny in the like button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked them whether that was going to be true retroactively and at first they said  no they came back and said yes.  So if you tagged someone you shouldn't have tagged before, now they're going to know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This article on search engine land takes what I just said one step farther.  They say new Facebook sharing controls undermine Google's privacy advantage, the Google Plus  privacy advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it was over, Google Plus had never privacy advantage.  They had a functional advantage.  And I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is merely expressing what is now a standard way of thinking about how we  share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like how we turn a page online now.  It's just everybody's going to have this.  This is the expectation of how you're going to do it.  This puts a proper level of control.  I think it makes people more comfortable with sharing, which is a good thing.  Now what's interesting to me is now your Facebook profile page, the Google profile page is a  public page period done.  And so what you put there is there for the world to see.  For Facebook in essence you end up with an infinite number of profile pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's really interesting.  It's so granular.  Your page will look different to everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right so I can share something with the twig crew but not with my journalism crew.  And of course the problem here though for Facebook is I don't have crews.  Because circles, they didn't have groups until well after I had all my friends and I'm not  going to go back and retrofit circles into it.  So that's a problem.  That means I have less functionality by the nature of the time being along with Facebook.  So what do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why competition is a good thing.  This is why we should say let a thousand social networks bloom because the best features will  come out.  And hey I believe that Facebook maybe was working on this before Google+.  I mean people have been shouting about the fact that Facebook's privacy was so difficult  to decipher for a really long time.  But I'm sure that Google plus gave them a little nudge.  I think there's a little fire under the behind.  So I'm really I'm glad to see this.  I mean the fact is in real life you're aware when you're speaking of who can hear you.  And that's how it should be online.  And I'd love to see that this is going to be a new standard that these are things going  to be upfront and center that it's not going to be difficult for anyone to understand.  I hope that Facebook doesn't opt people into or out of things without asking them first  or just decide on aggressive default.  I think they've learned that lesson haven't they now?  I hope so.  But I think that having Google in the game and any other new social network in the game  you know kind of helps helps them make those decisions.  You know that that's very successful.  It's as successful as G plus helps them make those decisions faster.  But again really happy to see a new standard kind of being set and these new concepts of  public and and subsets of that come you know be upfront and center.  These two major you know these are the two major networks at this point.  I mean besides Twitter of course but Twitter is just so binary it's you know protected  or public so great for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bradley Horowitz VP of product for Google plus spoke to Tim O'Reilly got a lot of press.  Some called it the in fact this Matt McGee writing in search engine land called it the  state of Google plus talk.  Google's been great Bradley's been great Vic has been great about talking about Google  and admitting things like as Bradley said in this conversation we need to improve.  He also though said that these Facebook privacy controls are good for users and what they  did was familiar implying that in fact yes it's very similar to Google plus but also  maybe if you could you could take it in another context familiar in the sense that as we were  saying this is just what everybody's going to expect from now on.  That I guess not on Twitter because Twitter has a default of public but anywhere where  you might have some expectation of privacy these kinds of very granular very specific  controls are just going to be the state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem here is I think we've got to move away from privacy being the structure of the  discussion because as I've been trying to say for a long time and others are saying it too.  This is the wrong place to put a secret.  You know it's not really about it is about focused relevant sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What the hell you doing putting those secrets on the Internet.  Right. Stop it.  So incredibly stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Better ways to share than better ways to hide.  That's the right way to frame the conversation.  Definitely. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room asked what I thought of the Nim wars what they're calling Nim wars  pseudonym wars and Bradley in his talk Bradley said straight up that they need to improve  their entire process for dealing with profiles that use pseudonyms and I'm not sure that he  went as far as to say they need to change their policy but I definitely heard from him that  that Google is trying to figure out what they need to do about pseudonyms and being anonymous.  The doctor Kiki discussion that we had a few episodes ago.  It seems like they're going really slowly with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they got taken off guard frankly.  Yeah I think that they made a kind of ill thought out decision which if you don't really  really think deeply about it is is a good idea which is well if people have their own  their own conversations and use their real names and we'll have a more civil Google plus  they didn't really think it out.  He said to Tim he said I understand pseudonymity and anonymity there are use cases that we  don't need to be educated about.  I understand the importance of importance of this for the Internet culture.  He said Google is working on a way to allow anonymity inside Google plus there's quote no  moral opposition to that happening.  We want to let them in in a way that's great for the whole community.  It's a high priority.  I think they just got blindsided.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I also think this hockey stick growth you know that any other any other startup  wouldn't have you know because they're Google and they have the established user base.  Right.  And it is a data store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can work.  Yeah.  Well but they have a tricky it's not obvious the solution now they have added this  verified button.  So presumably Lady Gaga is verified and which is a pseudonym.  She's not Lady Gaga.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Madonna has well Madonna's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I just started following her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Her name is Madonna and the last name is dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Madonna dot.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Madonna dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But she's verified.  So I didn't notice the dot.  That's pretty funny.  That's her last name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you required to have a last name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't even notice that Lady Gaga's first name is Lady.  So right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So she's got two names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now Madonna is not posting herself most of the time.  It's her people they don't even make any bones about it.  It's like they use Madonna and the third person.  But occasionally she'll say something like thanks for all the birthday love.  And I presume that that's her.  I don't know.  So they also Bradley also spoke about the brand issue.  They said we've kicked out tens of thousands of brands that wanted to get into the service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And angered millions of their customers he said.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said Google Apps customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  We want to be a good experience for the brands the people that follow that want to follow them.  And I think he's right to say this.  And the people that don't.  That's the issue.  How do you how do you allow brands in without junking up Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really appreciate that I got a verified badge.  I think you did to Leo and you probably did to Jeff.  Although I wondered why.  I mean I know they said people that have been added to a lot of circles.  But you're like one of the you're in the top 20 of the top 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think that they invited us.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They invited.  But how do they know it's me.  I mean I've never called you.  No they know they never called me.  I mean you know I have a lot of your pictures.  I have a lot of pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a must be you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a fake Tom Friedman this week.  Huh.  On Google Plus.  There was a fake Tom Friedman.  Really.  Who would fake Tom Friedman.  I know I know it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Checkout account with my credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They never asked either any of us right.  We never heard from them.  They never said we want to verify it's you.  Send us a hair for a DNA sample.  They know it's us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They invited us.  We came on you know we're easy.  I don't know how the scales.  I don't know how verification scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's a thing.  You know I don't know.  I just feel like there has to be some sort of automated.  I just wish that they would have said I think.  Was it not all that does it.  There are products that verify your identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how I verified my profile.  If you were in the old days of the Google profile you'd go to  the your null page.  And then it would look up your phone number.  Or you know you'd give it a phone number it would do a cross  lookup if it matched in the phone book you'd say OK that  must be you.  Or you would give it a credit card which is what I did  because I'm on unlisted numbers.  And it said oh yeah that's you the credit card matches.  So go ahead.  You're Leo.  And that's how I have.  In fact I was a little mad because I had a verified profile  which I lost when Google plus.  All right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That must be the reason why I just maybe that's it upfront  about that.  I wish that they had said people who've been added to a lot  of circles and who had verified their profiles previously or  had a Google check out account.  I wish that there has to be some sort of criteria involving  a phone number or credit card.  You know I just wish that they had been upfront about that.  I worried I wondered about it.  But otherwise I think I think it's a good thing.  And I'd like to see them be a little more transparent about  how this happens like Twitter.  You know you can get verified on Twitter but it's really not  clear who or why or how what you need to do.  And they only do it for people who are in danger of being  impersonated.  I just wish that that was a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it could be actually a business or a service that you  could outsource to the credit card company the post office  somebody like that.  And you know I'm actually I haven't written about the  NIM fight yet much because I'm kind of very much in the middle  of it on it which is unusual for me.  And and I think they're both right.  They're both wrong that that Dana Boyd whom I love and  respect like no one on earth and she's brilliant but she called  Google requiring real names to be an abuse of power.  Well I don't go that far because it's strong.  Yeah it's Google service.  Google can decide what it wants to be and people don't want to  use it.  They won't use it but it is their service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She makes an interesting point that that that the people who  are disadvantaged by a anti anonymity policy are not people  like you and me the white power base.  It's the downtrodden that suffer.  Well I know you understand that I'm not I'm not explaining to  you I just want to make sure that that got heard that that  was her point on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And and but yet we also have trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's obviously Google's not trying to Google's not  trying to say hey we're white males and we don't need to be  anonymous.  They're trying to fight trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I rarely say this but there's the need for a conference where  there's a need to try to get subject around identity and  there have been some of course but but in a different context  about about identity in other ways but not anonymity use

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  identity and privacy.  They all are.  There's a nexus of all three of these and the value of  publicness and the value of which is why you should lead  this conference.  This is what I will attend because it's a really it should

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be. It's a good this is me and this is my identity and I want  credit for this and it's not easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I would say in Google's defense.  This is a difficult thing to solve.  I agree.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great discussion though.  When I read Dana's post I thought about you know what's the  first thing that the police does when they when they pull you  over on the side of the road.  They say license and registration like demanding  identification and even going through China you know demanding  identification from everyone to use a service is definitely a  way for an authority for an authority to assert power papers  please papers.  Exactly exactly.  And I have to tell you my Google Plus gets gets spammed all the  time by people who put in fake but but but legitimate looking  first and last names.  So this isn't.  So I think Dana's headline was strong and her assertion was  really strong but I think there's some truth in that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's absolutely something I think there's a middle ground  here and others been trying to find the middle ground and I  think that there the middle ground comes not to one size  fits all rules and that's where I absolutely agree with Dana.  But there also comes to the means where I as a user want  the control and maybe I as a user make the choice to only see  verified people or real names and I'm losing out on part of  the world and then maybe a foolish thing to do but give me  the control to do that.  And Google should find a way to kind of pull out of that and  figure out how to do that.  But I also agree that if it became nothing but stupid  spam identities it would be my space and even Tom Anderson  gets this.  You know he's written some really amazing things on Google  Plus.  I've asked him on the show he doesn't want to do public stuff  yet.  I run up he's just kind of getting back to being public but  he's written some really amazing things about this and I  think he understands this too.  My space was a bunch of fake identities and fake stuff and  it had no value in the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Samsung in its lawsuit with Apple.  Apple's claiming that Samsung stole the design for their  tablets and their phones from the Apple iPad and the iPhone.  Samsung Exhibit D Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001 A  Space Odyssey.  That is great.  The tablet in the clip has an overall rectangular shape with  a dominant display screen narrow borders a predominantly flat  front surface a flat black surface back surface which is  evident because the tablets are lying flat and a thin form  factor.  Samsung says those tablets are prior art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish they'd gone in and hacked it and put you know like  chrome on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just shows you know the idea for a tablet isn't that original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know Annali Newitz is the editor of IONI which is a  fantastic sci fi blog.  Had this conversation at South by Southwest a few years ago  about how futurism and how science fiction is a way in  which we you know plant the seeds for what will be right.  I mean it's not just imagination.  You plant these notions into people's minds about what the  future could look like and then it happens.  So I just love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Example.  I just thought that was a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a there's a famous one too and I'm forgetting who did  it but a a night reader prototype of a tablet in 1994.  Right.  That was in wood.  Right.  That existed.  It was real.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and Apple did do very famously in.  I think it was in the late 80s.  Pretty sure it was late 80s a film which I will find of the  knowledge navigator which is a tablet.  So this idea has been going around and Apple.  I don't think it was the first but Apple has prior art too.  But I don't think anything goes back farther than 2001 a space  odyssey which came out I think in 1968.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just added the link to the night reader tablet if you care.  Yeah.  I can find it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's under other under last other under other.  We share Google Doc.  That's how we talk to one of the we have so many things to talk  about and and so little time.  There it is.  Night reader tablet.  If I could find that that knowledge navigator that's  actually a great video.  That is a classic video.  So this is a 1994.  Yeah.  There it is.  Yeah.  Night reader a vision for the future.  So this newspaper plant is outmoded and old fashioned.  Who needs ink and newsprint.  When you can put your newspaper on an electronic device someday  in the future this tablet PC will be going to talk up man.  You are you are.  Well I just had to happen there.  Here in our factory we're talking about it at a square  table.  Our engineers nod and agree a tablet is the future of night  reader news.  How do you like my hair.  Wow.  Not to a 90s.  Look you see this.  This is a piece of paper.  If we could only make something electronic that will the same  form factor we could conquer the world.  That reader sold him a clatchy several years ago no longer  exists.  Nor does this guy.  I wonder if I could find that old YouTube that knowledge  that I bet I could Google knowledge navigator and  probably find it.  What other stories you want to cover before we get to our  tooltip and number of the week.  Anything.  There's so many I'm looking at all these.  It's amazing.  Yeah here's the video it's on where video dot google dot com.  I'm going to miss Google video when it's gone.  This is the quality is not very good.  I think it was from a VHS tape.  Apple prepared this.  I think for the Ted conference one of the first Ted  conferences.  Yeah.  And I the reason I know that is I have the laser disk from  that Ted conference that this video is on.  That's what it was still called.  Edward.  Edward before it was Ted.  Oh come on play video.  Great great music in this too.  So here we are in a kind of normal.  Oh what is that.  Why it looks like the Microsoft Courier.  Oh and by the way it's got a guy in a bow tie inside of the  talks to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Robert Jordan a second semester junior requesting a second  extension on his term paper.  And her mother reminding you about your father's birthday  party next Sunday.  Today you have a faculty lunch at twelve o'clock.  You need to take Kathy to the airport by two.  You have a lecture at four fifteen on deforestation in the  Amazon rainforest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he does a lot of the you know the stuff he's got a graph  and he pinches it and ranges it.  I mean this is all very much and this is a very old university  video.  And and I think the main purpose of this really was to  demonstrate voice navigation as opposed to the tablet but it  just seems so obvious I think to everybody at the time that  that would be the form factor right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prior I should be a talking paperclip I think that's the  mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With a bow tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We couldn't wait for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good news for Google Music I think in this decision this  court decision that Michael Robertson's MP3 tunes didn't  was protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.  It was a service by the way Michael Robertson's company was  bought by Google and I think he's a Google employee now he's  the guy who started MP3 dot com.  So service that allowed you to well it kept a single copy just  as Dropbox does of any song that people uploaded if it was  the same song and the court said no they can do that.  That's that's fine.  There's MP3 tunes.  They did actually find Robertson for his own uploads.  That wasn't OK.  But they said the court and I think this helps Google a  little bit.  Google you remember and Amazon both declined to pay license  fees to the music industry for the music they were storing on  their service.  But they have been keeping I think separate copies of  everything.  Let's see there's a new YouTube version of Hangout.  Did you see that.  Where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah there's a new link below YouTube videos.  That is that we mean to send it to a hangout.  You can say hey you know come hang out and watch this YouTube  video which is it's under the share button.  So you have to be on YouTube video look at share and then you  can say start a hangout watching this YouTube video.  See I think that's great.  Yeah it's great.  I mean watching YouTube videos is kind of a cool way to use  Hangouts but it's sort of buried and not obvious how to do  it.  But now you can launch that straight from Hangout.  I think we're starting to see a lot of we're going to.  I think this is just the beginning of Google Plus  integration across the web that the plus one button also is  getting upgraded.  I don't have it yet but you can share when you plus one  something it'll share a snippet to your Google Plus stream.  So right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think that the neat thing about this is that we're  starting to see Google as we expected to see Google Plus  starting to show up and other Google properties.  Yeah.  So this is you have to.  It is kind of hidden.  You click the share button.  You can.  That's where you get that embed code and all that stuff and  right there watch with your friends start a Google Hangout  and now I presume that I was that shy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that show up only if you're in Google Plus I assume.  No this is on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's on YouTube for everybody.  Yeah that's what's it.  Oh I see if you're a Google Plus user.  I don't know what happens if you're not a user.  Yeah that's a good question.  You must probably it says oh you get that page where oh you're  not a member but you could join.  Yeah.  Page.  And this looks exactly like I haven't done this with.  I know you did it right away with YouTube Gina but this is  what it looks like right.  This is the normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah well it's right.  That's what it looks like and it should be it should be loading  up looks like it's a little bit slow there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah everything's going slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I wonder I mean I wonder if the video is paused until  someone joins you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I suspect it says it's waiting for Google Shared Space Gadgets  dot app spot dot com.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh so it does start playing right away and then you can  invite someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm all alone in here.  Nobody's watching this video with me.  It's just me.  But I don't see many invitations.  I thought you know I should see that because I follow you but  I'm not going to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends on who you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did I invite you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh there you are.  There you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this so it's public by default I guess.  Because I didn't see an invite or maybe there was an invite I  just missed didn't see it.  So it's public but it would take my camera and that would best  things out for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it went to extended circles and not public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It goes to extended circles.  Let's see.  Let me look.  Let me go back here.  Start a Google Hangout.  Let's do it again.  I got it online.  Well you're my extended family.  Do you want allow.  Yes.  Well I don't know why suddenly is asking me that.  All right.  Anyway enough.  We get it.  I think the reason it's a story to me is that it was just a  matter of time before Google starts putting links to plus  features in other Google properties.  No doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No doubt.  I think we're going to see a lot more of those kind of shared  experience type things through Hangout.  Games and now they're pushing the YouTube capability.  So I'm really excited about like screen sharing and being able  to I would love to be able to do a talk with demonstrations  you know about think up my desktop.  So I'm hoping fingers crossed for that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I have a plus one button on my blog.  Whoops it went away.  Let's do it again.  And look at this.  Now this is just if you put a plus one button on your blog  before you just click it it would give you a plus one.  But now what it does is share on Google plus.  Yeah.  So this is a new feature as well where everybody who has a  plus one button on their blogs or web pages automatically has  kind of this built in share on Google plus feature all people  have to do is high is a hover over the plus button and they'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  get and that mine hair is about to be illegal and Schleswig  whole shine.  What.  Why the head of data protection and show only if you're a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  government web page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No no no no no no no any any page will get will get could be  fined up to 50,000 euro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think they could find me from here from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No no if you're if you're in if you're a site in because that's  the thing that's the reason he didn't go to the vicar is the  head of data protection there.  He couldn't go after Facebook because he has no jurisdiction.  So instead he's going after sites in the state that use the  like button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well or things like that.  I guess their point is and this is something probably people  don't know is that when you put a like or plus button on your  page you are sending information to Google whether people click  it or not.  It gives a window on your page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But no different from an ad call.  As I call exactly the same as an ad call.  You're right.  They said this is the way the web works.  That's a good point.  Right.  So you know this this guy's a grandstander.  He and I went after each other in Berlin.  Sounds strange and really does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're wearing black.  We're wearing black leather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so he's you know Facebook says that they're fine with his  equivalent in Hamburg but he goes after them.  You ever called Facebook.  And he says that that if you're clearly if you click on the like  button you're telling the world you like it.  Right.  Right.  If you are signed in but don't click well the service can tell you  hey your friends like this page.  They're using that to customize and that's OK.  And if you're not signed in it sends your IP address for a brief  period.  But so does everything on the page.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about Google Analytics.  I mean they're basically saying that any Google ads would be  illegal.  Yeah.  That's right.  I mean that's like saying that a web page can't you know can only  make can only request documents from one server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Isn't that weird.  It just is so so ignorant about how it works.  And so I got to do a big hustle on Google Plus about this.  I at the same time I went into search Google News for specific  Holstein and Facebook and up popped a story out of nowhere that  a 42 year old politician had just resigned in disgrace because he  had had an affair via Facebook with a 16 year old girl.  Oh boy.  And so I went on that and my commenters went berserk on me  that this was no comparison.  It's the age of consent is 16.  This is completely wrong.  And why are you putting these two together and you should put  them together.  I think that we have government officials who are saying that  Facebook is a threat when it's not.  It's three old men politicians who are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We know that.  In brief a couple of other stories Fox and CBS both  announced that we talked about this I think last week that they  were going to give you an eight day delay before you could watch  TV shows like Glee on Hulu.  You'd have to wait eight days after the original airing from  Bittorrent comes word the law of unintended consequences.  There's a major piracy surge and this is exactly what we're  talking about on Twitter on Sunday.  What's the competition for Hulu.  What's the competition for CBS's website.  It's Bittorrent.  It's Pirate Bay.  And so you do this of course you're going to have more piracy during  the first five days of this policy.  The number of downloads from the US for the latest episode of for  instance Hell's Kitchen increased 114 percent for Masters Chef 189  percent.  Apparently people who like cooking shows love to pirate them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love those shows but I don't pirate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that.  But it's not a surprise.  But I guess you're right.  It was it was obvious that that was going to be the case.  Speaking of obvious I've signed up for the lift project.  I have no idea what it does.  This is the latest from Tony Stubble vine.  It sounds like a cult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm excited about this.  Did you sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean I'm excited about this just from sort of the lifehacker  perspective of you know I've been writing about goal setting web  apps for you to do apps and for years and it sounds like this is  going to be like Twitter crossed with a goal setting app.  So you see you kind of you set a goal you say I want to run a mile  or I want to run a marathon and then it sounds like short messages  or tweets that say when you reach that goal or when you reach the  milestone for that goal and sharing it with with with other  people.  I love that.  Yeah I love that too.  I mean I love.  I'll just fail every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll get messages like you suck Jeff you suck you suck you suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's positive reinforcement versus getting getting criticized.  By the way speaking of positive and negative reinforcement I made  the bad decision to read all of twigs one star reviews in iTunes  which are outnumbered by the more star reviews but but they're  cut but they were sad to read.  So I'm going to ask but they're also pretty old.  There weren't any new ones.  So I'm going to ask our listeners to please go to iTunes and tell us  what you tell us what you really think and be nice.  But we have criticism.  Let us know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Tell us the truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell us the truth but constructive criticism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know I never read those but I will now if you put what made you  do that Gina.  I you know I thought they'd be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Many of them were really good and thank you to everyone who did  delete.  And I actually I'm fine with negative reviews if I learn  something and we can we can get better and we would totally want  to get better.  Where they just kind of dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I know I know they told me to shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well they said that a few of them said that we were too pro  Google which you know we are Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're somewhat somewhat pro Google.  Yeah I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that we wander off track sometimes.  Obviously new to the twit network when they say that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of our shows never begin on time.  Leo never stays on track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is why you never read these reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know what they say and they're right.  I don't deny it.  But that's why there are hundreds of thousands of podcasts for you to  choose from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently I was popping my peas back in 2009.  Well we fixed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We fixed our shame on you.  We fixed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway let's get back to the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does impact us though because when people go to subscribe to the  podcast if there's negative you know it's only two stars or there's  negative reviews that are surfaced people don't subscribe to the  podcast they may never hear our wonderful show.  So put some good stuff in there too.  So lift.do if you want to sign up.  I did.  But you didn't get in did you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No no I didn't.  I just read right.  Had some extra more details even than the website.  They do some good good journalism over there.  So it sounds like Twitter for goals.  I'm excited about it because it appeals to the life hacker productivity  bent.  So I'm excited to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Always always glad to see new web apps new web sites and the Twitter's  behind this one.  But Tony's double fine is from open geo right.  Not open geo simple geo.  I think.  I think that's where he came from.  I see that Gina I have stolen.  I apologize.  Your app is a week.  I have a tip of the week.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Docs is getting a little bit of upgrade.  You can upload whole folders to Google Docs.  I mean Google really wants you to put everything into the cloud.  But if you have a folder with some folders and you go into Google Docs you  hit the upload button and it will upload all the files in those folders.  The Google Docs Android app also got an update.  So if you have the latest update you can take a picture with your phone and  you can save it to your web clipboard which means then you can go to your  desktop and it's available to paste or insert into a doc.  So lots of lots of cool docs features there.  You can also see you can also use the share.  If you're looking at a file on your on your Android device you can use the  share menu to send it to a Google Doc.  So lots of more and more ways to get stuff into Google Docs these days  including tire folders.  And I'm starting to use almost all of my disk space.  So don't tell us.  I bought more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bought like a much a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  SkyDrive is good too.  No it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's so funny because I mean I look at Google Docs and all the features all  these new features are constantly being added.  It's very capable very usable.  And then SkyDrive it's like well can I.  Oh I can't.  Can I.  No I can't.  Why you'd use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still love that you can take a picture with your phone of a whiteboard and  send and create you know create a Google Doc have it scan.  Awesome.  Easing.  It's like that.  It's it is the future.  So yeah Google Docs is awesome.  I use SkyDrive.  It's pretty it's pretty good.  Not as much as Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yes you don't want to get that review.  She's such a Google fan girl.
