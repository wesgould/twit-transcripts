We'll start with Matthew Ingram all the way over here from Giga Home,  just back from Italy.  Hello, Matthew.  Hi.  Good to have you.  You were in Perugia for what conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The International Journalism Festival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't a conference.  It was a festival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like a conference, but more fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sounds awesome.  Awesome.  Also with us, Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York,  the author of What Would Google Do? and Public Parts.  The esteemed Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're going in reverse order.  I am.  I'm throwing you, aren't I?  Usually I...  You gotta mix it up.  Yeah.  Mix it up.  Yeah, I usually start with ladies first, Gina Trapani of SmarterWear.org,  founding editor of Lifehacker and the creator of ThinkUp at ThinkUp.com.  Hello, everybody.  Oh, and host of All About Andre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So yesterday, I let you guys...  This is a review unit from AT&T of the Galaxy S4.  I just heard mine shipped today from...  I bought the unlocked European one from Expansis, which has the octa-core.  It's an 8-core.  This is AT&T's quad-core Snapdragon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No LTE then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No LTE, but I'm going to run it on T-Mobile,  and their HSPA Plus is pretty fast here.  So I don't need LTE.  I wanted an unlocked phone for travel, right, Matthew?  You need an unlocked phone.  Yeah, I agree.  And...  But Samsung did lend us this...  Or I guess AT&T lent us this for a review,  and I will review it on before you buy next week.  But we did a little unboxing yesterday.  You guys played with it on All About Android.  What were your thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, we checked it on All About Android.  Didn't you?  Yeah, we did.  We totally did, Ron.  Thank you for lending it to us.  We really like it.  It's a beautiful phone.  I think the one thing we were concerned about was that the storage...  A lot of storage.  It ships with like 40 times storage already used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's only 16 gigs total, but you can't put an SD card.  My experience with Android, though, is SD cards don't work as well as internal memory.  Have you had that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't put apps on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like half full, right, when it ships?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, let me see.  Let's just check.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a phone problem, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I've already put apps on here, so it won't...  This is not going to show what it has when it ships, but...  This is the other thing, by goodness gracious, there are a lot of settings.  This is the settings panel.  It's now tabbed.  So I presume I'll go to my device and look for storage.  You got to get used to a whole new way of finding stuff.  I don't see it there.  Maybe under more.  Yeah, storage.  So that was tab three.  Total space left after...  Now, I've installed 100 apps.  It's 9 gigs.  I've got 2 gigs of applications.  I don't have any pictures, videos, or audio on here yet.  So...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Total...  Oh, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Total space 9.62 gigs.  That's total available space after I put my stuff on 6.9 gigs.  So you are going to buy...  You need to buy an SD card in here.  And absolutely, there won't be room for pictures, videos, or audio on the main storage.  You'll have to put it on the SD card.  And you can't uninstall any of the Samsung apps.  It's odd.  Yeah, you can't uninstall the Samsung apps without rooting, I presume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  So that was a little bit like...  Not loving that.  But beautiful looking, good looking phone.  I mean, I'm really torn.  I love the HTC One.  I just love that the speakers on the front.  I love the design of it.  It's just the hardware looks really nice.  But I am curious about the Samsung apps in particular.  And the S4 looks really nice.  You have the screen side by side, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, here's identical.  Now, and I should say on the Galaxy S4 AMOLED, I've set it to movie mode,  which supposedly is the most color accurate mode.  It's not that bright Samsung AMOLED look.  Is the HTC thinner?  They're pretty similar.  HTC is a little, maybe a little thinner.  It feels heavier because it's metal.  The Samsung, I already remarked the fact because it's plastic, it feels cheesy.  It's made even cheesier by this pseudo chrome on the edge here,  which it just really feels junky.  That's plastic?  It's plastic.  It's all plastic.  And that's fine because you get better antenna characteristics.  If it's a question of hardware,  the nice thing about the One is it has 32 and 64 gigabyte models.  So you can have plenty of storage on here.  You can't add an SD card.  But in some ways, I think main storage trumps SD  because you can use all of it for apps and so forth.  The screen, I think, is better on the HTC One.  Both are 1080p screens.  HTC One is a higher dot pitch because it's slightly smaller, 4.7 compared to 5.  But I think it's also because it's an IPS LCD.  I think the screen is more accurate than...  A lot of people love super AMOLED look, that rich saturation, the deep blacks.  And I have to agree.  But this screen, to me, the HTC One screen is a better screen.  Battery life is poor on both of them.  But because the HTC is not removable, it's more of an issue.  I actually am buying a Mophie case for this HTC One.  The Galaxy S4 I'm going to do as I've done with other Samsung phones,  which is just buy a separate battery because  it's very easy to pry off the back on the Galaxy and put a new battery in.  I think that's a real advantage to having...  That's where plastic gets you somewhere, right?  Yeah.  If you're going to put it in a case, and I think in both cases,  you probably are, then who cares what the actual phone feels like?  Both are very fast.  I don't think you're going to...  Some people have complained about, and I haven't had this S4 long enough,  but I have read reviews that complain about some hesitation and sluggishness on the S.  By the way, you notice I have replaced Sense and TouchWiz with my own launcher.  I use the Nova launcher, and I far prefer different widgets as well.  But that's going to be the big difference, in my opinion,  and the deciding factor on which phone you get.  Is... Yes, you're right, Gina.  The front-facing speakers are so much superior on the HTC One.  That boom sound really is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They're running a commercial centered around the speakers,  like basically saying it makes no sense if you want to listen to something  that the speakers would be facing forward.  It has bands on stage facing the back, and it really gets the message across.  Yeah, they're really smart.  I mean, on one hand, I think, well, am I really watching something that I care about the audio  being perfect on my phone?  No.  Increasingly, people watch videos and pass their phone around  and listen to voicemails on speaker.  It really does make a lot more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because of these good speakers, it might change things a little bit,  because you can actually just prop the HTC One up and listen to a book or even music,  and it sounds good enough.  So in a case where you might have bought external speakers for your phone,  it's pretty good.  It's certainly good enough for an audiobook.  Surprisingly good sound.  But the big difference, I think, is the customizations that both manufacturers did to Android.  I think that's really, especially for our audience, where it's going to be the deciding factor.  And it's really going to depend on what you do, what you want your phone to do.  HTC Sense dumbs this phone down considerably.  And there's things you cannot change.  I'll give you a really simple example.  My lock screen.  Now, I happen to like the HTC Sense lock screen a lot.  I'm using a photo screen.  So it's doing a photo album.  It's got time and weather.  But these four, five icons on the bottom, the controls, phone, message,  lock, internet, and camera cannot be changed.  I use Chrome.  I don't use the built-in internet browser.  I don't use the AT&T messages instead of the standard messages.  So I would like to change these.  On the Samsung, the lock screen is infinitely, in fact, perhaps too configurable.  Notice I've taken off the life companion, replaced it with my name.  That was one of the first things I did.  But you could put widgets on here.  You can really change it.  HTC Sense is much more locked down.  There are not nearly as many settings when you go to the system settings.  And of course, with Sense, as with Samsung's TouchWiz,  they've changed how the standard Android settings look and work.  And AT&T has configured this too.  And this may be different for you.  But AT&T has taken away some things that I find very valuable.  For instance, in power usage, I want to know,  this is prettier than the Android look.  But I want to know when it comes to usage, how much is devoted to the screen?  AT&T or HTC, I'm not sure which has disabled that.  I believe it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They obviously went out of their way to obscure that information from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the screen is a big part of the drain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  But the fact that they went out of their way to remove that from the list...  I find that very annoying.  Yeah.  It's shady.  It's shady.  It's shady what it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's going to be the negative on the HTC One.  If you're the kind of person that really wants to get in there and tweak it,  Samsung's gone the exact opposite direction.  I've never seen so many settings.  This rivals Facebook for the number of tweaks and settings and things you can do.  Hundreds of settings in here.  Everything is configurable.  If you're the kind of person that wants a phone where you customize it up the wazoo,  if you'll forgive my French, this is a much better choice for you.  If you're the kind of person that wants a phone just to be beautiful and functional,  then the one...  I have to say I really like the Zoe's and the highlights that the HTC One makes.  I think that the camera is a great feature.  I like the low-light capability of the camera.  I think the HTC One camera does rival the iPhone 5, even in bright light.  It's a very nice camera despite its 4 megapixels.  Samsung opted for this 13 megapixel camera.  And the other thing that you'll notice with the Galaxy S4 immediately,  the load-up of crapware is unbelievable.  Things like scrolling a page as you look up and down.  I don't know anybody who's going to use this.  The camera settings go on and on and on and on.  I mean, there's just...  There's so much you can do with this thing.  Again, if you like that kind of thing,  if you like to be able to customize everything like crazy,  you're going to be very happy.  A lot of it feels like junkware.  And certainly some of the things like hovering  and scrolling with the eyes and stuff feel a little bit gimmicky.  However, I played a little bit, for instance, with the Samsung...  Some of the Samsung modes are very interesting.  Let me see if I can find the...  I'll go back to my gallery here.  I did a...  What is it?  They call that the highlight mode or the superstar mode  where you could take a picture of a person moving  and get all the images.  The One has a few things sort of like this,  but I think that that's still also a little bit gimmicky.  I don't know.  There's so many modes in this thing.  It is so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You have such a good staff, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They play along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They really do.  They play along.  They're so totally game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're good.  So you tap this mode button and it has auto mode,  which is probably where you mostly work, beauty face,  best photo takes a series of pictures,  selects the best, it takes eight pictures,  best face, you take a number of pictures,  five pictures of the group,  and then pick which part of the group you want the best face from  and combine the five pictures.  The One does something very similar,  although I couldn't get it to work.  Sound and shot is a still where there's audio behind it.  Drama is the one that I was showing  where it's multiple pictures of somebody moving in a single frame.  The stupidest one, there's animated photo, which is...  The stupidest one is the one, of course, with you in the middle of it,  where it takes pictures from both the front and the back cameras.  Very, very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, the dad photo, right?  Yeah, the dad photo.  The dad's always taking pictures of the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a few of those.  And you have different frame treatments and so forth,  but to me, it looks very odd.  Here, I'll show you what mine looked like  because it looks like my head's just floating in the middle of the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got to tell you, I'm kind of exhausted just going through all those.  This feels like the Microsoft Word.  It is.  It would just get more and more setting, more and more features  to just to sell another new version, right?  But it would just be exhausting.  Like as a user, you'd be like, I just want to bold some text.  Or take a photo.  Yeah, I just liked the photo.  I don't want to scroll through this endless carousel of special shots  that I don't even know what they mean.  What is beauty face?  I don't know.  Beauty face is going to help me out on this HD camera here.  Beauty face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want beauty.  So you're exactly right.  To me, this is the kind of philosophical difference between the two.  You really should add the Nexus 4 as the third choice.  The Nexus 4 is the pure Google phone, right?  That's the one I've got.  Yeah, no LTE, but in every other respect, a pure phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is making me hold all the more dearly to my Nexus 4  and hope that Google comes out with a pure phone soon, like in two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think what Google could do at Google I.O. is exactly do this X phone from Motorola  that has the power and capability of something like the HTC One  without all of the restrictions and the gloss.  But if you want a phone, if you're choosing between these two  and you want a phone that just does a great job as a beautiful phone,  I'd like the HTC One.  If you want more capability to customize than I think the Galaxy S4,  they're both very good phones, very similar category.  They do best the Nexus 4 in a number of ways because they're more recent.  So the real question is what's Google going to do to respond to these  because these are now the standard, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, sorry, Jeff.  I was going to say like for what it's worth on all about Android,  the consensus is that we, you know, the really nice handsets,  but we're all sort of biased.  Of course, it's a show about Android,  but we're all sort of biased toward the pure Android experience.  So Ron was saying last night, was he showing his phone like,  yeah, I like this.  I just don't like the extra software.  And I feel the same way.  I've been sort of true to the Nexus line since the beginning.  And while I'm tempted by the HTC One because the hardware design is really nice,  I just want my Android just straight out of Google  and see exactly what the sort of default intended experience is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm with you, Gina.  I don't like a lot of that software and stuff.  It makes me not want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a question then.  What would be wrong for a Samsung to say it's an option  that you can clean it up and just go back to pure Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's going to happen because it may happen first with the HTC One.  The Cyanogen folks immediately bought HTC One's.  HTC supports unlocked bootloader right out of the box.  And so I think people will probably root it in Cyanogen mod.  I think they already have a beta, early beta mod.  So presumably you will be able to at some point put 4.2 on here pure.  That might be kind of interesting, although I do like some of the HTC features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wish that companies like Samsung would kind of take the Facebook home approach.  Or it's like, hey, here's the Samsung launcher.  You have an option to set as your default launcher.  The phone ships with it as your default launcher,  but you can change it to something else.  Here's a folder full of Samsung apps which you cannot install  and which you will buy by default.  It's set as your default, but you know what?  When you click on tap on camera, you can choose.  Do you want the built-in Android camera?  Do you want the Samsung camera?  You tap on the always box.  You make your choice.  I mean, it just would be so respectful to users to say, hey, yeah, give a choice.  Like, hey, this is our product.  We're going to make them the defaults,  but you're free to back out and choose something else if you want.  I'd love to see that, but that's just not how it works.  Samsung's trying to differentiate.  They're trying to say this is our platform.  And they didn't say the word Android.  I think they said the word Android once during their whole presentation.  So they're trying to dress it up in Samsung style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do they sing it, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Before we show that video, which we are going to,  I just want to say that I think this is a trend in tech in general.  I've noticed this.  It came up on Twitter on Sunday because you're talking about Microsoft  very, very reluctantly saying, well, we might add…  Well, actually, they haven't said.  The rumors are they might add boot to desktop in Windows 8.  I blame Apple.  I think Apple paved the way in ignoring users  and saying, our way or the highway, we believe,  we know exactly how it should be, and we're going to give you that.  Now, to Apple's credit, they were often right.  Steve had great taste, right?  Only one's right.  Right.  But what happens is everybody looks at them and says,  oh, maybe this is the way to differentiate in a market that's becoming commoditized.  And there's nothing more commoditized than Android phones.  Maybe the way to differentiate is to tell the users what they want.  And I think Windows 8 is a good example of a company by Fiat saying,  you will do it this way or no other way.  Microsoft's done it.  I think Samsung's doing it.  I think HTC is doing it.  It's the way they differentiate.  But I agree.  It's disrespectful to users.  I think we should come step forward as users  and just say exactly what you just said, Gina.  Give us a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What drew me to these devices was the Google apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  That's exactly right.  S Translate.  OK, Google Translate.  I want Google Maps, right?  I mean, look, if someone else comes out with a better navigation app,  that hasn't happened yet, right?  But I want Google Maps.  I want Gmail, right?  I feel like that's the offering.  I mean, right now, that's the offering.  I know that that's not what Samsung wants.  Samsung wants you to buy their phone because Samsung apps are superior,  but they just haven't proven that yet.  And look at the cameras.  If I...  If I...  You know, they're not getting there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Gina, if I like their hardware, one different software,  what's the harm to them if I still buy their phone?  Right.  And the other thing is...  Well, it's another company that should look at Apple.  Best Buy by me now has a gigantic Samsung display space.  Really big.  It's like a little store in the store.  And so, which A, was interesting.  But then B, I was playing with the Note 8,  which I'm tempted by versus my Nexus 7 because it has the pen,  and the pen makes sense on something that size, I think.  So I might, you know, buy that Samsung thing,  and I'm not so dependent on the tablet as I am on the phone  for all these applications I use.  And maybe I'm going to be okay with the Samsung stuff then,  and I need the pen stuff there.  I'm okay with it.  I'm not anti at all.  I just want choice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it's funny.  Like, I've always been sort of interested more in software than in hardware.  I've never, like, I'm not much of a gadget freak,  but I look at the HTC One, I'm like, that's a beautiful phone.  Well, that's the thing.  The Nexus 4 is only $7.68.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is $10.80.  You don't have LTE.  You can get LTE on the HTC One if you go with an LTE carrier.  So I'm not a big, I'm not a huge fan of the Nexus 4.  I think you make some hardware compromises.  So you're saying, I want pure hardware,  I want pure software, and I'm willing to compromise on the hardware.  It's more important to me, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which is odd, but I want simplicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's not like we're giving up, it's not like you're giving up.  You get all the same things, plus, right, on these phones.  There's a few things you're giving up on the One,  particularly where they're just things you can't customize.  That's a pain.  Yeah, and that's a little paternalistic.  I'm a little unhappy about that.  But again, I'm sure I could root this and do something with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, those companies like Samsung should look at  people I know who are Apple devotees and have had iPhones forever,  and they're using Google apps on the iPhone because the apps are better.  Right.  And then eventually that probably might suck them into going fully Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think that you can make that case.  And I think Google's smart to be making these reference phones.  I really felt the Nexus 4 was a developer phone.  I was surprised to see how much consumer acceptance it got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought it was at first too, but it's a good phone.  People like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm kind of tempted to get one just to have, you know,  to see the differences, I guess, because I don't know what I actually  don't know what vanilla Android looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's so good.  I would say it's the Pixel of phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You have to do that, don't you?  You have to do that.  All right.  Let's play the.  So Jeff and Google Plus posted this.  And do we know?  We don't know where it came from.  So, yeah, pardon me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  S4 launch event from India.  So it was in the S4 launch event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roll it back so we can see from the beginning.  You guys see it from the beginning here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this, by the way, I did a little research.  This guy is not just some guy off the street.  He's a he's a fairly well-known Bollywood star, up and coming Bollywood star Ranveer Singh.  It's interesting they use size image for this.  This is very Bollywood.  And if you're going to launch your phone in India, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You gotta understand your market.  I think culturally this fits the market.  It's Bollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's crazy garish.  I mean, it's much like the Broadway launch in the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm not Indian, so I don't know.  But my sense is this probably speaks to the Indian customer better than the Broadway thing  spoke to American customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Broadway didn't speak to an American customer.  That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, and I know.  And see, I'm not Indian, so I don't know.  But I would guess this is more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, he's doing the dance.  That's not Bollywood.  That's the Psy dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a well, obviously you don't watch Bollywood movies, do you?  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't watch a lot of Bollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The normal reaction of people who've not seen Bollywood before is, boy, that's cheesy and garish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I've seen Bollywood routines like in, you know, there's in various shows.  There's been one in there was one in what's there in Glee?  There was one in Smash.  Felicia Day did one with.  Yeah, she did a great one.  Yeah, she did a really good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So yeah, this follows.  There was also a Samsung appliance marketing launch in South Africa, which for no good reason  had lots of bikini women in it, which caused a furor there.  Something about Samsung marketing that's off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we've we've decided too much money is the problem.  Because somebody somebody pointed out that the amount of money dedicated to marketing is directly  correlated to the amount of money they're making.  So the more they make on the phones, the more they have to spend on marketing.  And at some point you have too much money to spend on marketing, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I was saying that all that, Andrew, last night, like they worked.  I mean, we're talking about it.  We played it on two shows now.  I mean, you know, we're saying that it was that it's a little embarrassing.  I mean, I was a little embarrassed for the guy who leads singer.  But hey, it was fun.  I mean, I watched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I just think we don't don't have the cultural ability to context for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, judging from the Broadway launch in New York, I was like, oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that we have the cultural context to pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  And I love Broadway.  I love Broadway.  I do, too.  And yeah, Virgil just said in the chat room,  Big Bang Theory did do a Bollywood routine.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bollywood's everywhere now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We're going to come back with more great panel.  Matthew Ingram, by the way, we already determined before the show, nobody here has glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, but next week I'll have it.  I'll have it on Wednesday.  You're getting you got your invite.  I did.  I got my invite.  I'm very, very excited.  I'm going to drive to Google LA this this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So yeah, you decided you have the choice, right?  They'll mail it to you, but you can also get it fitted and get trained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah, they'll mail it to you.  They start shipping today on May 1st.  But they strongly encourage you to come to the office.  And I guess it's a fitting, which takes about 30 minutes, which sounds long to me.  But then there's a tour.  They take you on like an hour long tour of using glass.  So yeah, I'm super.  I'm really excited.  I know.  I know.  It's dorky.  I'm really excited, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are you going to wear it in the shower?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not going to wear it in the shower.  No.  Just checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, so let's get it out of the way.  Robert Scoble, who has this is there's a precedent.  He did this before to publicize his book with Shell Israel.  He and Shell were together in the shower naked.  That was even more unappealing.  Disturbing.  Yeah.  My reaction to this picture is very simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't look down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a codpiece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you see that Scoble and Andrew Keene were kind of having at it?  I think it was the Nextwebs conference.  They were having a sort of confrontational discussion where Andrew Keene was basically  like, are you going to wear that in a public bathroom?  Like, I'm not going to stand next to you in a urinal if you're wearing those things in  your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Didn't Scoble in his review say he went into something like four different men's rooms  with the glass?  He did, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He said he'd been in like 20 men's rooms.  Scoble wrote a very, very good Google Plus post only about a half an hour ago,  in which he just, you know, in Robert Lank, but he just said, come on, folks.  You know, of course I'm not going to do that.  You're just going, the privacy people are going overboard preemptively.  And I'm glad he was fighting the fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I have to say, like, it seemed like, you know, he was saying, like,  they're not on all the time.  I'm not recording at all times.  I mean, I think there are new social norms that have to get formed around this.  He said someone suggested putting the glasses kind of on top of his head when  you're in the bathroom, which would be sort of a way to sort of signify like, hey, I'm  not, I'm not recording.  He also said, you know, I don't look down.  Men don't look down.  It's like man code, right?  I mean, you just don't do that.  Right.  And that's something there's no laws about that.  There's no, you know, signs.  You just know not to do that.  And he's saying like, this is, yeah, no, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's presuming that whoever's wearing these creepy glasses in the men's room is  going to is going to adhere to these.  And I don't think that there's any reason to assume that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Have you ever been in a men's room where somebody had their cell phone out?  I mean, did you guys not take this?  So how do you know that they're not taking a picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Guys talking on this.  This is far more disgusting.  I've seen guys talking on the phone while wheezing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw a guy doing that and then he dropped his phone into the urinal and screamed and  everybody in the room applauded.  Oh, I did you not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody went, yeah, I had a guy pitch me on a story at a urinal that is to me,  Google Glasses is way better than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because at least with glasses.  Because FN Dunn in our chat room says there's no legal right to privacy in a public restroom.  That cannot be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, that's not because cameras.  That's wrong.  It's not a public restroom cameras.  Pervs have put cameras in public restrooms, gotten arrested for it.  No, that's not the case.  There's a presumption of privacy there.  But the point is, yeah, a little LED light is going to I guarantee you is going to be  put on the glass in the next version so people will know it's recording or not.  I'm a but be Leo.  I got to disagree that this idea of if it can go wrong, then with one there's one bozo,  one ass in the world who might do this that oh my God, the thing is ruined.  Well, that's true of a lot of life.  Cars, phones on camera.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  I guess you're right.  Lots and lots of things.  You got to have some faith in society that we figure this out.  We cope with norms and we do it.  And that's the problem is that even before anybody has the damn glasses,  some of these people are screaming what a murder about it.  And it's and it's it's it's  Remember when talking on your cell phone, what I considered really rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you remember that?  Yeah, now everybody talks on their phone.  Yeah, that was just the height of rudeness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I haven't seen some of the videos coming out through glass and they're just like they make  you kind of they make me like a little bit a little bit nauseous.  A guy published a video of he like dunking a basketball wearing glass,  which was really cool.  But it was also just like, oh, I feel a little sick because it's just so like glare, which

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  wearing glass, you're never going to nod again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're recording a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I watched the one even in the demo of the guy with I think it was his son  and he was going around in a circle and I had the same feeling as you,  Gina, I can't even watch, you know, movie handheld,  the handicapped movies where they go around in circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't make great video.  The sound if you're more than two feet away, the sound is bad.  Somebody went Mashable or I think was Mashable went on today's show.  Oh, here's Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Lance Yulamov.  Yeah.  I'm just annoyed by all the journalists who've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, the videos and I hate it's not a good video.  But one thing that there's a there's a Bradley Horowitz piece is really good where he  where he speculates about a lot of possible uses.  Like we can look at the Eiffel Tower and see others virtual graffiti on it or things like that.  And he said, imagine if you're in a crowd and suddenly there's a whole bunch of glass  there and people everybody turns at the same time,  then you're going to believe there's something going on there where you're looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that same thing if somebody everybody turns their head at the same time.  That's we're looking if you're watching the video, Tim Stevens of Engadget doing his review.  He we're going to have is Tim going to vote for sure on Twitter.  Yeah.  We're going to have Tim and Scoble on Twitter on Sunday, presumably both wearing their glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you're going to be glass fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jealous.  I'm going to be so jealous.  I have to admit, you know, when I was in Italy looking at things,  I wish if I had had something that would pop up a little  point, you know, Wikipedia entry or some something to tell me  even just a tiny bit of history about something that would be worth it.  That's field trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm surprised they haven't ported field trip to glass.  That seems like what field trip was invented for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  They that's a no brainer.  That's definitely going to happen.  Yeah, for sure.  I think still photos is will be maybe a better use.  I don't think that this set a lot of moving videos.  No, great.  When you first person, I mean, I want to go I want to go like paragliding first thing and wear glass.  You know, it's really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I'm sure that's I can't stand heights, as you know, bridges.  Oh, it's bridges and heights.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's related.  Yeah, really.  Same thing.  I was at a party the other night and the only few times I've seen people with glass,  it's people have to wear them in addition to their eyeglasses.  That's what I'm worried about.  You and I have glasses.  What are we going to do, Jeff?  It's a real problem.  And by the way, that your little fix for the men's room,  you're going to miss the urinal with your glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Scoble had removed glass, but had his glasses on underneath.  Is that how it works now?  Do you put glass, you put glass over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's going to be dorky.  That's as bad as really really a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They should have thought of this as too many young people at Google who don't have bad eyes yet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  You wear contact?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it comes with laser treatment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't wear contacts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I can wear my contacts, but I still don't.  I don't.  Anyway, whatever.  Now I can't talk about glass because I'm going to sound like I'm jealous because I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We got to get Leo his.  That's all right, Google.  Google doesn't like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's OK.  I don't care.  There was a rumor they were working with Warby Parker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On Warby version.  Right.  Which would have your prescription lenses in there.  They do.  It looks like they come with sunglasses, right?  They come with a pop in sunglasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm going to go to my eyeglass guy and say how ridiculous is the price to make lenses  that will fit on?  Wow.  You are dedicated.  Well, I think it's going to be ridiculous.  My wife will shoot me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You definitely are.  You're dedicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, film it when she shoots you.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Come back.  We've got the.  Well, you know, that's by the way where the scobel in the shower came from is not from glass.  He was I don't think he was looking in the mirror.  I think his wife, Miriam, took that picture.  He wants his her photo credit is somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  So blame his wife.  There's also a picture of Leo while you're got there.  It's on the rundown.  There's a picture of him in the shower.  The next one down is him with the warm afterglow.  Right.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's unfortunate in a robe.  And then the next picture down on the rundown is the one you want to show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you do.  If you're not, you're not.  It's OK.  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's the new goats.  We decided on Sunday that this is the new goats.  He is Robert in the shower.  Oh, there's Miriam not in the shower.  There you go.  Nice.  Miriam, who is that?  That's somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's one of the looks like it's one of the glass.  You're going to wear your glass in the shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Make sure you bring an umbrella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, she's one of the marketing glass marketing folks at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really?  Oh, OK.  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I don't know.  I just, you know, I don't know.  I'm just we'll see.  I think, as I said last week, is one of those things you have to use to understand.  Some reserved judgment.  Like a pixel.  You got to use it for.  No, I use the pixel and I understand.  I'm afraid I do understand it, Jeff.  Our show today brought to we're going to come back with a change log, Gina.  Prepare your trumpets.  Got it.  Get the trumpets oiled up.  I'll be sure ready.  Empty the spit valve.  Our show today brought to you by hover.com.  Hover is the way to do domain registration.  As soon as hover came out, and this is a creation of two cows,  they've been doing a domain registration for a long time,  but they said we got to make it clean.  We got to make it modern.  We're going to make it simple.  So they created hover.com as kind of the new, the modern way to register a domain name.  Great management tools.  They do not sell hosting.  They really they it's a domain name register.  If you go to our website, which is hover.com slash twig,  you can get 10% off your first domain registration.  If you haven't used them, you might want to just try it.  I moved.  I use their concierge service to move everything over to cover.com automatically.  Why would you want to register a domain name?  Well, it's more professional.  Certainly if you have a website for your business, it should be yourbusiness.com  or if you can't get.com and nowadays a lot of people can't.net is a very good choice.  Hover has that.  They also have.org.tv.pro.mobi.biz.ca.asia.us.uk.  They have a lot of top level domains.  Those are called, but I think.net is a very, I have leolaport.net.  Somebody has leolaport.com.  Domains start at $15.  By the way, that includes Whois privacy.  Most of the other guys will charge you.  They'll upsell you.  In fact, that's one of the problems I have with a lot of those other guys is  you can't get out of there.  You can't get to your checkout without clicking 100 different boxes saying,  no, I don't want that.  No, I don't want that.  No, I don't want that.  You do want Whois privacy.  That means they can't use your Whois record to look up your home address,  your home phone number or your business address or phone number.  Whois privacy is automatic with each and every hover domain.  It's great for setting up email.  I really like that.  In fact, I think that's something everybody should do is have their own domain name  and have their email forwarded to it and then use it to forward it to a mail server.  So you could still use Gmail or Yahoo or whoever you want to use,  but you don't expose that address to the public.  So if you decide to move on, no problem.  Your address does not change.  Great for a permanent email address.  I think lots of ways you could use hover.com.  But why don't you try it right now?  Their concierge service is very affordable.  I think $25 for all your domains.  They'll charge you $10 for a new domain or transfer,  but that gives you a whole year of the domain renewal.  So that's a good deal as well.  Hover.com slash twig is our special address for 10% off or use the offer code TWIG.  And one of the things I really like, they have great customer service.  Their customer service reps are empowered to help you.  And that's why they won't put you on hold.  They won't transfer you.  When you call during business hours, you'll get a live rep  and you will get your problem resolved.  It's just great.  Simplify domain name management.  If you're registering domain names, I invite you to consider hover from now on.  I moved all my stuff over there.  Really great.  Hover.com slash twig for 10% off your first new domain names.  It is time, ladies and gentlemen, for Gina Trapani and our Google changeload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google.  The Google changelog.  What's new at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Big launch this week was Google Now for iOS.  Did you guys see this?  Yeah, it's not quite as functional as the one for Android.  It actually comes packaged with the Google search app for iOS for iPhone and iPad,  but it includes things like traffic updates based on your calendar  or sports scores based on your location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It seems to have the same cards for me that I could get on my Android device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It does.  It does.  Well, it's missing certain things like nearby events,  activity summary, the boarding passes.  I don't think that it has quite the hooks into your Gmail account  that maybe now for Android does, but nice to see it.  And you also have to launch the Google search app in order to see your cards  versus launch it from the home screen the way we can on Android.  Still love to see Google Now sort of get to see, you know, launching to other platforms.  I saw a couple Android blogs saying, oh, Google Now should have stayed Android only  because it's a differentiating feature.  I'll wash.  I say love to see Google Now on iOS and I'd love to see it in Chrome too.  Hopefully it'll come to Chrome as well.  I'll wash says Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll wash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll wash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Gina's invitation of Dvorak.  I can't.  This is nasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll wash.  I'll wash.  What else?  Oh, so Google web fonts, well, Google fonts, which was formerly Google web fonts  is now available for desktop use.  Starting today, you can download Google fonts for offline access on your desktop.  There's a tool.  You have to download a tool from Monotype that basically downloads the fonts  and syncs them to your desktop.  So this kind of runs in the background on your Windows or Mac device  and just lets you use Google fonts offline and your desktop applications as well.  Yeah, I really like Google fonts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My website, like more than 300 fonts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, there are.  While you're there, while you're there, I got a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Being that I live, La Vida, Google, and I had a whole big document,  university document I had to print out this week.  So I had it at home.  I had it all formatted and everything else I had on my Pixel.  Then when I switched over to a Mac because it was hooked up to the printer  that I already had configured, still in Google Docs, the formatting changed.  Is that because it uses the local fonts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The formatting or the typography?  The typography specifically?  Like the fonts were different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Basically, you know, page breaks were off and things like that  because it was still Times New Roman on both, same 12 on both, but it was different.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this was a Google Doc like inside your browser?  Very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google Doc inside the browser.  So it was like it was using, I couldn't figure out why,  but it doesn't use local fonts, right?  It uses Google fonts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that should use Google fonts.  And that doesn't sound like a font.  It doesn't sound like a typography issue.  It just sounds like a like spit line spacing or, you know, page break issue.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  I mean, if it was a local document where you're using like different versions of Word,  I would say, oh, well, it just interpreted the font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's that you ask?  Well, use what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What an odd name for a product.  We need a Ricky Martin, live in La Vida Google theme for you.  I don't, I'm stumped on that one.  I don't know why that happened.  Sorry about that, Joe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  I was just thought it was an odd way to understand how Docs work.  That's all.  It was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It looks like there's over 600 of these Google fonts.  Wow.  It's quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've expanded it quite a bit.  Is it just the monotype fonts I can get or can I get them all or are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I believe it.  There's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because monotype is doing this downloader, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, monotype is doing the downloader and no, they're the Google font.  So they, they, they actually, yeah, they teamed up with monotype.  To offer...  Esteem.  And using the tool I downloaded earlier, you can, you can sign a monotype and get their fonts  or the Google fonts are just free right there.  That is a really great deal.  Yeah.  It's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Grumpy Wizard.  What is this?  Is this the new, the quick angry fox jumps over the lazy dog?  Grumpy Wizards make toxic brew for the evil queen and Jack.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's, that's way better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a new quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Grumpy Wizards make toxic brew for the evil queen and Jack.  Did you say angry fox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, he did.  It's the quick browns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's brown, it's brown, not angry.  Yeah, I'm angry.  Jumps over the lazy dog.  I'm still angry over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Angry about glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Angry, I'm glass, glass-free, glass-angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Google also this week launched a new Chrome extension.  Actually, this, this might've been related to your problem, Jeff.  There's a new Chrome office viewer Chrome extension that renders Word,  Excel and PowerPoint files directly in your browser.  Right. So right now, if you open up a Word, Excel, PowerPoint file,  it'll open in a drive-based viewer, but you can install this, this Chrome office viewer,  which is, which is still in beta and you actually have to be running the Chrome beta  or be on a Chromebook.  This is actually, I guess, by the fall installed on Chromebook right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me install it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it wouldn't let you install it on your desktop or your Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On my Chromebook.  Give me the name of it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Chrome office viewer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It said I couldn't do it on this machine, but I, I, I then switched to  the beta version of Chrome.  Maybe that was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Google says that this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, the TPS report.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  A little, a little, a little tip of the hat to office space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. A little Mike Judge going on there like that.  So, so Google says that the advantage to using this plugin over Drive is that it will  help protect you against malware because the files open up and kind of a specialized sandbox.  And they say, quote, to impede attackers, use compromised office files to try to steal  private information or monitor your activities, which is kind of funny there.  There's, I feel like that's a underhanded accusation of Microsoft for trying to do that.  Yeah, of course.  Not even underhanded.  It's blatant.  It's clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing underhanded about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So speaking of Google Drive, the plusification of everything continues into Drive.  I'm actually not seeing this change in our Twig rundown document, but I saw it this morning  at another doc you'll see now there's a side, there's a sidebar chat on Google docs.  Well, those are now tied to your Google plus account.  So you'll see your Google plus icons.  And if you mouse over the icon, you can follow someone or add someone to your circles.  This is right inside Drive.  You can start a group chat, kind of like what we do the group chat in the sidebar now,  but it's just a little bit, little bit more plusified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is this a touch of wave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it attached to wave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A touch of wave.  Or was it a touch of wave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a little bit.  It kind of is.  It's kind of like it is.  It's kind of like Drive's updates as you type, which is very wave like.  And now it's got Google plus users in there, which so you can add to your circles and you  can start a chat.  So yeah, it is kind of wavy because it's that chat while you co collaborate on a document.  And there's a new look for anonymous users.  This is interesting.  Anonymous users will get a random like animal icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can see the tip of the hat to O'Reilly there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  It looks that way.  Is there a horse here in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but I've got the, if you look at my screen chat, I think I have the,  maybe we could use this one, the quick brown fox jumping over.  A lazy dog here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me just wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, there's a picture.  The he where's the motion?  Where's the video supposed to move?  There you go.  Like we go daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There we go.  There, there you go.  Here it is.  Here's gonna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a quick fox.  He's going to ease.  No, can't quite do it.  Let me try again.  Fox try one more time.  There's that lazy dog.  Do you think they train him to do this?  There we go.  There you go.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he's quickly out of there.  I did it and I'm done.  I did it and I'm out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry.  Didn't mean to interrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no, that's okay.  That's okay.  Last change log item.  Google has announced that app activities are coming to search.  So a couple weeks ago, we, and actually I think we had a couple of Googlers on to talk about this  that Google had opened up Google sign in for apps.  So like if you're using Fandango, for example, on your phone,  you can sign in with your Google plus account.  Well, Google really wants developers to use those services because then Google  could collect information about usage on apps.  And then they're going to show stats about that usage in their search results.  So if you so soon, this hasn't rolled out yet, but if you search for a site or an app  on google.com and that app has integrated with Google plus sign in,  you'll see popular and aggregate user activity and the right of the search results  in that knowledge graph area.  So if you search for say Fandango, for example,  you'll see the top movies among Google users.  Oh, neat.  Yeah.  So they're rolling out this feature in desktop search.  The next over the next couple of weeks, they're starting with limited number of music and movie  apps.  So Deezer, Fandango, Flickster, Slacker radio, songs, SoundCloud tune in,  but they're going to be adding more apps over time as more apps integrate this.  My guess is that at Google I O they're going to be pushing this hard on developers  because they want developers to be using this sign in because this makes search results better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's I looked at the schedule for Google I O there's lots and lots of sign in sessions.  Schedules up.  I put it on the rundown.  Oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's all I got for the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's my signal to you, Chad.  Now I just do this and you're supposed to know that's the timpani.  Yeah, makes sense.  Google, you know, it's a very clear strategy with Google plus in the Google sign in collecting  signals and the more the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, yeah, it degraded one experience all tied back into Google plus profile, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One man's creepy, scrugelling is another man's collecting signals.  That's all there is to it.  Comex fired at Apple working for Google.  Who is super hacker Comex?  Let's ask our own super hacker Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who is Comex?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's the guy who first I think was first rooted the iPhone.  Oh, hi, Adam is an entry with college kid.  Apple hired as an interim, but evidently he didn't respond to an email in time and they  asked his interest.  Google said, come here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He wrote jailbreak me with the hacking tools for iPhone and iPad.  Nicholas Allegra is his real name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's not going to be on Android because he doesn't like Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did he say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was so I never liked it enough to want to hack it.  He said, that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or you could say it doesn't really need to be you to be hacked.  But okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the answer.  Right.  Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apparently, he's got a promising future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, people were amazed that he wouldn't when jailbreak three,  Jeb, like me three was released apparently, according to Forbes,  the information security community was baffled that a teenager had single handedly unlocked  the most tightly restricted consumer operating system in the world.  Charlie Miller, who's famous for hacking Apple said he was totally blown away.  Apple.  This copy is hysterical.  Fellow Apple hacker Dino Daizovi later commented to another reporter,  Allegra seemed to be from the future.  Within two months, he was given an internship at Apple.  But a year later, he was suddenly let go for failing to respond to an email that would have  extended his employment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that he didn't respond to an email.  I'm busy.  Didn't respond to an email.  Would you like to keep your job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now he's interning at Google.  I wonder if he's doing summer code stuff or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is he checking his email more regularly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think it's that's it's just bizarre that they'd fire because you  didn't answer to your email.  Well, I guess they're saying, would you like to stick around and he didn't respond?  That'd be very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, maybe you don't care enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do the Apple thing.  Well, that's a funny question because I recently sent an email to one of our employees with  exactly the same question.  And you know what?  Seriously, this person did not respond.  So what do I do?  Tell him to go work at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is this is my favorite part of this Forbes story.  He said after the missed deadline, the offer this was to intern or to be employed at  Apple was permanent rescinded.  And this is this is a quote.  I wasn't too happy about it, but it didn't seem like I was able to fix it.  He told me at the time.  So this kid can jailbreak iPhones and iPads, but he doesn't have the social skills or the  maturity to be able to go to the person who employed him and get them to change his mind  and be able to apologize for a missed email.  Like, so there we go.  I mean, I have great respect for his technical chops, but that's pretty typical, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina, isn't it?  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, very typical.  But it's just interesting.  He said I wasn't able to fix it like as if it were a bug in the system.  Right.  Let him go because he missed an email that he was not able to fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I found a trouble ticket, but I just we couldn't figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It wasn't won't fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Won't fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I couldn't root the Apple management structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's so so if you're if you're employee person, Leo, I came to you and said, look,  I'm really sorry I missed your email.  I had a fix.  I can you would fix it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, sorry, but he is an intern interns.  That's different.  There's an internship as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't someone have said, let's try a little harder than sending an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you got to think now that there's an article about it in Forbes that somebody at  Apple knows about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You think they would pick up the phone if they wanted to employ him.  Go buy his office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they have a lot of it.  There's a lot of interns.  You saw the movie.  It's a busy.  Actually, we have what happened to that movie?  The one with the where Vince won in that was the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Google.  They went to Google to intern.  But what happened to that movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it must have been so bad they never released it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's Google it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's in a bin somewhere where the Ashton Kutcher Steve Jobs movie just waiting to be released  someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't that going to get released at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They showed it at a film festival at Sundance, I think.  Mysteriously disappeared.  June 7th.  It comes out.  OK, we haven't missed it.  Not the not the Ashton Kutcher, the Vince Vaughn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would love to.  That would be a twig field trip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should we do a field trip and go watch it somewhere?  I'll go watch it.  What's it called?  Is it the interns?  Something like that.  I'm looking for it.  It's like the internship.  The internship.  The internship.  Let's all go watch it with glass and then post our videos or shaky head videos on the  internet.  How about that?  Yes, a hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then let's share it on Google Drive so everyone else can watch our experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we can have a hangout.  There it is.  The internship 2013 Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, they're rocking the Google logo, the typography and the colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  From the trailer, it's going to be god awful.  Seriously.  Get ready.  No tomatoes at all.  So Google last year hired Ray Kurzweil, another person.  Apparently he got the email and responded to it.  I guess yesterday he moderated a live Google hangout that was tied to the Will Smith movie  After Earth.  I think that was a week ago, Tuesday actually.  Right.  So he talked a little bit to Wired magazine about the movie, but also about predicting  the future.  And they asked him, they said, you predicted search engines.  Yes, I wrote about that in the 1980s.  But did you predict you'd be working for Google?  Well, that's the kind of thing you can't predict.  What are you working on at Google?  My mission at Google, to develop natural language understanding in collaboration with  other researchers at Google.  Search has moved beyond finding keywords.  It still doesn't read all those billion of web pages and book pages for semantic content.  So it's more than just indexing, right?  It's understanding.  And when that happens, we'll have Skynet.  If your system really understood complex natural language, would you argue that it's  conscious?  Yes, says Ray Kurzweil.  He said, I have a consistent date of 2029 for that vision.  So he's working towards a singularity.  And where better to do that than Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's interesting, he's not just talking about it being smart.  He says, this means emotional intelligence, being funny, being sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Being funny, I get.  Being sexy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what he says.  Hi, I'm Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm here to give you a happy ending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I really want my search engine to seduce me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I don't know.  I'm afraid I'm going to look like Robert Scoble in the shower.  That's the problem.  You and I, Jeffrey, we were going there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sorry, you're faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wow.  I think if you're going to be sexy, being is a better shot at it than Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That search engine with the woman, it was like an animated woman kind of standing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Miss, what's her name?  Miss Webster or something.  She dissed me big time.  You could find that on YouTube when you search for my name.  I don't know why.  It was an experiment by Microsoft.  It was never an improvement on talking paperclip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft, her name was Miss something.  This is Leo.  I think you could probably find it, Chad, on YouTube.  Because we did this on...  I can't find it.  Miss Cleo or no, Miss Dewey.  That was it.  Miss Dewey.  Oh, yeah, that sounds right.  Miss Dewey, chat room to the rescue once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There are so many great search results for Leo Lepore disses, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, here we go.  I diss, we diss, you all diss.  Here's Miss Dewey.  Wait a minute.  Yes!  There she is.  There she is.  I'm trying.  There she is.  Let me see if I could turn up the sound.  I've got Windows 8, so as you might expect, it's a little bit difficult.  But let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you hold onto that machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no.  You know what?  I was going to replace it with a Mac, but then I think they're going to do new ones.  Here's Miss Dewey.  Oh, there's no sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is not sexy.  Okay, let's find another.  Here we go.  Leo Lepore gets pwned by search engine.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they are always trying to compete with Google in the future.  Yeah, not in their own game.  Exactly.  They're trying to jump ahead of Google and see, you know, kind of come up with their own idea  of what the future will be.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I know that sounds vain, but I know what the search results should be for my own name.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So she thinks for a while, for a little bit.  And then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a reason why they call the TV the idiot box.  And I think I found it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is horrible.  Nice.  Oh, okay.  Well, at least I've been disrespected by a major corporation since 19, whatever, 93.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Weird response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Miss Dewey.  Yeah, it was more about attitude, but that's what I'm thinking.  If Ray Kurzweil gets to it.  See, now it's making noise again.  I'm going to turn down the noisemaker.  See, I installed a chat engine that is now telling me that you've you've people are chatting at me.  What a surprise.  Can you not turn that off?  I'm sure I can, but I'm busy.  Let's move along, shall we, to another story?  What do you say?  Should we talk about I.O.?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Should we look at the schedule?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do something, please, because I'm stuck in Windows 8L.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The I.O. is in two weeks, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm totally, completely excited.  Is it that soon?  Yes, it's very soon.  It's awesome.  The schedule just got released and it looks like there's only going to be a single keynote on the first day.  Oh, hallelujah.  What time?  Nine o'clock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Crossing fingers?  Nine to twelve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there'll be a break.  Oh, good Lord.  There will be a break, which I can't imagine that they're going to empty out that huge room to let people use the bathroom or whatever.  I imagine it's just going to be a kind of stand up and stretch kind of break.  We will be covering that live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, it won't be we.  It will be Tom Merritt and crew because Gina, Jeff and I will all three be at the keynote.  Only one of us will be wearing a Google Glass.  By then you might have yours.  What about you?  Didn't you get one, Jeff?  In the kiddie program.  Well, so a lot of people in the kiddie program got it.  Got it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Scoble got it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, Scoble was at I.O.  He was at I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Didn't he have a low number in the glass?  I don't know.  I'm pretty sure he tweeted it.  Anyway.  You might get yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, actually, it would be you could might be able to pick them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it's not like you can't get yours.  It's not like you can't get yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Might be able to pick them up while I want the picture because it's going to look just like the picture from the 50s of people with the red and green glasses.  I want the picture of the entire keynote audience going like this with their Google Glass.  Yeah, because that's what it's going to look like.  And it'll be just as historic in a few years.  Remember when they did with the thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Maybe Google's going to ask everyone to turn off their wife, turn off your glass.  Every single person in the room is going to have three devices on them which connect to the Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So one of the sessions at I.O. is how to avoid your warranty hacking through the glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it really? That's the name of the session?  I love it.  Which means they're encouraging it.  Which means they're encouraging it. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which is smart. Day two under the glass track.  They should encourage hacking.  You have to click on more topics, I think, on that chart you just had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay. That's all right. I believe you, Jeff.  It probably works better on a Pixel.  You bet it does.  I already read it all.  There's not a lot of... there's only a few... there's four Glass seminars. I'm surprised.  Avoiding your warranty hacking glass, building Glass services with the Google Mirror API,  fireside chat with the Glass team, and then what does that say?  Developing for Glass. That's it.  You'd think there'd be more given how many sessions there are.  Glass is just not that...  I mean, if you look at Android, there should be a ton of sessions.  There's Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then go to Plus, you'll see a lot of stuff, as you said earlier,  that's about using Google Plus authentication.  Yeah.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, honestly, Leo, they could have folded Glass into Android,  because not a lot of people have it.  I mean, it is Android. Not a lot of people have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One thing I didn't know that I found out from the Engadget review,  which you showed briefly earlier,  is that the Glass is another device so that your phone doesn't hook up with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth,  they said, your phone has to open up a...  Well, it is Wi-Fi, I guess, but it opens up a tethering session.  And so...  Well, you have to use tethering.  You have to use tethering from your phone to the Glass.  And thus, the guy said he's paying another 20 bucks a month to be able to tether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. I didn't realize that.  I didn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That sucks.  That really sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you have to tether to your phone in order to access...  Your phone has to be in hotspot mode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, kill a battery fast.  I can't believe that.  That's not right. It's Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, why wouldn't you be able to connect to any Wi-Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is also what Tim Stevens said in his review,  is that you need to use the Bluetooth done internet thing.  Oh, that's why it's Bluetooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why it's Bluetooth. It's usually done.  Okay, that's different. That's not the same as turning on hotspotting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it is to some...  But it's using the internet access.  That's the problem.  Mobile accounts...  I have an AT&T grandfathered unlimited  and supposedly I'm not supposed to tether.  Now, in fact, I can a little bit, but I don't want to do so much  I get caught and thrown into AT&T jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's Bluetooth dial-up networking.  So it is Bluetooth connected.  But it has internet access through Bluetooth.  That makes sense. It'd have to do that.  That's the only way it could do the internet access.  So that makes sense.  That makes sense.  They released a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't think it's actually in the rundown.  They released a How Glass Works video.  Actually, they didn't talk about it.  Yeah, is it... Let's see.  It's a minute long.  We played it last night on Alemant Android.  But it kind of shows how the touchpad works  and how the UI...  How you switch between cards in the UI  and what the UI looks like.  It basically looks like a horizontal Google Now.  That's it. Yeah, there it is, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Whoa! You can scroll through it.  So that's Google Now, basically.  Yes, exactly. That makes sense.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Swipe down to go back to standby.  And have fun exploring.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so we were talking about this last night all about Android.  And I was saying, like, oh, I didn't realize  that there was going to be... There's so much motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's so much kind of temple rubbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then someone from Google tweeted at me and said,  you can wake up Glass by tilting your head  and saying, okay, Glass.  So you don't have to be touching the touchpad.  You can just go to the touchpad and you can just  go to the touchpad and you can just go to the touchpad and you can just  go to the touchpad and you can just go to the touchpad and you can just  go to the touchpad and you don't have to be touching the touchpad.  So, you can sort of do it with head jesters as well.  So, you can sort of do it with head jesters as well.  But yeah, I feel like that was more information  than we really have gotten in a while  about what the UI actually looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you watch a TV show called  One Tree Hill?  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I haven't.  I've heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Holy moly!  Getting today in Mountain View?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know,  working for Google is a little bit of a celebrity.  There was an episode of Veep recently  where they said something like, oh, she showed  up a little late. It's not like she has a job at Google  or anything. Wow!  There's this, like, the perception of like  totally rock star.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes.  You can't pay for that kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, this fellow does look like a hot  hunk Perez Hilton-worthy.  I don't know. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. I don't know. Is your type a guy?  I got him. No.  31-year-old program director  Dan Friedenberg is a hunk  delicious.  Mmm, girls.  Stand back. He's taking...  He's wearing tomato-colored pants.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's his name? What's Friedenberg's Google Buzzfeed?

Transcript:  And armbands. Yeah, just look at those  armbands. They have been clubbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, they're at Coachella. That's what you need to...  Oh, yeah. Okay, sorry.  The sweatband is completely gratuitous.  That's just because he's such a hunk, he might  sweat all over his arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The sneakers. The sneakers are good. He's wearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Converse. Yeah.  Those are Vans. They're Vans? Alright.  He's a skater. She's got a hole  in her skirt. I guess she can't afford better.  But that's okay. We are terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm adding him to my circles right now.  We're all horrible people. We're horrible people  for reading Perez Hilton number one.  Number two.  I suppose  people have a comment on our appearance.  So we can do it as well. But I just  added Dan to my circles. He is on

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google+. Oh, he's hunkalicious.  Do you have any comment there on  anything that you say he's hooked up with

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Prehill? Apparently, they've been in  a relationship for six months, according to Perez  Hilton. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's a shirtless photo of him doing a  triathlon. He's quite the athlete.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just love it.  Mark Andreessen says,  Glass-assisted surgery is in the future.  Not in my future.  For him?  By the way, my son is having  his appendix out right now, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he had pain this morning.  And Jennifer brought him to the emergency room.  Oh, wow.  Ostroscopic?  Isn't it laparoscopic or something nowadays?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I've been getting urgent  text messages throughout the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good they caught it.  It's good they caught it.  And when it's not  burst, as mine was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they did the  blood test. No white blood cells, so it's not  burst, but it's hurting, so they got rid of it.  Or getting rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's over. That's it.  I used you a year ago when I had mine now.  Yeah, I used you as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I shall.  Glass has already been jailbroken.  That's good.  Was it the kid who  Was it Comex? No.  No, it was not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's in the record.  What about Glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, this looks like  it's Jay Freeman.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sarek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's wearing Glass.  Now that's a guy should have Glass.  The Cydia guy. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What can you do with a jailbroken Glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can put other  apps on it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can run apps directly on it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Glass, he says,  runs Android 4.04  of all things.  Which is ice cream sandwich, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Kind of old.  It took me two hours while I was having dinner with friends  at the time. Two hours.  While he was eating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  While he was having dinner. I'm eating and hacking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Social dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I met Sarek and hung  a little bit with him at food camp.  He's a nice guy, obviously a very smart hacker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But let's just say this, he's never going to be  in Paris Hilton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he's a good looking man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd date him.  He's actually a lot of fun.  Chat room's going to go crazy.  I can't resist.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Geez, give me a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love, I mean, hey, anybody who says it took me two hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to jailbreak it while I was having dinner with friends  is a winner in my book.  Yeah.  He's got a good looking brain, that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He got it through the developer program.  He says, I'm not sure what  gaining root access might make possible.  He can't use glass because he has,  he wears glasses.  So he says it makes focusing  on the display painful for more than a few minutes  at a time.  The other problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've heard from people is people, I didn't  realize, people have contacts who are near  and far-sighted. One eye is near,  one eye is far.  What does that mean for  how you deal with glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I won't be able to wear it.  And you know, given the, because that's exactly  a description of my vision problem,  given that so many  people wear spectacles in this world, I don't know  what the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, again, last night was this party for Berta,  the German publisher, and a guy there had everybody  try them on, and they just put them on over their glasses.  You look  doubly ridiculous, but what the heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, that's what I wonder, if you put a lens in it,  it'd have to be before,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  No, the problem is, that's right, Leo, it's a cutout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's probably why they haven't done it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can't change the focal length of...  Focal length is evidently quite  a bit out here.  But you can't change that. You can't adjust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Danny Sullivan's got it right.  He says, because I compared glass to the,  as you remember, to the Segway,  he says, no, it's not the Segway, it's Gordon Gekko's  cell phone.  I think that's actually right.  In the movie Wall Street, Michael  Douglas, Gordon Gekko carries  a brick cell phone and is making a lot of calls.  And it dated the movie, funny,  because the movie isn't dated in any other respect,  but in that respect, it's hideously dated.  So what he's saying really  is  glass,  we're going to look back on this and say  this is early days, right?  That it's  there's Gekko with his cell phone.  That it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The difference  though is that with Wall Street  and with early cell phones,  it sort of made you out to be  you know, well...  A dick.  Yeah, a dick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's exactly what he's saying.  Here's Danny's quote, Gekko was a jerk  whose jerkiness was only enhanced by his  phone, an expensive status symbol  of its time.  And so, people  will see  this initially as  only the wealthy, only the elite  will have this. It's a  kind of dicky thing.  And then, we start to see how useful it is  just as we did with cell phones.  They become ubiquitous, and then  it's like you're crazy if you don't have one.  They're dedicked. They're dedickified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think with cell phones it was dicks, whereas  glass, it's more nerds. I think there's a subtle difference.  Dicky nerds.  Go to white men wearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google Glass.tumblr.com  Yeah, this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the techno utopian, like lots of disposable  income, you know, just someone  who's wealthy and thinks that  needs to be connected all the time. So I do think  that there's this, there's a nerd  aspect to it, but right  now, it's like the very connected nerd,  connected meaning like access to  the Explorer program, right?  And wealthy, right? There's definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  Hi, I'm wearing glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's some new ones since I was there this morning.  Scott Heiferman on Twitter  showed this one. There's Lowick, Lowick

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lamar, Tim Stevens,  Lance Wolinoff.  There it is, there it is.  And there's Marc Andreessen, and  yeah, that's the glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The middle guy, that's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's too much, yeah.  These guys look normal. I can  live with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the old guy, who's like us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is the glass  He's wearing glass over glasses, right.  Well, he has  made it separately.  Maybe he took the rest of,  That's weird, the rest is missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's a Googler, so they

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Specially crafted glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, so they took that one part  and put it all, and clipped it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to admit, that doesn't look so bad.  You're wearing glasses and you have a little thing on the top of it.  The beard helps.  I'll grow a beard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet they don't have fashionable  woreies, you know, pretty soon.  That was William Gibson.  Was it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very cool. I bet he wore it for three seconds and said,  Get this off.  He liked it. He did?  He said he didn't want to, but he did.  Creator of Neuromancer and the  Cyberpunk movement, great sci-fi writer.  He's not necessarily  a fan of technology.  No, he's not at all.  Interesting.  You notice it's getting more  mainstream as we go down the page.  No, there's Joshua Topolski.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there's the dreaded Scoble picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to have to overcome that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These people look more normal.  I don't think it's so...  I want to see LeVar Burton wearing them.  Where's Jordy LaForge's glass?  That's the first guy I'd give glass to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's gotta happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on, marketing.  Get on it. We're going to take a break.  Any other big stories before we move on?  Google has made it easier  to turn its pixels into highly  expensive kiosks?  No.  No takers? Any Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you want a touchscreen.  You want to use a pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because you want to touch, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you don't want all those greasy fingers on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android 4.3  is still going to be named Jelly Bean  according to Android Police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is kind of, man, this is kind of  disappointing. It's possible  and Android Police did some investigative work.  It's possible that we're going to see Android 4.3  in two weeks at I.O. and not Keyline Pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just a little bit of a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  As a developer, I was like, I wanted the next  letter.  But apparently Jelly Bean 4.3  is in testing right now.  There's a build in testing right now and we're looking at I.O.  in two weeks.  It looks like that's going to be the next release.  Maybe they'll preview Keyline Pie though at I.O.  and not release it.  But there is a build  in the works right now, Jelly Bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if you were Thorsten Hines,  CEO of BlackBerry,  that's pretty amazing.  How would you feel  about the future  of mobile technology?  We're going to have to sit through an ad here, it looks like,  before we can see.  I want to see what he really said.  Thorsten Hines.  Do you have it? Do you have it on there?  Should I turn it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds like somebody who's on New England's Island.  He actually doesn't  say what he said he would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've been debuting it here in Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's talking about the Q10.  And not about  tablets here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  According to somebody, and I don't know if he said this or not,  Bloomberg said he did.  He says, this is the quote,  in five years, I don't think there will be a reason  to have a tablet anymore.  Maybe a big screen in your workplace, but not a tablet  as such. Tablets themselves are not a good business  model.  Maybe I'd say that if I were BlackBerry.  They put out the playbook, which was a  great failure.  I guess his  point being what? That you're going to use phones  in lieu of tablets.  Or glass.  Or smartwatches.  He may not be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or just a big touch panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The only  thing I use my tablet for  is to watch movies  when I'm on the road in the train or something.  See, it's better to read.  I read the New York Times on it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Better for reading. I read books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, read books. Yeah, that's right.  I keep on adding it up. I do a lot of things.  The problem is that  my Nexus 7, of course,  I got the cheap one, so it's not internet connected.  So that probably has an impact on my use.  Chipotle  been banned in Eastchester, New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could guess where that came from.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why?  I think  real estate  snobbery, actually.  We don't want anything like that in Eastchester.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't believe in that kind of thing.  We don't have a Taco Bell either.  Digfine's 14 years  in the NBA.  Not even on the ETH.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Digfine's 40% of respondents willing to pay  for a Google reader replacement.  Dig, of course, said they were going to do a replacement.  Part of BetaWorks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I always do a supposed  survey is about willingness to pay.  Yeah, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're willing to answer a survey.  That's what that survey is about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't base my financial  model on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sure, I'll pay.  How many of you would pay for Twig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, don't ask them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't ask them that.  It could be crushing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  None of us.  Be nice, Jack.  Nobody.  Yes, 40% said yes,  but that means 60% said no.  And none of those people

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  will pay.  Well, here's the numbers for the New York Times.  If you round up, it has approximately  almost 60 million unique users  of whom about 3 million  hit the wall and of whom  paid purely digital.  That's about right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That sounds about right.  What, apparently, BetaWorks  is thinking is that they don't want to do  an ad-based version. They'd like to do  a paid version.  It says  free products on the internet don't have a great track record.  We need to build a product people can rely on and trust  will always be there for them. I think there's a move in that  direction among a number of...  This pin board, that's what they said. We're not going to do delicious.  We're going to charge you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How well is that working? I don't know.  It could be a good business, but it's going to be  a very small business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's what you build in the profit, right?  It's like Twitter. We're not huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's what always was forgotten.  I know this from my days in the magazine business.  There's a subscriber acquisition cost  and there's churning.  So you've got to have some...  You need a critical mass, and that  means you've got a marketing cost, and it's a large marketing cost.  Right.  Good point.  When I started EW,  our subscriber  acquisition cost was running  25 bucks to require  a subscriber.  We'd charge you very little. We'd make it on the  third or fourth year of the subscription.  That's how it works. When I was at Delphi,  subscriber acquisition cost was  running about $100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure it was the same for AOL and the other  early online services. Very expensive.  Those free disks cost something.  Exactly.  Good point. Although nowadays, because of the internet,  I think customer acquisition cost must be a lot  lower. They've got the name...  I don't know.  If they get...  Well, they've got the name DIG, and they also bought  Instapaper from Marco last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love the guys at Bazeworks.  We need to be clear here, but I think  if you want to get to some critical mass  of size...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  There's a post-terus replacement.  Yesterday, post-terus closed down.  Twitter bought them. Thank you, Twitter.  I loved it as a blogging service,  but two of the founders  started something called Post Haven. They said, we're just going to  charge you five bucks a month. That way, we know  we're covering our costs, and we can guarantee you this will never  go down. That's a good idea.  I thought it was post-terus.  Post-terus, post-terus.  It's dead now. It doesn't really matter.  It doesn't matter anymore.  You can call it whatever you want.  It still doesn't work.  But post-haven.com  well, it's too late, I guess.  It would have imported your post-terus data.  It's post-terus.  Post-terus. I did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a good rationale for charging, though.  It was a free service. It didn't make it.  Twitter bought us.  So you don't have to worry about someone failing,  because you pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait, if not enough people buy it,  and you're committed, and you've got fixed costs  for servers or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think if a thousand people pay five bucks,  that's going to pay for what you need.  But there's, again, I go back, I'm sorry,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  but there's churn.  So what's it called?  What was the Twitter alternative app?  App.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right? And nice people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and I went ahead and paid the money,  and I didn't use it, and I couldn't stand people  coming along and saying they've subscribed to me,  and I don't do anything there.  So I pulled out entirely.  I just laughed, for I did that, they have a free version, too,  but that tells you something right there.  To hold on to people, they needed to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's a good point. They could, so they could...  By the way, you can't sign up for it anymore,  because the last day to do so was yesterday.  Apostress is down now, or Postress.  I guess if they got down to a hundred users  and made $500 a month,  it wouldn't be worth their time.  Right.  Right, exactly.  There's a critical mass, and it's not forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not forever.  But don't you think these kind of services

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  that have social built into them really well,  something like Post Haven, I guess is what it's called,  don't you feel like the marketing cost is kind of built in?  Do you feel like the marketing kind of does it itself?  Because presumably people are sharing links  to their Post Haven blog,  and it's kind of advertising itself,  which I think is kind of different than...  I agree, it's not a magazine.  Yeah, it's not a magazine. It's a social tool.  Fixed costs are lower,  but there is a point beyond which it could be too small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you still need growth, right?  Do you? Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You still need to find new users somehow, don't you?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you don't. Only if you want a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, actually, not even if you want a business.  If you're content with a business that doesn't grow,  I think there's always this presumption,  oh, we've got to get bigger and bigger,  and I don't think you have to always get bigger.  Do you?  Let's say that they built into this  enough to pay for a sysadmin  and as many servers as they need  for five bucks a month,  and they just run it forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but they want an engineering team  that's going to constantly innovate, make it better,  that costs money, and then it gets better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't do a lot of what posters used to do.  It can't really evolve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did you guys see Ghosts,  that open-source blogging platform Kickstarter?  Oh, no.  It kind of warmed my heart.  It really did. I guess I'm just sort of an old-school web person.  But I'm like, yeah, man.  2013, there's an open-source  blogging platform getting built  by somebody who worked on WordPress forever.  John Nolan.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You see, Zach Braff  financed the sequel to Cardless State.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There are a lot of people really upset about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really? Why?  Because they assume he's rich and so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, his net worth, is any worth like $22 million?  What's he going to do his Kickstarter for?  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They say in the movie business  you shouldn't back your own movies. You should use some other money.  I mean, I think this gave him freedom from  you know,  that's, there's this kind of  anti-rich view that if you have money,  you should all use it. You should never ask for money.  Well, you know, he could go to the studios to ask for money.  And then he said it was going to affect the product.  Or he can go to the fans and ask for money.  This is very Amanda Palmer.  And Amanda Palmer got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People hate Amanda Palmer for the same reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not all. Some do.  But Kickstarter feels like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It just feels like Kickstarter is a platform  for artists who have a lot of talent  but just don't have the money or don't have the faith  from the traditional sort of backers.  So it's hard. I mean...  Yeah, I mean, I don't know. Maybe I got...  Like Veronica Mars, for example.  That I backed happily because I was like,  I want this. I'm a huge fan. I don't have no idea  how rich or not  Ralph Thomas is, whether or not he could have  funded it himself. But I felt like really good about that.  The Zap Roth thing, I was sort of like,  I don't know, maybe I'm just not as big a fan of Garden State  or of his work, but I was a little bit like...  Yo, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got a problem with a movie about Jersey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Huh? What's the problem?  Look, I loved Garden State back in the day  when I saw... I wasn't like, when  are we gonna get the sequel or  the next Garden State? I was  feeling that way about Veronica Mars.  So, you know, I don't know. Listen,  I get it. It makes sense.  It's hard for... You know, Braff did this whole thing  about how the man was gonna  ruin his movie. And it's kind of like,  dude, you could  use your own money.  I mean, you are the man. Yeah.  I think that was the sentiment. Like, you are the man.  You could do this. But shouldn't, Gina, shouldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kickstarter be for connecting with  your fans? I mean, if you're rich  or not, if Amanda Palmer has millions of  dollars, shouldn't it be,  you know, I'm just trying to play devil's advocate,  shouldn't it be a platform for you  to allow your fans to  participate in what you're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely. I guess I just feel  better when I see Kickstarter bring kind of  unknowns into... I want to see, you know, a completely  unknown filmmaker who's just  really young and smart and hustles, you know,  win at Sundance or whatever.  Like, that makes... That's just a  story that makes me feel better than someone like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Braff. I don't want to see just that.  I also want to see the  platform be successful.  And having some well-known names in there  is part of what I think makes Kickstarter  successful. Did you see Amanda Palmer's  TED Talk? I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I didn't. It's in my to watch. It's in my Insta  paper queue. You should, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's really well done. And  I think it's a model for some media.  Yeah, but there's moments... There are

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  cringeworthy moments in there.  Like when she says  this poor family that she...  They gave us their beds  and they slept in the living room so we could sleep in their  beds. And I understand  what she was saying and I kind of  get it and support it, but it was a little  cringeworthy, like, yeah, okay, that's  nice. It was a very

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  TED moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is... You know what?  Let me propose this.  That what you don't like about it, Gina, is it's...  And the same thing with Veronica Mars. It's a...  Which you did like. It's a  backwards move. It's a nostalgia move. And  I would like to see Kickstarter support  forwards, not backwards. New things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  That's a good point. But I mean...  But there's also something more of what you like.  A bunch of people want to give that graph 2 million. Why can't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're giving...  And that would be the other question is, as long as people  who are donating understand what they're getting, which is  not a...  Zilch, zip, bupkis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I got into... I got into a big  tip from one of my students a year ago.  And I'll give him credit now.  That  he went after Matter,  which was a site that was up  from journalists to do long form and charge  $0.99, $0.04, blah, blah, blah. I think they raised up  like $140,000. And he went after them.  I went after my student.  You're just being rude about this.  My student was right.  Matter was just bought by Medium.  And my student did a post then that said,  you know, okay, folks, what did you get for your  $140,000? Yeah, maybe you got a couple  of articles, but you supported something that  in turn just got sold.  And there's no expectation of equity here.  That's fine. That's what it is.  But what did you really support? You've got to think about  what you're supporting when you do that.  Now, I would argue... Let me try another thing on you, Gina.  I don't know if you were an Arrested Development fan.  I am.  Okay, so Netflix came along and Netflix is  the salvation of bringing it back. But let's imagine  Netflix weren't there. Let's imagine the producers said,  we want to bring back Arrested Development. We want to put it on the web.  Whatever the business model is.  Let's go to Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Why not? Yeah, maybe I'm just being too subjective  about this, because I'm just like, well, Arrested Development is all...  I mean, no, I actually...  I liked Garden State. I didn't feel like  there was a clamoring for another movie or...  I was going to say, there was a clamoring for  Arrested Development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There is for Arrested Development. There is.  There's a huge fan base. It got canceled  too soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this is what happened with Veronica Mars, right?  It just never got a fair shake. I would feel the same way about  Firefly of Serenity or Dollhouse.  Any kind of series  that got cut off too soon.  Imagine Star Trek today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay, so let's try that. Let's try that.  So Star Trek gets canceled  in 2013.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Like the original Star Trek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The original Star Trek, right?  And now the fans write  letters and all this, and they can't get anywhere.  Now they can come and say, well, F them.  We can back  this thing. So it fails Leo's test.  It's going backward, but it's also taking  something that's known and liked  and supporting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I would be in support  of that. You know, for me, it's the rich thing.  It's that I know that Zach Raff  has enough money to fund his own movie.  And Jeff, you're probably right. I mean, I don't know.  I don't have that kind of money. So I don't know really what the rules are.  I get, I get, I don't know. Why wouldn't you find  Veronica Mars? Veronica Mars is being

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  subsidized by CW, isn't it?  I mean, that CW is putting up  like they fail the rights and stuff like that.  So it's not just like the creator who's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right, right.  The creator basically said if enough fans  kick in, then the man  will match or there's some deal where they said  the studio said, look, we'll help you if you get  this, if you raise this much money, if you prove that there's enough interest  kind of upfront.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we can agree that there are ways we'd  like to see Kickstarter used to do  forward-looking public  projects for the public good.  However, you all  it's an open platform.  And so you're going to get people doing  things that we might not agree with.  But if people put money, kick  money in, and are  and as long as they understand what they're doing, that they're  not, they're not getting a share  in Garden State, they're not getting anything.  They're not even getting a movie. They're just saying  yeah, I'll give you ten bucks.  Please do it. But you may get nothing  because I've learned that lesson kind of the hard way on  Kickstarter. I got a lot of nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the example that Jeff was using  though, I mean of Matter, you  know, you wouldn't have known, oh  there's a potential that they're going to sell  what I just funded to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  understand. You could be  suckered by this. So  all you're doing is using money to  cast a vote in favor of something you want to see.  And you're getting nothing  for it. As long as you understand that, I don't think there's anything wrong with it.  You get the reward.  You get a t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You get the reward that you  agree to, right? Like you agree up front  for a reward. It's not like you're not getting anything.  Right? I mean, assuming  the creator follows through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but you might also think this Pebble watch is going to be really cool.  And then get it and go  gee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, no, fair enough. That you do have to be aware of.  They might make

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Garden State 2 and might be like  My Weekend with Bernie.  Right. Is that good or bad, Leo?  Yeah. You be the  judge. You never know with the geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look, Zakk raised the money.  There's obviously the fan base. I just  I personally had a hard time  sending Zakk Braff 10 bucks. Because I  think I need my 10 bucks more than Zakk  Braff needs my 10 bucks. Yeah, they don't send him the money.  So then I didn't. I didn't back it.  I'll actually probably see the movie.  Right. But I just didn't back it.  You'll give him your 10 bucks then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't know for that either.  Including the babysitter. It's going to cost you some pretty pennies to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I know. Seriously.  This is depressing.  I should have just backed up and got the digital download.  I wouldn't have to get the babysitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I can tell you Amber McArthur who wanted  to marry Zakk Braff is so excited  and she gave money and she's  this is the greatest thing ever. So there you go.  I mean, it's just to each his own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It might be just my subjective sort of fan  where my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I understand what you're saying because I feel  squeezy about Kickstarter all the time.  But I can't put my finger on it. So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here, let me give you the  Amanda Palmer thing.  She says that at some point if you just open up and ask  people, they become better or you can give.  As opposed to this whole notion,  Matthew and I love to go on about and get in trouble for,  of paywalls. You must pay.  I'm going to require you to pay. You should  pay. You're bad if you don't pay.  And that's the attitude we have in media.  Whereas what Amanda says is she was just a street performer.  People just gave her money and she gave  them flowers or flowers or songs.  I don't know why we have to have one or the other.  We don't. We don't. But she's  at least saying, well in the L.A. media we only got  two. We've got advertising and paywalls.  That's it. We're replicating the old models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, there's three. We can ask for money. I mean, this is  the new way of doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Amanda says, so Amanda came out with one album  and it sold  25,000 copies. And she thought,  that's pretty good. Label said, no, it's not.  It's awful.  So she's out. She's gone.  Next time comes around, she's like, I'm going to go to Kickstarter and get  the thing supported. It was  25,000 people gave her  whatever was 1.2 million dollars.  So it was the same number of people.  Was able to support something  by just opening up and giving them the opportunity  if they wanted to ask. No requirement.  Obviously no requirement.  Right? Nothing. And this is the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  promise of the internet.  And that's why it's great. Because now  there are more ways to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's another great Kickstarter project  up today. Planet Money,  Adam Davidson and company from  NPR, who just  have done a great job of covering  the financial crisis. They want to follow  a t-shirt from the cotton farm all the way  through. So it's a  put in 25 dollars in the project, and  you're going to get the story of your t-shirt  out of that, which is a nice idea for  subsidizing a journalistic thing. Fully funded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now see, this is the other question.  They asked for 50,000. They got 73.  What happens to the other 23?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Profit. They can use the money to  do really good reporting. I've got no problem  with anything in Overage because they're  public radio, they get  What if it was Zach Braff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aren't they fully funded already?  I think Braff said

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They'll say that like, well,  then we'll contribute the rest of the money to the  movie. We'll just make the movie better. That's what they do at Veronica Mars.  Any Overage, we'll have better shooting  locations, we'll be able to spend more days shooting.  Better catering.  But you know, Veronica Mars, they were like,  well, shoot in Southern California, which is where  we shot the show. We wouldn't be able to afford that  if I just get the minimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they don't say on this one, on the  t-shirt one, what they're going to do with the  23,000 extra dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's easy. They do a lot  of good reporting. I don't begrudge

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  them. I agree. I think they're wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They did the best reporting.  The giant pool of money was called.  It was a co-project with  This American Life. If you  listen to it, people, it is the best  explanation of how we got in the financial crisis.  Beautifully done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually like the idea of doing  special reporting projects like that.  You know, Kickstarter funded  or specially funded.  So instead of giving NPR a bunch of money,  give them something for a specific  project. I'd like to see  more companies try to do that. More  media companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll send you back the Aaron Swartz documentary.  That's something I'm really kind of  excited about. So this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean,  and then you look at projects and some of  as long as people know what they're getting  when they give money, which  is the only question mark in my mind,  then it's great.  And I think that  Kickstarter has done everything they can. And you know, when they  started Kickstarter, it really was about funding creative  projects like plays, movies,  comic books, novels. It  was for the arts. And the fact that  it's become so much more, I think, is  interesting. And what it means  is there's new ways to  fund things  that  make more possible for us. That's  great. It's creativity. Funds

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  creativity. And all that happiness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I'm going to take a break. Actually, I had  a couple more things. What was it?  Oh, I should mention this EFF site. That  was it. Yeah, it actually is.  Who's got your back? Yeah, who's got your back?  I think  you can Google it. But we  talked about it on the previous show  on Security Now. And I think  he made a bit  bit.ly  who back? Let's see if it works.  No.  Why back?  Thank you. You got a good memory.  That's probably because you're young. Jeff  Needles. Why back? Let's try  that. Yep.  So bit.ly  bit.ly  back. Who has your back?  This is the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  They have  collated information about which  companies help protect which data from the  government. There are six categories  ranging from requires  a warrant for content  to tell users about  government data requests, publishing transparency  reports, publishing law  enforcement guidelines, fights  for users' privacy rights in courts,  all the way to fights for users' privacy rights  in Congress. Apple  has one star. They lobby. AT&T  has one star. They lobby. They don't do anything else.  Comcast publishes law enforcement guidelines  and fights for users' privacy in court.  That's it. We'll go down to Google, which  has all but one star. They don't  tell users about government data requests.  I don't think that's strictly true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they do when they  can, but it's not legal. They're not legal in  the United States.  Twitter and Google are both fighting around.  Twitter got that star. Google didn't.  They're both dancing around the same issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Google  probably deserves more credit than they get here.  But Sonic.net, which is an internet service  provider from here in Sonoma County and a  really great company, and  Twitter are the only two companies that got all six  stars. Verizon's zero  stars, along with  MySpace.  Some good work there. Good work there. Nice job.  So, worth looking at. I might  question a little bit about this one  on tells users  about government data requests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they do. They do. But not all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they can't legally on some of them  in which, so they gave the outline. Remember they gave the  outline. Well, this is, we can't say exactly what  I think that they've complied  with in every respect that they  can.  Our tip,  number, and tool of the week, and  Matthew, if you want to give us a tip or a tool or  something fun, a recommendation, we'll do that too.  Matthew Ingram is here. Great to have you  from GigaOM.  Jeff Jarvis, Gina Tripani, you're watching  This Week in Google, brought to you today by  99designs. I should, you know,  show our TeeSpring contest.  Or a T-shirt. We have our own T-shirt,  you know. And we didn't do Kickstarter.  We just did a TeeSpring. T-double-E-S-P-R-I-N-G-dot-com-slash-twit.  What we do is we create  limited edition  stuff. We did mugs.  We're doing a bobblehead.  Right now it's a twit T-shirt, but the story  behind it is kind of interesting. This was design  created by designer  at 99designs.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I got this one  from Lifehacker. This is one of  Google's advanced search operators  that I actually wasn't aware of. You can  search within numerical range  by using a dot dot.  If you saw an article, for example, I was  looking for my favorite BuzzFeed  list of all time, which is 33  animals who are extremely disappointed  in you, which is very funny.  And I couldn't remember, was it  33, was it 10, was it 100?  You can search Google, you can do  1 dot dot, 250,  and then animals who are disappointed in you,  and Google will return results  for any headline that has  a number within that range  in it.  So the Lifehacker example, Lifehacker  does a lot of top 10s. I know, I realize  that everyone's probably cringing at the idea. There are so  many lists now, the top 10 lists  or 167 ways to do that.  And yes, they're probably killing journalism.  But sometimes they're really  fun and funny and a good place  to start your research. So if you're looking for a listicle or you're looking for any  headline or webpage,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That dog is so disappointed in me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Very disappointed.  Very disappointed.  This list is so  appeals to my sort of cow the god bringing.  Like this is totally like, you know, very  frankly shocked and disappointed.  So you can use that numeric range with the dot  dot in between numbers if you're looking for any web pages  with a number in it, but you're not sure what that  number is, but you just know what the range is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is a wild operator. Yeah, it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  crazy operator. Programmers get it, cause  it's range. It's a range, right,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  exactly. But boy, that is  a weird operator. Only Python, only a  Python programmer would think of putting  that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So when you're looking for 67 ways to juice up your  Android phone, you should just do, you know,  10 dot dot,  you know, 100 and you'll find it.  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does that,  is PHP, you do PHP programming  too, right? Yeah, yeah.  Does PHP support that operator, the dot dot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, that's a good question.  I don't know that I would do it that way. I would just do  less than and, you know, greater than.  I would just do a logical and, you know,  conditional. I don't know if it does  ranges. Python does do that though, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. One dot dot ten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I should check it because I like it.  It's briefer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And now  it's a Google operator.  Yes. Jeff Jarvis, your number of  the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  17% of adults in the UK,  according to the Future of Britain report,  commissioned by media agency,  17% of UK adults think  that Google has their best interest in heart,  tied with  churches.  Slightly under 19%  for supermarkets, but I don't know whether this  came before or after  horse meat and their beef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Brits just  are not a trusting people. They are not.  That's ridiculous.  How can you not trust  churches and grocery stores?  Well, I got

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  more reasons not to trust churches  and grocery stores than I do Google.  Who do they trust?  Maggie Thatcher?  The National Health Service. Doctors.  Is there a bunch of commies, of course?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did not usually think of  Britishers as skeptics, but I think that  we can now say it is the  skeptical aisle.  Big Ginge says we trust our government.  No, you don't.  Matthew, do you want to give us  a tip or an app you like  or anything like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess this is kind of cop out  in a way, but Google now  I hadn't really, you know, I'd looked  at the cards and, but I mean  using it at home, I mean I go  so few places  and I work  at home that the cards weren't really hugely  useful, but when I was traveling  in Italy, it became  enormously useful and I really started  to see the potential  at telling me, bringing up  my boarding pass,  telling me there was traffic on the way  to the airport so that I  didn't miss my flight. That stuff is  simple, you know, it's just  and it's not rocket science, but it just  was incredibly useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree. I'm a fan. In fact,  to me, if Google Glass does that,  I might be very interested.  Exactly. It was just, it really  opened my eyes.  I kind of guess I did my  tools because I showed them both  the HTC One and the Galaxy S4.  We are, I'll tell you, there's  just no question in my mind that Android  is knocking it out of the park one way or the other.  The nice thing is the amount of choice you have  that between the Nexus  4, the Galaxy S4  and the HTC One, there's something for  anybody.  I put my mom on a Galaxy  Note 2. She's never had a smartphone.  And I put it, now  Samsung does offer  this kind of simple mode.  So I put it in there, it had big text, which was  great for her eyes. She's 80.  And she's loving it.  She used the S Pen to sketch  with.  This is just really exciting  to me. I thought Android might be a little complicated for her,  but no, she has no trouble with it.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It just seemed like a golden age for Android.  I'm excited about I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to thank you all for being here.  Thank you to Matthew Ingram, GigaOm.com.  Good to see you and the boxing gloves.  You kept the gloves off during  the show and I think that's important.  He's a Canadian,  so he's nice. Are you Canadian?  I am, yes.
