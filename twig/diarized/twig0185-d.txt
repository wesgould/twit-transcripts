Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis, Kevin Marks and Lauren Weinstein join us to talk about  lots of stuff including Apple's curved watch. Looks like it might be more than a rumor.  Unfortunately, the chrome pixel is less than a rumor and patent law. What's wrong with it?  It's all coming up next on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

I want to say that right up front because I don't want you to be disappointed when we actually  mention things like Twitter, Facebook and other stuff. Gina Cipenny is off this week, but we've  we've doubled up. We've doubled down. Jeff Jarvis is here, a professor of journalism at the City  University of New York, the author of What Would Google Do in His Latest Public Parts. Hi, Jeff.  Good to see you. Hi there. Thank you. And Jeff invited us to replace Gina just for today  with Lauren Weinstein, who is, wow, just wait. Lauren is, let me say this up front,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lauren is, I'm glad Lauren and I finally get to meet here, but he is my favorite person on Google Plus,  period, full stop. A master of the form. You have people like Elgin who do really well writing posts  and that kind of stuff. But Lauren uses Google Plus, I think perfectly for linking, conversation,  adding value. And he's really smart and has a great history and that is all kind of stuff. So  I've been dying to meet Lauren one way or the other because we often also agree a lot. And so  this is the way to meet finally. Hello, Lauren. Welcome. Very nice finally meeting you. And I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think I should leave now. It's only downhill. And also, I mean, when I said double down, I meant it.  We also have Kevin Marks joining us. Former Googler, former Apple employee, one of the guys  behind QuickTime and early proponent of podcasting who is now working for Salesforce. It's great to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have you, Kevin and your crows. Sadly, a stag twig this week, but Gina will be back next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't. We're gender blind here. We don't know what's under the table. We don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could be anything. Are you talking about my prostate again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm walking in the door and I'm thinking today I'm thinking I think at some point I crossed this  Rubicon, I am now entering old age. And I thought the only person I know who would understand when  I say that is Mr. Jeff Jarvis. Thanks a lot. I just I was walking a little slower. And then I  find myself wearing the kind of hat my grandfather would have worn. And I thought, when did I get to  be an old man? When did that when the exactly that? We're not going to be getting the kind of  commercials we get on CNN. No, thank God we're not there yet. Good news. Good news. Our commercials  are all stuff young people would be interested in. Let's say let's start talking about the news.  There's there's quite a bit to talk about. And I think with Lauren here, there'll be a lot of  discussion about a free Internet. Here's my hat, by the way. Thank you. Yeah, I want to see this.  So there's two ways I can go with this. I got this in Nolans. There's two ways I can go the  Hunts Hall Leo Gorsi Bowery Boys look. See, only Jeff knows what I'm talking about there.  Or I can do the snap brim and then I don't know what I am. I'm an old man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are. Yeah. Well, isn't this like a breaking bad thing now? Well, it's not quite you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's interesting you should say that because he wears kind of a jazz hat with a narrower brim.  It's very similar to telescope brim called a what's it called? I can't remember now. Pork pie.  Pork pie. Thank you. He wears a pork pie. This is not quite a pork pie. So I got a pork pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, how many drinks did you have before you bought that? I had a number of primary colored

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  beverages named after weather phenomenon. Chiefly the hurricane. I believe there was a tornado,  a lightning storm, a hail storm. I don't know what the hell I was drinking.  It is fun in Nolans. That was a lot of fun. I'm glad to be back though because that's hard work.  The Google reader apocalypse is upon us. Google feed reading service unusable.  It's more confined for me. Since Sunday, this is what TechCrunch says. I didn't have any problems

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and I use it constantly. I think it does this every now and then. It has little burps in  posting lots of things that are new but obviously Sarah had trouble with it. I didn't have trouble  with it at that point but I see this now and then. I get the same thing on my blog. There's  some blog that links to me in it's sidebar which means every post they post shows up as a comment  on every post on my blog which is kind of annoying. Google has not paid a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  attention to Reader. I think some of the experiments with sharing in Reader made it to Google plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But do people still have a standalone news reader? I check Reader every day but I'm old and weird.  The thing with Reader is that it doesn't have many users but it has huge numbers of  intensity. When I was at Google, we had weekly stats meetings for Marissa and one of them was,  oh yeah, Reader has the highest number of pages for a user but no users.  There every day, every week along with Orkut has the highest number of page views in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you do with a product like that that has a small number of highly devoted fans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of like Twitter. Well, it depends who you are. If you're a startup, then you say,  I'll charge them 10 bucks each and you're fine. That's how Pinboard works. If you're Google,  you're like, well, this is mass-marked enough for us. We'll take the engineers off it and  make them do something else. It's the way I follow the news all the time but what I worry about more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that more and more sites are dropping their RSS feeds. So if RSS dies, the reader follows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's also the other way around is that Reader is also used as a back end by lots of people  because it's hosted by Google and is reliable. So lots of sites use it for feed sync. I forgot  his name. The guy who wrote the original Mac feed reader wrote a post about this saying,  warning when this falls over, a bunch of things are going to stop working.  Lauren Richter or somebody else? No. I'm getting old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. So that's our theme today, the old fart show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can't remember stuff because we put it on the computer and now it's gone.  Lauren, does it bother you? It's a social network that's been discontinued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Certainly some sites don't do RSS. More of those sites don't just do excerpts on RSS,  don't put the complete article on there. Does that bother you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't bother me so much as long as there's enough there for me to find out whether I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an interest in the article or not. And then you click and go to the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm perfectly happy to give people clicks. I don't object to that. There's some sites that  don't include the whole articles just because they're afraid no one will ever visit the site  if they see it all RSS. I don't have a problem there. One of the worst is like, if there's just  a headline, that's a problem. Fox News does that, but of course there's no good reason to ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the headlines at Fox News are deceptive. You just can't tell what the article is going to  be from the headline. And that's why they only put headlines.  Right. You might want to click this and find out what we're really talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what RSS started out as. And then we grew it into long form posts. It was originally a  thing for sending headlines around. Oh, really?  It was originally built for Netscape, for the Netscape homepage. And you could put a feed up  and it would give you a little sidebar of things to click through to. That was the very first  version of RSS. And then Dave Weiner picked it up and said, oh, this goes with this blogging thing  that we're trying to make sense of and evangelize that and got everyone else to adopt it. And then  blogs were for a long time these pages that you basically had a page a day and it was a set of  links and it looked like tweets. If you go back to the archives of old blogs, they didn't have  titles. It's like Waxie links and stuff like that. Yeah. Waxie links and like the old scripting news,  if you look at them and Dave's point of view on it was I'll edit this during the day and  into the day I'll archive it and sign you one tomorrow. Right. And then I think it was movable  type that came up with the one page per post thing. And that meant that you had a presumption of a  headline and a story. Or was it also permalink? The permalink as page? Permalink as page, yes,  as opposed to permalink as what do you call it? Hashtag, hash URL thing within a time-based page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. You know, it's funny because Hacker News has always bugged me because they're one of  the sites that only puts the headlines in. You know, here's an interesting thing, Leo.  I love Hacker News. I wish I could see excerpts. There's a company that I work with called that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  has a product called repost.us that makes articles embeddable like a YouTube video,  traveling with brand advertising, analytics and links. Very, very interesting. One thing they've  found is that there's very little overlap as a rule. They work with companies like  Agence France Press and NJ.com where I work with and there's very little overlap in the creator's  audience to the embedder's audience. So you get new audience. Here's the interesting thing.  You have the full article there with your own ads and your own brand and everything else,  you don't lose any SEO. The click-through rate from a full article to the originator's site  is running 5% to 7%, very high, which says that your content is your best ad. If you read the  whole article, you're more likely to click through than if you just read a snippet.  That's bizarre because you've seen the whole article.  But what you're saying is, gee, you got a sister like this at home?  I want to see more. Yeah, right.  Right. And so you have in... Here we go, folks. Get ready, get ready, get ready.  We have in Germany the Leistungsschutzrecht.  Where's the reggae when we need it?  I know. Where they're trying... You got to have Fred from the Howard Stern show already.  Where they're trying to argue that snippets are too much and snippets are theft and all  this kind of stuff. And what you find out from repost on us is that the whole content is a better  causer of links. And we found that out in the RSS days. We're putting out your whole feed sounded  ridiculously illogical, but we found that in blogs and the Guardian and places like that,  found that putting out the whole feed was actually better for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, there's a sort of corollary here which has been striking me continuously for a  while, which is that citation used to be, here's a compact way of referring to something so you can  go and look it up somewhere else. And there's been an ongoing debate about how you do citation  on the web, which is a hyperlink, how you cite things that don't have URLs for a long time. And  it's now become very, very clear that the way you cite something reliably is to quote it.  Because if you search for the quote, that's unique enough you will find the original and the other  people who posted it too. So there's this sort of weird thing where the citation becomes the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  quotation and vice versa. Is it really important to maintain RSS feeds in Google Reader in an era  where people are using Twitter in a way as their feed, their link generation? Isn't that why RSS

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is kind of... I think there needs to be some way to have a feed that comes direct from the source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And... Well, kind of it does. If I follow The Economist on Twitter, it's more of a curated feed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from The Economist. Right, but if we're concerned that headlines are too short and a whole article  is best, where does that leave us when you have 140 characters to work with? Right. Well, what if

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter starts putting excerpts of the articles or maybe that thing you were talking about, Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in line in its website? Yeah, they are doing that. But here's the other thing. RSS, a lot of services  like NewsCred or Daylife before it, they use RSS as the means to get alerted that there's a new  headline and to be able to take the content not for display purposes but for analytical purposes.  So you can do things like then cluster articles into stories like Google News does. I don't know  how Google News... They probably scrape because they're good at scraping. But a lot of other sites  use RSS as a means to get true feed for back-end purposes too. It's funny after...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have HATM, which is a way to mark up your web page to say here's the structure you would  expect from a feed with classes. We did a microformat for that five years ago. And there are new  things in the latest HTML5 spec that are designed to make it easier for you to do that. But the  tension is you don't always want people to pull your content out without taking the ad. So  there's a sort of... The HTML5, you can mark stuff up as nav and a side. And there's now main. And  then there's a whole series of section and header things that you can do to make your page easier  to parse for things like feed readers and readability and stuff like that. But the challenge  is there's a tension there between, no, I want you to take my ads too. Please stop trying to  deconstruct my page. So there's always a back and forth between the two. But if you actually want  parsability, we've got HATM, we've got HNews, which is an extension of HATM with focus on  news publishing. So it has bylines and it has datelines and the things that you need for news.  It's perfectly possible to do this, but the debate is on the legitimacy of parsing a web  page with something other than a browser. And that's the thing we're kind of losing.  When Google started out, they could write a web search engine because the present was,  you could crawl the web with anything. And if you try and do that now, it's actually very hard.  If you try and crawl Facebook with something that isn't a browser, it says, go away and get  yourself a browser. You're using something we don't support. And many sites now have robots.tech  setups that only allow Google bots and not other crawlers. So if you're trying to build something  like, I built a Technorati or Spinner have built or a bunch of these, any kind of public  web crawler, it's much harder now than it was 10, 15 years ago. Because the sites are now  explicitly have a very different worldview and are trying to make the web not as callable and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  equal as they were. The good news is Google says, as of last night, users began noticing issues with  Google reader. They have now been resolved for everyone who was affected. We apologize. And  you're right, it's all working. And then I went to Google reader. I thought, oh, I forgot how great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this is. Started scanning articles. The other thing Google is really good for, and this is the  subtle thing, is the search box at the top is a search that's constrained to the things that you  followed, which is really useful for the I read that thing, where the hell was it type searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The truth is I used to have, I still have in my reader, a huge list of feeds, probably 80 or 100.  And the truth is I use it for number one, my ego searches, and number two, three or four feeds of  things that I go to regularly. And I've reduced immensely my use. What about you guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a folder called top underscore top, in fact, that has a bunch of things that are  update not very often that I want to make sure I catch. And I have a bunch of comics that I,  you know, I check in every day and read the comics, XKCD and Dilbert and questionable content,  Calvin and Hobbes. And then I have a bunch of other blogs that I want to know when they update,  and they're in there in my top list, then the rest of them are in another folder, which I don't  read. But it's there so that when I try to want to try. So that I want to run where I read something,  it's got all the tech news sites and stuff. So I can use reader search to find the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because we just said, Lauren, you're all you're you're pisses me off. But you're often ahead of  me in finding the headline that I want to link to to and so I like to you. Where are you finding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the stuff? How what's your habit? Mostly Google Reader. Interesting. I have a real long list and  I've gotten real good at scanning through it fast. I probably miss things from time to time.  And I just start starring and then I go back and when I see things that are interesting, I  pull them out. But I'd say probably 75% of those kinds of items are coming from Google Reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I find it amazing that Kevin Marks, Google Reader still gave me a new Calvin and Hobbes episodes. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  really want to I need that feed. They're old ones, but they come around again. There's enough  Calvin Hobbes episodes that I'm old enough. We're gonna take a break. We're gonna come back with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  more. We what a good panel. I you know, chat room, if you've got some stuff you'd like to talk about,  Lauren Weinstein's blog is fabulous. lauren.vortex.com. And we could just go through the  articles here and find enough to talk about for this week. But anything and go Lauren's  Google Plus feed to you. Yeah, I started. Lauren, you don't have a header. You just have a blank in  your Google Plus at the top. There's just a white space. Right. No, there's no there's no photo there.  That's intentional. It's a photo of white. Yes. In fact, when I click on it, that's what I get is,  is it something about snow? What's going on? It's emptiness. It's it's emptiness. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, I mean, I know one day I'll put something there. But I like it. It's just a big blank.  And when you click it, you get blank. It was harder to set up than you might think. Was it really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wants you to put something real in there? Yeah, they do. I was just wondering if there was some

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're making a statement with that. It's not it's not terribly cosmic. No.  It's just like white space. It's either that or some kind of obnoxious animated gif, I guess. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's the problem. What could you put there that would be the New York Times? You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, this great the great Twitter account and white on it. Yes, which which which finds all the  trend stories. One minute ago, guys, gifts are very popular on the Internet and the Times is on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are going to come back with more in just a bit. But first, a word from our friends at Citrix. They  have a new product they want to let you know about actually company they recently acquired that  really does the more I use it, the more I like. The problem is, it's very difficult to describe  what it does. So really, the message here is sign up for podio for free podio.com, create your first  workspace and start playing with it. It's it's the idea is to use a central spot on the web  that combines all the information that you need in your work, things like files, email,  you can even have a feed. That's kind of like a Twitter feed a company feed, I'm going to log  into our podio account here for the Twitter network. We've been using this more and more.  We just really like it. You can sign in with Google plus Facebook, Twitter, of course,  it will incorporate your Google information like contacts and so forth. And it just becomes a very  wonderful repository of information. We have a twig account and podio. We have a This Week in  Tech account and I've set up and we're going to start inviting people to our editorial advisory  board inside here in in a podio. The podio is again hard to describe, but it's a all the  information that you currently have in a bunch of different places in one spot your Google documents,  including word processing, spreadsheets, email, combined and managed. You've got great back and  forth instant communication better than email, workflow is managed completely can customize it.  They have workspaces for every possible team and project. It's not exactly a project manager  either, although you could use it for that. I think it's something you would just use day in,  day out. podio podio.com. The activity stream is a really nice feature, by the way,  that shows what's going on in the workspaces and what's happening. We have a workspace called  join podio. One of these days. Tom Merritt is the lead IaaS enforcer.  You can use it for silly things too. podio.com. Get in there, sign up. It's free. Create your  first workspace. Invite your team to get started. I think you'll be impressed with what you can do  with podio and you know, share your podio experience with me. Let me know what you're  doing with podio so I can show this on the air because it really is fantastic. podio.com.  Do you have Google Now yet, Jeff? Or is it still not now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, I always had it. It doesn't do that much. I uninstalled it, reinstalled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now there's more in now. So look at your now. In order to use Google Now, you of course,  you have to have a jelly bean phone. I don't get any of the fun stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's giving me the weather, which is fine. It's giving me some stocks. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've added Fandango. They've added a whole... Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can make it do more if you... When it says share more cards, you can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I've done that. I've signed up for every one of them. He's got some weird thing going on.  I've told him to look at my underwear drawer. I've said everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In other words, you're coming up irrelevant, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, he's not relevant. So apparently, it's Tom Morris's birthday.  Facebook's up 1.94% and it's 61 degrees in San Jose. That's what it's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not great. No, you need more than that. It's not that great.  They've got Rotten Tomatoes reviews in here, Fandango tickets and Zillow real estate listings  now. But I don't know. Does that mean if you... Zillow real estate, because it tells you what

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  your house is worth every day. That would be depressing. Let's see. I've got all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  birthdays from Google+. That's kind of a... Let me see here. What else? Harlem Shake videos.  How did they know that I was into that? You said Google searched it.  I must have searched for it. Netflix is up another eight bucks. What's going on? Netflix almost...  It's at 186 bucks now. I love this. These are all my packages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is all the people who like House of Cards. They're buying Netflix stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That might be it. House of Cards has really done well for Netflix, hasn't it?  The Weather Report, my next appointment. Look at all that you've got. Look at all that.  I've got a ton of stuff in here. Orin, are you on Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. What do you got? Nexus 7 and Galaxy. I love it.  I get Google Now stuff, but not all that much. It's not as much as I would like to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I just do... I do so much surfing now. There's all kinds of things I had to do. I had

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to go to my Google Apps account and say it was okay. The I as administrator had to say it was  okay that I as Jarvis was allowed to put the history up and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we're hearing more and more that Google Now is starting to be part of  more of what Google's doing. It looks like Google Now is going to get into notifications.  It's going to be... I think it's critically important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My argument around media is that media treated us all as a mass and it has to treat us as  individuals. Google Now is all about treating us as an individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet this is the ultimate in creepiness. Isn't it? Isn't this what bothers people?  Now you can specify your mode of transportation for your commute. You could say,  I want to know what public transit is, not driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't say bicycling. You can only say public transport or driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no. It's no, no. You get the update, dude. Driving, public transit, walking or biking now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  available. Oh, I'll change the preference. No, the problem is I want biking plus public transit  because that's what I do. Oh, you Californians are so complicated.  We're too complicated for Google Now. I bike to the Caltrain. The public  transport is really easy. There's one thing. It's called Caltrain. You bike to that.  That doesn't take... To San Francisco and then you bike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You're right. Do you bring your bike on to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  train or do you have a bike waiting for you? No, no. I have a bike that I take on the train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is one of those fold-up bikes? No, no. It's Caltrain.  He's setting it. He's setting it. According to Netflix executive speaking of House of Cards,  it is now the most watched thing on Netflix right now, showing that Netflix,  in their $100 million gamble, this was a smart move. You may remember Netflix  started doing original programming on Netflix. They said, we're going to bring back arrested  development. They're doing House of Cards, which is a Kevin Spacey production, a remake,  American remake of a British series, which you've all watched apparently and loved.  It is very hot right now and I'm not surprised. It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not giving any numbers though, are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is at the All Things D Dive Into Media Conference. He did not share any specific  audience numbers. There was a good article in the Atlantic about how this $100 million  thing makes economic sense. In fact, Netflix, with 799 a subscriber, is doing a little more  profitable than HBO, which makes about seven bucks per subscriber and has roughly the same  number of subscribers, around 30 million. Pardon me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has to make more stuff. What's interesting though to me is that we have the synchronicity  of being able to watch things together on Twitter. That's blown away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's old school now. I mean, I think the new way is to watch a series all at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right. So what that means is this idea of the shared experience, once again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gets worked. Well, no, the thing is it's become a bimodal thing. You form to one bucket or the  other. You're either all watching the Grammys or the Super Bowl or something together or you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  catching up with it. We're all afraid of giving spoilers. What's interesting here is that, yeah,  fine, you could have watched .NABIS. Yeah, you can't really tweet it, can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it's a big, yeah, yeah, you're right. Well, no, so there's, you know, arguably there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a service here, which is my friends' tweets synchronized with the program I'm watching so  that I can see the jokes as they say them, you know, and the challenge is constructing that as  a service. But you think, I remember having a conversation with David Weinberger about this a  while back, which was where you sit there and wisecrack with your friends while you're watching  something. We did it for the State of the Union or something like that a few years back. And then  what you want is that same thing but for watching pre-recorded media. So as you're watching House of  Cards, you get your friends' wisecrack's time to that episode. My son Jake was going to build that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  app and I wish he had. See, and then there's people like me who would throw the data off completely  because I'm watching, you know, old Hammer horror film. You can go online forever and there just  aren't a lot of people who are watching that at the same time typically. Or French Friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vampire movies. But that's the point. You see, if you don't have to watch it at the same time,  if you could have like Mystery Science Theater 3000 from your friends that shows up, so as you  watch it you're adding to the commentary on that episode. Because you want to outdo each other  with your quips. Right. So then you go back and go, okay, I just thought of the joke. I can go back  and rewind and put the thing just in here. It becomes like the Rocky Horror Picture Show script,  which is the sort of refined, you know, 1970s version of this where people thought of the  jokes that went with the movie and wrote them down and then they go along and say them to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  playback. You have the little android robots and everything. With the antenna sticking up into the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  screen. Yeah. Rocky Horror Picture Show as a service. There we go. They're talking about making

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Now a widget. Techno Buffalo says your Nexus may have a Google Now widget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, there was a new screensaver that I have been failing at this. I need Gina here to  help me. Hold on a second. A Google Now screensaver? Kind of. What it was, it's called Dash Clock.  Oh. It was done. Didn't you see that, Lauren, on Google Plus? It was done by a Googler.  And it's a widget that puts all bunch of data into your lock screen. But I can't get it to  become a lock screen. I don't know how to do it. It says move it to the right and I don't know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to do. Yeah, to do the lock screen stuff, I think you have to enable that specifically or you can't  get the data in there at all. I haven't played with lock screens too much. Yeah, because you can slide

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  between lock screens. Hang on. And we did mention last week in the Google changelog, the notifications  Google Now will come to your notifications. I like this. That's a big deal. But with Microsoft  going after Google with this new Scroogled campaign, don't you think that Google's got  to be a little careful about admitting how much it knows about people? And Google Now kind of lets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the cat out of the bag. I think that's the other way around. I think the Scroogled campaign, you're  like, sorry, why is this a problem? When you see the, I actually saw one of those, my son was  watching hockey so I was seeing ads on TV. They're putting ads on TV, which surprised me. The

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  original Scroogled was just like a web campaign. Now they're actually putting ads on TV saying  Google's reading your mail. But it was the wife was looking over her shoulder saying why have you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  got ads for bankruptcy in your Gmail? And he said, oh, because I made a joke about mortgages. It's  like, well, you don't understand that Google is slightly subtler than that. But also it was...  Oh, there is a Google Now widget. When did you get this, Chad? It was kind of broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All you have to do is update the search app and then you get it. So...  Cool. That's a nice little widget. It's Ashley Paramore's birthday. It's 59 degrees in Petaluma  and you're going to the gym at four. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Laura's been writing about the Scroogled thing a lot.  I've been following the Scroogled campaign. Let's talk about Scroogled.  It's a new one. It's really pretty dismal. What's really fascinating is it shows that people  don't care about the pitch that Microsoft is trying to make now. They launched that. That  campaign launched a week ago, just about, I think this evening will be a week or just approximately.  It was in the Super Bowl, wasn't it? Yeah, or within a day, I think. When they actually  launched the campaign per se, when the site went up, when they modified the actual...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The original Scroogled was going after Google Shopper. And I think this was not illegitimate  saying, hey, what was a search engine showing shopping results is now all ad-based. That was  not unreasonable, but this one's ridiculous. Go ahead, Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, Microsoft always had... They have paid shopping ads too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they didn't make a site of all paid shopping ads. It used to be a site of unpaid

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  search results. So now what happened with the new campaign? They went after Gmail on the basis that  Gmail is reading your mail, which of course we've known all along, just like ISPs scan for spam and  fishes and things. Google is reading mail in an automated way to do the ad display. And you can  turn that off because there's an ad preferences manager if you want to not deal with that.  So they launched this new campaign. So this petition is bogus that says...  It's legit, but the thing is, in a week, they had a target of 25K and they've got... When I  looked a little earlier, it was 5428. Yeah, they only have 5,000 signatures. Nobody cares at all.  And what's worse is they have a Facebook page that they launched at the same time,  which as far as I can tell, they've removed the link for from their main  scroogled page because it's just so awful. And it's gotten up as of today to 194 likes.  And virtually all of the comments are anti-Microsoft and pro-Gmail. So I can see why  that link probably wasn't serving the purpose. It's not on that page anymore. You're right.  Yeah, it's gone as far as I can tell. So I think most people, they understand how this works. And  I just think this is not hitting a chord for Microsoft in terms of going at this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think it's seen as mean-spirited too. Plus it's oxymoronic to say that you like Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I think Microsoft's probably smart to say, hey, we're the new underdog.  Oh, come on. Not a bad pitch.  Nobody buys that. Well, if they can get somebody to buy it, it's good.  Yeah. I mean, I think everybody knows Microsoft's also reading your email,  just not tying it to targeted ads. They're not as smart.  I mean, anything, any service is doing... Well, the thing is, if you go to Outlook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you can't even read your own email, let alone let Microsoft read it.  It has ads in it. It's because they can't spam filter. Google, they take out other people's  ads and they put in their ads. I'll take the trade off. I've got an Outlook mailbox. It's  horrible. We're going for worse. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should mention, Lauren, you are doing some consulting for Google right now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Not involving anything like this, but definitely full disclosure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For purposes of full disclosure. A financial analyst affirms Google  is paying Apple, this is hard to believe, to be the default search on iOS, 1.3 billion...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they're paying, they're getting a total revenue, one estimate is 1.3 billion, and of that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google is paying Apple a billion. Oh, so the total revenue is 1.3 billion.  So the 300 million is just like affiliate payment kind of thing.  To Google. To Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google keeps the 300 million and pays Apple a hundred. That's what the report says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's an estimate. That's not an official number, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Absolutely. It's Morgan Stanley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure if Google breaks that down, but they...  Does that seem reasonable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Google gets greater value in that because, again, Google wants to know people.  So it gets direct revenue from the ads on search there, but it also has a hook into us as

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people, and I think that matters. So Mozilla, this is one of the ways Mozilla,  but the primary way Mozilla makes money is through fees from Google for having Google  search on the Mozilla toolbar. And we always presumed that Apple was making...  That Google was making some money, that Apple was making some money from Google, but not this much.  It shows how much it's worth to Google is what I guess what we're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It also shows how good Apple has been at taking over a big chunk of the  search, of the using of the web. That's the point. This isn't like a flat fee.  This is a payment per usage thing. And it's ramped up enough that it's reached a significant amount  of money because Apple has a lot of people who use their phones for searches and their iPads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a debate over whether this is revenue sharing or a straight fee per device.  One of the analysts thinks Google is actually paying Apple $3.20 per iOS device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which wouldn't be unreasonable at all. The lifetime value or the annual value of those users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the rumors that Apple might try to boot Google from the Safari search bar is bogus then, right?  Because it's a lot of money.  And that works so well with Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and who they're going to go to? Bing? I mean, I don't think, I think, you know, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, when I go to Facebook and do a search and it comes back with Bing, I just, I laugh every time.  Funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good name. Makes you laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ned Ryerson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Google. Okay. So anything more to say about that? That's we all agree. That's probably the  case. And it makes sense for everybody. All parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's, you know, it's one of the things Google wants people to use Google. They'll happily pay  you that and they will have done some like, very careful measurements of whether it's worth it for  them and they'll be paying the money. If it wasn't worth it, they'd stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting that the Scroogled campaign has so, is getting so little traction.  Do you think that that's because, and I tie it into this because Apple users probably  don't care that Google's paying Apple. They want Google on their iOS device anyway.  Do you think-  We like Google in the UK.  Basically people are not afraid of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and we've had this anti-tax campaign in the UK, trying to go after Google and Amazon and  Starbucks and it's hurt Starbucks quite a bit, but the people just like Google too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. Why is that?  It gives us value.  It gives us value. It's not a question of trust. Do you think it's because  we actually get value for our-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's because they're actually good at the feedback loop. You know, they're,  they are very good at making the search give you what you want.  And so when you go and try something else, it feels slightly off.  You know, Gates, Bill Gates was on Reddit this week. Did he did an AMA?  And he said, as far as I can tell, the Bing is better than Google.  And it's like, well, it's better than Google for you probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're running those ads, by the way, downtown. Now it's in downtown San  Francisco, where they offer you an Xbox. If you do a search and you choose Google over Bing,  and of course they edit the ads to only show people who chose Bing.  We don't know what the real pers- I wonder how many Xboxes they've given away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that sounds like a rash thing to do in San Francisco because it's very easy to spot  which is which because you can just look at which one has one boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They even say it in the ad. We came to Google's backyard.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To challenge Google.  And they have, if I could find it, they have a Google versus Bing site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yesterday's battle, right? The importance of search to Google, of course, is still great.  But all the new frontiers are about mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it is interesting that that Microsoft is spending so much of its ad dollar and attention  on Google, like competing against Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because Google was very stealth about competing with Microsoft for a long time.  I thought Microsoft might just come and squash them.  And then at some point they got to the point where they didn't care anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it when they pulled the EAS server support for Windows Phone that did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was, I think it was a bit before that. I think it was when Android actually took off.  You know, the-  Android was the thing.  I think that the, you know, the, that, that, the Mary Meekers slides is something you should,  you should look at. The Mary Meekers set up from December that she, that she put out,  she's, she's an analyst who does this sort of nice overview of the state of the web  with actual data and links back to sources.  And the graph that she shows is the Asimco one, which says, what is the dominant operating system?  And, you know, it goes back 30 years and it starts out with all this, you know,  Apple and Commodore and Atari and stuff. And then this like,  Wintel for the, you know, 15, 20 years.  And then suddenly it goes, because Apple and Android are taking off.  And it's iOS, you know, and it's, you know, it's broken down by  manufacturer rather than actual operating system, which makes it a bit of a weird one because  it counts iOS and Mac together.  But the, the original Asimco one was like,  Microsoft's in trouble. This, these guys are up to 25%.  And her one, she updated for 2012 when it was like,  they're up, they're up close to 50%.  And she says this quarter, the crossover is happening where the majority of  machines on the net are Android rather than Windows.  That's that that's happening this quarter.  This quarter?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that really is all about mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Apple is still a big chunk of that too.  And it is about mobile because we, you know, we have, we have mobile devices.  We have more mobile devices than we have laptops and desktops now.  We're running out of words for this, which is the other weird thing,  because it's not just mobile, it's tablets too.  But mobile versus tablet used to actually mean mobile versus iPad,  because iPad was the tablet market until the last half of, of, of last year,  where suddenly all these Android ones start appearing.  And now there were loads and loads of them,  but they don't show up in all the stats because they're being used for odd things.  And, you know, they're, they're Kindles and their Nooks and their strange things in China  and so on. But there's, there's lots and lots of these showing up too.  And the slightly weird bit from my point of view is that  from Android and, you know, Android's fragmentation problem has been this sort  of thing that people have used against it for two years, but actually that hasn't been true.  What's happened is if you write for Android, you learn that, oh, these things can be this big,  or they can be this big, they can have lots of pixels, they can have a few pixels.  It's like, okay, whatever. I understand there's a domain here.  I will write some code that is that domain.  Whereas on iOS, it's like, well, we've got one that's this big,  and we'll free that this big, and we've got two that are this big.  I know we've got one that's this big.  So, on iOS, you either build an iPhone app or you build an iPad app,  which means that half the time you've got an iPad app, if you're on an iPad,  you download an app and it's got like black bars that take up three quarters of the screen because  it's an iPhone app and you'll, and they've decided not to do anything intelligent about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here, I want to, I want to get this printed from my wall. This is Mary Meeker's  slide, reimagining of computer operating systems.  That's the one, yeah.  From, and it goes from 1975 through last year.  The blue, the big blue thing is Wintel.  There is Atari and TRS-80 and Commodore in there. They all disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is CPM in the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Other is probably CPM, sure.  But really, from 1993 to 2007, it's Wintel and Macintosh.  Red is Macintosh, blue is Wintel. Dominant, and that's it.  Android appears in 2007 and climbs, as does Apple because of iOS.  And now the combination of Android and Apple easily is 63% or so of the total market.  Wintel is down to 35%.  Huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think some of this is-  Android becomes 150% now.  Go ahead, Lauren.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think some of this is kind of intangible too. I mean, we're talking about why people feel this  way. And I don't know whether you're talking about Microsoft.  Microsoft, of course, has a long, long trail behind it.  And I don't think it's that easy to have people forget about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do people really have memories? Do they really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the people who are influencers in a lot of this-  Yes, we do.  And they're the ones writing reviews.  Right. That's true.  When, for example, Surface came out right at the beginning, there was sort of a built-in-  without addressing how good or not it really is, I think there was sort of a built-in bias  among many people against it simply because it was from Microsoft. I'm not saying that that's a  good thing or a bad thing. I think that's just the reality of how the perception is among a lot of  the people who write those reviews and look at this initially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I admit, I have to work hard to overcome anti-Microsoft bias. But when you look at graphs  like this and you realize they're the underdog, you start to root for things like Windows Phone  to give Microsoft some traction in what is clearly the move from desktop to mobile.  Really, that's what this measures. And Microsoft just doesn't have a mobile presence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's not just mobile, it's tablets too. That's the other half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I include tablets as mobile. Yeah, but you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're used as computers now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is kind of what I was getting at, which is where the Apple thing has led us astray,  because we think of them as distinct, which is the iPad is something you use sitting on the couch  and the iPhone is something you use during the day. And if you actually look at the usage stats,  that's backed up. The iPad has this sort of big spike in the evening when you're sitting at home,  just looking at reading stuff. Because these things are heavy. They're that big and you've  basically got to rest it on your leg after a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mary Meeker's next slide actually shows that. At 2010, it flipped. If you look at red and blue,  red is desktop PCs, blue is laptop PCs. And if you look at green and yellow on this graph,  smartphones and tablets, in 2010, desktop and notebook PCs outpaced smartphone and tablets.  And every year thereafter, smartphone and tablets have just dominated. In fact,  desktop PCs have dropped slightly. It's not even so much that they're losing ground.  It's that tablets and smartphones. So it's not that people are giving up their computers.  It's the growth of tablets and smartphones is outpacing them.  The PC is not dead.  It's not dead. It's just stagnant. It's stasis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing is we're running out of useful subdivisions, discussion subdivisions here.  Yes.  Because we keep talking about desktop versus mobile. Well, actually most of the desktop became  laptop a while back. And a lot of this is like standing up versus sitting down, one hand versus  two hands. There's a bunch of different affordance breakpoints here. So one of the big pushes we're  doing at Salesforce is about bringing staff to people wherever they happen to be working.  So our example is Virgin Atlantic. We want all their employees to be in touch with each other  and be in touch with the customers to keep track with what's going on. And there's challenges there  because some of them are in the air and aren't actually connected. But the rest of them are  sitting in the airport and they don't have access to connectivity and desktops and keyboards.  And there's always the one person there who's sitting there with the keyboard changing the  flights and the rest of them are running around. But they can have phones and they can have tablets  in their pockets. And if you actually hook the stuff up to that, suddenly you can connect to all  your employees all the time. They don't have to check in with people. And this is this sort  of transition we're seeing in business a lot of the time where it used to be that they had a data  entry model that was there is this one terminal where you keep the business up to date with the  statistics, whether it's the cash register store or whether it's the thing you have in the bank  room where you keep track of stuff. Whereas now you can say, I have one of these or I have something  slightly bigger that has a bit more information on it. And you can both read the information of  what's going on and update what's happening all the time. And this has crept up on business  because they're used to having these very sort of monolithic systems. And it's coming from the  edges where if you look at things like Square, where you can have a small business that has a  very good handle on what's going on because every employee has a little reader like that.  But it's moving now to such that anyone who's working for a company can keep in touch with  everyone else working for that company at the same time and help them out without all the run  around you had to do before. And that's a huge change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a wonderful deck. I'm going through it. She talks about the reimagining of everything.  But what is very clear, and I guess we've seen this so many times in media transitions,  if you want to mention Gutenberg, Jeff, this would be a good moment to do so,  is that the old media doesn't die. In fact, PCs are still pretty much stasis in terms of number  of units in use. It's that there's these new things just take off.  Well, but desktops.  They don't replace it. Well, I'll go back to this graph. Desktops actually are holding pretty  steady at 750 million desktops in use. Here's the graph. Installed base of desktops in 2009  was about 750 million. It's slightly lower now, maybe 650 million. Notebooks have grown,  but not at the expense so much of desktops. Tablets and phones have grown, again, not at  the expense of notebooks and desktops. And I think that's what you see, right? Is that the  old media doesn't go away. It just gets subsumed by the massive growth of this new stuff.  Actually, what did go away is the Encyclopedia Britannica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But not that creation. If you're doing writing, you're not going to be doing a lot of writing on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a typical tablet. I guess not. Or a phone. But those people are... There's not more writers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess. They're more readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I put that in my little bit because what I found is that with SwiftKey on here, I can actually  type pretty quickly on this. I wouldn't necessarily... You wouldn't write a blog  post there. ...long form report. But I can live tweet as quickly on this as I can on the keyboard.  I can keep up with stuff like that because the autocomplete works well. The other thing I've  seen is that I was at a company offsite last week and all my colleagues in sales have iPads,  but they now all have those little Logitech keyboard things as well. So they pop up the  iPad into that if they want to take notes. And they don't carry a laptop as well, which was...  Last year, they had a laptop in their bag. If they wanted to take notes, they'd bring that out.  And they had the iPad to keep track of what's going on. And now the iPad has become that.  This is the supposed Surface market, but the Surface has lost it because the iPad is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have a Bluetooth... This is the Bluetooth keyboard I use with the Nexus 7, mostly. But if  you have a full-size keyboard with a tablet from a functional standpoint, then you're getting back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to a laptop. I'm going to take a break. When we come back, I want to talk about wearables,  because that's the other big thing. Google, of course, has its form of wearable, Google Glass,  and then the big report in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and now others,  including Bloomberg are confirming. Apple is moving big into an iWatch. Could that be? We'll  talk about it in just a bit with our panel. Kevin Marks is here from tummelvision.tv and  salesforce.com. From the City University of New York and the buzzmachine.com, it's Jeff Jarvis  and Lauren Weinstein from Google Plus and lauren.vortex.com. We're talking about  trends, really. And by the way, if you want to test whether Bing's better than Google,  bingiton.com. Just go there, do a search. You be the judge.  Which is which? It's so obvious which is which. It seems to me, and I don't know, it's interesting.  Do a search for acetaminophen. Acetaminophen, is that a good one? Google will give you the  the limit. Let's try it. That's good. I like it. A-C-E-T-O-M-E-N-A-P-H-I-N.  See which one does the best. See who fixes the spelling. Yeah. I guess I got it right.  Does it not show you the cards? I don't get cards on, well Bing is, you know what, this is a Microsoft  site. Maybe they're stripping the cards out. Yeah, that would be a big. So what they're doing is  they're just showing the API results. Yeah. Oh, that sucks. I guess they're saying, oh, if you're,  you know, then that would make it very obvious who is whom. Let's do it. Yeah, see, they're  taking out this stuff on the right, the card. Yeah. So they're doing a 12 blue links comparison,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is, you know. That's not fair. Slightly different. We have a collection of antique  typewriters here at CUNY. Yeah. And one of them is called the Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because when you hit the carriage return, many people don't know this, but when you, what I remember,  we'll be back in just a bit. But first a word from squarespace.com. This is blogging for the  21st century websites for the 21st century, the latest technology on the best hosting together.  This makes a great platform for your next website. I want you to visit squarespace.com and  try it out. They've got mobile responsive design automatically. That means whenever you put a  image on the site, they create seven different versions. The correct size will load for whatever  device you're looking at. One site serves all beautiful templates with 100% drag and  drag and drop functionality as you customize. But if you're a developer and you want to use CSS or  JavaScript, they've got a developer platform too with a colored, you know, syntax code editor and  all of that. It's so easy to build a site and yet so powerful. And of course, because the software  is running on top of the server and they're tightly integrated, you get some real benefits.  The servers never go down with the most reliable and not only just reliable, but also they handle  bandwidth very well. So if you suddenly get hit, they've got it automatically so that you get more  bandwidth as you need it. You just can't bring a Squarespace site down with traffic. And of course,  the software is always updated, always secure. You don't have to worry about that. You can  automatically import, sync and publish to and from social media with a few clicks. Automatically pull  photos from Instagram right onto your site, for instance, or instantly sync pages and galleries  to Facebook. Auto-publish your new blog entries right to Twitter. Let people know.

A beautiful design, great functionality and servers that just never go down. Try it free for two weeks.  You don't need a credit card. Just go to squarespace.com. But if you decide you want to buy,  and I wouldn't blame you if you did, look at the pricing. The basic plan, $8 a month when you buy  an annual plan. But I think you're going to want to look at the unlimited plan. Now $16 a month when  you buy a year, look what you get. Unlimited pages, galleries and blogs. Great for a photographer,  a designer. You can have galleries for every client, for instance. Unlimited bandwidth.  You get slash dotted. Don't worry about it. You're on Hacker News. No problem. We mentioned you on  Twitter. You're not going to get a bandwidth, Bill. You've got unlimited bandwidth, unlimited  storage, unlimited contributors. And when you buy an annual plan, they'll automatically register  a new domain name for you and hook it up to the system for free. Squarespace.com. If you decide to  buy 10% off your first purchase on new accounts, monthly or annual, although the annual plan gets  you better savings, when you use our offer code TWIG2, T-W-I-G and the number two, squarespace.com.  I think it was the Times, Nick Bilton writing in the Times, it said it first,  the Wall Street Journal immediately piled on. But Bloomberg has a lot more information,  including they named some names of executives involved in this new iWatch initiative. And they  say Apple has a hundred employees working on it. This is more than a prototype, it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Nick Bilton went off about, it was frankly a bit of an odd tangent about how Google is getting  close to our eyes. And that's more problematic than being on our wrist. He was a little too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  psychoanalyzing the world. They're just different things. Both of them seem like solutions for a  problem that doesn't really exist, but maybe that's just because I'm not hip and with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're very, very different, I think, just because you happen to wear them.  The Google Glass is going to do a couple things, right? One is it can record anything in your  vision and two is it delivers information. Yeah, the watch doesn't do that, obviously.  Right. The watch, it'll give you sound and all kinds of stuff. The watch, it becomes another piece  of access to your computer. But to me, where this really goes, I think, is that the watch in the long  run should be your computer and everything else communicates with it. That's what Apple, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at least that's what Nick said. Apple is thinking of it as a digital hub, not a peripheral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, right. That's the key. So that you are always carrying your computer with you. You're wearing  your computer. Wow. That makes sense to me. And then everything else is peripheral, right? Every  screen, every keyboard, everything else goes peripheral. That makes sense to me as a model.  I'm not sure that's where Apple's really going. I don't know. But I don't know that Apple yet  wants to put the entire computer onto your wrist because that reduces a lot of value. But if  anybody's going to disrupt themselves, it's Apple. So who knows? Mary Meeker calls it always on. She

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  says, how many of you will be wearing a wearable in five years? Is that the next big thing, wearables?  Or is this just grasping on the part of Google and Apple trying to find the next big thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't wait to see you wearing five computers, Leo. You'll be wearing them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny. I love the idea of carrying a computer in my pocket with my smartphone.  And I think that we've all embraced that. Always connected, always on is really powerful. Always  having access to the internet is really powerful. I don't know if a watch or glasses. I'm not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  convinced. What do you guys think? There's going to be different use cases, right? I mean, there's  going to be people for whom it works and people that it won't work for. For the really small  wearables, what I always worry about is batteries, right? Because as these things get smaller,  if you are going to migrate more of the capability, especially the radio, you know,  anything other than short range like Bluetooth, the battery requirements go up and up. So you  don't want to end up with a big bulky thing on your wrist. So a lot of this is kind of waiting for  technology and battery technology to catch up with what could otherwise be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've been telling that story for years. Battery technology is basically stuck 20 years ago.  Including in Boeing jets and Tesla. Apparently, exploding lithium ions and frozen lithium ions  What about, I mean, is somebody working on kinetic energy as a way of keeping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw Nicholas Neckerponte today. There's a lot of really good videos up at solve for x.com for  Google solve for x. Yeah. And Nicholas Nick Nick Nick said, you know, he said, no reason I couldn't  be on the phone and say, oh, wait, hold on a second. I ran out of power. Shake. You were saying  he said you could do that right now. Why is anybody doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you have to shake really hard for longer than that.  But I presume that we could get better at that. Body heat.  My current mechanical wristwatch never has to be wound as long as I wear it. When I'm walking  around, there's enough kinetic energy to keep it going. That's been around that. That technology is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ancient. I also love the requirements are going to change because as you have a denser, denser radio  grid, the amount of power you need to communicate with it is going to go down too. So the  infrastructure affects what your requirements are also, but that's not going to happen instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So do you buy it? Is Apple actually putting 100 people on the job? Are we going to see a Tim  Cook keynote in six months? And now we bring you the iWatch. We haven't seen anything really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  shocking new in a while from Apple or for that matter the Android world. I think it's time for  everybody to shock us in the next couple of months. I got a shock for you. Eric Schmidt

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  selling 42% of his stock. Larry and Sergey just facepalmed. It's an all-time high. Market cap of  $255 billion. Shares hitting $775. And Eric Schmidt says, I'm going to sell about 3.2 million shares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you think? I mean, you know, there's one there's gossip online as to whether or not  the divorce is involved, but I think he's going to invest in something or go philanthropic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. It's worth about $2.5 billion. He still has another $2.5 billion.  He still has another. Yeah. Yeah. He sold last shares were sold a year ago.  You got a billion and a half out of that. See, Kevin. Can you hear me? No, I can't hear you.  We fixed it. We had we had pushed a button. Sorry about that, Kevin. Okay. That's good. I've never  had a guest do that. He was holding up a smartphone. You do like SwiftKey. Only Kevin Mossby. What  program was that? That was good. He programmed the whole thing while you were waiting. He wrote some

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Java code. It's an ancient ugly, ugly ass app I've got called called Flash It, which is designed for  communicating with people in bars. So most of the most of the default messages like beer,  dance, hey baby, you can customize them. Flash it. Flash it. Dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to get that. That's an Android app worth keeping. Yes, we can hear you now. I'm wasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one of the pre-canned responses. This is very tuned to a certain demographic,  but I found it useful every now and then. I'm wasted. Wow. What's it called? It's called  Flash It. I'm getting it. There's probably so many has probably written a better one since I've had

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this about three years. Hey, it does everything you need, including asking us if we can hear you.  So what did you want to say? I've forgotten now. What were you talking about? There was something  we were talking about Schmidt selling his stock, but we could go past that to the watch. The

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wearables. Yeah, wearables. Yeah. So the challenge of digital hub is something that that was an  Apple strategy from a while ago, which was the presumption was you have all these gadgets and  the Mac was the place where you made sense of them. Right. And the problem they even used the phrase  digital hub as I remember. Yeah, there was in Steve Kino, it's everything. And that was the  presumption was you would like one place to manage all these gadgets from. And that was when iTunes  would actually work with everything. It wouldn't just work with Apple devices. You could use it  with any phone, any MP3 player and so on. And that constrained them a bit too long. And they were  stuck with this iTunes at the center of everything thing to the point where people got cross with it  because you had to plug your iPhone into iTunes to actually move things around. And they realized  that doing that for the world was better eventually after Google sort of showed them that  you might want to do this. But they're still wrestling with the iCloud as the center of things.  And I think what we're what we're moving towards is not I have this thing on my wrist that is my  universe. But I have this thing on my wrist, which is one copy of the stuff that matters to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But actually, things are just your identity. Kevin, is it just your identity? What you're saying is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you don't need a process. You didn't process as much. Right. You don't need to have also  you don't need a data store there. You don't actually want your entire data store to be  something on your wrist that you can fall into a swimming pool and lose. You know, there's that.  So the problem is the same problem as like phone as as as second factor ID,  which is, oh, we'll send you a message to your phone to confirm that that's what you meant on  your computer. Well, that works until you drop the phone in the toilet or it works until you're  confirming purchase on your phone and you need to buy a new phone. You know, there's there's  there's structural problems with it. And actually, people lose their phones a hell of a lot more  than than you would think, given that people are using them as a second factor of authentication.  But I think what it comes to is you once you've got, you know, there's there's like zero one many  thing going on here. And we're going we're doing from the one to the many part where  and Google has this with Chrome and with Gmail, lots of the things.  If I get a notification from Gmail and I read it, it's marked red on every other Google device I  have. If I get a notification from Twitter, then I go to any one of my other devices. I've still got  that notification from Twitter because they're not actually having a shared red flag between them.  If I if I if I browse to something in Chrome, any other browser that any other Chrome browser  I'm using on any machine will have that history and I can click through to it.  Whereas if I'm on iOS, every every app has its own browser history in it.  If I if I click through a link on Twitter on the iPad, it's in the Twitter browser history. It's  not in the main browser history and it's not in the Facebook browser history. And it's not in the  force of the browser history. It's in that it's you have to remember how I got there to find that  same thing again. So I think there's that is the tension that's that's that's being going on here.  And it's it's kind of the pocket versus the cloud. But it's it's making sense of both of those things  at once. And that's that's the sort of affordance we're working towards with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is the screen big enough so you could show it across a bar  on the iWatch? That's what I want to know.  To do the I have downloaded, you know, it turns out there's three of I'm sorry,  you were saying something really deep and profound, but I'm busy playing with Flash.  It there's love there's bar. There's three different flash. It's oh, they're on now.  Oh, they've got a whole ecosystem. There's a whole flash ecosystem. There's love flash it,  bar flash it. And then what's the third one? Oh, podcast flash it. No, I don't know. I can't  find the other one. But anyway, this is Christian flash. It there's Christian flash. Is there really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Jesus loves you. Amen. Luke Luke 719. There was something about the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  having data on your on your wrist, having all your data on the wrist that I think is important  here, which is we say, yeah, you don't want to lose all your data if you drop your your wristwatch  into the toilet, obviously. But we do that all the time. I mean, people do that all the time.  Yeah. But the other reason you don't necessarily want to have a little kid on your wrist is the  way laws have been going. At least here in the US police can just take it. They can just, you know,  sometimes without a warrant, they just take take the thing off your wrist. And if all your data is  there, they can you think you've got encryption on it, but it's probably weak encryption. They  can just dump it all. If it's in the cloud. The laws are not optimum. And there's problems with  those two. But it makes it more complicated for them than just to be able to take, you know,  if you have your whole life's worth of data right there on your body that they can just physically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  grab. So that's something to keep in mind. I do think, Lauren, we have demonstrated effectively,  though, that nobody really cares anymore about privacy or any of this stuff. And we're just all  full speed ahead. Give me the convenience. And I'm going to put it on my wrist. And I don't care.  The day will come at some point, I guess, when we put stuff in safes and say, our data is locked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it really comes to a matter of legal rights. You got CISPA coming back after sopa pipa.  And we have the fear it's got to be on level of principles to say that you're you have privacy,  you have in your data and in your email. And I keep on saying government keeps acting like it's  the protector of privacy. It is the worst threat to privacy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's the same thing going on in the EU. I mean, you constantly have governments that  are saying, well, they, you know, for example, you have the EU that went through this whole rigmarole  for cookies, right? They had all their sites with these big banners saying, you know, do you accept  our cookie policy? And now that's all falling apart because in the process of doing that,  they broke so many sites. But these same governments at the same time are pushing all these  government data retention systems and tapping of communications and all the rest now. So they're  very hypocritical. So like Jeff is saying, you know, if you're believing that government is going  to protect your privacy rights or other rights in this context, you're going down the garden  path because they're the first ones that are going to be going after it. Speaking of Fox News

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  headlines. Have you read the story doctor's new novel Homeland yet? No, I got it on my desk. Is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it good? Yes, it's very good. It's the sequel to a little brother. Yes. Yeah, that's great. But it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  covers a lot of these like cyber security things and people surveilling you and quadcopters and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the cops and it's well done. When Dick Cheney says I approve of President Obama's drone program,  then we know we got problems. If you ask me. Chimney Christmas. Here's the here's the yeah,  I just got this. We got to but now is this a young adult or yeah, because little brother was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for young. It's just a little brother. It's the same characters. It's it's it's set in San Francisco  and Burning Man and it's you know, it's it's sort of explaining the nerd world of San Francisco to  young kids across America, which is a great thing to do. It's the 60s all over. I just bought the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wrong flash. September. That's lousy. It's flash cards. I'm wearing French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's boring. Flash it a dollar. Nine cents. Yeah, no, these are all free. These are all free.  Well, I learned that. Yeah. What does this mean? Does this mean something?  Yeah, it means I love that means that means I love you. Yeah, I forget how you get there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it's a Howard Stern. I know I learned from Howard Stern show.  It's probably dirty. No, it's it's like it's the whatever the letters of the alphabet or I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know what it is. That's another thing from the Howard Stern show. You are sexy. No, I don't.  Is it? These are fun. These are good. Another another Fox News headline. Google is building  its own airport. Actually, this is one of those classic news journalism headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have their own airport already. They got the they got the NASA runway. Yeah, that's basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it. So down to San Jose. It's different. Close to it's going to be flying over you, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an eighty two million dollar facility in San Jose. Well, there's some in San Jose.  So they're going to have like a terminal at San Jose Airport. Well, no, it's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a private aviation. They're upgrading. Others will be able to use it to between the three of them,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  between Larry, Sergey and Eric. They have eight jets, eight jets, and that doesn't include  Google's corporate fleet. That's their personal property. What are the let Marissa use it?  The problem is that that there's been some other side of NASA. Well, they were using NASA Ames or  Moffitt Field, I guess. And they and they're and they're and they know, Congressman Grassley  and others have said, yeah, you know, they're only paying three point seven million a year.  This isn't right. So Google says, all right, fine, fine, fine. We're going to build.  We're going to build our own.  Twenty nine acres, each private plane would be a property tax generator, says San Jose Mayor Chuck  Reed. The proposed Google port. Will include its own executive terminal, multiple multiple hangars,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ramp space, aircraft parking lot, retail shops. So you're building Terminal D at the terminal G,  I suppose. It sounds like it's like building a new terminal. I like San Jose Airport. I live in San  Jose. I get there quickly. But also is this like little airport? So you go through the terminal.  The terminal is like 30 meters deep or something. You go in, you go out the other side, you go out  on the runway and you walk up a staircase to it to a plane. It feels like you're you're you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  back in the age. It's the old joke that you have one gate, but you change the sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually quite a nice airport now. Did anybody watch President Obama's fireside

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hangout? Man, this is like tomorrow. So it's tomorrow. Today, today, Leo, big, big interns,  the internship. And I put I put it on the bottom of the. Has Howard Stern done that? An intern hangout?  That's a different kind. Well, the great thing was they revealed the intern trailer  on Google Plus today and then tomorrow as a following act, the president doesn't hang out.  I put the link to the trailer on it is Google related on the rundown. Google's got to love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I mean, is this good for them? Well, they did already, right? Yeah, he's not.  You know, he's not the first one. He did another. He did one earlier. Yeah,  he did it Facebook, too. Mark Mark. Yeah, but I don't know. You know, OK, let's look at the  intern. Oh, here's the direct link on YouTube. The internship. This is what? To be an intern  at the at the White House? I don't know. Google. Oh, Google. Oh, this is the movie.  With Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. Oh, OK, let's skip the today. The ad. I love it. How they put

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ads on ads now. Yes. Well, it was so meta because they did a hangout saying they were going to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the hangout. So this was the movie that they shot at the Googleplex. This course and not get psyched  out of your mind. But they're adults that have the Chrono Shock 13. They didn't tell you that your

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  company is closed. You closed the company. Everything's computer. John Goodman. People

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have a deep mystery. You know, this is ironic. They're trying to sell a wristwatch.  And the company went out of business because everything's computerized now. Hey, Hollywood knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or two or three or four. This summer. Google. Google. Google. Google. Not a job job. It's an  interview for an internship that could lead to a job. Nick, this might be the last chance that we got.  You got to come in closer. We won't be able to see you. They're doing a hangout. We can see you guys.  Okay, good. You got it. Hi, my name is Billy. We can hear you fine as well. Oh, great. Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Welcome to Google. This will not be your average internship. We're looking at some sort of mental

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hunger games against a bunch of genius kids for just like a handful of jobs. That's a sharpie,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by the way, genius. That's my fault. This looks awful. Yeah. Normally just putting the fist out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  without the words is all that's necessary. Come on, bro. Fist me. Get up in there. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's definitely not right. This is terrible. Yeah. You're so old, though. I thought you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  important. Sometimes the long shots pay off the biggest. Our team's a joke. You guys got to start  believing. This reminds me of a little girl from a steel town who had the dream to dance. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not going to ever go see this movie. This looks like the worst thing I've ever seen in my life.  I think we're required to have one of those hats. Do you have the Google beanie? It's a nougat hat,  right? I want to go there and work for one day so I can get one. Yeah, I'd love to have a nougat  hat. Does it say? It says nougat on it, right? It does, yes. And they made even you an adult wear it?  You want to. You're glad to. Google is based on going to Stanford. That's what it's like. It has

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a U.S. university feel to it because that's all that the founders know. Well, Google is based on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the fact that it's partly to attract college-age kids to make them feel at home. So this was part

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of the, you know, when I was recruited to Google, there was that, you know, it's like, hi, do you  realize how old I am? So I kind of get some of that joke because their recruiting process was  then tuned for people who were coming out of university with a community science degree. And  you're saying, well, I have been doing this for 20 years. No, I don't know if I can persist.  And I've had friends who were called in for an interview and were like, really? You're making  me do this? Did you have to solve a Rubik's Cube? I did not have to. No, but they say, you know,  here's some writing code on the whiteboard and do this. They've tuned the process a bit since then,  so they're actually able to recruit people who have done stuff before. But there's fairly well  documented stuff of this going wrong previously. So I can see the joke and I can see that the  Googlers would get the joke and find it amusing too. But it's also, you know, every time your  culture gets focused on by mass media, you realize, wow, they got that really wrong, but they must be  getting everything else right. You know, this is the running joke with mass media is that they  trivialize everything. So it doesn't, you know, I'm over that. There was all this outcry about  Bravo startup Silicon Valley. That was horrible. It was horrible. But if it gets somebody somewhere  else to consider a career in tech, I'm happy with that. So you think this is a good advertisement  for a tech, for STEM? I take it as a marker that this weird shit we've been doing for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is now becoming mainstream. It's mainstream. It is mainstream. Otherwise you wouldn't have it.  And, you know, and you know, it's not funny. It would be nice if it were a better script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That, yeah. But that's, you know, this was the frustrating thing. That was the thing that  frustrated me about the social network movie. I mean, that was a market for it going mainstream,  but it was also such a, you know, weird macho bro bullsh** movie that, you know, all the women were  hookers or- Oh, the social network. Yeah. It's horrible. Yeah. There was,  but that was a framing narrative for the, you know, a couple of years worth of people who  will come to San Francisco to do startups. So I like startup Silicon Valley as counterbalance  to that because it means we may actually get some women who are interested in fashion coming in  and trying to do startups because that's the demographic that Bravo appeals to. And they  found people who would fit in with the Bravo worldview. I'm not necessarily saying it was a  great success or a great representation of Silicon Valley, but it's encouraging to see  different narratives around technology and technology going to the mainstream thing.  The show that's actually good at this is The Good Wife. I hear that's very good.  Very sharp script team there. They actually pick on real issues. And because it's a courtroom drama,  they can have extended discussions of it. So that's structurally, that one's quite good.  But that was the, so one of the things I was at this week was the patent office round table  at Stanford yesterday where the patent and trade back offices came here to say, okay,  we hear that some of you are not that happy with software patents. Do you want to come and  talk about this? And that was interesting to me in that I think they're feeling mainstream cultural  pressure because This American Life did an episode on how bad patents are. It's become a sort of  a trope in the TV series of the law firm TV series. There's a bunch of them.  I hope that's the case. I hope you're right. Patent lawsuits are aware of ripping people off.  I think there was a Good Wife episode and I think there might have been one in suits as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People are becoming aware of it. Here's a link to a request for comments and notice of round table  events for partnership for enhancement of quality of software related pads. Let's just get rid of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  them. Yeah, don't improve them. Right. Kill them. Get rid of them. But that's, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the interesting thing was that the people who were speaking were,  most of them were lawyers, but it was a mixture of, this was yesterday, very, very nerdy people  speaking as well. They had EFF people. They had the Developers Alliance guy who was really good,  who basically said, he stood up, this was organized after the Lotsis patent went after all the iOS  developers. And he said, when I represent these people who are building applications,  and their view of patents is entirely negative. And if you can't reach those people, you're  clearly doing it wrong. And then, you know, then another guy stood up and said, from my point of  view, as developers, a patent is the last place we go and look for, for technology. We have plenty  of places to look for, for I want to build something and has someone done this before,  and the patent offices is absolutely not on our radar. So clearly, you're not fulfilling the  purpose you were set up for, which was to disseminate technology. So that was fairly hard  truths for the bad people. And then the EFF stood up. Judy Samuels, who's great, she's now the  Cuban chair of getting rid of stupid patents. And that's the actual title, by the way.  She's got business cards with that on her Instagram yesterday. So that,  she stood up and said, if you're going to get a software patent, you need to put code in your  patent. And then we can have a discussion about whether that's patentable or not. But as long as  it's big, fluffy ideas, and then some random example, and then you sue people on the basis  of the idea, you're doing it wrong. And the patent office is doing it wrong to allow that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But do they understand what a huge cost this is to, it's a tax on innovation, it makes  small business people reluctant to do things, make people keep people out of the technology  business as entrepreneurs just because the risk is so high, it's inevitable that you will get sued

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  by somebody. They're starting to get that. That was that was the there's another one of these  roundtables in New York on the 27th, I think it's on that page. And they're also asking for written  submissions. So there's the link there to say, email us and tell us what you what you know,  what you saw. So I'd encourage everyone watching twig to contact the patent office and explain  why this is a bad idea. Because, you know, their problem is that their public servants, they don't  want to destroy the economy, they've just, you know, done it by accident, they're trying to work  out how to fix this. They don't necessarily have the ability to change the law or the stroke like  Congress does. But they want to understand what they've been doing wrong. And if you can have if  you can give them evidence of that and explain that to them, that will help them change their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  procedures. I'll be glad to it might be too late for us, but I'll be glad. One of the things here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is that, let's face it, techies traditionally have not really been interested in participating in the  legal side of this and the political side of this. So by default, we've handed right, all of the all  of the all the marbles to the side that has traditionally controlled this area. So until we  have people wandering around in the halls of Congress grabbing people by the lapel and saying,  hey, this is our side of this, this is what we would expect to have happen. Now that's that's  gradually starting to change. But up until now, it's been it's been so lopsided and so skewed that  it's completely understandable how we've ended up with patents being just just an enormous disaster  for for software and also in method method pathet business method patents also are a similar kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  problem. Right. And but the sort of from my point of view is I went back and looked at this, the  history of patents is patents were came out of a law that was passed by King James, King James,  the the first of England, who have King James Bible fame, his parliament passed a law abolishing  monopolies because M.D. 8th and Elizabeth and him had been issuing too many of them to their friends,  and they wanted to stop this happening. But they wrote a loophole, which is well, if you've actually  invented something, you can have a monopoly for 14 years, as long as it doesn't disturb trade too  much. You know, they they they had some well written clauses around it because they realized  this was a problem. And they've written a law to abolish monopolies. And some, you know, at some  point, somebody said, but they could, you know, there's some good to this and patents grow out of  that loophole. And each time, you know, over time, people that monopoly keeps growing again, you need  to have one of these monopolies to throw them away. And we had that with the show.  Yeah. But if you actually look at it, these things grow up and they they actually expand  when companies are in decline, because they start looking for ways to fight other people off. They  start looking at the world as a zero sum game rather than the growth game in the growth game.  You don't need the patent because things are going so well. You're busy selling things to people and  making more. But once you come to this point where, oh, wait a minute, we need to stop other people  catching up with us when you're on the other end of the intervention, that's when you start  finding patents. That's why IBM and Kodak have all the patents. But of course, if you're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you're going to get these occasional adjustments, you know, to bring the patent system  back into line with something a little closer to what the original idea was, you have to have a  functioning political system to start with. And, you know, what we can't even agree on basic issues  in Congress right now, trying to push things that involve highly technical areas and patents and  things is going to be a really tough pull. Because you can't get anyone's attention and you need a  lot of money just to get in front of their faces. So, you know, I'm not going to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the thing for me is that we have built alternative structures. So the goal of the  patent system as after the monopoly thing was done, the US version of this was, well, this is  to get you to disclose your invention so that after you've had your own limited monopoly,  other people can use it too. Well, guess what, we fixed that. In the software field, we have GitHub,  we have the IATF, the W3C, we have all these standards bodies that publish how to do stuff,  and you can search that and find it. So if you're going to start a project now, the first thing you  do is not I will write some code from scratch, it's I will go and Google some keywords and see  what code exists. I'll go and search GitHub and see how much I can build out of existing things.  So if I want to set up something, I will go and find some infrastructure and reuse that  and build on all that stuff. And then at some point it's like, okay, now the bit that I wanted  to do was this clever thing combined these two things, I don't have to build it all from scratch.  So we have a beautiful functioning system that shares inventions independently between companies.  If you want a concrete example, just look at the web on your phone. If you're doing that,  you're running WebKit to a first approximation unless you work for Microsoft and have a  Microsoft phone. And you are running software that was started by Apple, is now contributed by Google,  by Nokia, by everyone who's building phones, even Opera today just picked up WebKit. You have an  open source project that all these companies who are suing each other and fighting competing in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  market are actually cooperating on. So can we go to Lauren's point? So we get the sense of this,  even if you convince the patent office people of this, it's still going to come down to  courts and legislation and that's where the big money is still going to come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right? Is there any hope of changing this? The fact that you're using shared code or something  doesn't mean you're not going to get sued. All you may be doing in some cases is buying your way into  being sued along with the people that wrote the source code you're now using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So the point is, so yeah, when I had a patent lawsuit in 1991, this was kind of hard to say,  but there's a better way of doing this. It is no longer hard to say that. We have this massive  existence, proof is that we have a better way of doing this knowledge sharing because this is how  we actually run the computer business now. The guy from the Business Software Alliance stood up and  gave his sort of, yes, patent's a wonderful speech and he had a little slide up that was a grid of  logos. And I looked at the logos and it was like, do you realize that none of the companies in the  Business Software Alliance were founded this century? It was this sort of iconic example of  this is a thing that big old companies defend off competition, whereas the smart new companies  aren't doing this. The thing is that those are the companies that have a fair bit of money and they  can lobby now and they can explain this. But also culturally we can explain this narrative because  and when you say to something, so that phone you're using, do you realize that that's an open  source operating system? That's an open source browser. That is something that,  this is now the infrastructure of what we use every day. It is no longer this corner thing that  was Linux, which was only used on servers and you said, oh yeah, you're using open source when you  use Google. But you can now say you're using open source when you use Android, you're using open  source when you use your iPad, you're using open source with pretty much everything you touch now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think the trolls really care. I mean when you're talking about some of the big companies,  I don't care about the trolls. But the trolls don't care. They don't, they don't, they just go after

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everybody and they'll get enough out of it. So we need to stop enabling the trolls. The problem is  that the way the panel system is set up at the moment, because the cost of litigation is so high,  you can get a BS patent and then go and threaten people without even filing lawsuits and extort

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  money from them because the cost is so high. We're looking at one and a half to three million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So for the troll, they don't want to go to court either, but they're a bunch of lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lawyers are cheap at the moment. Well, it's also cheap for them to file multiple lawsuits because  the rough, you know, when they file one or 50, it's roughly the same cost. So what they do is they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  file massive numbers of lawsuits. So what we need is the courts to, I mean the first step is, and  we've seen a few cases of this where the courts have set called BS. Yes. We're starting to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that. But the first thing we need is the culture understanding, the realization that this is going  on and its exploitation. So that's where the media staff, It's American Life, you know, staff on TV,  when that is the narrative, that's good. You know, like then you need to have court decisions and  then you need to say, okay, patent office, you can do these things with regulations. Congress,  you can do these things by passing new laws. It will make you popular. Remember that super thing?  All those people would love you if you did this. You know, we can make this stuff happen, but it  is this political thing of explaining that the consensus has changed and making that clear to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people. So that is assuming a level of rationality, you know, in the way Congress addresses technology  issues. And I'm not sure that's really a good bet. It's emotionality. It's not necessarily

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  rational. It's them understanding that they look bad when they do this. Politicians are good at  that. That's why they get elected. They're good at understanding when people... I love Kevin's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  optimism today. He also said that the Bravo series was going to bring more women into programming.  Give me those glasses he's wearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you're out in the sun. There is one happy story and that's the New Egg story. They  were sued for the shopping cart patent. And by the way, this company that sued had already  received quite a bit of money from other companies, including Amazon, Home Depot,  Nordstrom, Macy's, Radio Shack, Kohl's. New Egg decided they were going to fight and they won.  But I don't know if they would ever recover their costs of fighting either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so we had the same thing with Eolus. So the Eolus patent was a patent on browser plugins.  Yeah, terrible, terrible patent. And Microsoft paid them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep. It was cheaper to pay them off regardless of the merit of the patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then last year, halfway through last year, somebody fought it. Tim Berners-Lee went out to  Texas and stood up in court and said this thing was completely obvious at the time they filed the  patent because of these other six things. And the jury decided. So the other half of this is  explaining to the people of Texas that they are being used by these companies to rip people off.  And that may involve going to Texas to testify and filing some death cases.  And but also applying the media pressure that, you know, Texas is being messed with or something.  I'm not an expert on Texas psychology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are mostly in East Texas, these lawsuits. And a lot of these patent trolls have  dummy offices in Beaumont, Texas. You know, just doors with signs on them, nobody behind it.  And the reason I've been told is there are a number of reasons. But one is because they fast  track these lawsuits. But the other is because juries seem to be very pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, there's a classic narrative, which is little guy against big corporation. And  if you're doing a patent troll lawsuit, that's what you say. You know, there was a, even the  Wall Street Journal wrote a thing about this this week. And it said something like, IBM and small  business, small companies are against big companies like Microsoft and Google on this. And it's like,  no, those aren't small companies. IBM, small company.  IBM is because they have a big hoard of patents, they don't care. But also it was like, and these  small businesses, they're not small businesses, they are they are shell companies set up by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  lawyers to exploit these loopholes. They're not businesses at all, except in the sense that they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  make money. So it's you know, it's constructing the counter narrative that isn't small inventor  against large company, but exploitative lawyers ripping off businesses, which is, you know,  it's the same narrative, just a question of who's the hero and who's the villain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Did you see the Wi Fi one today? Speaking of trolls? No.  The I guess it was Cisco was was trying to get the Rico against a troll that's been suing hotels  and motels for providing Wi Fi. Rico's the racketeering. By the way, the racketeering.  Yeah. And the idea the idea was and what they've been doing is it's kind of different than than  a lot of trolls do. They're going for very small payouts comparatively, like four or five thousand  dollars per site. But they're going after many, many, many sites. And the idea was that they could  go after them, you know, using Rico and maybe that'd be a good way to stop it. And I guess a  judge just failed yesterday threw that out. Yeah. Said you can't you can't use Rico now that the  case moves forward. But it just goes to show when they asked the trolls about this and said, well,  why are you are you going to go after homeowners using Wi Fi? Their response was not yet.  So so there's there's a whole world, a whole universe of ways for these guys to go forward  unless there's fundamental change. And I don't really see how you get the fundamental change  given the kind of structure we have now. I mean, it's nice to say, yeah, if there's if this is  becomes part of popular culture and it's on TV and such, that's going to influence congressmen.  But but when you come right down to it, they're more more influenced by who has the most money  at any given moment to give to their campaign. But there is a counter narrative, which is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is that when you know, the intermittent windshield wiper narrative where big company  steals idea from little guy and gets away with it, little guy sues and wins. And that is the  counter narrative, which is still quite successful. In fact, I'm looking at an article about the judge  siding with the Wi Fi patent troll over Cisco. The first comment is big invention stealing  companies have done a very good job of spreading the troll myth in order to cover the fact they're  stealing on a grand scale. There is that belief that that's what's going on. And that motivates

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cisco now. This is this is where Lord, you might have some hope that when the big companies start  getting hurt, and they do have the money, and they go in and say enough of this, we've got to  change the law that when those interests become aligned with with open innovators and big companies  to go together to Congress, that's when you might get something. Yeah. And I think that's why the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  new thing was so encouraging. Also, they went after that very basic patent, even though they knew  most likely they'd never recoup their costs. But they said, you know, hell, we're going to do it  anyway. If we saw more of that from companies that had the resources and the gravitas to do it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we might actually get somewhere. Meanwhile, a lot of smaller businesses like ours will be put out of  business in the interim. We were wrong. We were talking about the Chromebook pixel. Remember that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  last week? Now now now another report. Is it real or not? I don't know. Another report came and said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that there was some documentation found somewhere. I don't know. I think the video was made by a  company called Slinky.me. If had I known, I might have I might have been less likely to play it.  I don't know. I still want one. It was the idea was it was a touchscreen Chromebook with Retina

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  plus resolution. It's the touchscreen bit that's got that makes me suspicious because that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  isn't there on Chrome. Yeah. Just because you make the point being just because you made a video on  YouTube doesn't make it true. We're going to take a break. We're going to get a tool, a tip, a number.  And Lauren, if you want to give us maybe a suggestion for something people should  think about, know about, you know, just a tip. We'll do that after the break.  But first a little word from LegalZoom.com. Not a law firm. LegalZoom is a self-provide,  self-help services to get you the legal documents you need for your business or your family. LLC.  This, you know, you don't need to go get a big law firm to do an LLC or a trademark or a patent  for that matter. A lot of this you can just do by yourself step by step at the LegalZoom website.  Should you feel like you want to, you got a question, you want to know more. They also even  have an extensive network of attorneys. They call it the LegalZoom legal plan in most states. And  online, you can search online profiles and unedited customer reviews so you can really get a sense of,  you know, is this somebody I want to ask a question? The fees are set. And LegalZoom is very  affordable. Ninety-nine dollars to form a business or an LLC, incorporate. Sixty-nine dollars to do  a will or a living trust. And if you've got a blog, you know, you really ought to think about  trademarking your blog name, protecting yourself. It's easy and effective and simple. LegalZoom.com.  And we want you to use the offer code TWIG so that they know that you heard about it on this  week in Google. And as a way of thanking you, we'll give you ten dollars off your visit if you use  the offer code TWIG when you sign up for some legal services at LegalZoom.com.  Kevin wrote, Kevin Marks just jumped up and the table fell over. I need, I need a  special message here for Kevin. Let's see. Let's try that. Can he, oh, his umbrella fell over,  it looks like. Wow. One four three, Kevin. One four three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Sorry, the sun would move so I was moving my umbrella. That's quite all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you for supporting the show LegalZoom.com. For more information, LegalZoom.com. And if you  decide to buy ten dollars off when you use the offer code this week in Google, TWIG actually is  all you need. Normally, Gina Trapani would give us a tip, but you've already given us a tool,  Kevin Marks. I can't thank you enough. Flash it, the bar, the love. And then there's a third one,  which I can't remember. Didn't download it, I guess. Any other thing else you'd like to mention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A tool, a tip, an idea? There's an idea that I just stuck in the chat room, which is,  it goes along with the WebRTC thing. It's like suddenly the browser is getting control to do  interesting things. And it's a technology proof, which is you click on this thing,  it turns on your camera, it sees how far away your eyes are, and it makes the text bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it would be far too much trouble to hit command plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See how old my eyes are and thus make the text. All right. So here we go. So this is a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do it on your Chromebook. Oh, well, if I did it in Chrome, would that be good enough?  Chrome would work here. All right. So I don't have a Chromebook, but I have a computer.  Let me load Chrome here. Yeah. And then it says, oh, I can see your eyes. Oh, look, see, it sees  chat and it's making it much bigger because... If you leave it... Whoa! If you leave it, it gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  smaller. That is pretty funny. So the thing is, you know, it's kind of a joke, but this is actually  an important problem. So this comes down to the problem of design for phones and tablets,  which is that the CSS pixel is designed to be an angular measure of... With an assumption that the  screen is 28 inches away from you because it was designed... The spec was written when we were  using laptops. Right. The thing is, I've now got something like this, which I normally hold here  because I've got a good near point. And for that, I can read quite small type on that. This works  really well. Whereas I've got an iPad, which I hold a bit further away. And if your eyesight's  going, one of the advantages of the iPad is you're holding it at that length that you read a  newspaper. And that was... So I was beating on Apple for having just two sizes before, but that  was because they'd sort of hit these two sweet spots, which is I'm either holding something here  and glancing at it, or I'm holding it here and I'm reading it. But what you really want is this. And  they all have cameras in. You could do this. You could build this into the browser such that,  oh, I'm reading this here. I'm glancing at it from a distance. Give me the big version.  I'm looking over there. Give me that. Oh, I'm looking at the TV screen. I'm 15 feet away from  it. Make the type really big, please. That is actually a useful use case. And it's about using  a bit of insight from the machine to understand what you're trying to do. So this is a precursor  of how this stuff is likely to go. And it comes in with the wearableness. And it'll be true for the...  I've got a little tiny screen here. It'll better make the type right for me looking at it  at an infinity. And it's not going to work for me. But it can't recognize your face when it's on your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the only problem. Some of Samsung's phones start to do that. They at least look for face  detection. And then if you're looking at the phone, they don't turn the screen off, things like that.  So we're almost there. We're getting to that point. I like this idea. You don't want it to  do too much because you don't want the size of the font. No, no. I mean, it's more of an example of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you don't actually want it swishing around all the time. But you could do it at the point when  you open the page and you're running your queries as like, okay, how big is this screen and what's  going on? And doing it at that point will be useful. So you can just get some sense of which  domain you're in. And if you actually look at when you build responsive sites now, you have break  points. You say it's either this wide or it's this wide or it's this wide. But you're doing it on  width. You're not doing it on... And you've got width and you've got this multiplier, which is  the pixel ratio, which is hidden for you by the browser and is usually quantized to one or two.  Because there's an assumption of you are this far away. In effect, those settings are telling  you how far away to hold the particular screen. Whereas we can actually reverse this and measure  it. So I think that was a cute demo. And the other link that I'm saying you should go to is  eff.org slash patent. Because when we're talking about the software patent stuff, that's a discussion  of this and it has a bunch of calls of action and things you can do there. Please do. It's funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that Mark Cuban is behind this. And then you have on the other side, Nathan Mirvold, the Microsoft  billionaire who's decided... He decided, hey, I'm going to go out and become a patent troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody hypnotized him? I don't know why. This was the same Mark, the same Mark Cuban who had  originally said that P2P should be completely outlawed. Yeah, Cuba is an interesting case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting that he donated money to do this or to fund this seat, this chair. Yeah. And Notch

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  did. Notch of Minecraft. And Notch. Good for Notch. Good argument about why patent trolling is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  EFF.org slash patent. And there's also information there about what you can, how you can get involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I've also bought a site called fixed patents.org, but I haven't actually finished building it yet.  Oh, good. Oh, Kevin. I'm right on. Competing. And the hashtag fixed patents is a good hashtag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fixed patents, please everybody. Lauren, is there anything you'd like to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lauren's blog is lauren.vortex.com. Yeah. Well, I think one thing would be an Android app that I  use constantly now. So there's something that actually be useful that I can impart here. And  that would be, it's called Moon Plus Reader Pro. And that's become my go-to. It's really good. Oh,  I don't know it. Oh, I'm downloading it. Really good. Typical formats like EPUB and FB2 and those.  And the pro version of it has really nice PDF integration in it, very fast. And it uses the same  user interface that the rest of it uses. Now they had a problem recently, which was some company  in Russia, talking about trolls, complained that they claimed that they had a pirate link in them  somewhere in their network library. So they actually got pulled from Google Play briefly.  And they were very upset about that, as we all would be. And, but that's, they came back now,  they're back on. So they're having a 50% sale. So it's like 249 right now. And that's really what  I use. There doesn't a day go by that I'm not using that extensively. And so when you're not  using the Google Play for the books that are in that domain, for everything else that you're using  in terms of eBooks, that's not DRM. I really like the Moon Plus Reader Pro. And they have a free  version too, that saves you the 249. But I'd say support the developers whenever you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Search for Reader Pro, you think? I'm having a hard time finding it with Moon.  Moon Plus. You can't find Moon Plus?  Just Moon P-U-L-P-L-U-S or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Moon, it's Moon Plus sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Moon Plus sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's oddly the Play Store search is not very good. It doesn't do what you mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not finding it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, only because it sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Laura's right, it is very good. I had problems doing an EPUB and I went through about 10 different  apps trying to get it to work and finally got that to work and then found that using  PDFs within it is really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should just do it on the web. I keep forgetting I can install from the browser and it's much  easier than trying to do it on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, plus you want to install it on the 25 phones you own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I can install it. I wish there were install on all phones, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish there were two. I also wish there were a function that says when I get a new phone,  just go ahead and move everything from this phone to this.  You can kind of do that.  Can? How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's supposed to do that. I use AppBrain sometimes to do that.  Can't you get a list of the apps you have installed? I think you can somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can't, but you got to do one at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You still have to do one at a time. That stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Titanium, if you're rooted...  Titanium's great, yeah.  If you're rooted, you have more ways to do this. Titanium, if you're rooted, is really good.  You can basically pick up everything and dump it to another phone. That won't always work the way  you might want, but it's a lot better than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll take settings, too, and save games and stuff like that.  That's Titanium Backup Plus. Another great tip.  And I'm downloading Moon Plus Reader Pro.  Our number of the week, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For the week, I got a few. I'm going to start here with BitShare.  Has a nice data viz thing, data never sleeps.  How much happens in one minute on net? But it's a great compilation.  One minute, you know this one, 48 hours of new video on YouTube.  204 million emails sent.  2 million search queries on Google.  648,000 shares on Facebook.  We spend 272,000 on e-commerce.  God knows how much this is real or not, but it's really kind of nice to have a sense of this idea  of... I mentioned earlier in that Wired piece, the idea of the stream versus the library.
