It's Stacey Higginbotham.  Josette.  Josette. Is it French?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay. Stacey Higginbotham at Giga Stacey.  Is it spelled with an H?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cosette?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, cosette. Like COVID. Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Cosette. Cosette.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We cannot play it for you because we don't want the family to take us down.  But we played before the show a cute little video of an English family all singing together doing their version of One Day More rewritten for quarantine.  That was the contribution, the gift of Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  Hello, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got a worm now in all their brains. They won't get that song out of their heads for 24 hours.  It is pretty catchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One Day More.  Oh, God. His special link today on his lower third is his COVID Twitter list.  And it's something we talked about on the show before, but might as well make it easy for everybody to go to bit.ly, B-I-T dot L-Y, slash COVID Twitter list.  And the reason you want that, of course, you have to have a Twitter account, is you want to subscribe to it because he's put together a list of all the most reliable best sources for COVID information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five hundred sixty three epidemiologists, virologists, infectious disease doctors, researchers, NGOs.  And pandas.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was about to do another musical. I was going to be five hundred seventy five thousand six hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did that get there? Oh, it's the, it's the, you know what they're, you know what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the pandas making sweet, sweet love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Sweet, sweet love because they were too shy to do it when people were at the zoo.  This is in Hong Kong.  And now that the people are gone, they are South China Morning Post.  Yeah. Isn't that great?  So that, yeah, somebody obviously retweeted that.  I wish there were a way you could do it in TweetDeck.  I wish there were a way you could turn off retweets in just Twitter in general, because a lot of times the retweeting is just, you know, repetitious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not among the scientists because it because it does.  It is interesting to see what they choose to retweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good point. All right. Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so the scientists are there.  So I've interviewed three of the scientists on my list.  Oh, nice.  Epidemiologist. I've got the link also in the rundown under the coronavirus.  Epidemiologist Greg Consolves from Yale, an infectious diseases expert and Ebola veteran, Krutika Kupali from California and Angela Rasmussen from the School of Public Health at Columbia.  And I'm asking them on behalf of journalists how we should be covering this story, what we're doing wrong.  What do they say?  Well, one thing is that we're doing a very bad job of sourcing the experts.  You know, for example, on NBC, they have they have a good guy who's important to the TV.  They have a good guy who's who's on constantly, but he's a spinal surgeon.  Why are they putting a spinal surgeon on about a viral pandemic?  The New York Times had an influential op-ed that was written by a diet doctor, sugar shill and advisor to the California Walnut Board.  Nothing is anything wrong with California Walnuts, but has nothing to do with the pandemic and is amateurish.  We see armchair epidemiology from columnists all over.  And so they say we're not going to the experts, which is what I wanted to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This comes from that's because the experts are busy.  I mean, as any working journalist will tell you, you go for who reaches out.  They are incredibly generous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've they've spent, you know, they answer my questions.  They've spent time with me and I have no audience.  I say one look how much Anthony Fauci is on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they understand that their expertise is needed in a sea of misinformation.  I think, though, it looks to me like the media, especially televisions, consistent choice of style over substance.  They always want somebody who is good for a sound bite, looks good, speaks quickly.  And a lot of times you get the experts, especially the first time they're on TV, they're hesitant.  Maybe they're scared.  Or the other thing is they ask them the wrong questions.  Well, also, the other problem with experts and I'll say this also is they equivocate because they know there's no it's not a black and white thing.  And on TV, you want somebody to say strong, positive statements, not well, sort of.  It's kind of. But maybe. And then and that's not good TV.  Unfortunately, it's more accurate. What are you going to do?  Yeah, that's why you should probably not get your news from TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As I'm fond of saying about journalists, we in science, we always think the last the latest word is the last word.  Right. Right.  Wine will kill you. Wine will save you one day after the next.  We don't understand the process of science very well.  And we've got to understand things are uncertain.  And but but but I'm finding these experts you're right, Stacey.  They're very busy and I feel reluctant to take a minute away from their time.  But but to a person, they are eager to have the public get the right story.  They're eager to help. They're eager to answer questions, the right questions.  They're not so eager to answer dumb questions. I've also had them come to me asking for help.  I have one coming from one publication. The publication screwed them up.  I happen to know somebody high up there.  I emailed that person that got fixed because they couldn't get it done.  We can be very frustrating us in media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My husband says that to me all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's when you were dressed as a chicken. But it's a long story.  You put this in here, Jeff, and I don't know if this is related.  Scare mongering headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just there was no discussion.  So are you obeying state homeowners? Google is watching.  Now, if they said, are we obeying state homeowners? Fine.  But you it makes it look like Google is watching you individually.  I saw three or four headlines like this on the same story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those headlines do better.  I mean, if you A-B test those people click on the.  I know that is all that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is. But it's irresponsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You always want to put you in a headline because then, you know, but not this particular one because it is Google has done something I think extremely valuable in releasing its data county by county in the U.S.  Worldwide about our our our delta in going to workplaces, transit hubs, stores, parks, something else.  And and it's a very good check on us to say, are we as a as a population practicing social distancing?  But it's not against individuals.  And that's that's why I just I just wanted to wind about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I've won. They're not looking at you specifically, although in some countries.  The government is and I wonder, I mean, it's pretty clear that we're going to probably want to do that here, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I have a story for you all on that, on using peer to peer networks to privacy focused and track to track and trace using Bluetooth on yourself.  So this is an app I wrote about it last week.  It's still not out, which is kind of sad, but it's called Coalition.  It's from Nodal, which is a peer to peer IOT network.  And what it does and there's a lot of caveats here, but this you download this on your phone.  What it's going to do is when you pass other people who also have downloaded the app and who have self selected and said, yes, I have covid-19 or I have been diagnosed with it.  What it will do is it will let you know if you have interacted with someone who has later come up and said I have covid-19.  It'll let you know that you had an exposure to them and it does it in a way that is local to the device.  And it doesn't involve anyone except for you and the various phones that you have passed in time.  So that's an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And do you think it's more private because it's peer to peer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's private because they're not loading the data up to the cloud.  Everything's encrypted and they don't want to know who you are.  They just want to let you know.  Now there are other downsides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do they do it if they don't load it to the cloud?  They must have a common database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have a database that runs on your phone because they're tracking your earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so Nodal.  But yeah, that's Nodal is a cash app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's well, yes, it's oh, and it's GDPR compliant.  Wow.  Ta-da.  Sorry.  It is a cat.  They have a separate app that is a Bluetooth asset tracking network.  So like a tile and it usually customers in the transportation.  It's not LimeBike, but other bike sharing companies use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not global.  And so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it does run with Singapore.  It does interoperate with Singapore's track and trace app.  And another one.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But in a one way street.  So it's not contributing or it wouldn't be private to Singapore's database.  It's just sucking data from it.  So I think that's not a good.  That's not a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's only going to tell you it's not telling enforcement.  It's saying to you that you have been exposed.  That's all it wants to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're free riding on the government's invasive surveillance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in Singapore, they're working with it.  So someone in say if you go to Singapore and you have the coalition app running on your phone,  it will pull data from it'll pull.  But it won't push.  So you will push your data to them.  Oh, it does push your data to them.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, then it's not private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It it shares a hash with the Singapore thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But at some point, they have to be able to notify people about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what it'll do is they'll share the hash with Singapore.  The Apple recognize its presence in the hash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know who I am.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll say this hash has been seen by the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's how the Singapore app should work, too.  That's how all these apps should work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You tell that to some of these governments.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What you also need, what Germany has done, what I think New York is going to start to do with New Jersey and Connecticut is you have to hire people to do contact tracing.  You know, I come down with it and I say this is where I've been.  And if I could give more data like that, but then you need to manually get to people and say you need to stay inside for the next 14 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is this is about people thinking about what comes next after quarantine.  And if you can dampen it with quarantine, you could actually, in theory, with quarantine, eliminate it.  Let's say nobody comes and goes in the city limits of Petaluma.  We quarantine everybody in Petaluma.  Everybody who's sick gets taken care of.  They all get better.  Now the virus has no presence in Petaluma until somebody comes in.  But that's why you need track and trace, because at that point you've stopped the virus.  At that point, when somebody gets sick, you test them and you need people.  And that's the problem is we don't have these people.  You need people who will then go out, find everybody that that person came into contact with, quarantine them.  So quarantine continues, but with a limited subset of people, just those who've come in contact with the virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Germany was hiring 500 people and they had 10,000 applied.  We got plenty of people who are unemployed right now.  I just saw a Gallup figure today that 46 million Americans, adult Americans, have been hurt economically by losing their jobs or being laid off or had their hours cut substantially.  Forty six million people can be hired to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Good. All right. It's not that skilled, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not. There's a template you work with.  There's a template you work with. It's phone sales.  I'd like to save your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Tell me who you saw in the last 24 hours.  And then, of course, there'll be antibody testing, we hope, sometime soon. And that might help.  The UK screwed that up.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They thought they had the antibody tested and then they had to admit that it doesn't work.  I mean, we're screwing up here royally, but so is the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting to see a lot of, there are a few handful of federal or national governments that are doing this, right?  But a lot of governments are screwing up. And it's interesting.  Here in the States, we have an unusual situation. We're a federation of local state governments.  And the states are stepping up in some cases, some cases not.  I wonder if there'll be a larger distrust of big government out of this, maybe?  Or a need for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd say a hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I would say what we've, I mean, I don't know.  I look at our current response and I'm like, wow, this really shows how broken our federal government is.  And yes, I'm reliant on my state, but I'm also, historically, we have relied on the federal government to do things like, I don't know, coordination between the states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. But maybe Janesley is doing such a good job, your governor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He is. He's doing a great job.  Yes.  I, I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting how some governors are coming forward.  Inslee is one, Cuomo is another. Our governor in California, Newsom.  Murphy and Gerizim.  Yeah. And it's interesting how they are becoming national presences in the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every single one of them has complained about how they wish the federal government would step up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Admittedly, in the vacuum created by an effective federal government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I don't think anyone, I mean, I think most people.  If they sat and thought about it, they would be disappointed if we did a greater federation and we took apart what our federal government has done.  Right. Like, and we took that. I mean, think about things like interstate commerce.  I mean, we rely on that heavily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If there is an ideology in the White House, though, and I sometimes wonder if there's any coherent ideology.  But if there is, it's, it's the old Reagan ideology of federal government shouldn't be, should be as small as possible.  No, but this is the, this is the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Reagan, Reagan wanted to cut government down.  The Lord knows and taxes down. Yes.  But did not want to destroy the institution of the federal government.  What we see happening now is an effort to destroy its value as an institution.  I don't want to get too political and get you in trouble.  Was I? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know if we want to go to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember Ronald Reagan saying the nine most terrifying words in the English language where I'm here from the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I'm from the government. I'm here to help.  Yes. But also that was a good line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was good at those lines anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  I mean, just, you know, one of the things, look, I got nothing else to do.  One of the things that fascinates me and intellectual talk about Google, we can.  We're not.  No, we will.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There's lots to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the things that fascinates me and I think a lot of people is the intellectual process of what's next of thinking scenarios about what, what might be, what the world might look like in a year.  You know, we talked a few minutes ago in Windows Weekly about Microsoft saying, you know what, we're not going to do any in-person conferences until July 2021.  More than more than a year from now.  And in a way, that's a that's an acknowledgement that in-person conferences, they're not going to be the same.  Tony Fauci said yesterday, I don't think we should go back to shaking hands ever.  No, I'm happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm so happy about that.  Ever.  No more shaking hands.  It's a different world.  No more European kissy kiss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, but I like the kissy kiss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, no more kissy kiss.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And try to figure out whether it's one cheek or two cheeks or three cheeks.  Which one do you start with?  No, no, no, no, no.  Over.  It's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It is over.  As is the handshake.  The great American handshake.  So we're going to emerge from our slumber, rubbing our eyes into a different world.  I just think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you're going to put your hand in the sanitizer because you just touched your eyes.  I touched my face.  All right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google.  Google says Stadia is free.  This is their online gaming service that they were charging 10 bucks a month for.  Well, no, they still will.  They're still Google's Stadia Pro.  But now they, and they, by the way, this is nothing they didn't promise.  They said they would do this eventually.  Open it up to everybody.  There'd be a free tier and a paid tier.  And in consequence, I think, it announced that there's a lot more new Google Stadia  users.  I wonder, though, if this is going to make any difference in the success of Stadia  Discuss.  See, now you want me to go back to COVID, don't you?  Yeah, we do.  Because I don't give a damn about Stadia.  Stadia is not like a super hot topic for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, you're right.  I picked a weak candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm like, oh, Stadia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, oh, Kevin says the Stadia Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk about Wave for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like Google Wave.  What does Kevin say?  I'm like, oh, I'm going to go to Google Wave.  I'm going to go to Google Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to go to Google Wave.  I'm going to go to Google Wave.  I'm going to go to Google Wave.  I'm going to go to Google Wave.  I missed Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's talk about Wave for a while.  Yeah, it's like Google Wave.  What is Kevin saying to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stadia Pro folks get two free months as well.  He just checked his subscription.  So there, you found a Stadia Pro subscription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and you get a trial of Stadia Pro for some months.  And of course, Google's hope is you forget and you continue to pay for that for a long  time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, maybe it's not that you forget.  Maybe it's just that, hey, maybe you'll see that this is valuable to you.  Maybe you'll find, I mean, it's smart to say, I have all of this content and you are stuck  at home and bored off your mind.  And you'll be like, oh my God, I love this new addictive weird game.  And then you'll just keep paying for it.  I don't think it's as nefarious as like you'll forget.  I think it's more like the fist bite is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a method of subscription businesses, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's always has subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's kind of, yeah.  Right.  Forget, lose track of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When we got credit card billing in the newspaper business and magazine business, that was the  happiest moment any circulation director ever had.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, all right.  Fine.  Alex Stamos, there's a name you should remember.  He was the security guy at Facebook.  He's brilliant.  Well, I think he's widely respected as a security guy, right?  He is going to consult with Zoom to make it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good.  I know we're all complaining about Zoom's nefarious ways to make life easier for people.  I really panic all over my left ear.  The only issue I have with Zoom was that they did say it was end to end encrypted, but they  really kind of played with some language there.  We made our own encryption scheme that is actually not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So explain.  I haven't dug into this.  Explain to me their feint there.  What were they trying to say, convince you of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what I usually, the way I look at encryption is I look for people who use AES encryption,  right?  And there's different grades of that.  Now, the highest level is like 256.  And that's usually what people are talking about when they talk about encryption.  They're talking about some sort of difficult math problem that is, I would even say, some  sort of peer reviewed difficult math that needs to happen that truly keeps your traffic  secure.  It is possible to come up with your own encryption scheme that is actually secure.  Most companies, I don't think, use it.  So they're not using AES encryption.  They're using their own version of it.  That's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They are.  They're using AES 128.  Oh, they're using 128.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Thank you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they're also using ECB, which is a widely discredited form of encryption over 128.  There's also the second problem.  We interpret end-to-end encryption as equivalent to trust no one, that only the two ends of  the conversation could ever access the contents.  And it is encrypted, but it has to be decrypted at the Zoom servers.  And that's because of the way Zoom works.  It would have to be.  They have to understand it so they can route it.  So it's not so much they're nefarious.  See, this is the real debate about Zoom is, are they nefarious or incompetent?  Or did their market change?  Or did their market change?  They were a business tool and they were good enough for business and now we're using it  in different ways.  And governments using it.  And you wouldn't have Zoom bombing.  I mean, Zoom bombing isn't Zoom's fault exactly.  It's just that everybody started using it and they used it in the default, which is  good for business.  You know, it's funny they put passwords.  Zoom's been, I think, to their credit, really trying to address all of this.  And hiring Alex Stamos is a very, very good thing.  But they're being used in ways they didn't anticipate.  Their defaults were not the most secure.  They overstated.  There are not E2E.  There are not.  And so for them to say it was, it was an incorrect thing.  Stacy's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of the worst of it.  They bought a presumption and hit trust.  No, no, there's far worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The worst of it, if you want the worst of it, is Zoom is written in China.  They hire Chinese coders.  There are three companies in China, all really the same company, that does all the coding  for Zoom.  Zoom is based in Santa Clara, but none of the code is written here.  It's all written in China.  There were briefly routing calls that had nothing to do with China through China.  There was some concern there.  That looked like it was just a load balancing thing, and it probably wasn't intentional.  They have poor security practices, for instance, when you record video, they just store it  unencrypted, unprotected in an Amazon S3 bucket so it could be easily found.  Their methodology for naming the Zoom conference, you get a nine or ten digit code, was not  very good.  It was terrible.  As a result, there is a war driving, it's called Z-Wardrive program that will find about  100 of those an hour.  That's what's allowed.  Zoom bombing is that people can easily find open Zoom meetings.  That and people who have no freaking life.  There's creeps on the internet, sad to say.  I've mentioned this before, but I have a friend with a 12 is in a recovery program.  In order to do an AA meeting, you have to have an open meeting.  They were using Zoom and they were getting really pretty awful Zoom bombing.  I don't know if it's kids or adults or whatever, they're trolls.  They were doing things that were intentionally triggering and repulsive, racial epithets,  pornography, but also stuff aimed at alcoholics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you tried to have your AA meeting on Hangout, it would be the same thing, wouldn't it?  A public meeting is going to have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Zoom needs better moderation tools, which some people just don't know.  There's a lobby, they call it waiting room, but there's ways that you can make it better.  You look people in.  I've talked to my friend and they said, well, but it's against the canon of the group to  in any way make it hard to come in.  I proposed you could start and then close it.  Nope, can't do that.  You could have a waiting room.  Nope, can't do that.  You could have a password.  No, definitely can't do that.  So a lot of the things one would you and I might use, you can't do.  And yes, you're right.  Exactly.  Jeff, this would be the problem with any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But let me say just this.  Zoom right now beats that out of Google Hangouts.  Google Hangouts is the last show we set as 25x.  Everybody is fuzzy and frozen.  And Zoom has been a lifesaver to me teaching my students and staying in touch with people.  And I just I'm grateful for Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's pretty clear that first of all, I set up our own private Twitter server.  It's called twit.team.  It's using an open source product called Jitsi.  It is end to end encrypted.  It's in every respect, you know, and Lisa won't use it because you're not going to make  a sales call and say, oh, you got to use this thing.  You're going to use Zoom.  It's just you just are.  And everybody's using it.  So I think Zoom is doing exactly the right thing, which is saying we blew it.  You know, they've grown astronomically from 10 million daily active users in December  to 200 active daily users last month.  And their CEO says, you know, we blew it.  So we're going to no more new features.  Everybody on the team is working hard on securing it.  And I think calling Alex Stamos and saying we need you, come help us is exactly the right  thing to do.  Is a confession.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the other thing in this story is my dear colleagues in media who couldn't go after  Facebook every hour now because people are back there.  Even Leo's there for God's sakes.  Nobody wants to hate Facebook this week.  So who are we going to hate?  Zoom!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I don't think that's it, Jeff.  Oh, I think there's been a lot of coverage that's gone way over the edge.  Well, we're just it's kind of this squirrel mentality, right?  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.  And they're looking for an evil rabbit squirrel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they're looking for an evil rabbit squirrel.  They're just paying attention to what's big.  And when something good, I mean, this makes sense.  This is what you're supposed to do as a journalist.  When something blows up, you say to yourself, all right, let's poke this and see what out  in this case security flaws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Stacey, you're right.  But I agree with all of that.  And people should be informed.  But I saw too many stories that said how to get off Zoom.  You shouldn't be on Zoom.  Zoom is wrong.  Zoom is going to be awful for you.  And that's just simply not true.  And then you have a technical system.  I had that experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, by the way, the Pentagon's never allowed people to use Zoom.  NASA doesn't allow people to use Zoom.  Elon Musk, SpaceX doesn't.  The New York City schools now doesn't.  And so, you know, Zoom might have fumbled the opportunity.  I suspect they haven't if they can if they can make it more secure.  But there are plenty of other choices.  Microsoft Teams.  If you're all Apple, Apple FaceTime.  That's limited to 32 people and it requires Apple products.  There's Google Meet.  I don't know.  As you mentioned, Hangouts Meet is not great.  Here's my sad complaint here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am so sick of like proposing with my friends, hey, let's all get on a virtual happy hour.  And they're like, all right, FaceTime.  I'm like, no.  They're like Hangouts.  And I'm like, OK.  And then someone's like, no.  What about Zoom?  And I'm like, no.  And then someone's like, no.  What about Zoom?  No, I'm not using Zoom anymore.  And I'm like, oh, I hate everyone.  That's too bad.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See?  See?  There is a good solution.  And we need an easy way to do it.  We need a good solution that everybody can get their heads around.  What I've been telling people is use Zoom.  It's everybody understands it.  It's easy.  The security flaws are not significant unless you have reason, you know, to hide.  And everything I'm getting my whole family on duo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Duo is great.  And duo is cross platform.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's cross platform.  It's easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it works.  And actually duo does great.  And it has great quality.  Much better than Hangouts.  Yeah.  How have you found Skype to be during this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's terrible.  As a company.  I think Microsoft is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Skype degrading is what I'm asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is, by the way, that's one of the things Google's warning about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're saying, you know, someone's going to be like, oh, I'm going to be like, oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's one of the things Google's warning about.  They're saying, you know, so many people are using Hangouts Meet.  We might start seeing some degradation.  Maybe I think they've already.  Oh, they've seen it like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's been awful.  Yeah.  And so I think everybody.  I'm Mr. Google fanboy, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I did a call with some Google people last week and I said, guys, sorry to tell you,  but Hangouts sucks.  And they silently chortled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is the release notes for Hangouts 33.  Video quality may now decrease if server load increases.  And and frankly, teams had problems in Europe.  Their servers couldn't keep up.  I mean, we're just we're just killing the internet right now.  On the other hand, it's sort of working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're not killing the internet.  We're just killing these particular products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, Netflix had to step down its bandwidth use in Europe.  Europe.  The default for Europe is now 480p everywhere.  I know the Internet.  No, the Internet's being hit.  It's holding up.  And God bless it.  We say this every single show for the last three weeks.  We're very lucky that we have it.  This would be a completely different experience if we didn't.  Thank you, Jeff, for saving the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's now five o'clock.  That's all clap for the Internet.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, does that mean we drink to the Internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We we we do that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We clap for medical workers and first responders at 7 p.m.  But at 5 p.m. we clap for the Internet.  Thank you, Internet.  And you know what?  There are a lot of people keeping that Internet flowing.  Yeah, that's true, too.  It's not it's not a humanless endeavor.  And boy, I mean, look at your family using Google Duo.  That's awesome.  So they're lucky they have somebody like you, Stacey,  who can navigate this.  We tried to have a family group meeting on Friday and the kids  had no trouble with this the jitsy that I set up.  But there was one older person who I couldn't figure it out.  And she said, Well, I have a I have a paid Zoom account.  Can we use that?  We said, Yes, fine.  Use Zoom. It's better than nothing.  That's it is.  It's better than nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I got some really good suggestions from listeners for my father,  which I mentioned last week.  Was it TeamView or whatever it's called?  TeamViewer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't recommend.  TeamViewer.  Yeah, that's really what it's OK.  It's you know, our former sponsor,  LogMeIn's GoToMeeting is actually very good.  It's a great choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's my other question for the week.  My father just says he can't get on the Internet.  It could be something he messed up on his laptop.  I saw your tweet.  Could just be that his router is not on.  And I don't know how to tell him.  He's 95.  Yeah, 94.  So I don't know how to tell him to figure out whether the router is on or not.  How does he do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, can he just go to the router?  Can he identify the router?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does he even know what the router is?  Yeah, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bingo.  And plus, they put a new router in.  There's old boxes back there and there's things behind the TV and God.  Well, there is no way to ping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He could just unplug everything there and replug it back in.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who's his Internet service provider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whatever Bright House became in optimum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I would call them on his behalf, explain he's 94.  They can tell you if his router is on.  Oh, OK, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's what OK.  Right. Thank you.  Yeah.  OK.  Pretty sure.  Probably privacy fanatics will stop me from doing that, but that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then so that will give you at least the knowledge that they can even tell you if they see traffic coming and going.  They'll have some idea if it's working.  And then you go from the other end.  You have to walk him through the seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, what I'm looking to do is to send him a machine that is dumbed down.  That's a good idea.  To nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a good idea.  Yeah.  So anyway, thank you.  Thank you for the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would call Spectrum and just say, Hey, my dad, 94, he can't figure it out.  Could you just tell me?  Can you ping?  You see anything?  Yeah, you see anything?  They can see it.  I don't know if the router modem are separate.  They certainly can see the modem.  And I think they could probably see the router as well.  They would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I did a Publix Instacart order for him.  This is the tweet I was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my father was no, no, no, I'm fine.  I get out. No, no, no.  I had to argue with him five times.  I said, I know you're fine, Pa.  I don't know about the person next to you in the store.  No, you're not going out.  And he's deaf as a tree stump.  So I had to go on the deck.  The whole neighborhood knows.  And we live on three acres.  The whole neighborhood knows.  No, Pa.  So finally I convinced him.  And then I had to put on the order.  We know what he has.  He said the same thing for 10 years.  So we just make a list of my wife, my sister and me.  And then we go through.  And then this great Mohammed is in the store and he's texting me.  And he says, you know, I asked for paper towels.  No, no, no, no, no paper towels.  And he had to opt me for the grapefruit.  This is I've never done this before.  And he said, by the way, the text Costco has toilet paper.  It was just great.  And good old Mohammed got the food to my father, I think.  And it's pretty amazing what you can do.  Thank you, Internet.  It's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  It is sad to say an example of privilege, however, we are.  Oh, yes.  We are fortunate that we can we can do that.  And I get a farm box delivered on Fridays and Lisa uses Instacart.  But I New York now, the suppliers for the high end restaurants,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  since they don't have restaurants, are now delivering to homes.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if you get a month, if you got money, you can live fine.  You have a house, you don't have food.  But look at the disproportionate number of African Americans who are dying.  Huge disproportionate.  Terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Terrible.  And Chicago is 30 percent African American, 70 percent African American deaths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's the people.  Sadly, it's the people who actually make our life livable, who are on the front lines,  who are not getting well paid, who probably don't get paid well enough to do you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to get their own groceries delivered and don't get good health care and and live in pollution.  And so this is a story of inequity that it's going to we're going to have to dig into for years and years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Somebody said to me, maybe it was you.  What we're really going to see and what we are seeing is the inequity in our societies,  really rearing its ugly head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So do you think that's actually going to change it?  I mean, I feel like we've been seeing this forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I read a great article by a historian of the French Revolution who said, you know,  this is exactly what it was like just before they stormed the Bastille.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's I mean, look at if we have I don't wish that on anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You do not. Yeah. But look what happened in Wisconsin.  Oh, no. I mean, I look at this and I'm like, the state Supreme Court and then the federal  Supreme Court told Wisconsiners, yeah, you should you should risk your life because that's  the only way you're going to get to vote on it.  Unbelievable. It's just and so, yeah, I could see.  I mean, I don't want a revolution. I'm not voting for it, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, poor Bernie, everything that he's been screaming about, the need for it is now evident  and he drops out, you know, and I'm not I was never a Bernie fan and never Bernie voter,  but I give him a lot of credit for having changed the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. It is interesting that I mean, I don't know what it accomplishes,  but it does show everything he was talking about. Yep.  Yeah, I don't know. It's a this is part of the the only way that I can handle my anxiety is by,  you know, mental exercises like projecting out.  What do you think? What do you think that means? What is it? Should I should I start a garden?  Do I need to learn how I did buy a sewing machine? Yes, you should start a garden.  And there's nothing wrong with that, right? It's a good thing to have one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Worst case scenario, you'll grow some herbs whenever you need them.  You could just go and get them and it'll be perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Worst case scenario, I'll try to learn canning and I'll poison the family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Canning is advanced level magic. So, you know, I'm going to learn sewing, though, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and I'm going to make you all masks.  Tweet masks. Yeah, tweet masks.  Leo, my face on it so I can unlock your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been trying to breathe through the Feds. It doesn't work very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't have any elastic fabric, so I've got other fabric and I have a sewing machine, but I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Forgive me for this.  I'm not interested in the answer, but if you happen to ever wear pantyhose,  they make an excellent, excellent elastic for your masks.  Oh, I don't know if you do or don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I don't want to know. I'll send you some of mine, Stacy. Yeah, I wear them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love them. They're very warm. I don't have pantyhose, but I probably have tights.  So, yeah, tights would work, right? There's an elastic, right? OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go. Tights. What about what about the hair bands?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have seen no-sew mask patterns that do in fact use hair ties.  Hair ties, that's what you call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I have a sewing machine, so I can actually sew it.  Do you know how to sew? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to get my mom to teach me because I bought a sewing machine without any skills at all. I never learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, what's the June Oven version of a sewing machine?  It's not an expensive sewing machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't have those, but I wish they did because wouldn't it be awesome if you could set your pattern?  They do actually have. They have embroidery machines, automatic embroidery machines.  Yeah, they have these amazing computerized embroidery machines.  And my mom has one, like multi-thousand dollar machines. They're so cool.  I mean, like you watch them work and you're like, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I got kind of a portable machine, I think it was 300 bucks. It was Dr. Mom's sister.  So Dr. Mom in the chat room said, well, my sister is not, it's kind of, business has been slow in Santa Monica at the sewing store.  So you could buy one from her. I said, deal.  So she shipped it out to me. It's sewing arts dot com.  I got a little three hundred dollar sewing machine. She says very good. It's made by Bernina.  And yeah, that's a good brand. And she's going to she's going to throw in some boutique fabric, I think.  It's called the Burnett. And so it is not the June Oven.  But then, you know, the real reason I did this, Jeff, my mom, my whole life growing up,  my mom was is all about textiles and is an excellent sewer. Really thought I would get her on FaceTime and say, Mom, I got a sewing machine.  Can you teach me how to sew? I thought that'd be a fun thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My mother would have just said, no, you're too dumb. You're hopeless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then explains a lot. And then and then there'll be a practical side of it because I can make masks for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could also do things like, I don't know, make button holes.  It's got a button. Yeah, well, no, I mean, I just oh, you could make button holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This thing has a buttonhole foot and a zipper foot. I can do a zipper foot.  I just like saying zipper foot, zipper foot. So a buttonhole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see the mask for people who work with the hearing impaired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's got a little plastic window. Yeah. Yeah. That's cute. That's cool. That's cute.  That's sweet. So I should ask both of you because both of you were in Seattle at a tough time.  And I think Seattle is kind of flattened the curve. Right. We're great. Yeah.  But now Jeff's in New Jersey, of course, which is the epicenter. Not great. Not great. Not great.  Can you tell? I mean, does it feel different? Well, I thought let me go out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have no idea. But she she goes out and and comes back exhausted.  Is she going to work? No, not work. No, no, no. She's she's going to once once every 10 days.  She hits a different store. Yeah. So this week, this week she she tried to go to Trader Joe's and I was closed because they were disinfecting it because somebody there apparently had it.  Oh, my. You know, we're we're of an age where we can get in there. The senior hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Joe and our chairman says he's in New York City and all he hears all day is sirens because there's no more traffic noise, but the noise, but the sirens are going, which reminds me of 9-11.  Yeah. A UK judge has given Google a Sophie's Choice.  This is in that case, which I think we've all agreed is not a very good or just case.  The found them case found them sued Google saying you are prioritizing your your results over ours and you put us out of business darn you.  Now Google is being told you've got to give your ranking algorithms to found them selected expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, found them gets to select them. Not the judge. And them has already selected them. Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Philip Klockner.  He Philip Klockner is an SEO consultant.  And Google said the integrity of Google's ranking processes relies upon all webmasters or website owners having the same degree of access to information about Google's ranking.  This will be no longer be the case if information of this kind is made available to some individuals who actually offer commercial services to assist companies to improve their search rankings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they have some other way. How do you judge it? What do you do? Pile on 25 million lines of code onto his desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's actually what Google process. That's what Google did in the found them case.  They presented a stack of code, some documents, court exhibits filed by Google engineers and found them said, well, what are we supposed to do with these?  So the judge said, you got to have an expert look at these and we're going to let the plaintiff choose the expert.  That's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And Google is I mean, right in this case, I'm like, yeah, judge probably should be able to talk about that or select your expert and let the two sides fight over this because yeah, not great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The judge said you take it or leave it. You either withdraw the evidence or agree to let Klockner read the algorithm.  Klockner, by the way, was a consultant to both Travago and visual meta, both of whom had previously complained to the EU about Google's anti-competitive practices.  He would be given legal permission to enter two so-called confidentiality rings where he could read unredacted copies of Google's algorithm documents and talk to lawyers about them.  The judge said, I'm going to give Google a reasonable time to figure out what your response is, but you don't.  To an unreasonable request.  That's an unreasonable request. You either withdraw the evidence or you let the expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the maximum at stake for Google? Is it just money or is there a precedent that could be damaging?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's an interesting question. I don't see. I'm looking at a register article.  Why do they call Google the chocolate factory?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because of Charlie and the chocolate factory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Charlie and the chocolate factory is secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, like the secret candy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Yeah, I spent way too long going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a very registered thing. They like jargon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know they yeah, I know they come up with their cute little boffin names, whatnot, but that one was just escaping me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boffin is such a good word. I love boffin. Yeah, it's like calling Apple the fruit company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That at least makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They don't they don't see damage. This has been going on since 2006.  Wow. 2006. Always been a ridiculous.  Geez. So I don't I don't know what will happen.  But yeah, this is an example of this is so difficult for Google.  I don't know how Google Google's got the patience of Job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just don't know how they know they have a big legal team that still wants to be paid.  I mean, that's what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is not a lawyer.  But you know, you're going to go to law school.  Yeah, yeah, I was never. But because first of all, no, first you have to graduate college.  That was a little bit of a roadblock.  But but also, I did always think that I, you know, I watched the paper chase.  I thought that it was fascinating thinking about legal arguments and thinking about the law.  That was an intellectually wonderful process.  But all the lawyers I knew were miserable, especially the young lawyers who were in the document section in the basement of the building.  It's just like the worst.  And the only happy lawyers I know are former lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey, I remember you said earlier, show what you would have been if you weren't you.  But what would you have been a genetic engineer?  That's right. That's right. Well, boy, you'd be you'd be on the top shows now, wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's nice. I don't know. I mean, yeah, maybe.  No, probably not. I think my career would have been very different.  I probably would not be camera ready in any sort of way.  I'm barely camera ready now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you seen Next Strain?  It's a television show.  No, any XT strain.  It is dot org.  It is phenomenal.  It is checking every single strain of the covid virus.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  These are not mutations, but these are.  It's an open source project to harness the scientific and public health potential of pathogen genome data.  So are they sequencing it?  Yes. And then they're tracking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you click on, I think the first link, yes, click on the first upper left link latest data analysis.  And there you will see the mapping of the slight variations in the RNA.  And it's not a full mutation, right?  It's not like, oh, no, I'm going to get a different covid.  It hasn't gone that far.  But you will see it against geography.  You see it against the sequence.  And then also where did that allows you to track where they went and came from?  Just fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I get it. Yeah, because you could say, oh, yeah.  Oh, that's right. Of course.  You could say, oh, this is that particular scene in Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then I saw it in New York.  I have read about this, the work that they're doing.  That's fascinating.  There's a brilliant young woman named Emma Hodcroft.  Look at this map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Show this map, John, because this is a overtime map showing it's actually the part on the left.  Is there are you zoomed in a little bit?  Can you zoom out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the part on the left that's really interesting because that also feeds the part of the right is showing you what's happening.  That's what I mean.  The part on the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Is showing the spread globally as via the genomes.  This could have been used.  Let me go back to the beginning.  This is fascinating.  So this is the end game.  So here we are in Wuhan, China, and you're going to see based on the genetic information where it went first.  I think Thailand was the first place it went.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at this.  Oh, oh, oh, where's that purple one on the right going?  Oh, no.  It looked.  Oh, then France.  Oh, oh, it went to the United States.  Now the U.S. is giving it.  This is really interesting.  Isn't this fascinating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Really interesting.  So this is the first time in the United States that a gene has been used in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the US back to England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now they have it looks like four or five genomes or I'm trying to interview her for my series.  Yeah.  Really interesting.  Really.  And she's she's a you know, she's not alone as a team of people, but she's been speaking about it.  She's a young postdoc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is next strain dot org dot org next strain dot org.  Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing I'm talking to my scientists that's that's so I talked to one today, Angela Rasmussen from Columbia School of Public Health.  And she's been involved in other epidemics.  But she said this is the first one where we have preprints.  That is to say scientific papers that are published before they're peer reviewed.  And that gets in some trouble like the famous one about about the hydrochloroquine.  But the flow of data and information and theories for the for the for the scientists is invaluable.  And though there have been a few bad ones all at all, they seem to agree that this is incredibly valuable to have this flow of information possible.  You see the things like next stream then become possible, too, because people are sharing that scientists are trying to get each other to pledge to be open about their data.  I saw one of those.  It's phenomenal time.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's open source.  No, I was just going to say it's open source science.  It's really exciting because it does bring up this idea that when you get a bunch of smart people all trying to talk to one another and fix things.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will also say it shows the important in some sort of central body to manage the information or manage like the implementation.  It feels very tough watching like some of the ventilator efforts or some of the other efforts that are happening.  Just everyone's basically like, I have an expertise in this.  Let me find a group that I can work with to solve the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You mean like the logistics donating machines as ventilators.  You mean like that?  Not just like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I wish I could remember where I saw the article.  It was someone talking about like one of the cove in 19 hackathons.  And he's like, this is all well and good.  But the next step is figuring out like, how do we do delivery if we make these ventilators?  How do we tell doctors how to use them?  How do do they need approval?  How do we?  So there's still the need to have some sort of logistical element there that's usually done better when it's a bit centralized.  And I don't know.  It's kind of showing how we can build up highly flexible, open, problem solving architectures.  And if we can then flip it and focus on the ones, you know, and get the actual solutions that work to people, that's a very new way of doing business.  It's really crucible for changing the way we do business.  Or it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a lot.  So I'll put some Jake put this in the rundown chat.  Put together a list a week or so ago of some of the open source projects that are out there and that list keeps growing.  And yeah, you're right.  Some of it is, hey, kids, let's put on a show in the barn and everybody be better tomorrow.  But some of them were very serious.  And but is it Jennifer Palka said her first name, John, right here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't. I don't know who you're talking about.  Keep saying.  I was the former deputy digital head of the administration, I think.  So she started something preying together companies just to be able to communicate and volunteer resources with each other.  There is there's one effort that says if you're a mathematician or a statistician and there are researchers who need some help, we volunteer your time.  You know, there's a lot of a lot of good efforts out there.  But you're right, Stacey.  We we we ain't going to do this like Mickey and Judy put on a show in the barn.  We need the experts and we need the structure of institutions to make it possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can you not see my screen? I think we could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't like that's my son Jake's age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. Well, sorry, Stacey.  I agree. There's also no, no, I was to be peer review and all that.  I think the idea of getting the information out and presuming that the experts who are looking at the information and using the information have the ability to vet it, you know, at least formally and say, well, that's not a great study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was no, you know, yeah, the original hydrochloroquine was like N16, no control, no nothing.  And it being published in a journal for which the author was the editor.  Huge problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a little asterisk whenever it's not peer reviewed.  There should always be an asterisk.  Oh, there is.  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Presumers the experts would look at it and go, well, but the problem is what you can't count on is it goes out of that into a Twitter feed.  Somebody does story on this last week into Trump's head, not his mouth again and again and again and again and again.  Right.  And that's when you get to the to the uninformed use of pre print information.  But but but the scientists are telling me that it's worth it to have this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's gonna you know, look, there's stuff like that's gonna happen.  This is for you, Stacey.  Google Duo.  Sorry.  As you know, sometimes calls drop out.  Google is trying auto complete for speech in Google.  It's scary.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that is that is crazy.  Deep.  I'm just trying to envision.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're trying to have auto complete on the email.  Yeah, they're trying to they'd even duplicate the speakers tone and voice and all of that.  And artificial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They didn't because if they messed it up, then at least bingo.  That's the problem.  It's not auto complete because you have control over auto complete still.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they according to this article in the MIT technology review, Google's already doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe most of the time, it's not a sentence or a word even it's just a little bit a packet

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  It smooths out the sound a little bit.  It wouldn't be words.  Yeah, I would guess that's I'm gonna hope that's the case.  Yeah.  They call it auto complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's not auto complete.  It's not auto complete.  It's not auto complete.  It's not auto complete.  It's not auto complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to hope that's the case.  Yeah, they call it because otherwise it could get weird packet loss on duo Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you could end up with a major family feud.  Stacey, I heard you say that is called packet loss concealment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's really based on, you know, one or two packets.  So instead of you know what?  You wouldn't even know it's happening if it were that quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could they like filter?  I would like a better filter that like gives my lips some color and maybe like smooths  the flyaways in my hair so I look presentable enough.  And doesn't make you so damn pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So here we go.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK.  So this is an example of it.  This is this is with a 60 60 millisecond packet loss.  I don't know exactly what we're going to hear, but I'm going to play it.  Oh, you're not getting my audio.  Hold on a sec.  You always got to check that before.  I got to get my sound, my sound mixer up.  We always got to check that John can't come over to plug in anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not munchkins from the country of the gillic.  At the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins from the country  of the gillicons, the path divided.  So you can hear the dropouts there.  Here's the fixed at the foot of the mountain that separated the country of the munchkins  from the country of the gillicons.  The path divided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Still, still not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impetuous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've all heard that that kind of robotic buzzy sound.  Let's see what it does here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, mother said the young student looking up with a shade of impatience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a little better, right?  All right.  Let's try it with 120 milliseconds.  This twice as much packet lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next came olives turned to hell in the ceremonies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I hate it when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Next came olives turned to help in the ceremony.  See, that's a big improvement, right?  That is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's another one.  Well, what could the word help have been?  It could have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not replacing words.  It's just little bits of sound, I think, or cleaning it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They might do so too.  And that would make you a great deal of trouble.  They would think that they might do so too.  And that would make you a great deal of trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I honestly, I bet that would make you a great big troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is already happening in duo, according to this Google blog post.  So I think that makes it sound a lot better.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, some of them sounded better than others.  Right.  Well, yeah, still better than nothing.  That is the way the world works.  Some things work better than others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's pretty impressive and it could get better and better.  You could see that one of the problems we're seeing with,  again, income inequality, about half of the students who are being sent home  to do online school aren't even checking in.  They're just not doing it.  It's awful.  And some of that is because they don't have the means to do it.  They don't have the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, university, CUNY, had to delay restarting classes  because they had to go buy 33,000 laptops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Google is donating free Chromebooks and 100,000 mobile hotspots  for rural California students.  This is a little smaller than the CUNY purchase, 4,000 Chromebooks.  But they're also giving them internet access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I will say that I noticed with Anna's school,  which is a private school in a fairly decently well-off area of the country,  a lot of kids complained that they didn't have bandwidth access  when in fact, spoiler alert, they did.  So the school actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My dog ate the internet. Can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like my father.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're like, could you please tell us what computer equipment you have,  what bandwidth you have to in your house?  And they explained that a higher number than they thought would need it  does seem to need it.  And then they came back and they were like, okay.  So they did end up buying laptops for two, maybe three students.  But they were getting like a 40% rate of kids who were like, yeah,  I can't participate.  So I'm just throwing that out there.  Like, I don't think that that's the case in most of these examples, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The dog ate my spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  As if Facebook didn't already know enough about you,  now they're going to know your most intimate details, Stacey Higginbotham.  They have launched an app for couples to talk to each other  to keep a photo diary, check in on each other's moves.  Private. Oh, it's private. Oh.  Oh, yes.  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I'm not on Facebook, so it's irrelevant for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's built as a quote private space, end quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Poor Andrew's been sending you messages and you just don't see them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That happens in our real life too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't even have to have a Facebook account,  although you are subject to Facebook's data rules,  meaning the data people provide can be used for ad targeting.  So be careful what you say.  Honey, I think I'm pregnant.  Could really launch a whole barrage of ads you don't want to see.  Unless they were actually pregnant.  Yeah. Well, maybe you would want to see them.  See, that's why good targeting ads.  Tuned. A new app for couples. A private space.  Now I've used these. Lisa and I have used these.  We used a couple for a long time, which I really liked.  There was another one called Avocado.  I'm not against this idea.  It is nice for Lisa and I to have a private space where we can just, you know,  exchange stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you, I mean, not like text?  I'm not against this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, texts aren't, yeah, but texts, this has more, you know,  you've got a daily diary.  You can say, how do I feel today? You can exchange music, love notes.  I mean, it's a little more tuned toward the kinds of conversations you would want to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Color stays dubious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've never used it. You just use text messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we just must converse for some, I mean, I don't want to read my husband's diary.  And I certainly don't.  I mean, we, and we're, we're not, we're probably not the targeted market because both of us are very practical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I know I'm like, who's the more romantic of you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Andrew, for sure.  He's so well, he's not so romantic.  Flowers on this app and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is how practical I am.  When he's, when he brings flowers home, I'm like, damn,  now I got to cut them and put them in a vase.  So now he has to do that for me.  Oh, my wife says I'm allergic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You guys are such curmudgeon.  Who's the more romantic?  I'm just lazy.  Lisa says I should be more romantic, but I think I'm pretty darn romantic.  So I don't know.  She just wants more romantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She romantic.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does it mean to be romantic?  I mean, what is it?  What is it like?  Or what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, just in the middle of the day, just send a little note with a picture of a rhinoceros  and say, I'm getting horny for you like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm never going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one step from the divorce court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, not that I've ever done that.  I'm just as an example.  Thank you.  Don't do it.  Just a little advice.  Don't do that one.  Don't do it.  Okay.  I got a topic I want to talk about.  That's a good one.  Okay.  Is that romantic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lisa last yesterday said I'm going to order us dinner at our favorite restaurant, which  has never done takeout in the past, but does now, of course.  And she ordered me my favorite dish and it was ready for me when I got home.  It was cute.  It was nice.  That's romantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's thoughtful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, Jeff, you have a topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we need Kevin here.  I'm saddened because the only thing that was going to brighten my day was Monday Keem.  And I was going to be able to buy something new and a toy, even though I had little excuse  to do so.  But I'm not thinking.  Kevin Toffle put up together the reviews of the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook.  It's one big problem.  Two, actually, it seems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Besides the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the battery's terrible.  Terrible.  It seems terrible.  How disappointing because we saw it at CES.  It is gorgeous.  The Chromebook?  Yeah, we're talking about the Samsung.  The bright red Samsung Galaxy Chromebook.  Oh, that's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, but it has terrible battery life and a 4K display.  Oh, that's why.  It has terrible battery.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, because they gave it a giant display.  I'm going to go to Kevin's review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Kevin rounded up the reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I was disappointed when I saw the battery life.  And it does start at $1,000, but that's like the Pixelbook.  It's a two in one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Kevin also says it's too hot because it doesn't have a fan.  Yeah, it's too hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Verge claimed, Samsung claimed eight hours.  Verge got four hours, 20 minutes on a charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, but the Verge, if they put a movie on it, it went a longer way.  Yeah, it's too bad because it really is pretty, isn't it?  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a 4K is kind of unnecessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I look for in my computing equipment.  Is it pretty?  I do, because I'm a romantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  See, you are too practical, Stacey.  We're the computer romantics over here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A number of them said to look at the Asus Chromebook flip.  That's probably a better.  It was not red.  It's not red.  I like the red.  There's something about red, anodized red aluminum.  It's just gorgeous, just pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And really thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Finest.  The thinnest ever.  Let me go back to the Verge picture because that's a much prettier picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have nicer photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have really pretty pictures.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think really one of the virtues of Chromebooks is long battery life and low cost.  And it doesn't do either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't beat either of those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My Pixelbook was expensive.  That wasn't cheap either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's wonderful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't get putting a 4K screen on it, to be honest.  I think that might have been a tactical error.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's also a tablet, so you could watch movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's why.  That's why you want to watch movies on 4K movies.  That's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My use of it as a tablet would have been on airplanes.  So much for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You ain't going nowhere, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So both, I think it's Delta and United now, have extended status through January 2022.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Alaska did it through 2021, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just January is kind of the end of their year is all.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So has anybody played with the YouTube TikTok competitor?  Shorts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, is it out?  I thought that they announced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is how interested I am in making small short videos.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The information says plans.  Plans.  All right.  Speaking of shorts, have you played with Quibi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am not paid for it.  No.  Well, you don't have to because it's three months free.  Well, then I'll forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't fall for that, Leo.  I don't fall for that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, you don't use iPhones.  It's one of the things Apple does so nicely on the iPhone.  If you delete the app, it says, now do you want to delete the subscription too?  This is a very nice feature, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google sends you an email before it charges you.  As a reminder, in four days, you're going to get this.  To fix it, go here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do appreciate that.  So we watched Quibi.  Actually, we did a big review of it on iOS today if you want to see.  At the end of the show, it was my app cap.  It does one really cool thing.  I'll do it again here and I'll show you on this.  By the way, the negative is you can't put it on anything.  You can't play it.  You can't airplay it.  You can't put it on your computer.  You can only.  It's really made for an iPhone.  Shows are all about seven minutes, but each one begins with an ad.  So somebody said, you know, all they did is they took a half hour, an hour show,  cut it up in seven minutes chunks and put an ad in front of each one.  So it's like the ad breaks.  But watch this.  So this, when I turn it sideways, it's kind of neat.  It kind of automatically.  Five years ago, I would have said, ooh.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not enough.  I was like, they have mastered auto-rotate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it's better than that because they've shot it on the iPhone.  And in theory, their technology will allow you them to give you two different views of the same shot as you rotate it.  This is an interesting show.  There are a lot of reality shows.  There's a Judge Judy, except that it's Chrissy Teigen instead of Judge Judy.  This is a cooking reality show called Dish Mantled in which they take a dish and they pulverize it and fire it in a cannon at two chefs where they're going to put it in the oven.  In which they take a dish and they pulverize it and fire it in a cannon at two chefs wearing special PPE.  That's incredibly stupid.  And then, well, it gets better.  And then the chefs have to taste it off the floor, off their shoes, off whatever they could taste it on, figure out what it is.  And then they have a pre-COVID show.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then they have a half hour to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then whoever gets the closest, the judges taste it.  And then whoever gets the closest, get ready.  They're going to fire the goo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it looks better in widescreen.  Oh, thanks.  You've just convinced me that I'm missing nothing.  There's one called Murder House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where a house where a horrific seven people were murdered by a little old lady who wanted their social security checks and then buried in the backyard.  And this couple lived there and they say, yeah, it's kind of creepy in the backyard.  So they bring in a designer couple to do a makeover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this is the Murder House flip one?  Yeah.  Yeah. I read about that.  I was like, this is like, it is like those 30 rock TV, like Milk Island and all the 30 rock TV shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're all 30 rock parody shows.  They're real.  Punk'd is back.  But instead of Ashton Kutcher doing playing Alan Funt doing candid camera, they've got Chance the Rapper playing Ashton Kutcher playing Alan Funt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If they get the rural juror, I might watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The rural juror.  The most dangerous game.  There's news on here.  Wait, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is the most dangerous game?  Because isn't that hunting people?  It's exactly that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the same.  It's basically a remake of the most dangerous game.  But it has Christopher.  What's his?  Weld Wild.  The guy, the great German actor who was in Inglorious Basterds played the Nazi in the Ingorsk.  Oh, Vyte's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Vyte's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's so good.  Oh, he is so good.  So there he is chewing the scenery in widescreen or in portrait mode.  Widescreen.  So they, Meg Whitman, former CEO of eBay and governor, California governor candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When I think cool new entertainment, I think Meg Whitman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Jeffrey Katzenberg of SKG, former Disney executive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  When I think old Hollywood, I think Jeffrey Katzenberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, raised one billion with a B dollars to do this.  And they've poured every penny into the production value.  Very high production value.  Lots of celebrity names.  They've got LeBron James, Chrissy Teigen.  John Legend makes an appearance on the Chrissy Teigen first episode.  So it's all nicely done.  Five dollars with ads, eight dollars with ads a month.  Three months free.  I don't know. What do you think?  To me, this looks like Hollywood saying, this is what Hollywood's looking at YouTube going,  how do we get some of that money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, do they, what do they have on the data optimization?  Because this is designed to be done on the go, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you can't really, you can't, it doesn't really have an iPad experience and you can't play it on a computer and you can't airplay it.  You can't. I'm watching this and I'm saying, oh, honey, you got to see it.  I want to show it to her.  Yeah, I can't project it.  I have she has to come over and look over my shoulder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's I mean, I just I just think about like, I mean, because I hang out with tweens and they they totally like share YouTube videos back and forth like it's no tomorrow.  So but I'm like, would they share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think this might be for her or her maybe people a little older than her high school and college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because like that, I think what they I mean, what they love is people being stupid, goofy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, they love to talk and buy YouTube didn't say, OK, what could we do to get the kids?  They just made a platform and a lot of people write a lot of stuff, some of which really stuck.  And it wasn't any of the stuff Hollywood thought would stick.  Right. Nobody none of the YouTube stars are anybody who's a star at VidCon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Not at all.  And it translates terribly.  Do you remember Miranda? What's her name? Miranda plays or whatever?  No, Miranda. Yeah, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Every time Hollywood plucks a YouTube star and makes tries to make them a TV star.  It's just it's not awesome.  Doesn't awesome.  So I think that's one of the things most interesting about YouTube is how it became a kind of a Darwinian selection,  you know, natural selection for talent and produce something completely different than Hollywood,  which use the opposite process.  You know, they thought of what people would want to watch.  And maybe there's demand for that.  Well, there is more people.  I mean, I don't know who does who has bigger viewership, Hollywood or YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. No, I'm not thinking that.  But I'm thinking like, do I when I want to watch scripted awesome content, unless I'm stuck in an airplane,  I don't watch it on my phone.  So I'm like, do I want to watch something, even if it's silly, but do production, I guess, does production value and paying for it?  Does that matter as much on a phone screen?  And am I going to do I get enough value of watching that in line at the grocery store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know. A lot of money invested in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see. So I'm trying to see how many people watch YouTube in a week or a month versus how many people watch movies.  You have to include TV in that. It would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel like YouTube is bigger now, but maybe not.  I don't know. I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Total number of monthly active users on YouTube is 2 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's OK. No, I'm not bored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just sleepy. You need oxygen.  That's what I always tell people. People go, why are you yawning? Are you bored?  I say, no, no, no, I'm thinking so hard.  I need more oxygen that they don't buy it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, I'll try that.  John Krasinski, he was on The Office, the cute guy in The Office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody loved him.  Then now he's in Amazon Prime.  He's a Tom Clancy action hero.  He created a YouTube channel like one week ago.  He already has more than a million subscribers.  I think his first video has like 4 million downloads.  It's called Some Good News.  That's an example of going in the other direction.  I think because he's such a beloved star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's also a really good director. He did The Quiet Place.  That's right.  That was exceptional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's a good point.  This is very much quarantine humor that he's doing here.  That's going to be a whole new genre, isn't it?  No, I'm laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Quarantine humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's in his office.  It looks like his daughter made his sign behind him.  He's using a desk lamp for his lights.  He did at least put on a tie.  Look at that. 8 million views.  This is two days old.  One and a half million subscribers.  It does go the other direction, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does.  I think you can be a famous celebrity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You bring your tribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why are we saying tribe now?  I say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it obnoxious? Are you telling me I'm obnoxious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, just a lot of my people, especially the marketing people,  they're all about tribes.  Your tribe says tribe?  Yeah. I don't know what's happening there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm upset that the TV people now have fake backgrounds.  I really enjoyed seeing Casey Hunt's color-coded books.  I agree.  TV just insists on going plastic.  Yep.  I tweeted this week that they've run out of COVID B-roll.  We're seeing the same patient, the same thing a million times over and over.  Why don't we get rid of the B-roll?  It's pretty worthless. It's not informative.  It's boring.  But no, we have to have B-roll because we're TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you do have to show people something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not when it's the same damn patient with the mask on.  I've seen that guy a thousand times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know the interesting thing about this Krasinski thing.  Getting on late night, getting the Tonight Show, that's a big deal for a comic.  There's only a handful of them and there are a few shows.  If you've got the Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon made it.  He's made it.  But I look at somebody like John Krasinski who might have had secret desires to have.  He'd be good at it.  He'd probably be very good at it, but nobody's offering it to him or whatever.  So all of a sudden with COVID, Jimmy Fallon's in his 10 with as cheesy as can be.  Suddenly John Krasinski is now, I could do that exact same thing and show them I'm better.  So in effect, this is John Krasinski's bid to be Jimmy Fallon.  He's even doing the same kind of, he's got an over the shoulder graphics he's got.  But it looks just like Jimmy Fallon's Tonight Show from his living room.  So it's an interest. Look at that. He did the turn.  He did the news turn. Why did you do that?  To mock the news turn.  To mock it, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, when you lower production values, it makes it more accessible.  Everybody's equal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even Hollywood stars who get millions of dollars a movie.  I think it's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm on the advisory board, the industry advisory board for VidCon, which was canceled obviously.  And you think about what VidCon really does, and that's what YouTube does,  is this, but it's an entirely different view of celebrity, right?  It's an intimate celebrity.  I get to go have a selfie with this person I like.  And that's what this age enables.  So people feel more connected, I think, with Krasinski than they feel with Jimmy Fallon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Absolutely. Absolutely.  And it's got to scare the hell out of NBC who's saying, well, we got Jimmy today,  but we also have a bunch of 18, 25 year olds who never watch TV.  Ever. Never. Not once. Ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They watch it on YouTube. They watch YouTube.  I mean, they do. They pull the segments that they like on YouTube and they share them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Another reason they don't ever have to watch TV.  Actually, my son would just put it up on the TV, but it was still YouTube.  I think it's got to be terrifying, but I don't know.  Let's see.  Let me do an ad and then I will do the change log, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Then I've got a whole week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I was just thrown a little bit because, you know, Steakums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. The microwave snack.  You want to do that as a teaser?  It's gotten apparently pretty deep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It always has been. I wanted to say that. It's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Brilliant. Steakums has gotten brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They hired Albert Einstein as their social media manager or something.  I don't know. We'll talk about that in just a second. It's weird.  Jeff Jarvis, he is a professor of journalism at the late, limited townite graduate school for journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, we're still there. And let's be clear, because he listens and he noted.  Craig listens? Craig Newmark?  You bet he does. You bet he does. And he noted that you were muffling the name.  So let's be very clear, Leo. What's the name of my school?  Was he mad about it?  No, he was teased.  Fabulous. Fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What's the name of the school?  The Craig Newmark School for Graduate Journalism at the City University of New York.  Yes. Before it was up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  There you go. Craig Newmark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Craig Newmark. Does Craig ever want to come on the show? He doesn't have to listen to the videos?  Oh, yeah, he does. I screwed this up, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I talked to Karsten some time ago, and then I don't think I ever, I might have blundered my fault.  Though Karsten's not here, so I'll find a way to blame Karsten.  I've interviewed Craig. Craig might remember me from way back when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He might remember me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Craig would love to be in now that we're back in the big room. Could we have a guest?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because Leo can't hang out with a physical person.  No, no, I mean an extreme guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He'd be an avatar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK. I was like, no, Jeff, we can't risk Leo.  No, no, I'm not risking Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or Craig for that matter.  No, exactly.  Did it bother Craig when I called it the Craig Newmark School for Graduate Nerdalism?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think you probably like that.  Because Craig is a nerd.  He's the king of them.  So when the name changed at the school, the schwag, I never told you this, I should send it to you.  The schwag we made were Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism Pocket Protectors.  Oh, perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one uses a pocket protector now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Craig is such an amazing story.  He's a Craig of Craig's List, if people don't know. We're kind of acting like everybody knows who he is.  That's Craig of Craig's List.  And what, do they still have like five people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's, last I knew some years ago it was like 20, but it was nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like billions of dollars. Just a handful of people. It's amazing. It's a great story.  Our show today brought to you by, speaking of great stories, this is a great story, ITProTV.  I met the founders of ITProTV at the NAB conference many years ago.  That's one of the good things about conferences, I'll miss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I ask you a question about that? Yeah.  So they're advertising now not so much for the courses they have, which I looked at.  They're still doing.  They're really high-end courses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want people to think they're not doing it, but they're also doing other stuff too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they saw the opportunity and the need here.  Companies want to do internal training and they have no idea how to do it.  So they say, OK, we can be a platform for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's where they're better businessmen than me because that's fascinating.  I should have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, I'm looking at it like I'm like, oh, I could actually use this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, they can help you.  I can set it up, Stacey.  Just, you know, we'll connect you with Tim and Don.  They're great people, really great people.  So I don't what is a steak?  Steak them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know this because my mom used to make the sandwich.  It's pressed processed meat and it comes in sheets.  So it's not actually sandwiches.  It's not actually with Velveeta cheese.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's you're supposed to believe it.  Well, it's like cheesesteak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. OK.  OK. They have an inch taller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here you go. Here's steak them.  Now, the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take them are good.  I had them as a kid, too.  Yeah, it's nice.  I mean, I love cheesesteaks.  OK. It's cheesesteak.  Got it. Yeah.  Well, yeah, that's what became.  Yeah. And it's cheese.  No, no, no, that.  None of that pepper crap on it.  That's that's like a lot of pepper crap.  No, no, no, no. You don't put the peppers on.  You don't put the mushrooms on.  It's cheese and onions, fried onions.  That's it. Look at it.  That's all you're aware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  As I hover over there, I guess we can't.  It's cut off at the top.  But as I hover over.  Well, here we can show this.  But as I hover over their Twitter thing, it says.  Well, let me show you their Twitter thing.  Now, I saw an article in the Wall Street Journal that says Stakeham is misinformation.  But this is good information.  It's good. Yeah.  In times of uncertainty and information, anecdotes are not data.  Good data is carefully measured and collected information based on a range of subject  dependent factors, including but not limited to this is like the scarecrow after he got his brain,  including but not limited to controlled variables, meta analysis and randomization.  What is Stakeham doing here?  What is this is wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have a history of being a little fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is more than fun, though. This is serious.  We're a frozen meat brand posting ads inevitably made to misdirect people and generate sales.  So this is peak irony. But hey, we live in a society.  So please make informed decisions to the best of your ability and don't let anecdotes dictate your worldview.  OK. Did did did Stakeham get involved in something that we don't know about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I think I should do this.  So if you go down on that thread, I think it has an earlier thread to you're looking to an earlier thread somewhere.  No, just the one I put up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I just I went to their Twitter.  Oh, I put up one that has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So there's a couple of threads like this and they're and they're really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a response. Who would have thought frozen meat would be smarter than half of the US population?  So but wait a minute now, because I thought maybe I'm just going to go back in the search results because the Wall Street Journal says Stakeham emerges as an unlikely.  Oh, coronavirus misinformation watchdog.  Watchdog. Ah, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why Leo, you need Stakeham's so they can keep you from making mistakes like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I can read the whole headline instead of the cut off.  You almost made a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that is really wild that Stakeham is now in the job of protecting people from misinformation.  By the way, that's everyone's job to protect.  It is, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I would say I would love to support them, but I cannot eat Stakeham's.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does say something when a frozen meat snack is more presidential than the meathead in the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fifteen and a half thousand retweets, 58,000 likes Stakeham.  Ladies and gentlemen, I there is one adage that I agree with, which is and I read this at the very beginning of this.  People will remember how brands respond to this and brands that respond well will benefit.  But there are a lot of brands, at least initially, I think there may be learning that did not respond well.  And people won't forget quickly.  Not just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm doing a live thing tomorrow with aimed at advertisers.  And I can look up what it's called.  My friend, Dave Morgan's company.  And I'm in my head.  I'm getting ready to have a Jeff fit because the damned advertisers are saying no.  Stacey's backing up are saying no advertising around the word Kovac.  Well, damn you.  It's like you're you can be independent of this and you can be nowhere near this stuff.  And we're living it all our lives and we're seeing this.  No, no, no, I don't be anywhere near that because it'll get you don't get some on me.  Well, support the news where it is and support society.  They need it.  Newspapers are going to die.  News organizations are going to die.  And you don't want to have any of your ads near covid.  If you advertisers, you know what?  I'm going to agree with Jeff.  One hundred percent of this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm like in.  It takes a pandemic to get us to agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I will remember advertisers.  And this is a great time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like a lot of people are going to be like, oh, I'm going to be a good person.  I mean, it's a great time.  Like a lot of brands are doing these social media things like we're all in this together by Dove.  Wash your hands with Dove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's not that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I mean, I don't I don't actually I don't find that as offensive.  But like let's be like take it a full page ad in The New York Times.  Thank the people who are reporting on stuff.  I know the reporters are kind of controversial if our current president.  But I mean, they're essential.  Knowing what's happening in the world and the work they're trying to do to tell you the actual truth.  I mean, right now, that's kind of what's separating us from a dictatorship in the sense that we have someone who is invested in not telling us the truth.  And at least we have journalists like who are like, OK, so I know in the press conference today, he said this, but that's actually not true.  And the situation is more like this.  But without reporters, you have Fox News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's interesting because Stakeham has a budget of one million dollars a year, which is paltry for a brand like Stakeham.  And a couple of years ago, they decided that they were going to take a little bit of a left turn with their social media account.  And I think it's so this is not new.  Apparently, I have not been.  No, no, I was not aware of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some people are.  So, yeah, I knew Stakeham's account.  I was not in the know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And here's here's one from April 6th.  I just see a lot of nonsense on the timeline every day and know it could be hard for individuals to voice this type of stuff.  And for some reason, people are more inclined to listen when it's coming from a brand rather than a person, which is pretty unfortunate.  I mean, it's like Stakeham suddenly became sentient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just it's just sentient foe meat.  It's just bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then somebody posted a can of mixed vegetables responding.  OK, this is why Twitter is OK.  I'm following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter is OK.  Yeah, following Stakeham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Who does like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I had a steak sandwich for much better as my wife's we had grilled the other night and a thinly sliced flank steak, barinated honestly, this cheddar and mustard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think I'm regretting that Stakeham didn't enter the Democratic primary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's not talk about that today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Our time for do you know, Jeff had to play the drums in the trumpet and all that stuff.  You know what to do for that.  He watched me do it last week.  Let's see.  That's a bad start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's time for the Google change log.  You know, I started with the start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Press play.  You got it.  You didn't have autoplay turned on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We get so much, so much fun, so much fun.  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff.  They finally turned on require eyes to be open on the April Pixel 4 update, which I've got to do there with Google was, you know, not attacked, but criticized for the fact that their face recognition worked.  Even if you didn't have your eyes open and it's taken them.  How long has this been?  Six months to finally turn that feature on.  But you want to get your update on your pixel because you and you do generally want that on.  Otherwise, people can hold your phone up to you while you're asleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And oh, yeah, I was going to think, oh, my gosh, the middle school pranks that could ensue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, Jakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have they as your daughter yet got to the stage where they draw on people's faces while they're asleep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That has happened.  I think that that starts very early.  It's such a terrible habit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Have you got have you been TP yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your daughter is the I don't think they TP anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because that's a price.  That's a that's a valuable object.  You don't want to do that.  Of course.  What am I thinking?  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say with all the with all the cameras and doorbell cams, I don't think TP going by the wayside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  That's a huge cultural shift.  I think we talked about this, didn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Maybe you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, no, I'm like, I'm like, oh, I feel like we had this conversation somewhere.  You know what else is over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not Hangouts Meet anymore.  It's Google Meet.  They just snuck that in on us.  So just get used to calling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that the professional one or is that the that's the everyone one?  I think that's the everyone one.  OK, but every is.  Well, we were using Hangouts at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're going to change that to meet.  I don't know if they've done that.  But actually, you know, I still use Hangouts.  You know, maybe they haven't changed it because I use Hangouts because I'm a Google Fi user, but I have not.  I don't use it for a video call.  So I don't know.  That's an interesting question.  Interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a number for Jeff if he wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, don't do.  We're in the we're in the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get your it's change log ish.  OK, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead. Go ahead.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, Leo, say and don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, if it's a show, I don't know what it is.  If it's changed, log ish, do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's changed a lot of things that Google changes because then it's not change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Change log is, you know, when you get the new software and there's a bunch of new features that that's the change log.  OK, I'll wait.  Save it.  It's OK.  Saving it.  Save it.  Don't burn content.  We did burn some content.  We already mentioned Google is giving three months of Stadia probe to YouTube.  Oh, yeah.  Put me to sleep again.  Premium users.  Actually, Stadia Pro, not Stadia Probe.  That's something else.  Google Arts and Cultures app will make your photos look like masterpieces.  I've used this arts and culture app just for the wallpaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did one.  There was a there was a Japanese artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you can you can this is so your your art can be inspired by a great painting.  So, for instance, Edvard Munch is the scream.  You could take this simple thing and make it scream like you could choose from works by artists like Monet, Frida Kahlo and others.  I like this good this Google Arts and Culture.  Hello.  Hello.  So this is always spam anyway.  Yeah.  New feature in Google Arts and Culture where tech meets arts and culture.  And now you can mix.  I always thought it was just about beautiful paintings, but now you can make starry starry night.  Your your picture of the full moon, the pink moon last night.  Look, I thought it was beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  Was it pink where you were?  It was rosy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I kind of had to squint to make it rosy, but I did.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wanted it to be rosy to Google require new Android 11 devices.  This is a big story.  And I'm sure they covered it all about Android to support seamless updates.  This is fantastic news because updating has always been an issue.  And one of the things that keeps people from updating is what I'm going through right now, which is this long reboot process.  What they're going to do is they're going to have two images on your phone.  One of what they call an A B partition.  The new update will be installed behind the scenes on an inactive partition while the current operating system is running.  When you reboot, it just takes the inactive partition, makes it active, keeps the older version, makes it very easy to roll back.  And you can do all these updates kind of behind the scenes without even any interruption.  Just a reboot.  You're going to need double the memory though, right?  Yeah. And that may be why they didn't do it before because it's going to take some storage.  But I don't think the ROMs are all that big.  I mean, nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. And it kind of keeps them in check, I guess.  Of course, it could lead to the faster obsolescence of phones.  I'm just throwing all this out there.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So anyway, I think other vendors will probably do this as well.  It's part of the Android ecosystem.  Actually, I guess Google says they're going to require it.  We already did the machine learning of duo calls.  Google is shutting shutting shutting down neighborly.  And this is Indian app.  So I didn't know.  I was like, what is neighborly?  Yeah.  You know, but it was it was an experiment.  It's too bad because I wish they brought it to the rest of the world.  Truthfully, I prefer Google did it than say the ring doorbell.  But it's gone.  Bye bye.  Hardly knew you.  Bye bye.  Google's speakers and display at local control of smart home devices from Hue, TP Link and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yay. Local control.  We are we were excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You better explain this to me, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, this means that instead of things calling back to the cloud,  you will have control managed from your Google device like home device.  So Google won't know when I turn off my lights.  It's privacy protecting.  It is lowers latency.  And if your network stays up, even though your Internet goes down, you could actually have still control your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's so frustrating when you say echo, turn off my lights.  And it says I can't do that right now.  It's like what?  But that's because I had to go up to the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Stacey Stacey was nice enough to ask answer two questions from Greg Newmark on email last week.  Does that this have any impact on his decision whether to go wise or stay TP Link?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, wise will get there eventually.  OK, TP Link.  I mean, as I told him, TP Link has historically been a little slower with their updates, whereas wise has been faster.  So if you like security updates.  So that's why I said, yeah, if you wanted to, if you care about that sort of thing, and I felt like he might be the kind who does, then he should probably go with wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  According to Android police, other hubs like SmartThings and Wink have done this in the past because they didn't have those servers and all of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And what's really interesting is Google on their on Gboard does actually cloud based.  What NLP natural language processing.  So right now, if you tell Google to do something with your voice, it's possible that it won't actually work because that does actually go up to the cloud.  So what you're looking at is a lot of the automations that you may have said.  So routines.  So before we get too excited, you know, do think about like, are we going to do natural language processing locally?  I don't think they do that yet, but they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And in this diagram, it looks like they're they're taking speech and OK, well, then doing it locally instead of going to the cloud.  They're going right to the device and executing.  So Google is working currently with Phillips, probably signify right for the Hue lights, GE, Wemo, Lifex and TP Link on this SDK.  And we'll open it to all developers starting next month.  So, Craig, you could get this next month.  That's it. This is a good thing.  I like it.  Just faster and more reliable is good.  But as you say, speech may not be faster, more reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, who's it?  It always drives me nuts when I'm like, hey, gee, turn off master bedroom.  And then there's like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, yeah, no, it's you're a mean boss.  They got to hop to it that go on the same experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to wait. I'm going down the hall to go to bed and I say, hey, turn off the lights.  And then I have to stop and wait to see if it happens.  And it's usually a few seconds. Gosh darn it should be like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which no, my, my, my, what a rough life you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First world problem waiting for someone to turn off a switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The clapper worked instantly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google Fit is redesigned to make step tracking more prominent, not less, more prominent, not less.  I don't know if I like that.  I don't know if I care.  What if what if I'm not doing steps?  What do you use as a movement tracker, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was hoping it would arrive by now, but it hasn't yet.  I am using the Fitbit Charge 3 and then you get the new one.  No, this is the three.  The four isn't. It's on sale Monday.  OK, but the Wise Band just shipped yesterday, so that should be coming today or tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we saw that Wise is doing that. I thought that was very interesting.  Are they sourcing that from some Chinese company or are they making it themselves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Undoubtedly sourcing it from some Chinese company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But their model, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they do.  They're going to be on the show next week, so I will ask them all those questions.  Oh, you're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's exciting.  That's not his show.  That's Stacey's IOT show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The other show, Stacey. You call that the other show.  The other show that she does with Kevin.  You could call the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is so much better. So much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's just focused on IOT. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Chrome OS Tablet gets iPad style gestures.  I don't think anybody cares about that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  iPad style gestures. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, notice...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had to say those words to make them make sense for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Notice what they're using there. That's the new Samsung Galaxy Pixel.  My heart, my heart.  Yeah, it's pretty.  You know, the other complaint people made is it's...  And you can see it in this picture.  It's 16.9, unlike Google's, which are 3x2, and it is too wide.  I guess it's all about video because it's 4K.  Haven't we lost that battle?  Yeah, maybe. I have... I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The other problem we didn't talk about is the heat.  Yeah, you did mention the heat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The heat is on.  And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes...  Get ready. Put your finger on it there, Jeff.  The Google changelog.  Oh, man. Oh, man. You are so good.  I didn't want to do this story.  McCarston put it in anyway.  The toilet that recognizes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I put it in there.  No. No. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I already talked about it today. I'm not talking in a second time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No. No.  Let's put it this way. It doesn't have to...  No, I'm not putting it up.  It doesn't have to see your face.  It doesn't have to see your face.  It just has to see your butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It sees something else that's unique to you.  And it knows it's you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They could use weight just like a scale does.  They could.  It changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It also has a camera to take a picture of your poop.  That's not unusual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it measures it against the Bristol scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it weighs it on the Bristol...  What is this...  Okay. Now you open this scale of worms.  You got to look up the Bristol scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  This is how you measure the quality of your poop.  The Bristol scale.  I think it's one to five scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, stop. Let's stop.  It's good. I don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. One second there. Seating time.  Well, now men are going to come off bad at that because we sit there to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is not healthy for your bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You think men do that but women don't?  Right.  Is that true? Is that a gender difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. You shouldn't do it. It's not healthy for your bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can tell right there. I say I read and she's yelling at me.  Yeah, she is already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not yelling at you. I'm just saying that that's not healthy for you.  It's bad for your butt.  It promotes hemorrhoids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this story was promoted, I won't say by whom, as a look up anal print.  No.  And that's what it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do not. Whatever you do, do not Google that.  That is just a recipe for disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got worried. I came up with this. It was a scientific paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stop. Here's what happened.  Stanford researchers, they invented a toilet that can analyze your poop and pee.  They do this in a couple ways.  There are several cameras on a toilet seat cover that looks at your poop.  And they also have done a machine learning algorithm that recognizes your anal print  because they wanted to distinguish between different people who are sitting on the toilet.  All of this data is encrypted, but it is stored in the cloud.  They also track things like urine flow.  And I don't think they track the quality, the analysis of the urine,  like some of the things we saw at the CES does.  That is the whole story. Now, everyone has the facts.  It doesn't exist as a real product. Please let us never speak of it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And I will leave this...  Well done, Stacey.  Please let us never speak of it again.  How adult of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's another thing not to Google, which is the Bristol Scale.  But you will get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the Bristol Scale is very important to know for overall physical health.  You should know about the quality of your poop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was always told that that was a trait of the German people, Jeff.  You would know this.  And in fact, their toilets have little shelves on them so you can inspect your daily...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very strange. It's very strange, those toilets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I do not want to look. I do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No.  All right. Boy, I really have to apologize to everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, Carsten...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually should just let it go.  Carsten could have got blamed.  That's what I say every time I go to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let it go.  Okay. It is time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wait, hold on. I misspoke.  The Bristol Scale is seven.  I thought it was five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, you actually have looked it up as I did.  But please, let's not get any more than that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay. Moving. Right.  I'm going to be locked in quarantine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why do I have the urge to sanitize my hands at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you should. If I were an advertiser, instead of COVID, I would not want to be next to the Bristol Scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's probably in the contract, things you will not be next to.  And that's one of them right there.  It's science.  It's science. Everybody poops, as the book says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think about the poor research assistants and what they have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, someone had to train a machine.  You have to have data to train them on that.  And I'm like, aren't we really that different?  Where did they get the data set?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where did they get the data set?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If only I had studied more in my classes, I could have been solving coronavirus instead of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the point of the show where we do what we call the back of the book.  Stacey gets a pick.  Do you have a pick, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was going to have a number because it's actually Google related.  We can all do numbers. I don't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Numbers are good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So well, and I also thought I would have my wise thing right now to show you all, but I don't.  I don't.  So six million is my number.  And that is Google's G Suite now has six million paying businesses up from five million last year.  This is notable because now there are six million people who are unhappy.  Who are pissed like me.  Normal services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a good number.  Well done, Stacey. Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff is very happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Psychoanalyzed properly.  All right. Now, since she did something for me, I'm going to do something for Stacey.  OK, because I want I didn't put this in the notes, but I'll use this.  I want her to Stacey's plane.  The opening up of the six gigahertz band for unlicensed Wi-Fi use.  What does that do for us, boss?  Wi-Fi 6E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wi-Fi 6 enhanced. So this is OK.  This is in the yeah, like you said, in the six gigahertz band.  What this is going to do is it's only going to allow devices that are running Wi-Fi 6 and that have the capability to run in that band to run there.  So it's going to be like a super fast lane.  It's like a toll lane without a toll.  Right. And the way that the.  It's using OFDM. So the way that the frequency this is modulated is going to make it so your packets don't.  This is actually with Wi-Fi 6 in general, I believe.  It's a new way to to handle the packet flow so they don't have to line up and wait to be handled by the router.  They can all go simultaneously.  And then so you can do all the benefits of Wi-Fi 6.  And now you get its own separate band.  So you're going to see this in laptops, gaming rigs, computers, think, think things that need a lot of bandwidth.  It's not going to propagate well through walls.  So, you know, and it's so high frequency.  Yeah, because it's higher frequency.  But really, the benefit is if you are like a two point four gigahertz device, you're not even going to see this.  You can't even get on with your old school janky self.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course not. So which is actually good because it means it will have the band to itself.  Let's congest congestion.  And that's actually goes hand in hand with less propagation, too.  So your neighbors won't be impinging on your Wi-Fi either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have been pinged upon my Wi-Fi for the very last time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, the moral of this and I mentioned this before, though, the FCC votes on this April 23rd.  I think it's a given. They'll say yes.  But the moral of this already have chips out.  So we're hoping so better say yes.  The moral of this, though, is we wouldn't have Wi-Fi if the FCC had not allowed an unregulated spectrum.  Two point four gigahertz.  They were thinking baby monitors and, you know, wireless phones.  But as it turned out, some smart people were able to develop Wi-Fi based on it without having to get FCC approval and all of that stuff.  And so it's good to have unregulated band for people to innovate on.  And I think it's great to vote on this and say yes.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a lot of drama, like probably six years ago actually about this.  Like people were very upset that we were talking about bringing more unlicensed spectrum.  Who had six gigahertz spectrum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was it are they taking away from anybody?  Was that TV?  No, it's way too high for anything useful.  I don't know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not going to make something up.  I did know this at one time, but I don't know it now.  It's such a high frequency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't, you know, it wouldn't be useful.  I think it's the Navy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like it's a military defense department.  And see, I don't have my spectrum chart up in my office because it's in a frame and it's nice.  There will be a battle because some have said there should be a spectrum auction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they're not going to do a spectrum auction for this.  They're just going to say do what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't propagate well enough to have a conflict problem, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, no, there's always a conflict problem.  There's always a conflict problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you've listened to the show, you know nothing but that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's already used fixed point to point common carrier, fixed satellite broadcast auxiliary and cable television relay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're going to use.  Oh, that's right.  They're going to use a spectrum.  It's a line of sight thing.  So, you know, I know they're going to have a database, I believe.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember white spaces?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we developed a new system for that.  I think they're going to do that for this.  So that's good.  I think it's a good thing.  My pick of the week is a quarantine pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was going to be my sewing machine.  Maybe it will be in the future when I get it.  But I want to tell you about a website that you'll like, Stacey, called Bread Scheduler.  So there's a big problem when you're making stuff.  It takes a long time.  It's a long rise.  And you got to time it out with your life.  Bread Scheduler lets you take your favorite bread recipe and figure out what the optimum time, for instance, weekday sourdough bread, 23 hours to make, best to start at 8 p.m.  And they give you a little Gantt chart.  This is why I knew you'd like this, Stacey.  Gantt chart!  Yay!  And you could say at the ideal time, you could say if I start it, I'll start the artelise at 8 p.m., I'll saw it at 8.30, I'll stretch and fold at 8.45, cover and rest at 9.45, get up at 7.45, divide and pre-shape, shape and proof at 8 a.m.  The bake begins at 8 p.m.  tomorrow night if I started 8 tonight.  And that's what we're talking about.  That's what we're talking about.  That is really intense.  That takes all the kind of like organic pleasure out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's, you know, I've started the bread at the wrong time and you don't ever want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're going to be baking this bread at 3 a.m., folks.  So this has recipes.  It has the little Gantt chart.  It has the little Gantt chart.  It has step by step.  This actually is great.  I know a lot of you are looking at sourdough bread.  There are other styles.  There's tartine style, which takes even longer because they have very long.  Oh, no, it's only eight hours.  That's nice.  Oh, yeah, because he doesn't.  That's less.  Yeah, that's less.  He does these long rises that I really like.  There's county fair sourdough.  Also a tartine recipe.  Overnight weekend bread.  Everybody ought to have some overnight weekend bread.  So if you've been doing a bread baking and you've got a little sourdough, and incidentally, if you go to the website, there's a whole sourdough.  Make a starter that takes 84 hours.  I think that's longer than it takes to make a baby, I think.  But I might be wrong on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, it takes five, four to five days.  So, yeah, no, I know.  I'm kidding.  And I have a starter.  I've been at my starter has been doing so well.  And it only takes a few seconds to make a baby.  Well, OK, so maybe for Andrew, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the make a starter, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a great thing.  One of the things about starters is you feeding them all the time.  So they're always getting bigger.  So you have to find things to do with your starter.  And if it's not bake a loaf of bread every day, maybe you'll do what I did and have sourdough pancakes for breakfast.  They're quite good.  I made the pandemic sourdough ones from the Boing Boing with the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it Brandy Grand Marnier in there?  Oh, yum.  Delicioso.  Breadscheduler.com.  It solves a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are you doing, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had I had a deer going berserk in the backyard on that.  Oh, that's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to show you my berserk deer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had we the animals are getting a little lively.  I feel like they're thinking we're going to get to eat these people pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had a giant turkey looking in my window in my kitchen this morning.  I mean, giant, huge, huge.  I would show you, but I don't think it's propagated yet to my Google Photos site.  Let's see.  No, it hasn't.  But it was a beautiful.  I can't get how do you force propagation to Google Photos?  You have to open Google Photos.  That's the iPhone anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It doesn't it doesn't propagate.  Are you using an iPhone?  No, you're using an Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm using a Google device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It should be faster.  Yeah, it should just happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know why.  Maybe you don't have it turned on.  Maybe you don't have it turned on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you have to be on a Wi-Fi network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could turn that off if you want.  It's more oxygen there, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know what to say to y'all.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I don't know what to say to y'all.  Just say goodbye, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you for being here.  We do this week in Google.  Hey, every Wednesday, 1 30 p.m. Pacific 4 30 p.m. Eastern 2030 UTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What?  I feel kind of attacked by that.  You did a number.  I thought you were.  I thought your number.  You did six gigahertz.  No, that was that was just being nice to Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do a number.  I have a very fast number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It just came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just saw it on Twitter.  New number.  I didn't see it.  New number.  My number is Space Force debuts on Netflix.  May 29.  Wait a minute.  What?  Wait, is that television?  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that our space force?  Trump?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the funny thing is the show is getting out before the Space Force is Steve  Carell.  Oh, my God.  Photos photos at that tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this looks awesome.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I said I knew you'd love it.  Oh, my God.  Steve Carell in uniform.  I love him.  I love him.  I love him.  Steve Carell in uniform.  I love a man in uniform.  Jimmy O Yang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He has the actual Space Force logo, which was ripped off from Star Trek on his four  star jacket.  Oh, and it has some of the other great people.  Who wrote this?  Because this looks like it.  Oh, my God.  Look who's in it.  John Malkovich as the professor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, Malkovich was in something I was watching.  It was so surprising.  I almost fell off my couch, but I cannot remember what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's a surprising fellow.  That's what John Malkovich is.  He he likes to play against type.  OK, I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I just wanted to get to make sure you put that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wish they probably rushed it.  They're hoping that COVID won't end before May 29th.  And I think you're going to win following Space Force at real Space Force on the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I started off with a lovely rendition of Les Mis before the show, and then we end with Space Force.  You're all so welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's going to be awesome.  That isn't even on the Bristol scale.  So every Wednesday, one thirty Pacific to thirty four thirty Eastern twenty one twenty  thirty UTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whatever it's on some time.  We don't know.  We don't care.  It's all the same.  It's a Tuesday.  We don't know anymore.  Is it?  I don't know.  Is morning.  We have no idea.  It's just on some time.  You're not going anywhere either.  So subscribe and just listen to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've heard from many people that the only way they know what day it is is by our broadcast  schedule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, I have to thank everybody because like last week, I think it was I was super glum  and I was like, oh, you know, and then I said that it made my day because somebody had reached  out and said, you know, I was a positive, nice person for them to listen to and that  there were lots of people that I was a positive, nice person and that all of us were positive,  nice people and they loved the show.  So the show fans are all positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is your buddy show.  This is a show where your buddies get together and we have fun and we talk about poop and  stuff like that.  By the way, Lisa Kudrow is also going to be on Space Force.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Oh, gee.  And it's produced by Greg Daniels, co-creator of The Office.  So it's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I cannot wait.  I'm glad they managed to get the production before they had to keep six feet apart.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This looks really, really good.  It's straight to series picked up in January 2019.  It's a workplace comedy.  It's going to be like The Office is going to be a mock doc centered around the people  tasked with creating a sixth branch of the armed service space force.  And it was in fact sparked by Trump's June order.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Kudrow, who has turned down many offers to star in broadcast network pilots, will be  a recurring character in the series.  That is Maggie Naird, the wife of Steve Carell's wife.  He's General Mark R. Naird.  She's a Washington Air Force wife who has sublimated parts of herself to her husband's  career for two decades.  But as he takes on his biggest challenge, she's growing in a different direction.  Oh, it's going to be fun.  It's Space Force, Space Force.  Hey, one more quick note before we go on.  You should have said something, Jeff.  I didn't know this.  We do an AMA.  We have been since the quarantining began with our hosts.  Chance to ask people things and so forth.  This week, it's going to be Jason Howell from All About Android, Mac Break Weekly's Andy  Anakko, and this guy over here, Jeff Jarvis.  It'll be 1130 a.m. on Friday, that specific time.  Ask me anything.  I won't be there.  So ask Jeff anything that's coming up.  I'm excited.  Ladies and gentlemen, because this is a podcast, you can watch us live.  If that's the only way you can figure out what day it is, you've got my blessing.  We will be on the Twitch stream.  Twitch.tv slash live is audio and video.  You can also ask your Amazon Echo.  A lot of people do that.  They go Echo.  What day is it?  And Echo starts playing the show.  You know, it's Wednesday.  Nice.  You can get on demand versions of the show from our website, Twitch.tv.  In this case, it's Twitch.tv slash twig.  But you don't have to go through all that trouble.  If you just go, it's a simple thing.  You only do it once.
