Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How's the fundraising going? Fundraising is going really, really well. We're in the upper 900s now. We're trying to hit 1,000, so check out ThinkUp.com. But yeah, it's going great. Great to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also here, normally Jeff Jarvis would be here, but he is unfortunately stuck in Basel, Switzerland. So, and the internet quality was terrible. So, hey, we got somebody great though for you. Matthew Ingram from GigaOm is here. Hi, Matthew.  Hey, how are you doing?  The boxing glove is still on the doorknob, just in case.  Don't make me use them.  Just in case.  So, I don't really know what to make of this. I think it's kind of fascinating.  Google's Motorola division, makers of the Moto X phone, pushed something onto my phone today.  They started pushing it out yesterday, and I think it's, I don't think it's on other droids. I think it's only on the Moto X.  And it's an animation they made with former Pixar animators that is designed to be played back on a smartphone.  And it's very interesting. Now, this morning when I got up, there was a little red hat bouncing around all over the phone. I mean, it wasn't like just, it was everywhere. It was down in the buttons and you couldn't miss it.  I played the video, but I'll play it again.  Did you know what it was, Leo, when you saw that?  I had, somebody had said on Google+, a couple of days earlier, install this thing. And you'll see why. And then I'd started seeing some articles, but I wasn't really quite sure what I was going to get.  So, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A friend saw it, and he tried to uninstall it or get rid of it several times, and it kept coming back. He didn't know what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I don't think they told anybody. It's kind of like a little serendipitous surprise. It's an animation made with John Pinkava called Windy Day. And I'll replay it.  So you tap the hat, and then you get something kind of odd. See, there's that hat. That was what it was like. Little red hat floating around. Let me turn up the-  Like on top of your home screen.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then it's accelerometer enabled. So as I turn, this is going to be kind of hard to play back, but I can look up, I can look down, I can look left, I can look right.  Is it 360?  Yeah. And eventually you'll find- I don't think I'll be able to do it on camera. There's the hat. Some really great- I don't know if this is Django Reinhardt or just a Django Reinhardt clone, but some really great Django music comes up.  And there's a little mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So does it play when you stop moving?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you don't find the mouse, it doesn't start.  Okay.  And so you find the mouse, and you'll see, I have to follow the mouse to follow the action.  This is a really interesting use of a smartphone for an animated short. And by the way, it's a Pixar quality animated short. It's a great animated short.  Turn away and then come back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact, there are parts of this where you lose the mouse and you have to find him. And the action does not proceed until you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you interact with it? Other than-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't think so. I keep tapping it and stuff. The problem is, there's no way I can show this on the show because you actually- I mean, can you show me?  You literally start doing this to watch it. You're turning around. Oh, there. Oh, I just found- Oh, now I can't show you.  It is a very personal experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what did you install the other day to get this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't even know if I had to. I think it just arrived without- Matthew, did your friend-  Yeah, I think it just showed up. It just showed up.  So I knew that something was coming, so I installed an app called Motorola. Let me see if I can- It was the weirdest thing. It was the weirdest thing because when I- Did you see the hat flying around?  When I installed the app, it disappeared. It didn't show up in my apps listing, so I didn't know what- I couldn't launch it. I couldn't figure it out. It was like Motorola Animator, Motorola Play or something like that.  And then a widget showed up in my widget list that was this little hat. So I put the widget on the desktop. It turned out I didn't need to because when the- Oh, and see, now it's installed again.  It does it after you play it. It installs it again on the desktop so that you can replay the movie.  There is a- This is called Spotlight Stories. What happens when our engineers get together with Oscar-winning artists? You get a new kind of story in the making. We can't wait to show you. Love Moto X. And presumably, there are going to be more of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve Levy wrote about it in Wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really interesting. The fact that they would invest- I mean, they've clearly invested a lot in this. This is part of their marketing, right? I'm sure this is included in their half-billion-dollar marketing budget.  Because they only can do it on a Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was actually wishing that the Nexus would do it. I'd like to check it out.  This is super cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is cool, but okay. It is really cool. And I love Pixar shorts, right? But do I want something flying around on my homescreen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no. If you're a grump, the first thing you tap it and you can disable it immediately and uninstall it.  And it'll never bother you again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so you can say, don't show this to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't want to see this.  Okay.  But if you- I wouldn't because I think from now on I'm going to get serendipitously new stories every once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and can you say, show me this later? I'm curious, but I'm trying to go down with the life right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just did that. And what it does is it puts then a widget on your desktop. So who doesn't love a red hat? Add Shark Cart.  And then no more ever. Please don't play. You can uninstall it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just curious about- my mind of course goes directly to the sort of technical implementation of an app that can run itself and have permission to run over your homescreen.  Worse than that. Install itself.  Install itself and then launch and have permissions to run over your apps, over your homescreen.  File over your homescreen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a virus.  That's interesting to me.  It's a benign virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's a really attractive virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a really attractive virus. It's a really cute virus. I just like as an app developer, I'm going to make an app that can float above my windows, above your existing windows.  I have to explicitly list that as a permission, which is a requirement of my app.  And then you as a user, when you install my app, have to accept that that's okay. But you're not- but Motorola is bypassing all of that, right?  And installing this thing on your phone and then running it. I mean, I think that's the part of this that I'm a little bit like, it's really cute, but ehh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I wonder how many people are going to react the same way my friend did where they're just going to think, what the hell is this stupid hat?  Because they don't know and it doesn't really tell you. And so they'll just get irritated.  And I mean, that's not a great experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could totally- I understand completely understand what you're going to say, what you're saying and agree with you.  And I also could see the guys doing this going, come on, it's just a little fun.  It's just a little fun.  It's a way to make you smile.  Don't you trust? I mean, that's the problem is that it assumes that you have to you have to trust them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I do, you know, when I read about it in Wired, it's a fascinating, like the funny thing is we've had these capabilities for what years now.  And yet there are very, very few applications like that are that are trying to take advantage of those things to sort of do something interesting, not just to track your footsteps, but to do something sort of different in the way we interact with information or entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's the other thing. That's exactly what my reaction was.  Wow. Why hasn't anybody done this before? It's almost it's virtual reality.  You're looking through the screen and you're and there's points in the movie where you're you know, there's something going on and they wait for you and you're like, where are they? Where'd they go?  And you find them. I think it's a great imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine that kind of thing on Google Glass. Yeah, it'd be fascinating if you could overlay something like that on your real surroundings as you move around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're calling this a new artistic medium. And I don't think that that's unfair because they have to design this animation with an open world, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it reminds me of Chrome experiments. You know, we say when we see those HTML5 experiments that take take advantage of all the sort of rendering and graphics capabilities.  And you know, whenever I see those Chrome experiments, I think, why aren't more people doing this? Why don't we see more people rather than the Google team showing off what's possible?  You know, which is the point, right? Of things like Chrome experiments is to show developers, hey, this is something that you can do.  And so this kind of reminds me. But what is this exactly? We say what technology is this? Is this a special Motorola based player or runtime thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a Google moonshot. Or actually, it's a Motorola moonshot.  Yeah, it's not clear what the technology is. That's from their Advanced Technology and Products Group, which appeared with Motorola at the same time as Google bought them.  So it was, you know, Google inspired. And they hired the director of DARPA. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, so now I'm really going to be grumpy. I got it. It's a very cute video, but it's not a moonshot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know, Gina, if you invented a new medium of artistic expression that was that could that required a accelerometer based smartphone with I think that's that's kind of interesting.  I mean, I don't think that that's non-trivial. OK, maybe not a moonshot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. There's there's non-trivial and then there's moonshot. Right. Like there's a difference. But yeah, no, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think it could be handled much better. I think they probably should have made this opt in.  In some way, you know, say send that send everybody an email saying, hey, you have a Moto X phone. Would you like to participate?  Maybe they did. And I didn't see that, but I don't think they did. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, but we see that accelerometer based kind of exploration in Google Earth and Google Maps. I mean, we've seen that before.  I mean, I think it's a feat of animation. It's a it's a really it's really cute and really cool.  But, you know, I don't know that the moonshot thing just jealous you don't have a Moto X. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? You know what it makes me think of, though?  Maybe it's because it's a mouse, but it makes me think of the first days of, you know, Steamboat Willie Mickey Mouse when he was just hand-drawn animation.  And you imagine how far we've come with that and what Disney is capable of doing now.  Just imagine like this this same type of thing, except five years from now, 10 years from now, you know, devices like Google Class and whatnot.  It's it's I think it could be pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very intriguing. It's it's it's they call it an immersive short.  And it is immersive because you have to you're looking around.  I'm surprised games haven't done something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was actually what it reminded me of or not.  Not the game, not this. But there were some guys at MIT that were trying to overlay.  I think it was Quake or something like that on your actual surroundings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Good. Where a vibe augmented reality kind of thing.  Yeah, there's a lot. I think there's a lot of that going on in the world.  I thought this was great. And, you know, it's funny is you can't show it.  I cannot show you. You can't show it on a Web page.  It's it requires I have experienced it myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I mean, it looks really delightful.  It looks like they really did pull off like a kind of fun, delightful experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very Pixar. It sounds like they spent a ton of dough on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Must have spent a lot of money on this because I got the guy who did Ratatouille or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the co-director Ratatouille. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So when you get to the end, is there a call?  Is there any sort of call to action or share this or anything like that?  It's just a short and then the only call to action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, this is the call to action right here is what pops up after you've played it once.  Miss anything? Replay. The hat suits you. Add shortcut. Oops, sorry.  And please don't play this ever again uninstalled.  Those are the three. There's no share this.  There's a buy a hat or anything.  Yeah, there is a learn more page where you can read more.  You can disable it on learn more page.  I mean, there's a privacy policy attached.  It says, and I think this is good, Motorola Spotlight Stories.  That's what this is called.  Do not deliver ads to your device or access any of your personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they'd have to be very careful about that, especially if they're going to install it without asking you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, now somebody in the chat room says, and this may be true, that it's pre-installed on the Moto X, but you have, but it's so uses it.  And I installed the app, but apparently I already had it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. Oh, I see the Motorola Spotlight player is actually in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's in the Google Store.  In the Play Store. Yeah, I went and got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it says incompatible with all of my devices.  Yeah. Whoops.  You have to have a Moto X.  Yeah, for the Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a very interesting way to sell a specific brand.  Because, you know, I mean, I think there are definitely some people who will, like Gina, say, well, I don't want that.  But there are also some people who say, well, that's kind of interesting. Can I see that?  You have to have a Moto X?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I'm really interested to see what, you know, what they come up with in the future.  Like what other sort of things they can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a mixed bag because I completely understand what you're saying, Gina, and I agree with you.  This is, I think there probably could have been handled better.  There should have been some explicit opt-in.  But I think I understand what they wanted. They wanted a surprise.  They wanted to. And this is kind of a marketing idea.  Just kind of pleasant surprise, pleasantly surprise or, you know, unexpected, serendipitous kind of joy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder what kind of responses they're getting from users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. This has just happened.  So I haven't seen a lot of people sharing it, but that's partly because probably a lot of people don't have a Moto X.  I, I, I, I for one like it.  I'm happy I have it.  And I can't and I hope that they every month or so give us a new one.  It's an attractive virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it'd be interesting if they let you interact with it a bit more.  Maybe do like a, I know I've been doing and of course they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, it could be location aware.  Have you tried Google's Ingress?  Yeah, I played Ingress for a while.  Chad's played it too. Did you stop playing, Chad?  Yeah, I stopped.  It's a lot of work.  It is a lot of work. Yeah.  Pandre is way into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He travels a lot.  He travels a lot. He, I mean, he, he says he's lost weight because of it.  The problem is that Chad and I are pretty much stuck in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And what Ingress is, is a game you have to get an invitation.  I think you still do to play it.  There's a good Google group about it if you want to read what people are up to.  You install it on an Android device.  It uses location awareness.  It uses augmented reality.  You go to, I think it's always public places like in Petaluma it's the post office.  Right. It can't, yeah.  You have to collect these.  And you have to take them over.  You hack these teams. There's enlightened and resistance.  Right.  You join a team at the very beginning and you're fighting for these places.  So if you're enlightened, you go and resistance controls it.  You and others have to hack the place to take it back.  And you can expand your territory by adding other places.  And then the territory boundaries are defined by those places.  It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I signed up.  I signed up and I get the emails and stuff, you know, and it says, here's your assignment.  And you have to go and do this thing.  But I'm busy doing something else.  And then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting. So Robert plays it.  A lot. Yeah.  I mean, I was very intrigued by it.  It'd be great if you were on a bicycle and you lived in, say, San Francisco or New York City.  You might play it in Brooklyn, Gina, when you move because...  Yeah. Yeah.  Then there's all these other spots and you go around and it's probably much more active.  It's not so good in a small town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the location aspect though.  Again, there's very few people sort of experimenting with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an innovative game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, something simple that they could do with a short like that is...  I don't know if you guys have noticed, but when you launch Google Now,  the header image is contextual.  So like, I live near the beach.  So like at sunset, I'll actually get a picture of, you know, sort of a pink sky and sunset.  You know, I'll see like the water.  When I'm in New York, I see a cityscape.  They clearly have morning, nighttime and daytime images.  You know, they're just header images.  They're just, you know, cartoons.  And I feel like, you know, like right now, you're just getting...  That's the standard daytime in California.  You got a balloon.  Yeah. Yeah, the ocean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google doodles have showed up there.  So, some of the Google doodles will show up there.  I don't know what the criteria are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They could definitely do something like a background that's dark or light or sunset or whatever.  And then in the background of the hat, the windy day video.  Which isn't as far as, you know, Ingress, which is based on, you know, your actual maps.  I mean, actually Google Earth or Google Maps integration would be awesome.  But like, it's all there, right?  Maybe with Earth.  All the pieces are there, yeah.  Yeah, all the pieces are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is so cool.  If you were a kid, this would be magical to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  I can't wait to show out of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, you have to find the hat.  And you go, what's going on?  It's almost like mist or something.  I don't know.  I can't really show you guys because if I tilt it and aim it at the camera, it's a little bit off camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's way easier than mist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's much easier than doing anything.  And I love the music.  But you don't even know how big the download was or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't tell you anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder how much bandwidth is used enough for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  I mean, isn't that a point?  You see how it gets you to follow it?  It gets you to follow it around.  I have to turn it to follow the action.  Nineteen megabytes, according to Boeing.  It's also funny.  This mouse wants to wear this red hat.  And he's having trouble.  So you have to find it.  You're going to lose it.  I have to turn it to find it.  How can I?  Is there any way I can?  You need three cameras there.  I know.  How can I?  I can't show you.  And by the way, if I stay over here, nothing will happen.  I have to go over because the bear shows up.  There's the bear.  You can kind of see him.  And then there's a squirrel, I think.  Yeah, there's a bunch of different characters.  He flies through the air at one point.  There's a squirrel, not the bear.  It's the squirrel, right?  I just love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Jason just gives me a link to someone who recorded it using Google Glass.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  Well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you can follow it around.  Of course, we get an ad.  Well, I like that.  It says, don't go to the gym.  So I guess you win.  Maybe skip like a third.  You know.  So that's good with Glass.  So how would he do?  Oh, I see.  He's turning around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he's following it around again.  And it's going to get real crazy in a second.  I lost it when I first did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, is this something you're going to do more than once?  Is it something you're going to do multiple times?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.  What you're going to do is you're going to give it to people.  He's even having trouble following it, apparently.  Yeah.  Look down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  It gets very...  Oh, there's a ton of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  It's about what?  About five or six minutes.  It's a short.  It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it raises all sorts of questions.  But this is typical of Google, isn't it?  That they push the envelope and then people go, whoa, that crossed the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or look, the Motorola Story app player was probably pre-installed on your Moto X, right?  Yeah.  With the permissions already accepted.  And updated.  And they would just push the story down.  Yeah.  So maybe this isn't an issue.  This isn't a privacy issue.  It doesn't say...  I was concerned that they were bypassing Android's app installation security thing where they  prompt you, is this okay?  But maybe they're not doing that at all.  Maybe it was pre-installed on your Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess that's what it was.  Although it's an invisible icon you don't see as an app so you can't uninstall it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's kind of bogus.  But we've seen that happen before.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cool.  It's really kind of cool.  It's a little bit like Ice Age.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  That's Motorola's spotlight and only about 1% of you can even play that.  That's also a little unusual.  Ultimately, this is a marketing tool to get people to at least consider a Moto X.  Yeah.  I tell you, it's still my favorite phone ever.  I don't know what it is about it.  It's just appealing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was trying one out and my oldest daughter now wants one.  She wants to trade in her iPhone.  She wants a Note?  At a Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She wants to trade in her iPhone for Moto X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it appeals to iPhone users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she likes it.  She was thinking about the Samsung S4, but it's quite large and her hand is very small.  The Moto X is a nice size.  Just the right size.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's just right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've had a few guests on All About Android come on and say, yeah, Moto X, my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard to ... On paper, it doesn't appeal.  It's medium specs and all that.  Speaking of which, whereas I can't wait, and you know me, I'm on the next one.  Moto X is five, but where is it and why can't we buy it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like everything that you need to know about it, we already know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all leaked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's supposed to be tomorrow or Thursday, but I expected Google to schedule an event to announce it, and that didn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's one thing I think we can pretty much be sure of.  It will be in short availability.  So you're going to want to order it the minute it appears on the Play Store.  How are we going to know?  You're going to watch Twitter or Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can set up an if this, then that.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Let's do it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually did that with Twitter's S1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw Pocketrusting said that, and that works.  You got the push?  Yeah, it was a little late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is if I filter Twitter now on Nexus 5, I'm going to see a million posts.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is ifttt.com, if this, then that.  The this ...  Let's see.  What would be the best thing to plug into?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  RSS on what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google Play Store having RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.  Oh, that would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And their devices.  I don't think that they do, though.  No.  If they had an RSS feed of devices.  They hate RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they use the Google Twitter account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that might be it.  Yeah, maybe.  All right.  So let me ...  Twitter.com.sysgoogle.  I'll do Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll start with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't announce it, right?  And then a new tweet, new favorite tweet, new tweet by you, new tweet by you.  No, these aren't the triggers I want.  New tweet by you.  So how did you do it, Matthew?  You were looking for text in a tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looking for, yeah, S1 in an RSS update at the SECs at Edgar.  So I don't know what would be the ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want an RSS feed, don't you?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There aren't RSS feeds for tweets anymore, are there?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you can hack one up, but I don't think they provide them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, here we go.  App.net.  Can't do it on Twitter.  Apparently the API has been restricted enough now that it's not part of this and that.  But I can say new post by anyone with a hashtag.  So I'm going to do hashtag Nexus5.  I need a better ...  But App.net is so small that probably that's not going to overwhelm me.  And then I'll send myself a text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're getting a lot of texts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could have a phone call.  Well, where should I put it?  Where should I put it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just looking for the search results for Nexus5 on Twitter and ...  There's a lot of them.  There's a lot of them, yeah.  Two minutes ago, three minutes, four minutes, five minutes.  I'm sending myself a text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Send me an SMS.  And in that SMS ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Leo's phone blows up.  You could add other terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you could add Google Play Store.  You could add ...  I don't want to miss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's only for a couple of days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what you do.  Hire somebody on TaskRabbit to just refresh the Google Play Store over and over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here from our chat room, from Cosmic Arbiter in our chat room.  On XDA Developers, I made a script to alert me when the Nexus5 was available.  It's a Python script that watches seven different pages and posts notifications when it detects a change with a text, Nexus5,  and then posts a message using a Twitter account.  So this is the Twitter account you should follow, at N5stock.  See? Done.  The cool part about this is you can easily get push notifications in the Twitter account.  So let's take a look at N5stock on Twitter and see if there's anything.  Here, it just added, based on the leaks Thursday.  Yeah, this is just people talking.  I'm going to follow N5stock, that's for sure.  I love hackers.  Someone had to have done it.  I wrote a Python script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was all I needed to do.  It's obvious.  Why didn't you think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the Android Police folks are saying it's going to happen tomorrow morning between 8.30, 8 and 10 a.m.,  probably no later than 11 a.m. Pacific tomorrow.  So just to recap, what do we know about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Nexus5, we first saw a picture when they put KitKat out in the Google Play Store.  It's an LG-based phone.  It looks pretty big, maybe 4.5 inches to 5.5 inches.  It looks pretty big.  We have seen a benchmark now, one of the gaming benchmarks,  that showed it to be the second fastest GPU after the iPhone 5S.  Of course, it'll run KitKat.  1920 x 1080 display on a 4.95 inch screen is what one rumor says.  8 megapixel camera, 1.3 megapixel front-facing.  It'll be Snapdragon 800, of course, quad core.  And black and white.  Black and white, 16 and 32.  But, and this is one of the most interesting rumors, for all of that,  and that would be a top-of-the-line, spec-wise phone,  except with the exception of the camera maybe,  And the last Nexus was very cheap too.  Makes it very desirable.  Unlocked.  That's cheap.  Yeah, that's cheap.  It's kind of like a G2, but for a lot less money.  445 pixels per inch, says this leak anyway.  That's the highest PPI I have ever seen.  I'm not sure if it's a good thing, but it's a good thing.  It's a good thing.  So that's why we're all saying, oh, when will it be out?  Because we know that you'll be able to order it for five minutes  before they're out of stock.  We just want to be there for that first five minutes.  Yeah, yeah.  I think an IFTTT recipe is an order.  So you got to set up without that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't gotten any texts yet, so.  Task rabbit.  Task rabbit is probably the best.  I mean, I'm not sure if it's a good thing.  I mean, I'm not sure if it's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Task rabbit.  Task rabbit is probably the best way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People are, yeah, task rabbit, it's right.  Mechanical Turk.  Do you think that's a legitimate price?  350 for unlocked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, do I think that that price is real?  It seems so low.  It seems low.  It does seem low.  It seems wishful to me.  Wishful thinking.  But I hope I'm proved wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  What would be the most?  I mean, if we're market priced to be 650 bucks, right?  Right.  So it's going to be the next, I think it's fair to say the next 24 hours.  But I'm going to be watching my phone like a hawk.  Let's talk about the new data center that Google's building on the San Francisco Bay.  Google has a patent for water-based data centers.  There's a mysterious building going up near Treasure Island, which is where the Navy used to be.  It's an island in the middle of the Bay.  The Bay Bridge leads to it.  And there's a barge with a four-story stack of shipping containers out there.  Nobody knows anything about it.  Although now CNET and now Channel 5 News, KPIX 5 has learned, probably by reading CNET,  that Google is actually building a floating marketing center, a kind of giant Apple store, but for Google Glass.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that doesn't make any sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Channel 5, what?  An insider close to the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission says,  Google has spent millions on this, but they can't park this barge on the waterfront without a permit, and they don't have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, you weren't kidding about the Google Glass thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Channel 5 is saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought you were joking.  Well, I'm sure they have great sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CNET says it's a data-based...  I mean, everybody's talking, nobody knows,  but based primarily on the fact that Google does already have a patent for a sea-based data center.  The reason being, there's two things you really need in a data center, unlimited power and unlimited cooling, and of course the sea provides both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We wrote back in 2008 about Google, the patent and them talking about, scientists talking about, that would be a great idea.  I mean, it makes total sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I get the cooling, but dumb question.  Energy from the sea, how does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's waves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it?  I don't know, it's magic.  Okay.  It might be a temperature differential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The patent actually mentions a wave-powered electrical generator system using machines from a company called Palamis.  Wow.  So, I guess these are just wind turbines except these waves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Isn't that wild?  That's pretty, indeed, genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you remember when...  I think Wired wrote about it.  I read about it on extension cord.  Remember Sealand?  Yeah, Sealand.  I wanted to buy an old...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was really, until I found out the maintenance costs were sky high, I was really interested in buying an old oil, a disused oil well.  Apparently, there's quite a few of them, a sea platform, and put twit there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great.  International waters.  International waters, pirate podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Issue your own currency.  Yeah.  Like Sealand, Sealand had its own currency.  Passports, stamps.  Yeah, Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that could be the emperor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone was going to put servers in the big tubes that make up the legs and basically submerge them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I think Sealand had the same problem, which was...  Is it still around?  Because it was very expensive, I think.  Yeah, it's still around.  So, the principality of Sealand.  It's a bit of work.  It's a fixer.  Yeah.  It's in an oil rig in the middle of the North Sea.  It's a nice view, though.  They're cheap.  It's cheap.  Because what happens is you can only get...  You know, the well runs dry.  And they built this platform out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can buy them cheap.  Sealand was a defensive...  No, I can't remember.  Oh, it wasn't an oil rig?  No, I don't think so.  No, it was...  There were a whole bunch of them for the Second World War.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it was known as HM Fort Rogues.  I am reading off of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a fort.  Yes, sea forts.  It's a fort, a sea fort.  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello?  It's a little breezy there, though.  Yeah.  Well, the weather's terrible.  It's hard to get people out there.  I just like...  And there's really nobody's...  There's no reason to do pirate radio.  We're a podcast.  But...  Sure would be fun.  It sure would be fun.  I might get a little cabin fever after a while.  The other issue with this sea-based data center, according to the San Francisco Bay  Conservation and Development Commission, is you're not allowed to build something on the  bay that you could reasonably build on land.  It would...  It needs to be a permit.  It seems like this is...  They don't have approvals.  But they're building it.  They're building something.  And who gave them permits?  That's the question.  I mean, right.  Right.  It's a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you couldn't build something like this on land because you wouldn't have wave  power, would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So maybe that's the story.  Hey, we can't.  We needed waves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does make sense, though.  I mean, Google's got to be using up almost every place in the world you can get sort  of huge amounts of reliable power.  Got to be getting close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think about the challenge, right?  And then we saw this announcement yesterday with Vic Condotra, the new Google Plus stuff,  and they're going to store your photos in full quality.  They're going to run servers to grind on your videos and make edits.  And I mean, this is crazy.  They're building...  They're, I mean, they're creating demand for more data centers.  I mean...  That's true.  I mean, it's almost...  It feels like there are...  It's almost profligate spending.  Here's the Channel 5 reporter talking to somebody through the intercom.  Local news is so funny.  Basically, they have a lot of pictures of people saying no, you know, closing doors.  But there's something there.  They're building something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So my other dumb question is, so I get the cooling and I get the electricity, but the  connectivity also has to be amazing, right?  So if it's out to sea, if it's out in the middle of the sea, far away, I mean, right  now it's in the bay, right?  But if it's out there...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think you bring it out to sea.  I think you have to dock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you dock it.  You dock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would think.  Or maybe you use Google Loon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.  But Google Loon's...  The connectivity rates were not...  They weren't great.  And latency is a problem.  And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you could tap into one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could tap into one of those out there to the bay and you're good.  You're good to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could tap into one of those undersea cables right at the end of the sea, does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's it.  Maybe you just drop it to a cable.  Oh, of course, that's it.  You have an undersea cable.  That's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course you do.  And there's lots of room in the ocean.  That's it.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just sent some divers down to the bottom there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, as you're going, as you're sailing out, you just have a big spool and you go...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  You're dropping the cable.  You're laying cable as you go out.  Laying cable as you go, right, right.  Yep.  Yep.  That's a hell of an anchor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love a company that will put animations on my phone and data centers in the middle  of the ocean.  I love that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And do the good work of laying undersea cable for us in the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently, Brendan in our Charm says they're building another one in Portland, Maine.  Something similar.  That's right.  This is scary.  This is really Skynet.  Scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kind of awesome.  See, I'm way cooler with this than the flying hats in my whole screen.  Really?  See, I have a mixture of fear of both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, they could submerge those and then use some of the excess heat to heat up like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a hotel and sell rooms in some underwater super farm hotel.  Stay in the underwater Google hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Presumably, somebody's working on that already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is what happens when a company is too damn successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gosh darn it.  All right, we're going to take a break.  When we come back to change log.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes, there have been a lot of changes to Google Plus.

And now, Gina Trapani will tell us what's new with the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lots of Google Plus improvements this week.  Google held a press event a couple days ago.  And unveiled a bunch of new features.  So Google Plus is getting lots of new features for photos and videos.  First, iOS users are getting full-size backups for the first time.  That's worked for Android for quite some time.  You've got better auto enhance that you can adjust up and down to your liking.  A new filter called HDR scape.  Vic and Dottra explained that normal camera can't properly display the colors  that a human eye can see, but an HDR photograph,  which used to involve a lot of complex, expensive software,  well, that's all bundled into Google Plus right now.  Google also enhanced their search capabilities.  So I think we showed this a few episodes ago.  You can go into your Google Plus photos and say,  show me photos of food or show me photos of trees.  And Google Plus has already sort of looked at your photos,  figured out what objects are shown there,  and will show them to you in search results.  They've improved that and they've increased the number of objects  that Google Search can recognize inside your photos to over a thousand.  So Google can detect Labradors and snowmen, tulips, umbrellas, laptops, shoes.  And this is kind of magic, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really works well, although I asked for dogs and I got some ducks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I searched for puppies and it showed me one of the pictures of my daughter,  who is as cute as a puppy, but not quite a puppy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except for the two ducks, I think they nailed it.  You can even search for people's names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep, you search for people's names.  And you can search from your photo library and from people in your,  from your circles photos libraries, photos that are available to you.  So you'll see Leo there.  You can see that the link from your circles is right next to from your photo library,  which is also new.  This is totally cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I forgot I had this video.  This is Henry, my son, reading for the very first time in 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. My dad forced me to do this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Aw.  But, um, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's now a freshman in college.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't do it.  Because he said that, um, I had to do it for you, so do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the most precious video I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it found it.  First page.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Tode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I mean.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty amazing.  To have that.  Thank you, Google.  You're going to make me cry now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that wind in the willows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a frog and toad.  And if you had little kids, you would know it.  You will know it, Gina.  That's his first.  That's the first time he ever read to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, he has a Hogwarts shirt on.  This is killing me.  Oh my God.  This is killing me.  You overload.  This isn't even my kid.  This is killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't even remember that I uploaded it.  So, but it's a guess it's going through Picasso web or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is pretty cool to be able to search for a name and get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pretty, it's, it's pretty amazing.  And I'm really glad that iOS users are getting this as well.  I feel like the auto upload and all of Google plus's photo features, people, people kind  of talk down Google plus all the time, but really the photo stuff and hangouts to me  are the killer, the killer features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am.  This is amazing.  Yeah.  For sure.  The photo stuff is blows me away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And speaking of the photo stuff, there's three new auto awesome features.  Um, one is called action and it's for action photos.  So if you take a series of photos with someone moving like dancing or running or jumping,  um, auto awesome can merge them together into one action shot, uh, where you can see kind  of the full range of movement.  So you see on the screen there, a guy like skateboarding up the side of a, up the side  of a wall, it'll merge them all together and show you kind of, you know, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting about this is this is the kind of thing that Samsung galaxy has for in the  HTC one do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now Google is doing it for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Uh, there's a new one called eraser.  So if you're at, say a busy landmark where there's lots of people in the background,  take a bunch of photos in succession and then Google plus will basically remove everybody  from the background and make it look like you're standing and then kind of an empty,  an empty space like the one up.  Amazing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, um, auto awesome movie is a little bit like HTC Zoe, but more advanced.  Um, so you basically, you use the Google photos app for Android, which we're going to see  on.  So this is the rough cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are all the videos that they took as they're doing a little road trip.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a bunch of videos.  You take a bunch of pictures and videos, and then you choose the ones that you want to  include in your auto awesome movie.  Oh, so it doesn't do this automatically.  Right.  This is the only one that doesn't do it.  It doesn't do automatically.  Uh, but you choose the ones you want to, you want to show and then Google stitches them  together, add some music and you've got just a really cool, you know, stitched together  movie with, with both stills and videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you'll see in this example, straight out of the HTC one, uh, highlights, but better.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it adds the music.  It adds music.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can, you can choose.  I think that you can shoot, you can change the theme, the style, the background music.  You can remove and shorten or reorder scenes as well.  So there are some editing capabilities.  So you'll see there's an example of a still, a few stills getting added.  So we're really kind of getting HTC Zoe, you know, features, but even, even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you get to choose so that something awkward doesn't show up in your video.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  So yeah, you choose the initial photos and videos that it includes, and then you can  even reorder scenes.  Or edit scenes, which is, which looks really, really neat.  I can't wait to get this.  This is going to, I'm going to take so much more video just for this because I don't have  to edit video.  Uh, but if it's going to do this for me, then I'll take video for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say the auto awesome.  I was sort of skeptical about it because I, you know, I just wasn't sure that I wanted  animated gifts in your timeline to do things like that.  But I, I took a whole bunch of photos at the lake of geese or something or ducks or whatever.  And, and then all of a sudden there was this auto awesome sequence and it's awesome.  I really liked it.  It's awesome.  Let's have to choose it or get them to do it or, you know, it just happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it does, it does a great job at highlights.  Like I take a bunch of, you know, I always take five or six pictures of my kid and only  one of them is in blurry or she's actually looking at it.  And it does a great job of picking out the good, the one good photo that you got.  It does a great job at making collages.  Um, it's yeah, it's pretty, it's pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say this is a, whether it's photos or video, like a lot of it is just the time  you take, like you go on a trip, you take like 350, 600 photos.  You don't have time to go through them all.  And like you said, find the one that's good or put together a movie or I mean, the more  of that they can kind of, they can take the pain out of that for you, the easier, the,  you know, more people are going to do it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also it's such a natural, cause now it's in Google plus.  So it's so easy.  The easiest way to share it is all just shared on Google plus.  So it's very good for Google plus.  Um, it, uh, you know, it sells Android for sure.  Although you can do it on iOS too.  Anything that'll upload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say their photo editing tools are pretty good too in Google plus.  They bought, uh, can't remember what it was now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They bought Snapseed and that's another thing that's been improved.  And the new Snapseed, I, a lot of us got new Google apps today, by the way.  And, uh, one of the new Google apps was this new Snapseed with HDR that they had talked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. The HDR scape is what is one of the Snapseed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like, I don't need Lightroom anymore.  Good. It's kind of, wow.  Although I'm not a fan of HDR, but you really can easily.  It's overdone.  It's overdone.  So here's an auto awesome.  Cause I took, that's the key with auto awesome is you've got to take a number of pictures.  It's rapid sequence.  So I got Lisa going off on her jet ski.  Now that's not something you're going to put in your photo album, but you might very well share it on Google plus.  Right.  And it looks good.  And then I have, if I go up here, I used, oh, see, it's not, I guess it's on my phone, but it's not yet been uploaded.  So I played with the Snapseed on these, on this image, turning on the HDR and actually really, really improved the image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of that kind of auto fix thing again, like saving people time.  Like, so you don't have to open another app and then fiddle with it and then save it and then export it.  And I mean, all of that just sort of making it sharper or fixing up the white balance.  I mean, that stuff makes a huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great.  A lot of those Snapseed capabilities are actually already in Google plus in the browser, by the way, you know, the drama shot is so cool.  I just, there's so much good stuff in here, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, neat.  Yeah.  Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you control the strength too.  This is just on the web and the saturation.  I mean, it's just.  You can really change something.  So, yeah, wow.  Bravo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, good stuff with photos and videos.  Hangouts also is getting an update, which hasn't gotten pushed down yet, but it's on its way.  Google is adding location sharing to Hangouts.  So if someone hangs out to you or chats you, it says, hey, where are you?  You can just tap on a button and you can send someone a Google map of your current locations.  They can find you, which is, which is kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something that a lot of group chats have had for a while, but I think still useful.  Have you got any SMS capability yet?  No, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This hasn't rolled out yet.  So SMS integration and support.  And I'm honestly not sure how this is going to work.  I don't know if you have to register your native phone number.  I use Google Voice, so I'm not even sure how the voice integration is going to work.  This hasn't been pushed out yet.  The registration has, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you use Hangouts, you can add phone numbers and I've added all my regular phone numbers to it.  OK, OK.  So yes, I use Google Voice, so it has the Google Voice number.  But if you go into settings on Hangouts right now, you can see confirmed phone numbers.  And I'm not going to show these, but I have quite a few of them.  And it will offer them to confirm your existing.  If you tap it, it'll say, oh, let's confirm this phone number and you'll add it.  And then it says, so it sends an SMS to that phone and then it adds it.  So the question is going to be, can I remove the messaging app from my dock and just put Hangouts there?  I think I can.  Right?  Or I will not yet, but I will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  I do actually I do have my phone number.  They're all in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's intercepting your SMS or it's just I see it's just detecting that your messaging app has received an SMS and just displaying it within Hangouts.  That happens now with voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you use Google Voice as I do, it will show up in both messaging and voice.  Right.  And voice.  So I would presume now all three will show up.  It'll show up in Hangouts, messaging and voice.  And I can use any one of them as my default messaging app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. That makes sense.  That makes sense.  And animated GIF support, which I know we were all waiting for inside Hangouts, of course.  And the final update is Google Plus is expanding its custom URL availability to everyone.  So a custom URL is you get plus.google.com slash and then plus whatever your name is or whatever you choose.  So I've had plus Gina Trapani for a while.  Yeah, me too.  And Google's rolling this out to everyone.  Yeah.  All profiles that have a picture, at least 10 followers or encircleers, I guess, and have been around for at least 30 days will soon be able to create a custom URL.  If your profile meets the criteria, you'll see an option on your page to start the process of claiming that URL or you might get an email the way that Chad did.  Chad, you got this email, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did. And if I go check out my thing, you can see at the top of my profile, it says I can choose to change it to plus Chad Johnson, OMG Chad.  I didn't really want this.  That's what they suggest.  That's what they suggest.  But now if I get rid of just the Chad Johnson to only choose OMG Chad, it won't let me.  It says that it's not allowed, which is kind of a bummer.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks. Thanks.  Oh, and that's why it's suggested because you're...  Because that's how I have it set up.  ...and Chad Johnson in parenthesis OMG Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so I can't choose Chad Johnson or just OMG Chad at the moment.  You can't choose Chad Johnson either.  No, because Chad Johnson is a football player, which I bet.  Now, I wondered if perhaps because I have a page that that is what is throwing me off is that I also have a Google Plus page with OMG Chad.  And maybe because there's a page that exists, I can't have it.  I tried going to the page and changing my name, then I realized that that was tied to YouTube.  So I'm kind of stuck right now. I don't know what to do.  Maybe I should just go ahead and grab Chad Johnson or Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google.com slash plus twit works.  Nice. So that's a page.  I didn't know. I don't know if we applied for that or not.  I'm not sure either.  That's good, though. I'm the manager of the page and I didn't apply for it.  So, you know, celebrities like us have had this for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you little people can get it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You said that. I did not say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about this when they started doing it for verified names that it's not it's not a fish.  It's not part of the Web RFCs that you put a plus in a URL, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not really. Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plus, when you URL encode a data plus generally indicates a space.  Right. So it's a little weird to have the bus.  I'm surprised it works.  Yeah. Well, Google.  But yeah, I mean, my pluses work. Right.  But like but but it's usually used to encode encode spaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I guess that's right, because it's it's it's a Google.  Oh, no, it's a URL. It's not a Google search.  It's a URL. Right. Or is it? Oh, maybe Google parses it.  Maybe. Oh, that's probably what it is.  It comes in as Google.com with some entity attached and Google parses it and sends back a website.  Right. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. Works for me.  Yes, it's their server. They made it work. Yeah.  They can do whatever they want. Imagine the marketing guys.  Plus, the plus must work. We don't care about the RFC.  Plus, must work. Hey, can you do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's somebody some some geek in Google.  Oh, yeah, I can do that. Like we can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But technically the RFC violation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But man, why not? Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's do it. That's how you get a dancing cat in your in your header picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just upload a GIF. It's a GIF. Yeah.  Or a GIF or a GIF, depending on not a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a GIF or a GIF. Yeah, I did not take a cinema movie, a moving picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then that auto awesome. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does anybody chat room anybody in the chat room got a yet done this moving picture thing?  They showed a really good one.  Vic showed a really good one of one of his coworkers running on the bridge.  And he said, you know, we don't know exactly what you prefer.  Maybe that woman running through the shot of the bridge is destroying it.  Maybe that's your girlfriend and you care about her.  So we do both. We we make a awesome.  What do they call this new running shot where this shows her going cinema gram or something like that?  Or well, it's I mean, it was cinema gram that started doing this on iOS.  That was an yeah, that's what I'm thinking of.  But I don't know what the name of it. Auto Awesome Action.  I think there's an awesome action. So it goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  And then they also take her out of it completely and say, oh, by the way, here's the bridge.  If that's what you were looking at. OK, we're going to here's a here's one from Turnip Head.  He says, here's a great one. I'd like to see it.  This is a feature that Samsung has in its galaxy.  They call it golf shot, but I've never been able to get it to work on the galaxy very well.  I don't know. This is an auto awesome. But I do like this.  I was I wanted the one where it was somebody running or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  John drops. Yeah, that's pretty neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that nice? The raindrops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a whole that's a whole category of of animated gifts or chips or whatever you want to call it.  That's a cinemagram. Yeah, I like that.  So you just get it. Yeah, that's a cinematic shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's one thing moving like that's what we call a cinagraph.  But I was thinking of the ones like with a golf swing where you get the golf club in all of its positions.  The other thing they showed. Is if you overlap, let's say it's a basketball shot and you're moving too fast, you overlap.  They ghost the overlapped images and save the last.  I mean, it's exactly what you would want. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to say the one where you can erase people, that's the one I'm probably the most interested in just because you do take photos lots of times of, you know, places and there's a giant crowd and you can't see the thing you're trying to take a picture of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Or you get photobombed. Erase. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really have to, you know, play with these. I keep meaning to go out and take.  But I think the best thing is what just happens by serendipitously and you go back to your Google plus photos.  Oh, yeah. Look what happened. It is really delightful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like I first I was a little annoyed. So I can email from Google like you've got 24 new photos ready for sharing.  I'm like, yeah, yeah. But then you click through them and you see the highlights.  I'm like, oh, yeah, this is great. Like it's definitely a delightful experience because they're showing you the best photos.  They've made you collage. They've done, you know, the auto awesome stuff.  And I'm like, oh, these look even better than when I took them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it really does market the service really well because you're not expecting it.  And then it's like someone took your photos and went away with them and fiddle with them and then shows you what they did.  And it's pretty cool. Look what I did for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm your creepy stalker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I erased all those nasty people from your. I'm your creepy girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look, I created the best version of your life for you. I arranged your closet.  I sent it out all the crappy photos from your life.  Five photos. Here's the highlight reel from your day yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Gina, you nailed it. You want to take more photos and videos now with your phone all of a sudden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like, yeah, and I'm so much more willing to just snap, snap, snap, snap, snap.  And I know that, you know, I'm not going to have to sort through them myself to find the best one.  I'm going to have an email from Google saying, hey, look, and there's going to be a great shot of my kid, which is really nice.  That's all I got for the change. Here's one from Paul Moody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is kind of a neat one of a cliff diver.  So, yeah, I can see the ghost. Yeah, nice. Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty cool.  So how do you do that? You do a rapid shot, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you go. And Google, you know, something like fast burst camera or any sort of fast burst mode, which I believe is actually might be available.  There might be a fast burst mode in the latest stock camera update on Android.  Oh, really? Well, it makes sense. Yeah. Yeah, it would make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. This is really neat. And that's the Google change log.  I can't wait till my photo streams filled with all of these. It's going to be interesting.  Moving. Let's see. Let's take a break and then come back.  We'll talk more about the Google and some other things that Vic mentioned.  Some really interesting things that might be used for those of you who are Google plus fanatics to respond to those Twitter naysayers.  Our show today brought to you by our friends at Shutterstock.  If you're looking for stock images, a great place to go.  How long before somebody like Shutterstock does it deal with Google and you could mark or maybe flicker?  You could mark pictures, say, you know, this should go to Shutterstock.  They have a lot of pictures. They added 200000 new images this week.  Thirty million images at Shutterstock.com. Since there's always new images, there's always good reason to go back and look around and maybe pick an image for your blog or your presentation, for your advertisement, your publication.  It's royalty free. That's nice. The search engine. Super cool.  I can search for Cliff Diver, but I can also search for a Cliff Diver illustration.  Click the Diver vector. I could search for happy Cliff Diver and sad Cliff Diver, blue Cliff Diver and green Cliff Diver.  They've got a great little color spectrum tool that lets you actually pick palettes. Great for designers.  The light boxes are really neat, too. Now you have to make a free account with Shutterstock.com for the light boxes.  Once you do, you can take any image and put it in the light box. You don't need to give them a credit card to do that, by the way, or you just set up in a free account.  They also don't forget to click the footage tab because they've got great video footage, really high quality video footage.  1.3 million of them. Shutterstock.com. Now, if you do decide to buy, you can buy image packs. You can buy subscriptions. That's what we have. It's the most affordable way to do it.  I think we get 25 images a day for a flat rate. It's a very good deal.  If you do do that, please use our offer code and you'll get 25% off your new account at twig1013.  Twig1013.com. Beautiful site. I use it for inspiration.  I'll search for things and I get ideas. Really kind of a creative whack up the side of the head. Shutterstock.com.  So during the talk a couple of days ago, was it yesterday? It was yesterday.  Vic mentioned that Google Plus has 300 million active users every month.  Take that Twitter. Take that Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How are they counting active users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the immediate reaction. That can't be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does active mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does Plus, what do users mean? This is the thing about Google Plus. Everybody says, I don't use Google Plus.  I actually know you do because if you use Hangouts, if you sign into Google, if you use profiles, if you use YouTube, if you use Docs,  Google Plus is just baked into everything in some little way.  It doesn't necessarily mean you're posting on Plus.Google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, be like that. You're saying I'll count plus one button clicks and all of that.  Then you have 540 million active users.  Active users, Google says, anybody who interacts with Google Plus in some way on any Google property,  that could be leaving a comment on a blog or website with Google Plus comments enabled, as our site does,  commenting on YouTube, that counts, clicking the plus one button. That gets you 540 million.  The 300 million is active in stream viewers, people who actually go to the Google Plus content stream.  300 million.  Once a 300 million a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who are these people? Who are these people? Because I mean, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, me and you and Chad and I'm sure Matt and you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's once every four weeks, right? You have to go once.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because none of my friends and family who don't work in tech do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  Yeah, me neither.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  I mean, I'm not trying to talk bad about Google Plus.  You know, I actually, I hate when people assume that Google Plus is a total failure because I don't think that it is,  but none of my friends and family are actually writing anything on Google Plus either.  Most of them just have a profile set up and they might use it.  Because you kind of have to.  Right.  To use Google to be signed into Google.  At this point, Google prompts you so often to create a profile and that's profiles is Google Plus now.  I mean, everything's so integrated, but viewing the content stream, like going to plus.google.com.  That's surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To me, that was always the genius was to integrate it into everything.  Right.  Everything Google has.  And so you link to it even without even realizing it because your account is connected to something else.  I mean, that seemed to me really smart.  But yeah, I would agree.  I can't see that many people deliberately go to plus.google.com and look at something or do something.  I use it every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use it all the time.  And the more they do things like these new photo enhancements, the more likely I am to use it.  I mean, they've made it really great, really useful.  And I don't even do hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I check it because the number comes up, you know, when you're in Gmail or whatever, the toolbar, the number comes up.  And so I have sort of notification anxiety.  And so I click on it, you know, to see what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You wouldn't want to be me.  Numbers on as always.  So somebody in the chat room, this is an interesting, completely anecdotal data point says my 14 year old and all his friends use Google Plus instead of Facebook.  Now, what that surprises me.  But I think that I think kids don't like Facebook.  Facebook has become their parents place, Twitter, even more so.  I would disagree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would disagree with that.  No, my my daughter and lots of her friends.  It's Tumblr and Twitter.  Right. And sometimes Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tumblr, I'll grant you.  Instagram, Instagram, Vine and Tumblr.  Very big with the young folk.  But it was interesting because creative types.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Twitter and Tumblr are both for live blogging shows that they live like or live tweeting.  So you're watching.  So they like they're teenagers, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They like Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And interestingly enough, both of my daughters, youngest ones, six almost 16 and the middle one is 20.  They both love Doctor Who and supernatural shows like that.  They live, live tweet them.  They live blog them.  But they also they've both created fake Twitter accounts pretending to be characters in those shows.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting. Oh, yeah.  So for fan fiction type thing, first of all, you raise your daughters right.  Matthew, that's yes, he did.  Did he?  He did.  But yeah, for fan fiction, I mean, you know, it is really cool to see characters in TV shows.  I totally follow like the Mad Men characters on Twitter and even some of the newsroom tweets I follow because you actually get some sort of news news items.  But yeah, that's that's interesting.  So did you see what do you think about Arrington's opinion piece on Uncrunched about how Google should buy Twitter before the IPO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I almost I almost wrote something about it because it it makes a huge amount of sense.  It certainly makes a lot of sense for Google.  I'm not sure it makes as much sense for Twitter, especially since they're just about to go public.  Like if Google was going to buy them, it would have made a lot more sense to try and do it six months ago, you know, to say let's let's kind of, you know,  forget about the IPO and we'll offer you way more than you're going to get.  And but now it's so close.  It's hard to imagine that Twitter would actually say, OK, it's like it has to be a huge number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure that Google has made offer.  I mean, I'm sure that Twitter has had to turn down offers.  Right. But but his point is that the IPO is coming up and so they could just buy buy them right out.  The thing about this piece that I didn't like is that, you know, Arrington was like to Google Plus, supposedly the number two social network after Facebook.  But I don't buy it. No.  And I know he uses Google Plus much.  And I don't see people giving out the Google Plus names on cable news networks and other TV shows.  I that's true.  But that's not the only measure of the success of a social network.  This was so we were just talking about, you know, the Google Plus's use numbers are a lot higher than we thought.  And because it's integrated across all Google products, there is high usage there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And actually, you could argue that Twitter and Google Plus might make a good combination in a way.  I mean, Twitter is used by still a relatively small number of people and relatively sort of, you know, people who are looking for a specific thing.  Maybe it's a news service. Maybe it's just sort of short sharing or whatever.  Whereas Google Plus with particularly with the photo stuff and all that, it's much more of a community.  So you could see those two things fitting well together, even complimentary.  I still don't see it happening, though, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it makes perfect sense.  Mike points out and I think he's right here that the search signals you get from Twitter alone are worth billions.  Twitter is valued at 11 billion.  So you'd have to offer more than 11 billion for the board to even consider it since they're about to go public at a 17 to 20 dollars, which give them.  They'd have to be 15 to 20.  Yeah. Mike says that.  It has to be significantly more. It's going to be a big chunk.  Google can't afford that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he's right about the search.  It's worth something. It's worth a lot.  I'm trying to remember who who wrote it.  Kevin Marks pointed to a blog post that was talking about Twitter's short URL shortener, the T.C.O.  Right. So every link that goes through Twitter gets shortened by T.C.O. or wrapped by T.C.O.  And they forbid Google from crawling any of those links following them.  So they are the only ones who have access to all of the links that are shared on Twitter.  That's a huge. I mean, that'd be worth billions right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. And I think frankly, Google with Twitter is more valuable to Google than it is by itself.  I'm sure of it. So the problem, though, I'm sure there are people like Vic inside of Google who are saying, no, give Google Plus a chance.  Look, we're we're getting traction. And that's why Vic brings up those numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're getting traction.  You know what Google Plus is missing for me?  Google Plus is is connected to everything Google, but it is not connected to anything non-Google.  At least not in in any useful way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if somebody dies, a Hollywood celebrity dies, you don't go to Google Plus to find out if you heard it. If it's true, you go to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just that. It's the it's the API.  It's the sort of ability to read and write or to share things across platforms or cross services.  You just can't do anything like that with Google Plus.  Well, they can fix that with an API, right?  It could. But so why haven't they? That's so it's big enough now.  At first, Vic said we don't want it to get too noisy and we don't want it to be to whatever.  But I mean, it's at this point, it's like a silo in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why Twitter is a good thing to buy because it's complementary, 100 percent complementary to Google Plus.  So 20 billion. There you go.  But I think there's internal debate.  I would not be at all surprised.  I mean, look, the Twitter IPO is in the next couple of weeks.  I would not be at all surprised to have a big announcement the next couple of days.  Yeah, we were. And if they make an offer that's significantly over what the valuation is, the board probably can't even say no.  It's like, well, you're going to the stock market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the board can't say no.  The board can't say no. But, you know, there have been these cases before.  And I mean, for sure, venture investors are going to want to be pussed.  And if it's not if they're not getting a multiple that's that they see as enough, then they're you know, the board is just not going to say yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. So it has to be enough.  Yeah. It's not going to be cheap. That's what Mike's round up to like 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, throw an extra 10 billion in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You keep adding more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dick's going to want a couple of billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I this makes a lot of sense.  And Google has shown as it showed this with YouTube, it's shown that it can buy a company like this and preserve its corporate culture, keep it somewhat separate, autonomous.  They know how to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And actually, YouTube is a good example because YouTube was, you know, it was still relatively new and kind of untested when they when they bought it.  It was obvious that it was something. It was obvious.  But but they have it has grown substantially.  And, you know, they have managed to preserve it in a lot of her to keep it from getting sort of screwed up like lots of companies do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not that's you know, the YouTube Google video comparison Arrington makes is it is decent.  But the difference with Google Plus is that Google Plus is the core is really core.  It's all Google products at this point. Yeah, it's not going to be video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's much more important. They're not going to get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's much more important than Google Video. Right.  Like and they're not going to put by Twitter.  And then what? And they're not going to replace Google Plus with a Google Plus is the core of like user identity on Google.  I just don't know where where Twitter would fit.  Didn't they buy? Oh, what was that short messaging service is very similar to Twitter.  Not pounds, not Jake, Jake. Thank you.  Jai Koo. Right. So they'd be buying the data.  They'd be buying the data. But what would they you know, I don't know.  They don't touch it. They keep running it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They let they let I would like to continue to run.  All they want is to just open up to that CEO alone.  Right. And but I think that but the real fear is we don't want to kill Google Plus.  And we think there's a lot of power and value in Google Plus.  And if we bought Twitter, that might be harmful to Google Plus.  I don't think it is, but it might be harmful to Google Plus.  I think they're two different audiences and I use both.  And with it without very, very different things. Yeah, they're different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I suppose Instagram and Facebook have been working sort of together, but separately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right. Vick said whether after the IPO and, you know, Twitter's public and whatnot.  I wonder whether they wouldn't be open to some kind of licensing deal with Google like the one they used to have where and then they cut them off from getting that that data from Twitter.  I wonder if they'd be open to some kind of deal where Google would just pay them for that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure they could they close it off for a reason, probably because they wanted to see.  Well, it's valuable, Google. How valuable. Right.  Let's see. I'm just looking through what else is going on. Google Glass 2.  This is interesting. You probably got this, Gina. Glass explorers have gotten what is it? Three or four invitations.  Yes. You can now they're expanding the universe for glassers. Yeah.  So Jason, so I bought so I bought them for Jason Howell and he said, Do you want a guy that you want? Do you want glass?  I'm not going to spend fifteen dollars on that. I'm sorry. Yeah, well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can invite three people to spend, presumably spend fifteen hundred dollars. It's not completely clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jason says it doesn't say anywhere that it's going to cost money. But of course, it's going to cost fifteen hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. It is. And explorers also gets a trade in their current hardware for the next iteration of the hardware, which is which is kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do that, Jason. He doesn't hold on to this early. Do you have to pay money?  Oh, so you want to hold on to it shrink wrapped in the box so you can sell it 20 years from now.  But like, you know, I'm really going to hold on to get the glass to probably.  Are you going to get the glass to Gina? Yeah, yeah, definitely. It's compatible with prescription glasses.  Does that say what does that mean? Do you buy lenses for your glass? Not clear, not clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not clear. It sounds like maybe it comes with you can order like regular glasses and and have the touch glass installed on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because there are plenty of Googlers. I've seen them with who wear prescription glasses and glass. Well, they were working with Warby Parker.  I'm pretty sure. Right. Oh, that's what they'll do. They'll offer a Warby Parker edition.  That makes sense. Senum per square. Yeah, exactly. How much that going to cost?  And the first driving ticket issued for driving with glass, a California woman.  She was to be completely fair, she was speeding, got pulled over.  And then in addition, they the trooper added Google Glass as part of the site.  I own San Diego. Yeah, you're down your way. I thought it might be you at first.  Driving with monitor visible to driver is the violation.  And then in parentheses, he wrote Google Glass.  Google Glass. She was also 10 miles above the speed limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not normally enough to get pulled over. Big ups to SDP for knowing what Google Glass was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding. That's that's pretty mainstream.  This is California Vehicle Code Section 27602.  A person shall not drive a motor vehicle if a television receiver, a video monitor or a television or video screen or other any other similar means of vision.  Displaying a television broadcaster video signal that produces entertainment or business applications is operating and is located in the motor vehicle at a point forward of the back of the driver's seat or is operating in the monitor screen or display is visible to the driver while driving.  That means everybody drives a Tesla is driving illegally. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Or anybody who has their phone mounted on the thing for navigation purposes, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I think she should fight it. I mean, that's so vague.  Like, obviously, they don't want people having a TV sitting on the dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now I think that's there are exceptions. You can drive with equipment includes a mapping display and or a global positioning display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, she should have argued navigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, but you know, not not in her defense.  I mean, we when you pick up glass, they made it very clear that you should not wear it while driving at the laws have been updated yet.  You should not. So she knew that she shouldn't have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She said her glass was not on and the officer said it was blocking her view.  Well, really doesn't block your view, does it?  It's not your eye.  So now you have to look at when it's off, it's clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You see right through it. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I say fight it. California woman from San Diego.  Fight it. Fight the good fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stand up for glass holes everywhere.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I we talked about the Post-it note that the Guardian displayed today of how how the National Security Agency can watch what's going on at Google.  Did you see it? It's kind of no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Wait a minute. I gotta find this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean the drawing?  It's a drawing. It's on a yellow.  It's it looks like.  As a happy face, it has a happy face on it.  I got to show you this.  It's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're spying on you. Happy face.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't pull it up fast enough.  Pull it up.  There you go.  Chad's better than me.  So this is yet.  This is another one there slowly leaking out.  Yet another slide from the NSA presentation.  Except this one looks like it was drawn on a Post-it note.  It's it's so they have a cloud on the left that is the public Internet, the cloud on the right that is the internal Google cloud in between them, a GFE, a Google front end server that would be hardware interfacing the public Internet to the private.  And then there's an arrow dotted arrow with the text SSL added and removed here.  Exclamation mark with a smiley face.  Official NSA jargon for.  Insert spy device here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As the most sarcastic smiley face probably ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It actually, if you carefully observe, fits my face perfectly.  I am Edward Snowden.  I, you know, I was really believe in these slides right up to that one, which looks like he drew it in a bar in Hong Kong.  I don't it doesn't that really at least the other ones were PowerPoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like this is what and the smiley face.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the smiley face is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  However, it does confirm what we do believe, which is that the NSA is tapping in at the unencrypted point of the transactions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see the caption?  Two engineers with close ties to Google exploded in profanity when they saw the drawing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that doesn't tell you much.  They could have been saying, well, that's not true.  Or why would you find that?  I've ever seen.  Or that's who put a happy face on their exploded and profanity does not tell you anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It really doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it does.  It for sure looks like they're tapping into the connection to their cloud and probably, you know, it would be kind of what we figured was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it would be compatible with a Google explanation or denial.  And and technically it makes perfect.  Does work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, the project is called Muscular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  And it's done in conjunction with the British GCHQ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did notice one thing interesting in Alan Russ Bridger from The Guardian wrote a big piece for the New York Review of Books about, you know, the The Guardian and the series that it's been doing.  But he mentions way down.  It's quite a long piece, but he mentions near the end that he was talking to a senior executive from a West Coast based technology company, which he didn't mention.  And that they all they they admitted this guy admitted that the that he neither he nor the CEO would have security clearance to even know about anything that was going on related to the NSA anyway.  So that, in other words, their denials are sort of irrelevant because they're not they're not the people who are doing it.  They don't have the clearance to even know that it's occurring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this would be a good time for us to do a tool, a tip and a number of the week coming up in just a bit.  Tom Standage, he wrote the book The Victorian Internet, which is a great book.  His newest is about social networks, 2000 years of the history of social networks.  We're going to interview him in just a little bit.  But first, let's get a tip from Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My tip this week is actually an app.  So I guess it's kind of kind of like a tool.  And I apologize to the people who watch all about Android.  This is just such a great app.  It won the arena last night.  I wanted to bring it up to the twig listeners.  Pushbullet.  Pushbullet.com.  Love this thing.  I installed it to test it out and I've been using it so much.  What push bullet does is it lets you push data from your computer from Chrome to your phone very easily.  It's very similar to Chrome to phone, actually, but with lots more features, a lot easier to use.  So you you install it on your Android device.  You can install a Chrome extension into Chrome and you sign in with Google.  So it's really simple.  One click sign in and then you can push lists, locations, text files, links, whatever you want to your Android phone.  And it shows up in your notification shade.  It's a rich notification.  And when you tap on, say, for example, location and automatically loads Google Maps, if you tap on a list, you can check off items on the list.  And you can also push between your Chrome browsers.  If you want to push from one Chrome browser to another, it works for it to your tablet, to your phone.  You can push to your friends devices if they give you access.  And it's just a really, really handy way.  So like if you're sitting at your desk and I do this all the time, I look up an address to a restaurant that I'm going to or a place I need to go.  And I want an easy way to just send that to my phone on the way.  I just just click a button and it goes really, really beautifully designed Android only app uses the rich notifications Android for and above.  And just super, super useful.  I love this. I love this app.  I've been using it so much.  I want to want to share it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Push bullet.  Yeah, because I've always used Chrome to phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like it's Chrome to phone, but even better.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That looks cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  Pretty cool app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, normally, Jeff Jarvis would do a number of the week.  We don't have Jeff's number of the week.  But I but Matthew, if you have a tip or an idea or an app you like that you'd like to share with us, that's good, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything I don't know?  I don't know how new this one is, but it's one that I've been using a lot because I for backing up photos.  It's called it used to be called Open Photo.  And now it's called Trove Box.  It's got iOS apps.  It's got Android apps.  It's got a website.  And it it the thing that appealed to me about it was that when it was called Open Photo, it's very open.  So you can host your photos with them or you can host them on S3 and you it's just very seamless.  It's got a really nice UI.  So I back up my photos to like 10 different places.  So Google Plus, I've got auto upload turned on Dropbox.  I've got auto upload turned on just so that I never sort of lose them.  Trove Box has got quite a nice setup.  And I know that it's all backed up to my S3 installation with Amazon.  Yeah. So it's it's really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it.  Well, I already showed you my pick of the week, my little floating hat.  I really like Windy Day.  I like Windy Day.  And I hope I look forward to more.  And I'm very excited about it.  I just feel like it's too bad that it's only Moto X.  But because this is really and I think in some ways a new medium and I think there's a lot you could do to be very interesting.  So if you do happen to have a Moto X and you don't see the little hat floating around on your screen, go get the Motorola Spotlight app.  It's on the Play Store.  Download it and it won't be long before you have a windy day, too.  Ladies and gentlemen, we thank you so much for joining us this week.
