It's time for TWIG This Week in Google, the show that  covers the Googleverse and the cloud.  Cloud computing in general as well with us right now, of  course, great Gina Trapani, founder of Lifehacker and  blogger at smarterware.org, the author of the software  formerly known as Think Tank.  We'll talk about that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, we can talk about that.  Hi, Gina.  Welcome.  Hello.  Thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good to see you with your Madonna mic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  My Madonna.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also here, Jeff Jarvis with his steampunk mic.  Far less fashionable, dinky, dorky mic.  He has the Kraftwerk mic on.  Jeff is, of course, a professor of journalism at the  City University of New York, very well known in journalistic  circles for years, the author of What Would Google Do?  and blogger at buzzmachine.com.  Great to have you both.  No Googlers with us, although we got a thumbs up from the  Google that we could perhaps do a feature, which I'd like to  do starting soon, with a featured Google product and  engineer every week, just for 10 minutes.  So I think that's a chance for us to talk about something  Google's doing.  With somebody who's writing the software and get kind of an  inside story on that, which I think will be fun.  So I believe that's in process.  We'll get that started pretty soon.  Meanwhile, I guess we're going to talk about cell phones  again.  Somebody said that Google was on track.  I haven't looked at the graph, but that Google's on track to  have 100,000 apps on Android by the end of the summer.  Does that sound right, Jeff?  That's not your number, I hope.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, it's not.  I got five numbers in case you steal any.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Smart man.  His number rich today.  That's a lot.  Really, how many applications do you need?  If it's got the key ones you want, 20, 30 is fine.  But 100,000 means you have a good shot.  Yes, it's not 250,000 as the iPhone has, but it's pretty  solid, and I think what you're seeing is if you compare  iPhone app growth to Android growth,  Android is really fast.  It's growing fast.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it only amplifies the problem we talked about last  week, which is the crap problem.  And how do good, well, two problems for the first and  foremost, how do you discover good apps?  How do good apps move up?  There's not a good way to do that in either  marketplace, I think.  And then the second problem is how do you get good apps made  and really excel there?  And that's where I think we talked about last week.  I don't know if this is newer news, the $5 million that  Google's going to invest in YouTube.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We didn't.  We missed that last week.  And I think that that's a really good story.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is, and I think that they should do the exact same thing  with the app marketplace.  And in Kleiner Perkins has two large funds now for iPhone  apps, and I presume iPad apps.  Well, I think Google should be investing in the creation of  killer apps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  AndroLib, I'm being told by the chat room, Pat says  AndroLib, which is an independent Android app  website, has 95,000 apps.  So we're very close.  Wait a minute.  And the estimated number of apps downloaded, according to  them, is 1 billion.  So look at the graph.  I mean, phenomenal growth.  It's not a hockey stick, but it is not linear either.  I mean, phenomenal growth over the last three months.  The year begins kind of in the middle of the graph through  July, and you're really seeing an uptick.  Now Google's added this new thing, which we can only trust  others to tell us about, because I haven't gotten my  invitation.  I guess you haven't either, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I haven't.  Sad face.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Sad face to the, what is it, App Innovator?  What is it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's the App Inventor.  App Inventor, yes.  What is it?  It's a web-based visual Android application creation tool.  So you go to this web page.  Once you get an invite, you can go request an invite.  If you just Google App Inventor, you can request an  invite, which I did.  And I did.  And Jeff did.  There's a YouTube video that kind of shows what it is.  And it's actually a really cute, cute video.  But the idea is that it's what you see is what you get app  development for Android.  It's just like a WYSIWYG editor, basically.  You create a canvas.  You can drop buttons onto it.  You can assign actions to those buttons.  So in the example, the user drops a photo of her cat onto  the canvas and then a button that says purr.  And when you press that button, you can say, play the purr  sound or make the cat meow when you swipe across the  image, cute little apps.  That sounds great.  Yeah.  And it seems to be targeted towards educators.  They want to get young school kids building apps.  And I think they said they had students as young as sixth  grade making quizzes and question and answer type apps.  And I think this is a great thing.  I mean, some developers are complaining.  Or some people were saying, this is just going to flood the  Android market with crap apps that anybody could  just slap together.  But I have to tell you, as someone who's knee deep in  building an Android app, not the App Inventor way, doing it  the old non-job way.  It's hard doing it the old way.  It's hard.  It's much harder than it needs to be.  And in fact, I think that Google could do a lot of work  just in that.  Here's download Eclipse.  Here's the SDK.  Build your app.  So I really like the idea of making it easy, even just to do  layout of buttons and boxes and tabs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Could you use App Inventor as a starting point and then get  back into the code?  Or is it kind of opaque at that point?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is the problem.  App Inventor does not generate source code  that you can modify.  So this is my problem with it.  I think it's also a key point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like that.  It's pieces.  Yeah, so I wish that it generated the Java so that you  could download then the code and then progress from there  and work with the app.  Because everyone knows what happens when you get a  WYSIWYG editor, right?  Everyone started using Dreamweaver or whatever,  starting creating web pages.  And it would generate kind of crappy code.  Who knows what kind of code this is creating.  But I think this is only, only a good thing.  You want to create interest.  And right now, I'm building a Hello World Android app.  The old school way is just too hard.  It's too hard.  And so I'd like to see them improve in that area.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina buzzed it when she got the Hello World app running.  She buzzed a screenshot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It was like a big accomplishment.  It's like a big deal.  It was, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I've done it too.  And really, the accomplishment is getting all the tools  installed and working properly in your environment.  But once you do that, I have to say that from a professional  programmer looking at what Google's doing, many of them  already use Eclipse.  They certainly know Java.  And I think it's a very nice application framework.  I mean, I haven't looked under the hood to see how nicely  put together it is.  But it's a fairly complete framework, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, the framework is great.  And I love Eclipse and have experience with Eclipse having  been a Java developer.  But I'm a new mobile app developer.  And even with Java experience and knowing Eclipse, I still,  you know, installing SDK and going through all the steps.  And it's a long ramp to the Hello World.  You know, you want to shorten that ramp as much as possible  to get people, because you get so excited when you see that  Hello World work.  Oh yeah.  And then what?  And then you change it to Hello Gina.  And you're like, yes, it's doing what I want it to do.  Like, you want to make that path as short as possible  for developers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's not so bad.  It's the stuff that, then the ramp gets a little steep.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And clearly, this is the name for that.  I think Gina, I too heard kind of the priesthood of programmers,  some of them objecting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I heard two different things.  One is, yes, the pros not liking it.  The other one is, amateurs saying it's still too hard.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you're going to be in that bind,  but it's a step in the right direction.  But to me, the use is, you're right, educational, number one.  But number two, I think what's brilliant about this  is that I can imagine a business using this to create  their own app just for their Salesforce.  Yes.  That's interesting.  Using this for salesforce.com.  And so what it does is it drives people to have to then be on Android.  And I can't imagine Steve Jobs ever doing this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because...  No, in fact, you know who did do this?  Microsoft, in some ways.  Microsoft Visual Basic really propelled business apps for Windows  because it was so easy to code business apps for Windows.  And I think that that has a lot to do with  maybe the use of the adoption of Windows in business.  You know, you can create custom codes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's a lot of reference to HyperCard.  And HyperCard, yeah.  Oh, it disappeared. It was nothing.  But but then Kevin Marks came in Twitter and said, well, Tim Berners-Lee  used it as inspiration at his right for the web.  The founder of Wikis says that it also inspired him.  And, you know, I think that the more...  Gina's right. And Gina is always a generous Democrat here.  Lowercase T in terms of inviting more people in.  And the more people who use the stuff, the better it is for all of us.  No question about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you don't dismiss the notion that you're going to get a bunch of crappy more.  Of course you will.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You'll get tons of crap.  But that again amplifies the problem for Google is  that you've got to curate the best of the stuff and find good stuff and create it.  Yeah. But this is not for that.  There's not going to be a, you know, million download app coming out of that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And better. I want to say I when I applied for an invite,  I applied as an educator because I am on the board of trustees of my kids high school.  They are adding Java and I've been advising the instructor on Java curriculum.  And I do very much think that the kids should, at least after they've studied  Java a little bit, get a taste of mobile development, because isn't that the future of

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  programming? And mobile development presents these challenges  that you don't have to think about on the desktop.  You're dealing with very little bandwidth, very little memory.  You're dealing with someone with a very short attention span.  I mean, if your app doesn't respond to a tap within one or two seconds, it feels broken.  You know, so you go back to this kind of minimalist sense of, you know, with web apps,  we're injecting jQuery.  We've got all this really kind of heavy stuff going on because you've got these rich clients  and these thick broadband connections with mobile development.  It's like it's a whole different playing field.  It's really interesting.  You're presented with all these interesting limitations.  You have to reduce the number of taps in order to get things done.  It's really it's a fantastic.  It got me really excited. I was like, oh, this is a new programming challenge, you know,  something I haven't had to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  As a journalism teacher, you know, one of the fights that we have with our students here,  I probably shouldn't say it that way, but some students say you should make me into a Flash  programmer. And I keep on saying no, not only because it's Flash, but because I said you  should be the boss of the Flash programmer.  As a journalist, you know, we're not going to be able to turn you into a great programmer here.  And what you need to be able to do is know how to spec.  You need to know what it can do and you need to spec it and you need to be a project manager.  Well, what it strikes me about it, I got to play with App Inventor, but it strikes me that it might be  that step in the right direction to say, OK, you want to make something, make a mobile app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't wait to play with this.  I'm very curious to mean that the trivial example that we just showed in the video that's on  that on the page doesn't really inspire one to write an app.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, not too much.  But if you look at the on the on the App Inventor page, the tutorials page, they have some  example apps. And so the Hello Purr, which is the Pet the Kitten and it and it Purrs app is at the  top. But then there's some advanced app, which is a Quizme.  Yeah, Leo, you might want to go there.  Yeah.  OK.  Trivia game about baseball.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Where's the bus schedule game, a bus schedule program?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can I is there any way I can try this or I guess you have to download it and try it?  It looks like yeah, it looks like you can download and try it.  But yeah, this is OK.  You know, I mean, if it's a quiz and I could see huge benefits to a teacher to be able to develop  their own mobile quizzes.  You can.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What I said on my blog post is we talk a lot about getting the electronic textbook.  Screw that.  I want the electronic workbook.  Yeah.  This is OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now I'm going to say this is HyperCard.  That is the power.  That was the power of HyperCard.  My dad used HyperCard to create a stack on Darwin that he used.  He's not a programmer.  He's not even a computer buff.  Yeah.  But it was very valuable to him.  And so this is I think that is the closest analogy.  This could be the HyperCard for mobile.  That really puts some pressure to Apple.  It really does.  I get.  Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I was going to say I get email from non programmers all the time who said I'm not a programmer,  but I want to build a mobile app.  Where do I start?  And up until now, my answer has been don't start with mobile app development because  you're either going to have to get into Objective-C with the iPhone, which is just not easy.  The iPhone IDE I hear is beautiful.  Yes.  Gorgeous.  Very powerful.  But you need to be a programmer to kind of start with it.  Incidentally, they have an interface builder that is essentially like this, a drag and

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  drop.  You create the buttons.  You create the interface.  But you have to do the glue code.  It's kind of like Visual Basic too.  You have to do the glue code or the button code to make it functional.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It handles events and that kind of thing.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's a nice interface, a developer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And the Android SDK has, there's a little bit of a visual component with the XML files.  You can see the layout.  I'm still kind of not sure of myself with it.  But I feel like this is something I would advise.  If someone's interested in building a mobile app here, here's something that you can start  with.  So I think it's a good thing.  I'm definitely not one of the...  I think the market has to fill up with some bad apps in order to create the market for  the really good apps.  I was at BarCamp last weekend and there were a lot of Android phones there.  And the conversations I was hearing about Android was, you know, really this task manager  is pretty good, but I really like one that does this.  And these are kind of the programmers that are going to identify the features or the  things that are going to make the great apps, kind of given the groundwork of the bad apps.  And I think that that motivates developers to make the great apps and then those will  surface.  And I think the Android market just has to fill out in order to create those opportunities  and to kind of narrow them down so people will build them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're right.  Democrat with lowercase d, Jeff.  That's exactly right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, that's exactly right.  It's generosity.  It's an openness.  Speaking of which, is there...  Because I haven't been able to play with it yet.  Is there a...  Is it open, sufficient?  If I create a good module, can people create new modules for this and share modules they've  created?  Do you know, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a very good question, and I'm not sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They say, you know, on the front page, Google engineers have created modules to do everything  you want.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What I really want is for Gina to be able to program new modules that then dorks like  me can actually put into something.  Because that would be the better use of your talents, Gina, and the better use of my enthusiasm,  shall we say.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, letting anyone contribute building blocks would be fantastic.  I mean, this is kind of Google's philosophy, right?  I mean, they do generally let them do this.  But I don't know if that's possible now.  I don't believe so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's based on OpenBlocks, which is...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They were great in the post, where they were saying that they were built on the shoulders  of giants.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes.  It uses OpenBlocks Java library for creating visual blocks programming sources.  OpenBlocks is an MIT project.  So, maybe, I mean, it depends on how much it uses OpenBlocks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good point.  It could have just used stuff from scratch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  The compiler that translates the visual blocks language for implementation on Android uses  the Kawa language framework.  Kawa is a dialect of Scheme.  Wow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't even know what that is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Scheme is a Lisp variant.  Oh, okay.  So, this is...  You see the MIT open roots here.  Very interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So, how do you see this competitively with Apple?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think it puts Apple on the spot.  I think Apple...  But I would never imagine Apple...  They can't do anything like this because it would flood them with things to approve.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a back door into the App Store, or it's a non-App Store app repository.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's kind of a sad commentary on Apple that, in fact, if they wanted to do a hypercard  for iPhone, they really couldn't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That really isn't an option.  And, you know, smart of Google, perhaps, to recognize that and say, okay, we'll do it.  I'm feeling right now...  I've been using the iPhone since it came out solely.  I sit and I look at my Nexus One on the shelf.  But...  And I have to say, I've dropped five calls in the last two days, even with a case on  the thing.  I'm about to throw this thing through the window.  I love so many things about it, but if it drops calls, I can't use it.  So I'm very interested.  DroidX comes out this week.  That's the Verizon Motorola sequel to the Droid.  Actually, there's a Droid 2, which is a direct sequel.  DroidX is much more like an Evo with a 4.3-inch screen.  I've touched it.  I've held it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What do you think?  Very nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the Hummer of phones.  That's what I'm calling it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's larger, but that's fine with me because I got big geeky hands and it's all right.  But I like the problem.  I guess my only problem with it is, well, besides the issue that you and I always talk  about about GSM versus CDMA, if I want to have two phones anyway, then I think I'd  probably get the X, except I want the forward-facing camera.  I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, who are you going to call?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's true, but I just wasn't knowing what it can do.  I think there's, did you all watch, I blogged about this, the commercials that Apple did  for the, what's it called?  FaceTime.  FaceTime.  Oh, the new commercials.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I haven't seen the new ones.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it really struck me, and I have them all on my blog, Leo.  It struck me as odd because it was almost tragic because at the end of these videos,  you want them to be able to touch, but they can't.  And yes, it's more intimate than a phone call, but that's what makes this evident about how  it's still not.  And there was something, something kind of sad about it to me.  It was wacky, but it makes me wonder that the video online has been solely about broadcasting  to the whole world and now in an instant video became incredibly intimate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  So this is two people looking.  Smell now?  And now.  I can't believe you're never going to smile.  It's a guy trying to get somebody to smile.  All right, you're going to make me sing.  Shannon's never going to smile.  She's going to go, oh, hey.  No, come on.  They look good.  That's your father, obviously.  How do they feel?  Kind of weird.  You look beautiful.  Okay, that's pretty touching.  But you're right.  He's not there.  Right.  Dad's not there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In each one of these, even though I brought them closer, it only emphasized how the last  mile was still there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess we live in a world where we are so desperate to connect and we are so far away  now that this is it.  Wait a minute.  Where are you?  Jeff, Gina, I can't.  Right.  I can't.  Let's all touch.  You're so far.  Well, maybe this is the way.  Is this the world we live in now or we don't?  That's what I'm saying.  Leo, I think that...  It's kind of depressing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It is kind of depressing.  facing camera.  and she's not going to be able to do it.  She's going to be like, oh, I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do it.  I'm going to do it.  She switches the camera from her face to the sonogram screen to back.  Right?  And that's...  That was the killer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  That was the killer for me.  That one is the one that really got me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  Which one is that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I got to have to play it.  It's the last one with the baby.  Oh no, it's not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  On my blog, it's the fourth of the fifth, I think.  Fourth of the fifth.  It's not the guy with the beard.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  One, two, three.  It's not the hair you just played.  I think it is here.  Big news.  I think that's it.  All right.  All right.  Get ready.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Free ad for Apple.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, what's going on, sweetie?  That's not it.  She just got a haircut.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Same topic.  Go back because there's another one.  Haircut.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Meet her.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't think you have it embedded here.  I don't have it on this one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jeez, that's weird.  Huh.  Okay.  Was it in the omnibus one, Gina, where there was a whole bunch of people doing different

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  things?  The one I was thinking of the soldier was sitting on his bunk, presumably.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In Afghanistan or whatever and talking to his wife, which just made me sad about the  war.  I was totally...  I was just all filled up and like, oh.  Well, this is where...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is good advertising is emotional, so it's good advertising.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That was what TechCrunch was saying that it's very mad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It says as if...  MG Siegler writes, it's as if Apple had hired Don Draper.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, they don't have to hire Don Draper.  This is what every ad agency in the world is hoping for.  FaceTime lends itself to that.  Ironically, I'm sorry, I don't think it's a technology that's going to take off.  I just think it's not...  It's Wi-Fi only.  It's...  Well, that's true, but...  iPhone 4 only.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But isn't that going to be the case?  Isn't there a front-facing camera phone on Android?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Evo has it.  I've got Anna Ravenscroft sitting in here.  She's a big fan.  Do you ever use the front-facing phone?  Not yet, she says.  That's the problem.  They've been front-facing cameras on Nokia phones for years.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can take a really good self-portrait.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what it's mostly...  You can check your makeup.  And I've done...  I did a few FaceTime calls to people like Robert Scoble and I haven't done anything  since.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, Leo, that says it all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  If that's who I'm calling...  I'll turn you off from doing it.  Exactly.  What's the...  Oh, good.  I have to call Robert more.  And I'll be honest, I'm not proselytizing that my friends and family...  You'd think, okay, I got an iPhone 4.  Wouldn't I want to talk my friends and family into getting an iPhone 4 so I could FaceTime  them?  No, of course not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you're really going away from the iPhone here, man.  You are throwing it over...  I have a feeling.  So wait, even when Abby goes to college...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I asked her, you know what's funny?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I said, you'll appreciate this, Jeff.  I said, Abby, could you get a...  I actually have an iPhone 4 in the box sitting that came to me a couple of days ago.  It was going to be for Abby.  And she says, I said, then we could FaceTime you.  And that's the last thing she wants to do, by the way.  Then we could FaceTime you.  And here's the weird...  Where are you?  I can see you on the road.  Dad, you have to decide.  Are we rich or are we poor?  Because if we're rich, then if I carry an iPhone, it's a statement and then I have to  spend at that level.  But if we're not rich, I want a cheap old feature phone because I don't want to get  in the position where I have to keep up with my phone.  Wow.  She's strange that way.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I love that.  She's basically saying, dad, you want to FaceTime me?  Then you're going to have to up my allowance.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's where she was going with that.  You're right.  It's going to cost you, dad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's going to cost you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll carry an iPhone, but it's going to cost you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, low blotting aren't far behind.  It's the entry drug.  Oh, you're right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you're right.  You don't have that problem with Jeff, I hope.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, Jake.  So...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, he has expensive tastes in gadgets.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, of course he does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, he's like you.  He wants all the latest.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So she's going to a hipster school and she says all the people have iPhones.  And I actually said, you know what?  If it's really a hipster school, all the people will have Android phones.  And actually, if it's a really, really hipster school, they'll all have old Nokia candy bar  phones, retro phones, right?  That's really the...  I don't know, Gina, you...  These are different flavors of hipster.  When you go to New York City and you go down to the meatpacking quarter to the clubs, what  phone are they carrying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff?  That was for you, Gina.  That was for you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can tell you, I guarantee you, they're not FaceTiming each other.  That would be so uncool, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, the fear is this is only going to make it a lot easier to do chat roulette.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, there is...  This is something not on the yet on Android, although with this new Android inventor, probably  just a few minutes away, there is a chat roulette clone for the iPhone called iChatter that  I tried and regretted immediately.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Was there...  It uses FaceTime.  The things we expect that are there, there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You want me to try it again?  Oh, sure.  No, no.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think...  I saw a presentation when I was in Berlin.  Somebody did this with chat roulette on the huge screen and she tried to get one of the  guys to show themselves, I mean, show their face.  And it was hilarious.  As soon as they realized...  Even though there was no face, as soon as they realized that a huge audience was watching  them do this, suddenly, boom, they went off.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you get that anyway.  You get this...  There's this chat roulette rejection thing, which actually is very depressing if you're  a guy on chat roulette because it's boom, boom, boom.  They're not looking for guys.  They're looking for young women that can scare.  And so it's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  In fact, there's a great video on YouTube of a guy who did an experiment.  He demonstrated this.  He sat in front of it, rejection after rejection, then he got his girlfriend to sit in front  of it.  Nice long conversations.  Of course.  So what I'm holding out for is...  Because I have a Nexus One on T-Mobile, I'm going to get this Galaxy S4 T-Mobile is going  to be called the Vibrant.  They're going to be on every carrier, but it's four inches.  So it's kind of in between the Nexus One and the honking big Evo or Droid X.  It's very thin and it's got an AMOLED screen.  It's actually a Samsung screen.  No flash.  Anyway, I'll give you an objective.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I know you're going to T-Mobile because you already have the SIM, but my T-Mobile just...  I love their model.  I love the fact that they're unlimited.  I love the fact that it's month to month, but the coverage is awful for me in New York.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this is telling.  They're better in the Bay Area than AT&T.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, that's their big opportunity, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Exactly.  There are certain places in town here that I don't get a good signal.  Actually at bar camp, I didn't get a great signal.  And everyone with their iPhones was like...  The Wi-Fi was down and everyone with their Wi-Fi or their iPhone said, oh, well, can't  you just make, you know, do the portable hotspot thing?  And I said, I don't have any coverage here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  If you don't have any coverage.  I want to see Apple's commercial for video phone sex.  Like how are they going to make that emotional?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Steve is saving us from sex, Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  There's no porno in the world.  There's no sex in Steve's world.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You're right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're right.  It's not, by the way, my direct experience of Steve, but I'll leave it at that.  Maybe sometime over drinks, I'll tell you this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The magic you made together.  Not me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no.  I spent a long about... this was before he went to Apple.  I've told this story before.  He was still at Next.  I spent a long weekend with him, his young wife and their kids.  Then now leave the rest to your imagination.  So no, they're shaking their heads at me.  I don't know what they mean by that.  Let's take a break and come back.  You can think.  We have many more things to talk about.  A new acquisition, actually, I'm sorry, an acquisition that Google made some months ago  comes to life on Picasa.  We'll talk about Facebook and a lot more as we continue this week in Google.  Leo Laporte here.  The show brought to you, as always, by our friends at Citrix who want to remind you about  GoToMeeting.  This is another one of those great Citrix products that built around their remote access  software that saves you time, saves you money, saves you business travel in this case.  I know many of us have spent time in business meetings, conference calls where you're just  thinking, this is the end of the world, or worse, you're stuck in the middle seat flying  somewhere for a one-hour meeting thinking, why?  Why are we doing this?  American Express says the average cost of a business trip these days, and they ought  to know since they do a lot of expense meals, is $1,000 for one trip.  That's airfare, hotel, meals, all of that.  GoToMeeting, less than 5% of it, $49 a month, and you can have all the meetings you want  online.  It's so much better than a conference call because it's visual.  In fact, I would argue it's as effective as an in-person meeting, maybe even more so.  Everyone sees your desktop on their computer screen.  You can meet with up to 15 people at the same time, trade around the desktop so they can  show you something and then you show them something.  It includes voice-over IP and phone conferencing.  It's part of the $49 a month and it's absolutely secure, 128-bit SSL.  Citrix knows how to do this stuff right.  Makes it easy to install, easy to invite people, and very easy for your attendees to join your  meeting.  That's important if you're going to do a sales pitch, you can't have the client jumping  through hoops.  You're trying to convince the client to spend some money with you.  In fact, GoToMeeting impresses them.  It's so easy.  Here's what you do.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig, T-W-I-G.  You'll have it installed in a minute or two.  The next time you want to have a conference call or worse, plan to get in the plane, just  say, send an invitation, say, let's have a meeting online first, see how this works.  You can even do it while you're on a boring conference call.  Just say, please do me a favor.  GoToMeeting.com.  Here's the meeting ID.  Let me show you the PowerPoint, the keynote presentation.  It's so fantastic.  Based on Java, by the way.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  Give it a try for free for the next 30 days and then you tell me what you think.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Apple's senior vice president, Scott Forstall, creates a Twitter account and it's news.  Has he tweeted yet?  I don't think so.  But the point is that most of the time, I don't think you ever see any Apple executives  on Twitter.  Do you ever see Google executives on Twitter?  There's a lot of Googlers on Twitter.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You see Marissa's there.  Is she tweeting?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  And she responds to folks.  She's actually quite responsive.  Really?  What is Forstall's username?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find it here.  This is a TechCrunch article.  Just signed up for Twitter.  Nothing.  He hasn't posted diddly.  Get short, timely messages from Scott Forstall.  Oh, he's just Forstall.  It's Forstall.  It's his last name.  That's easy.  Verified account.  Twitter says, yes, it's him.  I don't know how they know he hasn't tweeted.  He's following one person, Conan O'Brien.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This looks like a defensive, I don't want anybody to fake Steve Mee account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, wishful thinking, Scott.  Nobody's going to fake Forstall.  Really seriously.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, to sign up and just make it a verified account and not post anything that that looks  like a defensive move.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  25,000 people following him.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's crazy.  Well, because TechCrunch reported it, right?  And I'm sure probably a lot of people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is the sound of one hand tweeting?  Nothing.  Dead silence.  All right.  That was a stinky story.  I apologize.  I'll find a better one for you.  Microsoft is going to release a Bing search client for Android in the next six weeks,  according to PC World Magazine.  Have you been waiting for this with bated breath?  Actually, the Bing app is pretty good on the iPhone.  I don't use it, but.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Henry Blodgett at Business Insider, a very good New York.  I love Henry Blodgett.  Yeah.  So Henry said that Bing came after him and made him eat crow because Bing is growing.  And so he find he noshed on the crow and choked a few bones.  And then he said, still, my being at Bing is the same.  No, because he said that they're, if you look at the numbers, they're making no money.  They're spending every dollar in advertising to buy traffic.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  7% growth, but it cost them.  Right.  This is an interesting one.  Apple this just came across the wire.  Apple has just acquired a second mapping service, Poly 9.  They make 3D mapping software that looks a lot like Google Earth using satellite imagery,  aerial photography and geographic information of virtual atlas.  You might remember that a year ago, Apple purchased PlaySpace, which is more like a  Google Maps type product.  We haven't seen them use either product on the iPhone, but it's interesting.  Do you think Apple?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Trying to divorce themselves from Google Maps a little bit?  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would like to dump Google Maps?  I mean, they put Bing on the iPhone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Maps are going to be the winner at local.  Maps are going to be the primary UI, I think, to get you to local stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's where the money is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Would you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  That's interesting.  Do you want local?  The first place you go is Maps.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, no, no, no.  I think it...  You don't go to Yelp.  I went to a restaurant today with my editor and agent.  Isn't that cool?  We talked about you, Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that not a conflict of interest?  Your editor is your agent?  No, no.  Two different people.  Oh, okay.  Gina, you were confused too?  Oh, good.  I was.  I was going, oh, I'm kind of stupid.  I thought you said one person.  Okay.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Your editor...  There was no hyphen there, right?  Editor and agent.  I think you should go see them.  I think you should go to their website, and then you can go to the average blog post,  and then they'll be like, hey, I'm going to sign up for him, because my trick now is  that I look at the menu before I get there so I don't have to, you know, stare down and  be rude.  How's that for neurotic?  Anyway, so I go to...  Google place page.  I use Maps to find out what's around me.  That's the data we're winning.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you start...  That's interesting.  But the link you get is a map.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The link I get is the place page.  The place page is a map.  And or if I'm out and I say, well, gee, where am I going to eat?  I'm in a strange motel.  I go to the maps in that case.  Really?  Say what's around me.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that actually makes sense.  The starting point is Google, which makes it hard for Apple to get into this business.  The starting point is never going to be Apple.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But if my phone, if my phone says, here's where you are, what do you want around you?  Then having their own map app is important, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How about you, Gina?  How do you...  Where do you start if you want location based information?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I've been really into Foursquare lately, so I would probably hit Foursquare.  I should also say that I am a woman of routine.  So I'm often not in a situation where I'm in a strange city where I don't know where  to go.  So that doesn't happen too often.  I have...  I travel between San Diego and New York and I have my favorite places.  But I will often look at Foursquare just to see kind of what's around me and where my  friends are.  Foursquare is interesting.  But of course, that's...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know.  I did a total 180 on Foursquare.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I really like it now.  I like it a lot, actually.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  months.  and start doing the search on reviews of parks, which is all the way to about the

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  is where the winning really comes in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's where social and geo really matter together.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is where frankly, Apple is not a player because they're not a strong web presence,  but Facebook and Google and companies that really live on the web, that's their players.  You can't just say, oh, I'm going to be a player in this space and buy a bunch of companies.  You need to have people using you on the web.  I think so.  Right.  So it makes it very difficult.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I just bought a new machine, I bought a new 13 inch Mac and I switched over and I haven't put all my data in there yet.  So my RSS reader I haven't been using.  So I actually just switched to Google reader.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And I just finally use pin tabs.  I'm behind.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But wait a minute, you better tell us what's pin tabs.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  On Chrome, you can pin a tab.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it's always there.  Right. So I don't have to this problem where I was always closing the Max event layer and move them around or what kind of crap.  But I just, Gina told me to do this three years ago.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got to talk to Gina more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So how do I pin this tab?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I'm looking at my Mac.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  In Chrome, you go to the tab and you control click on it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There it is.  Control click on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And pin tab is always there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Beautiful.  Pin tab.  So now Buzz Machine will always be right there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it should be, Leo.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And it shrinks it down to the favite com, which is my favorite.  I love that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. But you know what, Jeff, you got to work on your favite com.  What the hell is that?  It looks like a piece of paper.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I'm always a blank slate of paper.  It's symbolic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You see, it's symbolic.  He's a blank sheet.  Well, that's handy.  OK, so you so I'm sorry.  I derailed you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is it going to so I'm going more and more away from apps  to straight web stuff.  And it doesn't work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to say that's a news reading is a very good example of that.  I've tried every news reader under the sun and I end up back on reader  Google dot com every time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It works awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Partly because it doesn't have to load.  I mean, a lot of these apps, they're going, OK, hold on.  Let me go out and get the latest headlines.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But the other thing is I never because I never used it.  I never I have some, you know, some thousand people following me  and they're getting nothing.  And now RSS just became social for me to which wasn't before.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I have to say.  And also, Reader has really improved its front page.  So there's actually some useful stuff right at the beginning.  I like the what's hot in Google  reader feed, which is a feed of its own.  And then you're right.  It's again, this is social applied to news.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So now go back to your question, Leo.  I'm not sure where we stand now on is Apple in a worse position  with maps and apps versus web on mobile.  It's different.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right, you can't you're not going to go to a mobile.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I do use Reader.  I'm not going to use  a web page based app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're not. No, you know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you know how much how often you ever open the browser?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  On my on my phone, your Android.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hmm.  Oh, I usually I shouldn't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Not that often.  I mean, I normally start from the search widget on the front page.  If I need to look something up on Google  and I load Think Tank to check on it.  But no, I mostly I use apps.  You're right. That's interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is what's changing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. So if Apple has.  Best signals into its own map app  and its large installed user base and so in advertising.  Now, does it does it have to kill Google Maps to do that?  No, I don't think it does.  I think it just advantages themselves.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is why Apple's strong interest is closed, really, because  that's the ecosystem that that that they survive in.  Open is a bad ecosystem for Apple because they can't compete against Google. Right.  So really, this is probably the force that's pushing Apple away.  I mean, I think hereditarily, Apple would prefer to be open.  I don't know about Steve, but Apple had been open.  And I think what's happening is they see they cannot come.  This is this probably is the Google effect on Apple.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, and go back to the hypercard thing. Right.  Apple always was a tool that enabled people to create.  Well, now, when you get to the most important thing, create apps.  Apple says, no, no, no, no, no.  You can't do that because you might make crap, you might make money.  And you can't do that. Right.  So that's what goes away from the Apple DNA, I think.  Apple was always the great creators tool.  And now it's not.  It's a consumption tool, which is the problem I had with the iPad.  It was consumption more than creation.  My my. Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I've come around to your way of thinking, actually.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you are really having a bad Apple day.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You are.  I was going to ask about the iPad and how much I like the iPad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I love it just as you love candy.  It's not good for you, but you might love it.  It really is candy.  And, you know, I actually had this debate at food camp with  I'm embarrassed to say the guy who created the popular science app,  which is a kind of a really good example,  because here's a beautiful application,  exactly what the publishers and you've talked about this, Jeff, prefer.  The the links are in inward.  Don't take you out there. There's no link economy.  We control the space.  You're reading our stuff.  And I found it unreadable. It was beautiful.  But there was I couldn't read the content.  It was like, no, this isn't what I want.  And I realized that Jeff was right all along.  What I really want is a web page with links in it.  You're right. Oh, I get. And I and I told him that I said,  this is I think I probably use your word regressive.  This is a step backwards in the open link economy.  I and I still love the iPad.  But, you know, the iPads got a browser.  You could still use the browser. It's not like, yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But and I you're more likely to use the browser there than you are on the phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, that's true.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The phone, the browser isn't isn't that good.  So that you're right.  That's that's where we see the split is the app world and the closed world  versus the web world.  Now, then is Google at a disadvantage  because it's the beginning, many of them are not as good.  And it's thinking in terms of Chrome, in terms of browser based applications.  And we don't go to the browser.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The truth is, I'm looking at Reader on the iPad and it's a very capable  in the browser. It's very capable.  It does, you know, kind of the same things  that it would do on a desktop for the iPad anyway.  It's fine. It's just too small for the phone.  The phone, the phone, you know, this is really interesting.  Apple's interest is in keeping this display small  because that's where you that's another thing you need for apps to succeed.  You need a constrained environment.  Right. Not in their interest to have a nice big display on this thing.  Oh, in fact, that's exactly what they did.  They said, well, we'll keep it small.  We'll just make it higher resolution, make it look pretty.  But we're not going to make it big because.  Well, that's the iPad, for one thing, but also it doesn't it.  It kind of obviates our advantage with apps.  Very interesting.  I learned I love this show because I learned something  every time Tom Formsky.  This just came out also writing.  And thanks to the chat room for pointing this out.  Writing on ZD net says, and this is from an article  in the Financial Times that requires subscription behind the paywall.  So I ain't reading it, but I'll read I'll read Tom's  article on this. Google admits employees change  index ratings.  Companies with a high page rank are in a strong position  to move into new markets by pointing to this new information  from their existing sites, they can pass on some of their  existing search engine aura.  Google juice to use Robert Scoble's term, guaranteeing them more prominence.  Google's Mr.  Singal calls this problem the problem of brand recognition,  where companies whose standing is based on their success in one area  uses to venture out into another class of information,  which they may not be rich at.  That that, of course, is how the market works, too.  I mean, a company like Apple becomes strong in one area,  uses its success in that area to branch into other areas.  Google doesn't like that.  So they use human raters to assess the quality of individual sites  in order to counter this effect.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They've been saying that for quite a long time.  I really acknowledged having human.  I've heard them say it.  They've acknowledged having human raters to rate the quality of search results.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  These employees have the power to promote or even completely  erase a site from the Google index.  Well, we knew that because, of course, if you game Google, you'll get erased as well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I always thought, though, that the humans who do do things at Google,  shocking that there are humans that do things that they that they don't  necessarily demote individual sites, but that they make observations  to help tweak the algorithm overall.  This sounds like there are editors who are looking at sites and saying, no,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that's not it, right, right.  We're going to rank you lower.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it sounded I always understood that it was always just about  tweaking the algorithm, but this sounds more editorial.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They still say that.  Oh, this was a fail.  This shouldn't be there.  So I'm going to tell the algorithm, no, no, no, no, no, no.  You shouldn't put that there because there's a difference between.  Well, there was between killing and promoting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But there's also a difference between a site by site  modification and a modification in the algorithm.  So Larry Page always said this.  He said he told me he says, I go to the end, I go to the end of the search results  and I look at the stuff that falls off the edge and we tweak the algorithm for that.  Of course, they do that.  This is different.  This is a guy looking at a site and saying, hmm, no,  that's not fixing the algorithm.  That's that's saying the algorithm gave me the wrong result.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The algorithm is learning from that and saying, you know, right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Like like when you report spam, right?  You say, get this email out of my inbox.  Matt does that. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Matt Cutts does that. He says, OK, this is clearly a spammy site.  They probably respond directly to that site as well as saying to the  the algorithm, hmm, maybe you better fix this part. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, I'm always Google fanboy, but I don't know what they're  they're they're treating this as a big scandal.  Google has employees.  Of course, you have to deal with the results of the algorithm  to make the algorithm better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Scott Cleland is saying that this is the first time Google has admitted this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's some fine point here that I'm missing,  but I have heard it from Googler's mouths that they have people who check.  But I think we talked about the show a long time ago.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, you may be you knew something no one else knew.  God knows. So today, Google.  This is a reading from Scott Cleland's blog, the precursor blog.  Today, Google publicly admitted for the first time that it's purported  neutral and unbiased search algorithm is not completely automated  or computer algorithmic.  Rip. Amit Singhal is the is the guy there.  Oh, I met him.  Mr. Singhal calls the problem of brand recognition when we talked about this.  And then this from Google's website, he quotes, 10 things we know to be true.  We never manipulate rankings to put our partners higher in our search results.  And no one can buy better page rank. Well, that's not this isn't right.  That's not that's not that.  Are our users trust our objectivity?  No, I don't. I don't think that that's clear.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Cleland has has a thing for Google and is constantly listening,  saying on emails every day. OK, playing about them.  They may be right. I don't know.  This may be this may be manipulation of a higher form than I'm aware of.  All I'm suggesting here is that they've always had humans  doing quality checks on search results.  And as a result, that affects sites.  They've also always had humans decreeing spam.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So here's the he does raise this point, which I think is legitimate to raise.  OK, so there is somebody making these decisions  and there are antitrust suits filed over it.  Antitrust authorities, he said, should want to know how these human  raiders maintain objectivity and what internal controls are in place  for this human process not to be abused.  That's reasonable.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it is.  And I think the real problem Google's had, I've said it on this show,  is that they are godlike there.  They have godly if our Google argues that normally they're  they have an open marketplace of advertising and hey,  succeed or fail based on the quality of your ad and the clicks  and the price of those ads.  That's not true when it comes to deciding that a site is spam. Right.  So when they've gotten the suits from a site that says, no, I'm a directory,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  not spam site. How dare you?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And there is a a difference there.  So sorry, I just had something weird on my computer.  So when Google says, no, no, no, you're spam.  They are godlike saying that.  And I have argued for a long time.  No one listens.  But Google should have a jury of peers. Right.  It's in no one's interest to have bad search results and have come up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  At the very least, Google needs to be more less opaque about this,  more transparent about this, because it's a black box right now.  You just, you know, the index goes in, sites go in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And the argument there is, is you find out the tricks.  You'll you'll only be better at gaming it.  I think it's in these cases of dispute rather than having Google employees  adjudicate them and get themselves in this trouble because they're just so damn big.  I think if you had 10 generally trusted business people  able to review this and say anonymous, I mean, I mean,  identity hidden so they can't be bribed.  But to say, no, you know, Google, you're wrong on that one.  That one looks OK to me.  And if enough agree, then it stays up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If this is an interesting, this is an interesting.  Of course, you're it's completely meaningless if it's Bing.  It's much more meaningful because it's Google and they have so much power.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're vulnerable to accusations of antitrust just from the power.  So the way to get around this monopoly  accusation is to say, yeah, we're huge.  But you're right, Leo, we are as transparent as we can be wherever it is.  A, B, the marketplace handles these decisions.  We don't. And C, when there are disputes,  here is our dispute resolution mechanism.  So there can be no complaints. Right.  So you make complaints, Phil, but sorry, this is the way it works.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I also think that the it's kind of a false.  We shouldn't differentiate between like it's it's the algorithm.  So it's good or it's humans and it's potentially bad.  I mean, humans created the algorithm, right?  The algorithm is just a conglomeration of human judgments over time.  Right. That the computers are just, you know, been programmed to make automatically.  So I think that it's, you know, reasonable.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're right. The algorithm is a statement of prejudices.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, the algorithm is just automated human judgment.  You know, human judgment automated.  That's good. You're saying that this is this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It requires a programmer to say this, because those of us who are not programmers  think that there's something completely objective and magical about this.  And it's a math. It's math.  There's no humans involved. It's math.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, no, there's yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's an expression of a human.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, exactly.  But the algorithm is an expression of the engineers for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very good point. Very good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's it's David Weinberger who always says brilliant things,  but he does a great spiel about Dewey Decimal System  and how Mr. Dewey had his prejudices and they are evident in the system.  There's like a hundred numbers for Christianity and two for Judaism  and one for everything else.  And the system brings forward the prejudices.  And I think there's I've never seen studies done about trying to back into  search and algorithmic things like that to try to say to suss out.  What are those judgments?  How can you learn the judgments from what it does?  And recognize the prejudices it then naturally has.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very interesting.  Just circle around to our conversation about mobile versus the web.  Steve Rubell writing in that age,  writes an interesting article called It's Time to Prepare  for the End of the Web as We Know It.  He quotes a Morgan Stanley report that says within five years,  global Internet consumption on mobile devices will surpass that activity on PCs.  We're clearly seeing that trend.  We're away from PCs and towards mobile.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But what's a mobile device?  Right. Well, the eye is your eye.  Had a mobile device.  So your five inch Dell thing, a mobile device is is your car, a mobile device,  or is it a whole new kind of device?  I think that's the problem with this discussion of declaring things dead.  Is that it well, there's this there's new definitions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's a continuum.  But I think that even on even something as big as an iPad,  it's not the same as a notebook.  And it is a different experience.  But certainly on a phone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo is the same thing when we switch from desktops to notebooks.  We're there now. Yeah, you're right.  We've already done it. Yeah. Right.  And so was that really such a big deal?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We know what our lap don't don't don't these small devices,  as we were talking about earlier, favor apps over the web.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, that's true.  That's so really that's the trend.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is a continuum.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We're also going to go to things like voice. Right.  Commands more.  And we may do that with our laptops and our desktops, too.  All I'm trying to say is that is that I think Steve's wonderful.  I love the guy.  But but this kind of declaration of something dying  is usually suspect.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, I'm with you on that.  I guess what he's trying to say to the readers of advertising age is  how do you change how you think about marketing and media, too, I guess,  given what is what is a clear trend?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Let me ask you both, Gina.  Compared today to a year or two ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mm hmm.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There was a time when you had to get your email 100 percent on your computer.  What percentage of time do you do email checking now on a mobile device  instead of a computer?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, a lot more. Yeah, a lot more.  I deal with email like in the spaces when I'm standing in line and,  you know, in the car, a way more so percentage of time. I mean,  God, I have to say 60 or 70 percent of the time I'm checking email,  responding email, processing email on my mobile device for sure.  I'm a very heavy email user on Android.  It's the only way I can stay on top of it is using that kind of extra few minutes  I have, you know, standing in line somewhere for sure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I check, but I don't write.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm the same way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I'll check it and delete it or maybe process it.  But but I don't like to it's hard to write on these things.  So I don't respond a lot.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I use one liners.  Yeah, one liners.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And in fact, I think this is hurting my email because I kind of now feel like,  well, I've looked at it, but I haven't really looked at it.  Yeah. So in a way, three weeks later, somebody says, hello.  I think you say I saw it.  I meant to respond, but I wasn't I wasn't at my desk.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I thought it was so important.  I looked at it on my mobile.  So I didn't do anything.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You need a good email productivity system, Leo.  We should talk about that. Do you have one?  I mean, I have a follow up folder that I label stuff follow up.  And I and when I get back to my computer and I have, you know, the full screen  and stuff, I go to it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For the longest time, I've wanted to do a show with you and Merlin  just on this, on productivity.  Let's just like, please help me.  But I'm also kind of thinking that I don't think there's any solution to this.  So maybe I don't think so.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I do. I put this is going to show here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is it? I put it looks like your stomach.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, now it's your crotch. OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We talk about that too much.  I put post-it notes on the laptop.  Well, I go back and I can write down old notes there.  It doesn't work. I have notes here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Posted notes. You are so retro.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Posted notes.  I'm one of these Embug Zero freaks.  Are you? You still are?  Yeah, I empty my my.  So when I'm looking at my email, kind of on the go, I empty it out,  put the stuff I need to do something about and follow up archive.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Nobody hears since you've had an empty email box, Leo. Never.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Never.  I'm super anal freak, though, so I'm not a good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm not. You know, what you have to do is hypnotize both of us.  That's the only thing that's going to change us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I only have let me see.  I'll just check on my inbox right now.  Looks like I have fifty two thousand nine hundred eighty eight messages.  Six thousand nine hundred five unread.  So I'm kind of screwed.  How could I get to zero from that, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Select all. And delete.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But look carefully.  I think there's something from Gina Turpani in there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There is. There is. I see my name in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gmail changed our habits there because we kept everything now.  Yeah, which is good, which I like.  But it means there's no such thing as an empty mailbox.  For us, normal people, Gina,

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I just I have to differentiate between the stuff that I have to do something about  and the stuff that I don't.  And like, that's that's the key differentiator for me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I just wait. I have Leo's rule.  I wait till they come back to me three times.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, that's one that's definitely one way to do it.  And you can certainly trust that the important stuff will bubble up again.  For sure. No, I mean, that works.  It might annoy the people.  But we have to do it because there's no hope.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  To quote Dave Allen, I do not have a mind like water.  You don't mind like, I don't know what, like a turbulent pool.  I did. In fact, I would love to be very interested in how to solve this.  You know what I recently took off?  I had an auto responder on there, which would basically say,  hey, I got your mail, but don't expect anything.  And I mean, it was more elaborate, but that was the gist of it.  And I took that off because then people I know were saying,  well, I keep getting this responder. Are you seeing your mail?  It's like, well, yes, can't you read?  It says I got your mail.  I get a lot of mail.  I'll read it, but I may not respond to you.  But they don't get that. They'd say it was automatic.  So now I just turn it off and say, screw you.  It's an empty hole.  Just send the black hole of Leo's email. Just send it.  Maybe I'll get back to you. I don't know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know what to do.  I've declared email bankruptcy. Now I've declared life bankruptcy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do I have an obligation just because somebody emailed me?  Do I have an obligation to them?  No, you do not.  Otherwise, I'm opening myself up to the world and I have obligations to too many people.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I had a guy yesterday who yelled at me.  He God bless him.  They had a discussion about my book and they wrote this little thing.  And I wrote back immediately. I said, thank you very much.  I look at those with interest, which I actually did.  He started yelling at me, well, you only spent three seconds on this.  And I just went after him.  I said, you know, I got other things in life, man.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I got kids.  Totally. And let me just be clear, just because I have an empty inbox  does not mean that I reply to everyone.  I mean, I'm pretty ruthless about there's a lot of people I don't reply to.  So what do you do? You just delete.  The person who's offering me money for a job that I want to do,  you know, I want to, you know, I want to get back to them or whatever.  I just because someone emailed emails, he doesn't mean you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no. And the truth is, I don't have a problem deleting email.  My problem is I get a lot of email that is people offering me money.  So I can't even respond to that.  It's like I get a lot of email that I would, you know, in a normal world,  I would I would respond to.  But there's so we have created so many inputs for ourselves  and so many ways that people can get their hands into our minds.  I don't know what to do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We don't have new social norms. We don't.  Established yet. That's I think the bigger problem here.  Sorry, my light just went out. I'm dead.  Back to life.  We don't have norms that handle this stuff yet. Yeah.  And, you know, I I've I I insulted the hell out of that man  by not responding to him, given an equal time for what he gave me.  Sorry, I can't do that.  It happens all the time.  There's not a structure to say that. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Happens all the time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's why I like sometimes doing that one line reply from your phone,  because it it kind of gives you a little bit of an out, you know.  What is it? What is program responses?  Yeah. Yeah. What do you say?  Unfortunately, Gmail doesn't do canned responses in the Android app.  And that's actually one of the things that I really wish that I did have.  So I use Gmail's canned responses on the desktop.  So if there's something that needs a canned response, I'll put it in follow up.  And then when I'm back on my computer, I'll do that.  So sometimes I am handling stuff more than I need to.  But but I'm saying if somebody sends me a long email and I just have,  you know, one line thing to say, it's almost good if you do it on your phone  and you have that on my mobile, because it's kind of this socially  acceptable way to be brief without being.  I do put that in my signature now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It says sent for my iPad, sent for my iPhone.  So the next is one.  So they understand.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And now you can put a rich text signature.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, you can.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, maybe you just tip.  I don't want to say anything. I'm sorry.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That was my tip, but that's OK.  All right. Never mind. Coming up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Google has responded to the Street View.  Fracca.  Having spoken to the relevant regulators,  we've decided to start Street View driving in Ireland,  Norway, South Africa and Sweden once again.  Notice Germany.  Grandma, they're coming.  Germany's not on this list.  We expect to add more countries in time.  Here's the deal.  Our cars will no longer collect any Wi-Fi information at all.  But we'll continue to collect photos and 3D imagery.  We recognize serious mistakes were made.  They took a line from the White House.  Serious mistakes were made in the collection of Wi-Fi  payload data and we have worked.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  At least we're not polluting the world with oil.  Yeah, could be worse.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And we worked so quickly to rectify them.  However, we also believe Street View is a great product for users,  whether people want to find a hotel, check out a blah, blah, blah.  So basically, they're saying.  That both the hardware and software will have been removed  to do this from all Street View vehicles before they resume driving,  but they are going to resume driving.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wonder if they're taking away the phones of the people so they can't  have their own Wi-Fi on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, well, I bet they're going to sanitize the hell out of it, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'll put there.  I found my shock yesterday.  Street View came to one block away from me and I live way out in the boonies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't want to see the Street View car because I want to moon them or something.  I mean, I figure people now kind of know that that's what's going on  when they see that wacky vehicle go by.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's got to be recognizable now.  I wanted to go down the street that the San Diego Convention Center is on,  on Comic-Con weekend.  That's what I want.  So we can get some store servers on the map.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Start picking good times to do stuff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right. You are right.  That's like that's like getting the great moments from from the sky.  You want to propose great moments to do Street View.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  You know, the Google the airplanes flew over O'Reilly's campus in Sebastopol  when Foo Camp was going on a few years back.  I want to say it was like Foo 607.  So, yeah. So if you zoom into the O'Reilly campus on the Google Maps,  I think it's still there.  You'll see their yard is full of tents.  And that's great.  Yeah. They had some like soccer playing robots and people set up some  oh, that's neat projects and stuff, which is cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's really when I was at Foo Camp this year, I met the guy who  piloted the Street View shopping cart through the museum in Tehran, in Iraq.  Yeah, pretty neat, pretty neat stuff.  So we talked last week about Google buying an airline  travel information service.  Facebook has acquired one now.  Next stop, it's a user generated  traffic. So they said this was mainly an acquire

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  a high rate of talented more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a talent acquisition, they call it.  Yeah, because if it's user generated,  the date, you're not really getting much value from the data.  It's a shame, though, because I hate it when this happens.  Like CDDB getting acquired by Grace Note.  Here's a database that was kind of created out of altruism and goodwill  by individuals. And then a big company gets it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, there's another way around this is AOL has  what the heck's the name of their mapping service?  I can't remember it. We used to all map quest.  And so MapQuest is switching to using the OpenMap platform.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good. Oh, OpenMap.  What is it called? OpenMap?  We did. We interviewed them.  It's such a great project.  And it's amazing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's kind of great about it is that that way they're not buying it,  but they're getting the benefit out of it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  OpenStreetMap. OpenStreetMap.  That's right. Fantastic project.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's basically a wiki for mapping.  And because so many people have GPS is now.  I mean, I looked at my neighborhood.  It's better than Google Maps. It's very detailed.  They got elevations.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you take the wiki, you know, cultural view of the world,  maybe you could even have more local data than the Google Maps.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Precisely. And they do things like hiking and biking trails  that are hard to get a Google Street View van down.  They say surplus. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not in my house, but somewhere September 1st.  I'm in a big deficit right now.  Cognitive deficit.  That's going to be my book.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You need to buy some cognition from somewhere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's going to be a very short book.  Huh? Huh?  I'd write a book, but I have cognitive deficit.  I'll let you know when I've got a surplus.  Starting September 1st, NextUp will shut down the site.  In the meantime, you'll be able to export your content.  NextUp will not share its users personal information with Facebook.  They didn't, you know, they'll protect you in that case.  That's good news.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Social travel is kind of an opportunity.  I use Tripit. I love Tripit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to add you to my network.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's fantastic. It's so great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So for those who don't know, Tripit is a site, Tripit.com.  In fact, another guy I met at the founder at Food Camp.  I had fun at Food Camp.  Well, you sure did. I met some great people.  Anyway, I met the founder and I said, I love Tripit.  I'm kind of a fool myself.  He said, well, you kind of made my reputation with my little kid, my son,  because I was talking about Tripit on the radio and they happen to be in the car.  And he said, Danny, they're talking about your company.  And it gave him some credit.  Yeah. So I feel good.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Validated his career to his son.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love that. Yeah, to his little kid anyway.  Yeah. It's like it's like bows of the clown saying, hey, kids, Tripit.  So Tripit is a website free, but I'm a premium member.  I'm sure you are too, Jeannie.  And and you go to this site, actually set up an account.  And then whenever you get travel confirmations, you email plans at Tripit.com  and it chews on them and builds an itinerary.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you just forward, you know, your confirmation from your airline or your hotel.  And then it just builds it and it tells you how many miles you've logged in a year.  Like, I love the stats.  It tells you if your friends are going to be in the city at the same time.  It's it's for road warriors, for sure.  I really didn't see the true value until I had like six or seven months  where I had a lot of trips and it was fantastic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wish it had existed when I was more of a road warrior.  I could have really used it.  And of course, there's interesting here in that nexus of mobile and web.  There are mobile apps for it, which are great.  And they were smart. They exposed an API.  So they're a third party apps, although  I can't remember his name, the CEO of Tripit said, you're going to use our app, though, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  He's the Tripit Android app is great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's fantastic. It's great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I stopped printing out, you know, the you know, the address of my hotel or having  to look at my email, I just launched, you know, you land at a new city  and you bring up the Tripit app and it's like, here's directions.  You know, I know what to tell the cabier. It's fantastic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And you can add you can add pictures.  It gives you weather, as you said, maps.  It's it's really nice.  He told me some new features that are coming.  This is and I put pictures in as I'm going to places.  Oh, I mean, it's really, you know, you're right.  What was the one that was bought by Nokia?  Was it Telenev or NavTik?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I don't mean that was the Tripit similar one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, something like that. Yeah.  I wonder if I have old trips on here.  I could show you my trip to China. Yeah, past trips.  This is one when I first started using Tripit  for the travel that I was going to do.  I ended up putting in all these pictures as I went to places.  I'd put more pictures in of the places I was going.  And it really was kind of fun because it was a way to think about the trip  and and all the places we're going to go visit.  And now it's kind of a I don't know, it's just kind of a document I have.  It's kind of neat.  Anyway, how did we get into Tripit dot com?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We were talking about Facebook purchasing this next stop.  All right. Social travel.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So in that respect, Tripit, you could follow your friends.  And you use that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a few friends who travel around.  And so, yeah, I get these Tripit alerts that say, you know, so and so  was in New York this weekend or you and so and so are going to be in San  Francisco around the same time. And it's kind of neat.  So actually, yeah, Anil and I use it to kind of coordinate our trips for expert labs.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I want to add you to my address book.  I just need to add you, I guess. I'll have to figure that out.  Yeah, that's cool.  Speaking of Anil, he tweeted that you've got to change the name of think tank.  What's the deal?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We do. We do.  You know, it's a simple thing.  Another company has software that does crowd sourcing very similar to what we do.  And and, you know, they have the name first and they asked us really nicely to  to change ours, you know, to reduce confusing and confusion and Google  juice and that kind of thing.  So we are on the hunt for a new name.  They were they were very gracious and gave us some time to come up with a new name  and switch over, which is nice.  A lot of a lot of times these things are like, here's a lawyer.  You need to do this in three days. They were super nice.  So so yeah, we're on the hunt for a new name.  We're lots of brainstorming happening.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Any good choices in there?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm I don't want to throw any out there because we haven't decided on one.  It's torture. It's torture.  I hate doing that.  Let's be honest. Choosing a name is really hard.  Really hard. It is. It is.  I have some anxiety about it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It doesn't much matter.  Daylife, where I'm a partner, I when they came up with a brand,  I thought it sounded like a day spa.  I wanted to get a massage there.  And now it just sounds like what it is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's true. It doesn't matter.  I just I don't it's so hard.  You know, you don't want to get stuck into that sort of the typical startup.  You know, but you realize in the naming process is how all these companies  come up with what sound like sort of crazy names.  Ultimately, it's the product that matters and not the name.  But you do want to come up with something good,  something that has someone has used before.  So it's a challenge.  It's getting harder and harder, I have to say, because it's not just a name.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not just a trademark.  You have to get a website, you have to get a this and that and email.  I mean, it's gotten much more complicated.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it has. It has. So we're working on it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, it's good we named our kids a few years ago, because nowadays  I don't know how you name kids.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, because you want you want domains.  I mentioned that in the book that there are families  who now check domains before they give the kid the name.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Families, I would guess everybody does that.  Yeah. Oh, boy.  So it was originally Twitterly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it was originally Twitterly, which was my idea.  I'm the engineer.  I like Twitterly.  Program our name.  And yeah, we just we didn't do we didn't do our due diligence.  We really should have researched a little more.  We were concerned Dave Weiner.  Well, that's what I was going to say. Yeah, Dave.  We consulted with him and he gave us his his blessing and said that  to his knowledge, no one else had been using the name.  And so we really appreciated that.  So we thought we were free and clear. But but we weren't.  So that's OK. And projects go.  I feel like this is a kind of mandatory growing pain of any any of any project.  You're right. Sort of, you know, traction, right?  If someone's worried about us using their name, then we've actually got something.  So I'm trying to look at it that way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go. It's a positive.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think I'm an interesting Google related story.  Twenty three and me, which is that personal genetics analysis service  that Sergei's Sergei's partner founded.  They did a sale a while back.  It was like ninety nine dollars to have your, you know, genome analyzed.  And so I jumped on it because normally it's like five hundred dollars  or something. And I got my results back and I need to write this up.  I haven't I haven't written up.  And obviously it's can potentially contain a lot of really personal information.  But I am very relieved to to to find out that I have most likely brown eyes,  which I can confirm.  I genetically tend toward straighter hair than average,  which I can also confirm.  I have and this is kind of gross, wet earwax.  I know you want to know that.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's toward dry skin.  So so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, but here's the weird thing.  She's she's related to Eric the Red.  So don't they tell you that, like where you where your people came from  and stuff like that? They do. They do.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You kind of have to fill in all this other information about your parents,  your grandparents. I actually haven't gone that far.  And I need to I need to dive into the results a little more.  It's incredibly broad.  One of the scarier things was they said, you know, we have all these results for you,  but we got this one result that you have to unlock to see.  So I click on unlock and it says that there's a particular gene  that has a very strong correlation of Parkinson's disease.  And it knows whether or not you have this gene and it wants to let you know.  But like in order to find out, you need to understand that this,  this could be potentially really scary information  and maybe you don't want to know and all this stuff.  So I'm sitting at my computer just like,  you know, thinking about Parkinson's disease.  It's a little bit of a scary, scary thing.  I don't have it.  I was it was a very.  Yes, yet.  I did. I did. I checked.  I'm good. I'm in the clear.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they're warning you that you.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That they know whether or not you have this gene,  which is kind of has a strong correlation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you said, OK, and then they said you don't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. I said, OK, and they said you don't.  So it was a huge.  What did they bring it up for?  Yeah, it was one of these kind of user experiences where I was like,  did I need to go through all that anxiety before I looked at that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I guess I guess it's like, you know, call the doctor back.  If I hate that, they only told you if you had it,  then as soon as they tell you that you should, you should.  Yeah, but she doesn't have it. Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So what do they randomly pick a sample of people who don't have it  to warn them so that the people that they are that do have it will know that?  Well, just because you see this warning doesn't mean you have it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, what are they doing?  I don't know. I don't know what that it was.  And anybody has anybody else done 23 and me?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you get warning that you had Parkinson's?  She got the warning to.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I didn't get that because I looked two years ago.  Maybe maybe it's new, but I I did 23 of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the new one.  Everyone who gets that test, the new test gets that information  available to them and they can choose whether to look at it or not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Anna Ravenscroft is in studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their doctor and ask their doctor about it so that people don't get scared  and sue them about freaking out that.  Oh, my God, you told me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So everybody who opts for that test is going to get the warning  that we don't want to tell you the result of the test  unless you understand the ramification.  Oh, that's fair.  And Alex, do you have Parkinson's disease?  No, he doesn't either. OK.  You're OK, Anna? Yeah.  Yeah. OK.  So all three of you got warned, but didn't have it.  So don't worry if you get the warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm adopted.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so that must be interesting for you to adopt because you know anything.  Yeah. So it was wonderful.  All right. I might do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To be able to give them some family medical history.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, aren't you getting your entire genome done?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I you know, I never heard back from them.  You're kidding me. Maybe they don't want it.  I don't know. Yeah, I did this whole thing with the with George at Harvard.  And I said, I volunteer because there's only like 20 people  and it's expensive and blah, blah, blah.  And no, nothing.  So maybe I'll just do 23 and me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It tells you, so I look at it and guess what?  My my ancestors are from Europe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ha ha ha ha. You're kidding.  Shocking. I can't.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I can't be. Well, the funny thing about this is there is a family picture  of my grandmother on my mother's side and my wife says, Jeff, she's black.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's African-American. Oh, that's good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it does look like that.  But no, the 23 of me said, oh, I like that a lot.  I would have especially.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, you're about the whitest guy I've ever met.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly. I mean, there's no bread named after me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I suppose you go far enough back.  We've got a little bit of everything in there, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I would like that.  I'm still just as boring as I ever was.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So would you I haven't done this.  I would you guys recommend this is a cheek swab blood.  What do they do?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's fit fit. More fit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's easy. I got lots of spit.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a really bizarre experience.  Can I give them wet earwax instead?  Yeah, it's wet or dry earwax.  Apparently you'd have one or the other.  I guess it's like whether or not your ear is attached.  But but but getting that the Parkinson's news  was a very strange thing to happen on a web browser.  Like I was definitely like, oh, this is weird.  But well, now we know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What did you do? You called that a user, a UI issue.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's such a programmer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It scared me half to death.  Although it's the UI of life and death.  I feeling like I'm so happy to be alive and healthy.  So I guess that was a good thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So so this is the next ad you see is for a travel around the world  because what the hell I'll celebrate. Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Where do I want to travel in the next seven hours?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, you can see all the diseases and traits that they cover.  I mean, it's it's incredible.  And I guess they know the gene markers for all of these things.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I think you're saying if I had the old test,  then I wouldn't have some of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they've added some new things on the new test.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I pull that mic in front of you, because we actually do have a mic  that you can speak into.  We don't. You're just a little bit off mic there.  That's my fault.  No, no, it's my fault.  I should have just done this in the first place. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a new test and upgrade that you can do.  And you spit in the tube again and resend it.  And they will do a lot more gene sequencing to find out  new things that they know.  And they're adding new things all the time based on studies that come out.  So is this the best one? You think it's  the one that I found really cool?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All three of you have done it. It must be. It must be a good.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is I haven't really played with this yet,  but it does let you people can come to you and say we're related.  Do you want to connect?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, boy, that's scary.  Talk about it. I already got an email problem.  I don't want to open that can of worms.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, I got a lot of a lot of worms in my can.  Oh, my family's from the hills, West Virginia.  So God knows.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got a pretty mouth.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I do. We kind of like a lot.  We like each other a lot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's take a break. We're going to come back.  Actually, let's not take a break. I don't have a commercial.  Let's go right into our tip, pick and tip number and tool of the week,  starting with Gina Tripani, her tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Sure. Jeff mentioned it earlier.  Gmail now supports.  No, no, that's OK. Give the details.  Gmail now offers rich text signatures.  And, you know, honestly, I wouldn't have thought this is that big a deal.  I'm a big fan of plain text email, but I build this a Firefox extension for Gmail.  And this rich text signatures is one of my most requested features.  That's what Google said, too. Same thing. Yeah, it's amazing.  So rich text signature just means you can use HTML to format your name  and your contact information.  You can add a company logo.  And so now this isn't even a labs thing.  This is just in settings.  If you go to Gmail settings, you can create a signature  with images and colors and formatted text.  And you have the option for either plain text or rich text.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to make my entire signature in Comic Sans.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What do you comic sans, baby? Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What was the LeBron font? Yeah, that was it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the LeBron font. We call that the LeBron.  This is the Cleveland Cavaliers style signature now.  Can you put images in there as well? Yeah, I believe you can. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The Google shows a Google logo there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I could get a link. I could put an email address.  So what do you think about this?  I mean, it's better than HTML, I think, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, I think it is HTML, ultimately. Oh, it is?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think so. Yeah. It's kind of a constrained HTML.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can't. I'm a nerd.  I'm plain text email all the way.  But I think, you know, most normal people like to format their email  to look nice. Right.  And it's about time. And literally, it's been years.  People have wanted to know this is kind of like the big thing  that people want in Gmail,  is people to control their signature, format that signature.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  When I saw that you put that in there,  what my wish was, was I wish I could put a legal signature.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm driven nuts. Is there a legal signature?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, what I do now is I just put a GIF on the documents  because I'm driven nuts. I still have a fax machine.  I have a separate phone line for it. I want to kill it.  And there's just these legal documents that you've got to, you know,  every time I do a speaking engagement, I've got to give them a,  you know, the tax form with a legal signature.  And I just get that up with it.  This is the only thing that ever affects anymore.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But what makes it legal?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, I see you're talking about an image, a scan signature, an electronic signature.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You mean? Yeah, one that they would accept. Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What would make it legal?  I mean, if it's just a scan signature.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, then you get into the whole thing we haven't discussed on the show,  which is the White House's effort to create, you know, an identity card,  an online identity card.  I suppose at some point, that's what it is. Right.  I verify I am Jeff Jarvis and I say yes to this.  That's probably the only really legit way to do it.  But I think about now by just putting on a gift.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Why not just put a gift in there?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But your Twitter verified account isn't good enough.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what I like.  The Google profiles thing that's that you can get verified there.  We got to get somewhere with that.  All right. Rich text signatures.  Gina doesn't like them, but use them.  We know you want them.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If you want them, they're there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What do they degrade gracefully?  I guess they would. If I said I only want text emails, I'd probably get the text.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, they should.  That should. But that's a good experiment.  I'm going to try and find out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can I say can I tell I think I can tell Gmail I don't want anything but plain text.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, actually, you can so you can compose in either plain text or rich text.  But the email that you receive in the Gmail client anyway, displays as,  you know, as it was sent.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't I can't turn off H2 or HTML or RTF.  Oh, and I said she she knows a way to do it.  There's some magic way to do it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It'll it'll give you a button, say show images.  Yeah, I see the images thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Show all pictures or only show pictures I've chosen for my contacts.  Oh, that's contact pictures.  Personal snippets. All right.  Anyway, I'm sure we'll find out now.  That's one way.  That's one way to find out is just assert the opposite and see what happens.  Jeff, your number of the week, my friend.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I stockpiled them.  Many numbers.  It could have been mobile Facebook hits 150 million users  up from only 100 million in April.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I stayed away from that one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Where Squarespace spending thirty eight million dollars in.  By the way, we were very happy about that,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because Squarespace is one of our we like that more money sponsors.  And I got an email from them last night saying,  you're going to see this cross the wire.  Big news. That's a lot of money for a blogging platform.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's really gutsy to come in at this stage.  But it wasn't that.  It could have been that the iPhone for recall would cost one point  five billion dollars, but we're tired of talking about iPhones.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's no way in the world Apple's going to recall this thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Though I'm waiting for some suits on this.  I think that, you know, there already are.  Was devastating.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, there already are lawsuits.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So what it is, because I want to ask you guys, is 4K,  which is the YouTube goes to the 4K video up from the 1080.  Huge. How does that?  The question I have for you is on my laptop screen  or on my TV screen, does that make a big difference?  Or is that because they said that that properly should be on a 25 foot screen  checked by a projector the size of a refrigerator?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I disagree.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Does it just waste a hell of a lot of bandwidth?  Yes. That's all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So for what 4K is, is twice the width and twice the height of HD TV.  So it's it's 4000 by 2000.  Let me put it this way. I've seen a lot of 4K displays.  This is one of the things that I keep saying instead of 3D.  It's already been, you know, Hollywood's behind the standard.  There is a standard for it.  There are cameras that can do it. These red cameras can do it.  I've said it for a long time. Forget 3D. Give me 4K.  This is real. And if you see a beautiful 4K display,  it looks like you're looking at a window.  It's very hard to tell it from reality. Very effective.  So YouTube is the story is YouTube is now going to offer 4K videos on YouTube.  The problem is, as you said, first of all, you need a 4000 by 2000 display.  Most people don't have.  I guess if you had a 30 inch display, even on HD, the Maxis HD.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So there's no way I can see any difference on a regular TV.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You won't see it on a computer display. You might.  There are 2000 lines of resolution on some computer displays.  But you also need  a lot of bandwidth.  You know, they say four megabits, but that's to watch it in real time.  That's, you know, means you need at least eight to 10 megabits.  And, you know, practically.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is this a little shot across the bow of the ISPs, just like Google  Towns, which they put up as a website, by the way?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It makes sense that if you're going to do gigabit networking,  this would be one of the applications, hyper real video. All right.  It's a bizarre thing to support because few people create can create it.  Fewer still can watch it.  You know, I mean, it takes a lot of something to watch.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm looking at the playlist.  There's a playlist of YouTube videos.  Yeah, we played it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We played some of them on MacBreak Weekly.  We talked about this, but.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And they look sure they look high quality.  You can't tell, Gina, because you know.  Yeah, I mean, that's you know, I mean, it looks like a high quality  YouTube video, which even if you pause it on a frame, you still get  there's still some fuzziness.  It's not like it's it's as good.  A single frame still isn't as good as, say, a still picture.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you're watching it on the freaking Internet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right. So it looks nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, look at the thing that's that kind of is mind boggling  is that we're even to this stage at this point.  Yes, that's true.  When I mean, it was just a couple of years ago that we started doing.  Alex Lindsay started doing  1080p video for the MacBreak podcast and we nobody could watch it.  You know, you couldn't even you couldn't even see it.  So, you know, I think we're what Google's saying is,  get ready, high quality videos on the way and YouTube.  It's interesting because it's also saying is YouTube.  I think this is the semiotics of it is, hey, we're not just growing shot videos.  You know, we got we're going to be a place  that you will come to watch high quality video.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, that's twice in one broadcast that you use the word semiotic.  I just learned that if you use in Kuwait.  I mean, this would give New Yorkers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, boy. Too late.  I already have that. In fact, God damn it.  I'm sorry. Gosh darn it, New Yorker.  A PDF of your magazine does not count as an online version.  Would you please get it out there?  This is ridiculous.  If you're a subscriber, you can go online to the website  and read the entire magazine, but it's a freaking PDF.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I just want you to want to get that out there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He doesn't ask much.  He doesn't ask much at all.  All he wants is a little bit of technology since 1990.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, really.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Relatedly, my book is now available as an EPUB.  Thank you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Gina. I keep waiting.  I trust the PDF.  I keep waiting. And I know it's regressive and all that.  But if the New Yorker did it in iPad app, I would I would buy it. Absolutely.  So you may remember that this a couple of months ago,  about six months ago, Google bought Picnic,  which is a online kind of JavaScript based  photo editing service.  You've probably used it on Flickr and they were offering it on  on I think for as a paid version.  But now if you use Picasso Web, you will find an edit in Picnic button.  And Google has now made it public, which is fantastic.  I think Picasso Web is is really kind of underappreciated.  It's not Flickr yet, but it but it's it's getting there.  It could really be Flickr in some ways.  Let me see here. Let's just click on an image.  So this is my tool, obviously, my tool of the week.  There's my teeth.  Now, if I wanted to edit those,  press a button and there goes Picnic.  This is I would guess Gina and HTML five app, right.  Or is it Flash?  Might be Flash, might be Flash.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It might be Flash.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, it must be Flash.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What happens if you right click on it?  Do you get the Adobe?  Yep. Yep, that's Flash. That's Flash.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you can do a lot of cool things with it.  Rotation, red eye reduction has some nice auto fixing features.  And then there's a premium version, which you can also buy for  starting at two dollars and eight cents a month,  which is interesting because Picasso is free and Picasso Web's free.  But for some reason, they want to make us a commercial  version as well. Still a lot cheaper than Photoshop,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  which is overloaded with too much functionality.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think this is for most people what they're going to need.  Red eye sharpen exposure, resize crop.  It's kind of the fundamentals.  And then if you if you if you buy the premium, you get things like  you can print stickers and stuff like that.  They have more touch up tools.  It's just a matter of time before the functionality of Photoshop  and Lightroom and Aperture is available online.  This is this stuff is getting very close.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And this looks like a Chrome OS play, right?  Because you can edit your image in Picasso on the desktop.  But this is kind of an option when Chrome OS comes out.  You'll be able to edit your images.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, speaking of Chrome, Gina,  since you did this, I think, or someone did this on Lifehacker.  Have you used Chrome to phone?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah, we talked about it last week.  That was her pic last week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, that's when I went off the air.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, we lost you. That's right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Never mind. I'll watch the replay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's it's great. I use it all the time now.  OK, yeah.  Another reason to stick with Android, I have to say.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Look at that. Look at that smug, Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's not smug.  That's genetically pure.  Brown eyed, straight hair, wet wax smile.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Open source loves you.  Come back.  Enough of this.  I'm an open source advocate.  I feel I'm certainly a Google advocate, but I'm I Google  and my values are aligned right now and open source loves you.  Yeah, we're going to use two phones

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  because you're never going to be done one phone.  So you got two phones. What are they?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I think definitely right now the iPhone four and the Nexus one.  You know, the only thing that really is keeping me on the Nexus one is  I'm hoping that the Samsung or the Droid X will go to two point two  because that's I Froyo is great.  Really, really think it's important.  And, you know, I can't wait to get App Inventor and play with it.  But I think I'll still work on doing it the old fashioned way with the clips  and stuff. I think you're right.  It's open. And that's just a whole lot to be said for that.  And I think the fact that there's almost 100000 applications says a lot.  That really that tells you the developers are embracing it.  And that's what you really need for that ecosystem.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm thinking that I'll I'll I'll go with two phones.  I'll keep I'll get an iPhone for once they fix this thing.  Tell me if I should or not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, what's your reception like with your old iPhone?  Was it good?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's better than T-Mobile, but not great.  So that's why I'm thinking the Android phone I get, I'm going to get on Verizon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, why not?  And then you'll have an iPhone.  So when you travel, you can use the iPhone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Use it to tether to my fi. There you go.  Right. Does that make sense? Yep.  Will you convince my wife?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Honey.  It's part of his tax deductible, Jeff.  You do it. You do a show about Google for crying out loud.  You got to.  Jeff Jarvis is at Buzz Machine Dotcom.  And if everybody runs out right now and buys his book, what would Google do?  He'll be able. Yeah, there it is.  He'll be able to buy a phone.  That's all. If you really cared, you'd buy this book.  Yes, it's always great to talk to you.  Gina Tripani is at  Smart Smart Smart or where?  I don't know. I know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  My brain just underwear.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, Jeff, my new man packs came.  Thank you very much.  And I.  Speaking of underwear, Jeff, I think called me.  They said, Leo, we just want to thank you for buying man packs.  I said, but I well, they don't.  They're too small to buy an ad, Jeff. Come on.  So we'll give him a free ad underwear by mail.  I might my son and I both get every three months.  We get a man pack in the mail.  And you know what, Jeff, I'm not talking to my daughter.  And I look at the back of her phone and she's got a sticker.  That's men's underwear.  I said, did you get that out of my man pack?  And she said, yes.  She said, it's just so random.  I said, yeah, they sent me stickers of BVDs.  So there's another good reason.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Stylish to stickers to stickers to you.
