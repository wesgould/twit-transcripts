Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're wearing a lovely scarf and configured in a stylish fashion.  You're just really upstaging us in many ways. It looks good. No, no, it looks great.  There we go.  Thank you Miss Marple.  Also with us... only Jeff got that one.  Also with us...  I'm an old detective.  Oh yeah, I did get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to read Ellery Queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah. I think it was Agatha Christie but close.  Anthony Pruitt is here from Hands On Photography. He's got his granny glasses on too.  Can't see today.  Nice.  Don't know why.  Did you get your pupils dilated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Just some days I wake up and I'm like, I can't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know what it is. It's allergies. It's peak allergies.  Oh, it is spring again.  Spring is here.  As somebody said on Reddit, enjoy the Green Hills. They'll be deathly brown in about eight weeks.  Yeah.  Looking like they're just dying.  Also with us...  The Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, the ever-tuneful Jeff Jarvis.  Hello Jeff.  Hello, hello, hello. How are you?  Hello, hello, hello. I bring sad tidings.  Yeah.  Today at one o'clock just an hour ago we learned of the passing of the man who created the JIF.  And you know what? I'm going to call it the JIF in his honor.  Here is a tribute. Steve Wilhite won a lifetime achievement award from the Webbys a couple of years ago.  Here is David Karp of Tumblr to present that award with a look back at some famous JIFs.  There's a peanut butter jelly time. The dancing baby from Ally McBeal. See if you can identify all of them.  Everybody's website had the under construction JIF. Netscape, American Flag, Tomatoes.  I don't know what that is. Crying Guy, Baby with an Ice Cream Cone, the mascot that falls on his face, Orson Welles applauding, and Citizen Kane, the Deal With It dog.  David Robinson.  I don't know what to call that.  As David Robinson.  Getting stood up.  These are so many famous animated JIFs. The JIF is not inherently animated. It can be a still image. It was often used on the web as a still image.  I'll never forget seeing my first animated JIF, Netscape Navigator. When it first came out it had that rotating compass. There he is.  Steven Wilhite. He's going to give a little bit of his speech because he says something pretty important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This year's Webby for lifetime achievement. Steve Wilhite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My god, he's so young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What year was this?  I think it's two years to go, believe it or not. I don't think it's two-one.  No way.  No, you think it's...  Wilhite passed away earlier today of COVID, complications from COVID at the age of 74.  Oh no.  I know.  People wear your damn masks around people.  Yeah, get your boosters.  Oh, so we did this.  And I have one of those spring awards as well.  Wibbies.  Standing O from a crowd who never knew a world without a JIF.  Right.  He's got five words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Instead of speaking as five words tonight, Steve is using his own invention to accept his award.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pronounced JIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Not GIF.  Yes. You tell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For those who don't know, that was the tradition.  It still is, I guess, at the Webby Awards. You get five...  It's a short acceptance speech. You get five words.  That's awesome.  It's pronounced JIF, not GIF.  That's very funny.  Awesome.  Very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway...  For the day, I too will say JIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you a hard G kind of guy?  Oh, god, yes.  Yeah.  I am too, and I don't know why, but he did, in fact, very famously. Well, you saw yourself.  It's a graphical thing.  Yeah, it's a graphic interchange format.  But you know what? This is his day.  It's his day.  It's his day.  What else did he do?  Not much. That was enough.  Actually, that was 2013.  Yeah, I was going to say...  Yeah, right. More than we did. That was 2013. That was nine years ago.  Oh, okay. That makes a lot more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it was created for CompuServe. He worked at CompuServe.  And actually, the interesting story here is he did it in his spare time  and didn't bring it into CompuServe until he had gotten it just so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now you can easily create them on your weak little smartphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although, as I said, the GIFs originally were not necessarily animated.  It was just a compressed format, a graphics interchange format.  But it was very important to the development of the web and CompuServe  and all the online services because they were very small, very compressed.  And so you could get a very tiny little thing, little thying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To speed up those load times.  Yeah. I wonder if I can find...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was in 1974.  Yeah, 74. Left his wife behind and she asked everybody to say GIF in his honor.  That's what's up.  Yeah. Yeah.  As I remember, it was not an unencumbered format. I think Sperry, Sperry Univac,  remember that, Jeff, owned the compression algorithm.  Yes, I think so.  It was an issue because they had the patent.  And so for Unisys rather, well, it was Sperry Univac before it was Unisys.  So when Wilhite released it in 1987, it was used legitimately, sort of,  but there was a controversy over the licensing agreement between Unisys and CompuServe.  And that's why Ping arose in 1994, seven years later.  Ping was a replacement for GIF, in fact, a much improved replacement for GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm reading right now, bamboozled at the revolution.  Oh, I want to read that.  John Bonavale, he's 10 years old.  But it's about media companies utterly screwing up the internet, not knowing what to do.  And the stories, some stories that I'm not in it, but I was involved in some of these stories,  like when Time Inc and Cunninghast wanted to buy AltaVista.  Pathfinder, all these things.  But it was the time of CompuServe and Prodigy and AOL,  and everybody guessing which one of those was going to win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we didn't know, did we? Google didn't exist yet.  The first GIF I saw was, as I mentioned, and I was blown away.  I remember vividly seeing it, and I think in 1994, with Netscape Navigator browser,  the web was static, static still, and this compass, the points on the compass were moving,  and I was, I can remember my jaw dropping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was so stupid.  I remember they did that at one of the Cunninghast sites we started, and our pages were too slow.  And I said, well, that's that animated thing is constantly using bandwidth.  And they said, no, Jeff.  No, it's not like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  Well, but you weren't wrong.  In order to do it, they had to download all the frames.  So GIFs could be, I'm sorry, GIFs could be quite big because you had to download the whole thing.  And then it animated it by going through, cycling through the frames.  Anyway, that's how we begin the show.  Farewell to Mr. Will Hite.  Thank you for your contributions.  Thank you. Yeah.  I think you still see GIFs everywhere.  Oh, gotcha.  The Unisys patent expired, and so it didn't have to be Pings.  Pings support animations, but these are all animated GIFs on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What would Discord be without them?  I know.  Or Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or social media.  Yeah, or Twitter.  And oh my God, there's my head being shaved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I send them to my family via my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The family communication is usually in GIFs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a question.  Are the Google animated thumbs and all those... are those GIFs too, I wonder?  No.  They're emojis, they're GIFs, they're stickers, and those animated things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are those called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm just asking what the background technology is, if it's GIF.  I don't know.  It's really hard to say GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is.  I'm impressed you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad to hear you say it, because I've never said it the other way.  But then they can, every time I'm around smart folks like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, there's no right.  If we're going to say there's a right way to say it, we're going to give Steve Will  Hyde the pride of telling us how you say it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's dead.  It doesn't matter to him anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It mattered to him when he was alive.  She is harsh.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's when you should have said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He did.  Over and over.  And did we ignore him?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's when you should have said it.  Not now when it doesn't...  Yeah.  Sorry.  I'm not cold.  It's just realistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Boy, the Lapsus gang has been very busy.  The Lapsus extortion group.  They hacked Microsoft, leaked out 36 gigabytes of source code for Windows, for Cortana, and  for Bing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who wants it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Run their own Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now they've breached something called Okta.  Anybody who's done enterprise security or IT knows Okta very well.  It's used as a second form of authentication.  Putatively, I'll use that word because I don't know why because I'm going to show off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you need 50 cents or a dollar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I need 50 cents?  Putatively, it is more secure than a text message.  Maybe not today.  Maybe not today.  The Lapsus digital extortion gang has been very busy.  And they published this on their Telegram channel.  Okta says, okay, we're not saying they didn't do something, but it was on January 21st and  it was one account and we've constrained the damage.  And so we probably, you don't have to worry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I ask my dumb question of the day?  Yeah.  What does releasing the source code of Bing actually do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing.  So, I mean, obviously it's a proprietary, right?  It's a company secret.  I mean, it's not like if you got the recipe for Coca-Cola, you could make Coca-Cola.  It's not like if you got the recipe for Bing, you could make Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is more of a bragging right?  Look, I got you.  It's interesting to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, I am on Twitter.  I'm going to be honest, but a Bloomberg reporter, William Turton, is saying that he's got a  story coming up that he's saying that a 16-year-old living in his mother's house in Oxford, England  is suspected to be the mastermind behind many of the hacks conducted by the hacking group  Lapsus.  A 16-year-old living in his mom's basement.  Okay, probably just in his mom's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to put him in the basement.  No, no, no, no.  He's sleeping on a cot in the basement.  I guarantee you.  Wow, he's 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is what this reporter is.  Oh, I believe it.  He hasn't filed his story yet.  I totally believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What else did they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What else did this group do?  Oh, Lapsus has been around.  So that's interesting because that says it's not, by the way, Russians.  State actors.  State or state actors.  Turns out any old buddy could do that.  I first heard their name a couple of weeks ago on Security Now and I'm trying to remember  what it was.  They are asking for money.  That's why their name Lapsus ends in a dollar sign, which sounds like, to be honest, something  a 16-year-old living in his mom's house might do.  Oh, by the way, this is clever.  It's two S's, one's a dollar sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not going to be like Cash Shop.  We're going to put it at the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of their first victims was the Brazilian Ministry of Health.  50 terabytes worth of data stolen and deleted.  Among that, COVID-19 pandemic information took them a month before they could get their  systems up and running again.  That's a nice little hack.  Isn't that sweet?  Nvidia failed victim to a cybersecurity incident attributed to Lapsus last month.  That's the one where they stole a terabyte of data, including employee passwords from  Nvidia.  Samsung confirmed the data had been breached in attack, including source code relating  to the Galaxy smartphones.  You know, this is sounding more and more like a 16-year-old who would want the source code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why can't we go after these folks and hire them and give them jobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I bet he gets a job in about four years after he gets out of juvie.  Lapsus also claims to have compromised video game developer Ubisoft.  And the company said, yeah, well, we did have to reset passwords across the organization.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, this is from a ZDNet article today.  Obviously, they don't have the sources our Bloomberg reporter has.  Not much is known about Lapsus itself other than it's a cyber criminal gang.  I'm going to put that quotes.  Believed to operate out of South America that hacks into networks of large organizations  to steal data and extort payments.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Or Daily City.  They publish the information on a telegram channel.  They seem to have a variety of techniques, including phishing emails and exploiting  public facing remote desktop protocol installations.  So who's the guy?  It's on Bloomberg.  I want to see this article.  His name is William Turton.  So at William Turton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  T-U-R-T-O-N.  He is a Bloomberg reporter.  That's hysterical.  16 year old living in his mother's house.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll look forward to seeing the full story.  That's quite a scoop.  I'm going to go ahead and put it in the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to put it in the article.  I'm going to put it in the article.  I'm going to put it in the article.  I'm going to put it in the article.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm going to put it in the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to put it in the article.  Yeah, I'll look forward to seeing the full story.  That's quite a scoop, Mr. Turton.  Yeah, I was like, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, it's Bloomberg and didn't they publish some of that other crazy stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see.  You know, I still think Bloomberg's good.  I was like, who is this dude?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bloomberg.  Yeah, see, despite the super micro reporting, which they've never.  Never changed or retracted.  Never retracted.  Never proved but never disproved.  I don't think it didn't tarnish them as much as it should have, although you're not alone,  Stacey.  Everybody, when they hear Bloomberg now, a story like this says, oh, yeah, super micro  guys.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm on Bloomberg because I pay the money for Bloomberg and I do not see the story  yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we'll see.  Okay.  Wow.  What a story.  Thank you for finding that.  See, I'm glad you were on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The reason I was on Twitter was I was pushing my talk tomorrow or my, what's that called?  Help me.  Book club.  Book club.  I was pushing the book club.  I saw that Ant had pushed out something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you find the John Roach obituary?  Is that what you posted?  Yes, I just put that in there.  So this just in from Twitter.  I have never heard of this guy, but he was a pioneer of the personal computer, John Roach,  dead at 83.  Help make the home computer ubiquitous, says the New York Times obit by introducing the  fully assembled Tandy TRS 80, which was so novel.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How many cousins you have out here, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your DNA is everywhere.  Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the next avatar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't believe all three of you said that at the same time.  It must be true.  That was in 1986 when he was chairman and chief executive of the Tandy Corp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you can scroll down and see what you're going to look like in a few years then.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, that's a good question.  Yeah, I think that's right.  I think I look like that now.  That's actually 2009.  That's 13 years ago.  So, you know, when he's the chairman of the company, I'm not sure I give you full credit  for inventing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually putting it together, nuts and bolts, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The TRS 80 was beloved by some called the Trash 80 by others.  $600 through a radio shack.  It was the first computer for a lot of people listening right now.  Very, very, very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never had one, but my cousin did.  Yeah, it's like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish I'd had one.  I went over to my cousin's house to play with it.  Is that kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he didn't know what the heck he was doing with it.  It was a brick for the most part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did not have one either.  All right.  So enough people passing away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They come in threes.  Who knows who's going next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From your vast experience at Entertainment Weekly, is that true, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just seems so because you then go back and think of the two prior deaths and say,  oh, they come in threes.  Well, actually, that is the third thing.  That is the third death.  Hold on one second.  Jeff, don't die.  You don't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's looking around for the Reaper.  We don't need to.  We don't need to make you the third.  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Speaking of which, this is the last print edition.  Oh, that just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this just came out.  Speaking of death.  But Barry Diller...  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's the third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Barry Diller killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  With its cover billing.  Is that JD Lang on the cover?  The future of Hollywood.  That was JD Lang.  That was rather controversial for me, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  So the Kenobi one is the last one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, so the one in your right hand is the first one?  That's the first one.  Oh, OK.  I was wondering why they were doing a cover story  and Katie Lang is their very last episode.  OK.  There you go.  Star Wars related.  It's Obi-Wan Kenobi.  And the future of Hollywood.  You and McGregor as Obi-Wan.  Not the only one true, only one Alec Guinness.  Obi-Wan.  Yeah.  Goodbye, Entertainment Weekly.  Bye bye, baby.  Bye bye, my baby.  Hey, you might be interested.  Ron Richards, the host of All About Android, tweeted,  Got my last issue of Entertainment Weekly today in the mail  as someone who subscribed in year one.  Back in 1991.  I have a lot of emotions.  Seems fitting the last cover would be Star Wars related.  Goodbye, Entertainment Weekly.  I'll miss you most of all.  So, Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here was issue number two.  Do you have them all?  Tim O'Brien's The Things They Carried.  Oh, that was an amazing book.  I was told this was a, it was an amazing book,  but it was not exactly something,  they didn't tell me they were selling this on the newsstand.  I thought it was a subscription only magazine.  As the circulation director said,  it was the only magazine camouflaged on the newsstand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, also since it was 1991, we were out of Vietnam.  So I'm not sure I really understand the headline.  Why can't we get out of Vietnam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, because we can't get out of our heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, call me ignorant, which I'm sure a lot of you do.  Is this available on newsstands?  It was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Last issue, yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, we can run out and get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Collectors item.  I think I'd like to get one.  I used to get, seems like I remember having my hands on an EW,  and I don't remember ever subscribing,  but I remember having my hands on one  and throwing a couple away here and there.  But yeah, I would like to have that one.  I have Star Wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have her third death.  Madeleine Albright just died.  Yes, by the way.  Are you serious?  She's like fit in our world.  She was the first female secretary of state.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Eighty-four.  So I guess we have three, so stop it.  There it is.  Knock it off.  No more.  No more.  If you're worried about cyber attacks, you're not alone.  The president spoke earlier this week saying,  get ready, they're coming.  This article in The Yorker by Sue Halpern,  the threat of Russian cyber attacks looms large.  We had a warning last week from the intelligence community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an extension of the Shields Up program that was launched  when Russia invaded Ukraine back in February.  This is specifically targeting Satcom.  And I don't know if y'all remember me talking about Space Force being legit.  Yes.  This is actually talking about Ukraine had attacked via satellite sooner.  Sorry, Russia had attacked via satellite soon after they invaded.  And this is an extension of that.  So basically, CESA and FBI put out a warning this week and said,  we already told all the infrastructure people to get ready  and make sure that you've got your plans in place.  Now we're doing a specific one for the Satcom industry.  And they are hearing credible, like beforehand,  there weren't really any credible threats.  It was just like, get ready, y'all.  We assumed that they would do it.  I just had to put my two cents in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the questions everybody's been asking is,  why haven't they yet really done an all-out attack?  And in this article, the author kind of says,  well, once you can start dropping bombs, a cyber attack isn't,  you're just going to drop more bombs.  They took out, when they took out Viasat right before the invasion,  that was to take out Ukraine internet.  But Viasat is used by the military in the United States,  as well as the Ukrainian army and a number of Western militaries.  The US military says the attack did not affect us.  They use Viasat for some battle management system.  So you can see why you would want to take that out before you invaded.  The real question is though, you know,  Russia's been using Ukraine as a testing ground for years,  more than a decade, why they haven't unleashed the hounds of hacking on Ukraine or on us.  Biden said, I have previously warned about the potential  that Russia could conduct malicious cyber activity against the US,  including as a response to the unprecedented economic costs  we've imposed on Russia alongside our allies and partners.  It's part of Russia's playbook today.  My administration is reiterating those warnings based on evolving intelligence  that the Russian government is exploring options for potential cyber attacks.  So, yeah, CISA has been saying put your shields up.  In fact, I saw a tweet that's actually was a good tweet this morning saying,  okay, you want to help, you know, the fight against Ukraine, update your routers, you know, secure your systems.  Because a lot of times that's exactly what happens is normal people like you and me,  our routers are vulnerable.  Steve did a whole thing yesterday on security now about micro TIC routers,  which have updated firmware, but nobody has up to lots of people have not updated them.  And they're used in then massive DDoS attacks.  They're co-opted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did he have a utility up to check?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He did not write a utility.  But his strong suggestion was to anybody, not just somebody using a micro TIC router,  but anybody using a router should check to make sure they have the latest firmware.  Because if there is a flaw in the router, you could very well be part of an attack on Ukraine on Ukraine or on the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, according to my YouTube history, about three weeks ago, we talked about on Twitter,  a potential cyber attack from the US on the offensive towards Russia.  Right.  You think we're capable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's so it's interesting.  There's there's speculation in Halpern's article about why it hasn't happened.  She quotes a fellow at Hoover Institution who says if you're already at a stage in a conflict where you're willing to drop bombs,  you're going to drop bombs.  But she says it also may be Russia never had the capability.  Its adversaries ascribed to it in the first place.  I'm not sure that's true.  Or it may be that the Russian generals prosecuting the war are skeptical of relying on weapons composed of zeros or ones.  I could believe that.  Or that the Russians and I think this is the most likely and I think this is what we talked about three weeks ago,  tried to replicate their earlier attacks.  But Ukraine's digital defenses, which are much stronger now, successfully fended them off.  And I think, Stacey, you were also saying that that the attention, the million, the US has pumped,  I think, 18 million dollars so far with a pledge for 30 more into Ukraine cyber defense.  And we've done much of the same thing with CISA here in the United States.  I wouldn't be surprised if we just I think we were talking about this.  We just are maybe a little more hardened than we thought.  I still wouldn't be complacent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I also I think we have been investing in that.  There's good news there.  But I also I made this point a couple of weeks ago is once Russia does that,  especially if they do this here in the US and it causes a loss of life,  we're going to treat that like we would a physical attack.  And we will physically enter.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that may be another reason that although I mean, yeah, at this point, it's still going.  Yeah. Yeah.  I wouldn't I wouldn't count on it.  All right. Let's take a little break. We have more uplifting news.  This has been a grim downer of opening segments.  So we're going to cheer you up with something funny.  Moral panic. Funny tick tock.  Anything you got just, you know, get it ready. More death and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look, I'm tick tock now. Tell me.  Tell me what? No. He asked for it.  What? I showed it. I showed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They brought you by Codecademy.  Are you ready to change your career?  There's never been a better time to be a programmer.  They are in high demand right now and as a result are highly paid.  Great benefits. Great jobs out there.  And with Codecademy, you can learn to code on your own terms.  Over 50 million people already have.  They already know Codecademy is the best way to learn to code.  That's because Codecademy not only teaches you job ready coding skills,  but also helps you build unique projects for your portfolio.  That's really important.  Companies look at that and say, what have you done?  And it's nice. And one of the things about coding that's so great is you can do stuff for yourself  that still show off your skills and still get credit for it.  You also can earn certificates at Codecademy. That's often very important.  And they even help you prep for technical interviews.  That's the thing that always scares me when I think about getting a job as a coder.  The interview process. But you'll be ready. You'll be prepared.  I used Codecademy myself because I like learning and it's a really great way to learn.  I've played with their Python classes.  What's nice is when you start using Codecademy, you start programming right away.  When you, your very first lesson, you'll enter code, you'll run it, you'll find out what's wrong,  you'll fix it and it runs. And I don't know if you ever had this experience,  but everybody who codes had that experience.  That first time when they wrote a program for me, it was 10 print hello.  Actually, it was more like 10 print Leo's the cool guy.  And then 20 go to 10 in that infinite loop.  And when it happens and the computer does what you said it should do, that's a magic moment.  You can have that magic moment right now.  You'll learn at your own pace. You'll get qualified for in-demand jobs.  You can choose what to learn from building basic websites to artificial intelligence and everything you could want.  No matter what your experience level, you'll be writing real working code in minutes.  It's a great feeling. It really is.  To sit down, type out some code and say, I got the computer to do something.  Lots of languages, Python, HTML, CSS, SQL, JavaScript.  If you're not sure where to begin, and I love this, Lisa and I both did this.  We took Codecademy's programming personality quiz.  It's not a test of your programming skills.  It asks you about how you learn what you like.  It's kind of like career counseling.  And it's great. It's tailored career advice and course recommendations based on your strengths and your interests.  Lisa, for instance, it was right on.  They said you should do R, you should do statistics because you've got a mind ahead for numbers.  And they looked at me and they said, you should be a shepherd.  Because you have no they looked at me.  I took the test and they said I would be good.  I should study computer science, which I'm a great.  I agree. That's what I'm most interested in.  I'm not sure what it will tell you, but take at least do this.  Go to Codecademy.com and take the personality quiz.  It's an interactive program. You'll learn by doing.  You can build your portfolio. You'll get the certificate of completion.  You put that in your LinkedIn, then land your dream job, whether it's in web development, programming, computer science, data science, or tons more.  I think Codecademy is the best way to learn.  Join over 50 million people who agree.  Learn to code with Codecademy and see where coding can take you.  I will say this. Absolutely. It is so much fun.  It's so gratifying. Get 15 percent off your Codecademy Pro membership.  Just go to Codecademy.com.  Promo code twig. Please use that because then they'll know you saw it here.

Thank you, Codecademy, for your support of this week in Google.  Woohoo.  Woohoo.  I guess we should talk about this UK law.  The online safety bill.  Wrong in so many ways, including jail time potentially for tech executives.  Executives from Meta, TikTok, and other tech companies would face the prospect of jail time.  This is from Mark DiStefano and Sylvia Varnam-O'Regan writing in the information.  Under sweeping new legislation proposed by the UK government,  the aim of the bill is to curb illegal and harmful internet content.  It's called the online safety bill.  It's going to be introduced for a vote tomorrow.  Tech executives will be potentially facing criminal prosecution  if they fail to comply with decisions made by the regulator in charge of enforcing the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The worst part of it is that they're told to take down legal but harmful content  without the government defining what is harmful.  So if you don't figure out what's harmful and take it down, your rump is in trouble.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't have, obviously, the First Amendment,  because that would be unconstitutional in the United States.  For the government to tell anybody what they can or cannot say is against the First Amendment.  The provision to include liability for senior management and not just companies  has been called the Nick Clegg law in Downing Street.  That's why. Let's get Nick.  Nick did not leave a trail of friends behind when he left the government in the UK.  He is, of course, now a senior vice, I think he's a president of global operations at Facebook.  And apparently he could be found criminally liable.  Now, you'll have to destroy evidence, give false information to the regulator,  or obstruct officials from entering company offices.  So I doubt Nick will be doing any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He'll have someone else do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The UK government hopes to, of course, got Boris Johnson's support,  hopes to pass the law by the end of the year or early next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It became a hot mess. They just threw in the kitchen sink.  This includes the need for anybody showing pornography to get age verification.  Can we talk about privacy violations and problems and data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to go.  And let me tell you, the places they're talking about to get age verification include pubs.  You go down, you're 16 years old, you go down to your pub to show them your ID.  Can I have a beer, a pint and some porn?  Not a good idea.  The Safe Harbor principle, which is essentially their Section 230, also would be rolled back.  While some of the tougher parts of the legislation, the information rights, appear controversial in tech circles,  yes, the Boris Johnson-led government is confident the public largely supports the bill.  Think of the children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's well, it's the same as the hearing going on in Washington right now.  Hide your authoritarianism behind child porn. You can do anything.  Moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Well, you know, what are you going to do?  They've got the Snoopers Charter. There's all sorts of stuff going on in the UK.  I would hope we would be smart enough not to do here. Let's hope.  I would hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They also added in cyber flashing.  Wait, what's cyber flashing?  That is, you know, sending a picture of you know what to a young person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's cyber flashing. That's a new way of putting it.  I didn't know it was taking over the world. Apparently it is.  We've got to do something. Think of the children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they also buy the favorite media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like actually not to get unsolicited pics.  Yeah, I agree.  That's okay. I'm for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would you, if somebody were to do that, and not anybody I know, would you want them to be thrown in jail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like the opportunity to press charges and have them.  Yeah, actually.  Yeah.  Maybe you could be a sex offender.  Because you know what? Keep your penis to yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Keep it to yourself, buddy. No one wants to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a show title for you.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Money laundering and human trafficking are also included. Also equally awful.  Removing legal but harmful content is the most controversial, as you said, Jeff.  Yes.  It's nasty, but it's not illegal.  But if the government tells you to take it down, it becomes de facto illegal.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And it's not just child porn.  I mean, there are things like there are no laws right now, well, in some places against upskirt photos.  But you know, a lot of people would like to not see those.  Yeah, that should be illegal. I agree. I agree.  Yeah.  That should be illegal.  You know, you're like, do you go in and make legal rulings for every creepy things?  Like, oh, this guy installed a bathroom camera and stuck those in there.  Is that its own brand of like?  That's a fair argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's already illegal in the real world.  Right. I mean, flashing is already illegal.  But it's not. That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but sending a photo of your penis is not.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excuse me. An unsolicited photo.  I don't know. Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's not illegal.  Unsolicited?  Oh, well, that's good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not an unsolicited though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you might like if you're doing it at a company, you might get like HR might fire.  Oh, yeah, you get a lot of trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get in trouble, but it's not against the law.  Well, I don't know.  But it's not against the law.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should get to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, if you send a picture of your penis to a minor.  Minor? That's a different story.  Well, that is definitely against the law.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, but what if you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, New York State bill. There's a bill in the New York State Senate.  I just searched this.  A person is guilty of unsolicited disclosure, disclosure of an intimate image when with  the intent to harass, annoy or alarm another person that's added in, which serves no legitimate  purpose. What legitimate purpose could it be?  He or she sends by electronic device and unsolicited image to another person, such person.  So there's these things are.  But it's not illegal.  It's interesting.  In California.  There's a flash act in California.  So there's a lot of stuff coming along the pike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe it'd be better to have specific specific laws against specific things.  Or you think there's just such a wide range that you can't.  There's such a wide range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, so I'm saying this as someone who has watched men harassing women on digital  platforms play out in a lot of different ways.  Totally agree.  It's not just men.  Totally agree.  There are not in a lot of cases laws to police departments aren't interested in prosecuting  this or able to understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to threaten death or put somebody in fear for their life for them to go after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is distressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's very black and white.  It's horrible.  Yeah.  But you understand the concern is that it might also be a satiric comic about Boris  Johnson's hair or likening President Xi to Winnie the Pooh.  And that's the problem.  You have to be specific enough to get the bad stuff.  The law has to be specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's unconstitutional to be so unspecific that you don't know what the law is.  That's the issue.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this does not cover all those bases.  And we've historically been very bad at labeling.  I mean, even we'll know when we see it.  And part of it is, I'm going to just be honest, it's because men tend to write our laws and  enforce them.  And a lot of them pooh the harms of some of this.  So I'm just going to throw that out there.  Hey, speaking of bad laws, are y'all playing the tech dirts Mark Chavendis most misunderstood  legal concept?  It is pretty funny.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is their brackets, their version of the brackets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the legal misunderstanding Mark Chavendis.  Oh, you did?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's on the rundown.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So should we play it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you just have to fill out your spreadsheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you do it yourself.  I get it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not like super fancy.  I think Mike was just like, we'll give it a whirl.  But they're good.  Section 230 is on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the bracket.  Oh, this is nice.  It's a Google Sheet.  2022 legal misunderstanding March Madness, First Amendment rules of evidence.  Which one?  So what you're predicting is?  The most misunderstood.  More misunderstood.  And how are they going to determine that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to see.  The number of people who are going to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, because they're compiling.  They are compiling this and I saw the numbers.  So section 230 versus something else was like 87%.  I think it was HIPAA, wasn't it?  Versus 13%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's based on a poll or something.  Here's HIPAA.  This is the poll.  So the first, no, this is not a poll.  This is your vote for which is misunderstood.  This is your prediction.  That's misunderstood, yes.  So you're misunderstanding the point of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what you think is the most misunderstood.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My question is, how are they going to know who wins?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's read Mike.  Maybe he tells us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, you save it and then you take a screenshot and you share it to him.  So it's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I understand that, but somebody has to say who won.  Who's tabulating said votes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Mike is tabulating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But these aren't votes.  These are predictions.  Every day.  I've got it.  I'm sorry.  I had to read the article.  I'm the one who never heard of this.  You guys are the ones who talk.  Each day that this is running, Tech Dirt says we will be posting Twitter polls of the competing  legal concepts to see which one is misunderstood the most.  The winner will advance to the next round, eventually crowning the most misunderstood  legal concept of 2022.  What do you think?  I mean, there's quite a few of them.  Fifth Amendment Sherman Act, Fair Use, Substruction of Justice, ADA, Insider Training.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First Amendment is pretty common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is more misunderstood, the Hatch Act or the Unruh Act?  I don't know.  Which is more misunderstood?  The 25th Amendment or hearsay?  This is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I sense Kathy Ellis involved in this.  Who's going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the 25th Amendment?  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the right against unreasonable.  No, no, wait a minute.  That's not.  No idea.  The 25th Amendment is the right to vote for women?  What is it?  Look it up quick.  I'm looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It lays out the transition of power for president.  Oh, that's the crazy president one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I knew I'd heard that recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, what was it?  Crazy president versus what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hearsay versus crazy president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, hearsay.  Nobody understands hearsay.  Hearsay is the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All I know is when you're watching Law and Order and the attorney jumps up and says,  that's hearsay, your honor, because it's not my eyewitness thing.  I'm reporting somebody else's eyewitness thing.  I think that's pretty well understood.  Someone else heard something.  It's understood because of TV.  The 25th Amendment is pretty well understood because of, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because of the last presidential era we were in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Never mind.  I bet you if you asked that question four years ago, it would not be as well understood.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, if you grew up in the Reagan era, because didn't they listen to their debate

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  either then?  You know what?  We've been talking about the 25th Amendment since it was created.  It just depends which party you're on, which side you're on.  How about this?  It's treason versus OSHA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, OSHA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OSHA.  OSHA would be OSHA.  Gotta be the most confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think treason would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The National Self-Safety and Health Administration.  I figure treason would be more confused.  We know what treason is.  Although people often say things are treasonous when they're not.  It is not, right.  Net neutrality or the CFAA?  I'd have to look that up.  Net neutrality.  Copyright or Citizens United, ERISA or Joint and several?  Fire in a theater or NDA?  We can go and vote as a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not filling out these brackets.  There's a lot of them.  No, go to line 55.  We can just vote on Twitter.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the CFAA?  CFAA?  CFAA.  You gotta look it up.  CFAA.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm looking it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  We should know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should know that one.  That's the one, of course, that Aaron Schwartz was prosecuted under.  Yeah.  Okay.  This is actually, you know, this is Mike's secret way of getting everybody to look these  things up.  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's genius.  He's doing a great job.  I feel like I'm helping out a good cause here by looking up things.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So First Amendment or Rules of Evidence?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the first one.  Jeff, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  We're not filling out the brackets.  There's 32 of these.  We are not doing the brackets.  All right.  And that's just for the first round.  Then there's the Sweet 16.  Then there's the Elite Eight, the Final Few and the Championship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the Final Four, isn't it?  Final Four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like.  I told you I don't know sport ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm definitely not a sports ball guy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll come back for the Final Four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Too busy making computers and waging Russian war.  I'm casting my votes here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good.  You cast your votes.  We went to take my daughter out to her 30th birthday, which was yesterday for dinner.  Cheers.  Henry and I are sitting side by side.  We're at the restaurant.  We're looking up.  There's a basketball game.  Henry says, oh, why aren't they showing the March Madness?  And I said, well, it's basketball.  He said, no, no, that's the NBA.  I said, oh, yeah, there's LeBron.  He said, no, that's the Nets.  What are you talking about?  Oh, boy.  So I proved that I know nothing.  You are Russian.  I am Russian.  I am that guy.  I am a deep cover.  What do they call that?  When you like in the Americans, when you're a mole and you're under deep cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You skipped the week on American sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I forgot that.  I should have gone.  Espionage.  Should have gone.  That's a fun one.  I like that.  I like that.  Let's see.  What else here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say it's not like we have a lot of Google News to discuss, so I figured  we could throw some fun stuff in here.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, through the rundown.  Unsolicited Dictics.  There's a John, we told you no unsolicited Dictics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For our listeners, perhaps for our listeners, you might want to explain.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A Dictic is a kind of aminal.  It's an ungulent.  Is it an ungulent?  I don't know.  There's a cute picture.  Does it have hooves?  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jammer be unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I'm looking up Dictic Ungulent.  So Dictics are named for the alarms, calls of the females.  In addition to the females alarm call, both the male and female make a shrill whistling  sound, class mammalia, order arteriodactyla, family bovidi, they're cows, bovines, subfamily  antelopinides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you yelled at me for trying to go through concepts of law and saying that was distracting.  Geez.  I'm going down tick dirt and you're going into Dictics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is the ultimate ungulent.  I'm just saying.  Oh, jeez.  Just telling you.  Here's another unsolicited picture of a Dictic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm listening to their call and it doesn't sound like Dictic.  It sounds like whistling.  Yeah.  Oh my gosh, but their little nose does this very cute thing.  It's like a little tiny elephant trunk or something.  Oh my gosh.  By the way, this is from ultimate ungulate.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kirk's Dictic is not in danger.  What the heck?  I'm just glad.  If your name is Kirk, congratulations.  All right, let's move back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you know there's an open internet alliance from the small internet companies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh God, who cares?  Thank you, Mr. Jarvis.  You know who else doesn't care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jonah Peretti.  No longer cares.  Did you see this article from the Defector?  Well, I couldn't read it all because it's beyond a paywall.  Oh, you're right.  It is.  I have this thing that says, take down these walls, Mr. Garbachev.  He laid off a year ago 70 employees, including 47 HuffPost staffers in the US, to drive long-term sustainability.  Today, he announced, this was yesterday, he once again is reducing the BuzzFeed workforce to, quote, accelerate profitability.  Hey, you know what?  When you're an owner, sometimes you have to do that.  Well, he's not the owner now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the stock market, and that's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He closed basically the entire news division, I think.  And so I tweeted about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's too bad.  They won the Pulitzer Prize.  They've done brilliant work.  BuzzFeed News has been great, but you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I even said this on the show.  It's tainted because it started with BuzzFeed, and you think BuzzFeed, Listicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they got past that and really got a reputation, but the problem was there was never a business model.  Yeah.  It was always subsidized by BuzzFeed and the Listicles.  And people said, oh, this is wonderful.  It's the future of news.  I said, well, I wish.  But never.  The BuzzFeed business model, hey, we can make our stuff viral, we can make your stuff viral, didn't come over to news.  You know, the same problem every news organization has.  Who wants to be next to news?  Nobody.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Peretti, who was the founder, had an all-hands meeting following the resignation announcements from BuzzFeed News editor-in-chief Mark Schufes  and the other two other top editors, Nakamoto and Kaminer.  He said he's making cuts, et cetera, et cetera.  And then right before the Q&A, he just leaves.  He logs out.  And people were pretty upset.  Julia Rheinstein tweeted, I've worked at this company for seven years and I've never felt so disrespected.  And seeing my CEO log out without answering a single question about why he wants to gut my newsroom.  But it is, I think the point of this is, is news sustainable is the real question.  Is it going to just be the New York Times, the Washington Post, and that's it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not sustainable at the infinite profit margins, apparently, shareholders expect.  I think news can be sustainable.  You don't think news can be sustainable?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that may be going a little too far.  I think that, yes, at the scale of the stock market, there's only three brands that bring in two thirds of the subscription models.  Advertising has changed markedly, the ad market as a whole is going down and they haven't reinvented themselves.  But at a different scale, no, I still believe that it is possible to have sustainable news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you'd let me finish, that is exactly what I was going to say.  Yay.  I thought you asked me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you.  I thought you asked me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.  I interrupted and then I'm sorry.  Shame on you.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was, it is profitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People are going to yell at me on Twitter, so I will get my just desserts for that.  I apologize.  I was wrong.  I thought she was not wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure it's my fault for not moderating this panel.  OK, OK.  Did you go to South by, Stacey, speaking of moderating panels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I was really excited to not go to South by because I no longer live in Austin, so I no longer have to go.  Oh, I get it.  Was it awful, Stacey, when you lived there?  What?  To have to deal with it?  It wasn't awful.  It's just I'd gone for like almost 20 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't hear anything notable coming out of South by, did you?  All I knew was a Twitter friend, Mr. Wesley Faulkner was going and outside of that.  He lives in, oh, he doesn't live in Austin.  He lives in Austin.  Oh, he moved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually met Wesley.  He's in the Midwest somewhere.  I know.  You introduced us in Austin.  Yeah.  I heard it was a bunch of work.  Amy Webb, our Amy Webb did her annual keynote there for her Future Today Institute.  OK.  There were people, forget Mark Zuckerberg, did a panel.  I thought he was virtual though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was virtual.  Yeah, but you know, there might have been some news out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of it was crypto stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, that's what it is.  Hey, I recognize the sound of that fantastic Samsung Galaxy Flip Z3.  Boy, that sounds mighty good.  You didn't even pick your own ringtone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not heavy either.  It's not heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not heavy.  It's a lovely phone.  So actually, you still liking it?  Is it OK?  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still like it.  Do you want it back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  I'm just teasing you.  Invoice coming.  You can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I'm just teasing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll pay you whatever it goes for on Swappa.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's yours.  It's a gift.  But I'm just glad you like it.  I was just curious if you liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, don't ask me about the Kobo because I haven't charged that yet.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Kobo was not a gift.  The Kobo was, I think technically it's called a dump run.  I was going to say an unsolicited e-reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was almost as bad as a, yeah, it was an unsolicited e-reader.  I drive by e-readed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was curious for y'all's take maybe because you might be well versed in corporate, not  malfeasance, but shady tactics.  The Justice Department talking about how Google employees, Google has basically told its employees  that if they're going to put anything weird in an email, they should loop in an attorney  to keep it.  They're in trouble for that.  Yeah.  Well, it's kind of, I'm like both, it's both like clever, but also super shady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure they thought it was clever, but apparently it's illegal.  So the Justice Department is in fact investigating.  They're accusing Google of, and this makes sense.  In fact, if you were kind of naive, you might say, good, this is our policy from now on.  The Justice Department said that Google teaches employees to before, when they're sending  a sensitive business communication, like we got to shut that Facebook down.  They should also CC the House counsel because they shield the documents from discovery.  It is suddenly protected under attorney-client privilege just by virtue of CCing them.  Oh, now the DOJ says they're using false requests for legal advice.  That is, they feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if you're actually asking for the advice that is legit, I used to have to do that  in advance all the time because it was kind of a shadow management of the company.  I had to think it's clear to the lawyers.  And before I sent something out, I had to check with the lawyers.  And that was, I think the government might lose on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, the government is asking the judge to sanction Google and compel disclosure of  more documents, documents that are hidden from them due to this attorney-client privilege.  But I think if I'm the judge, I'm going to say, well, you have to show intent with each  and every one of these.  And I don't think you can.  So the DOJ was saying, look, they had training sessions.  They trained people just CC the attorney.  It doesn't matter.  What they need is a smoking gun.  They need an email from Sundar Pichai saying, whatever you do, make sure you CC an attorney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was told every time I did something.  So Advance is a fascinating company because it's family owned, the new houses.  And they didn't have a corporate, I was the only corporate employee for a while there.  They didn't have corporate and because of the family and then they had the law firm  and the accountancy firm.  And if you did anything that had the slightest kind of controversy, not even legally, but  just business sense, the bosses, the owners would say, did you check with the lawyers?  That was a means of management and a means of checking and making sure that things were  going to be passable.  And so I got it.  Most everything I did went through the lawyers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's clear that probably Google was using this, but it's also very difficult to  show because it's a reasonable business practice.  The DOJ lawyers cited an email from Sundar Pichai to Susan Wojcicki, the CEO of YouTube.  He was telling her how to respond to a press inquiry, but he put up at the top attorney  client privileged and copied chief legal officer Kent Walker on it.  So, but you have to then, right.  You have to, the DOJ would have to prove that Sundar Pichai was doing this intentionally  to hide it as opposed to legitimately saying, I want to make sure the counsel is looking.  Was it from Sundar to whom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wojcicki.  And Wojcicki.  So it was internal.  Susan.  If you do that at an external and said, oh, we're going to get around and I trust here  because of my email to Zuck, I'm going to CC.  That'd be a no-no.  Right.  Checking things out.  That seems normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google spokesperson said, just like other American companies, we educate our employees  about legal privilege and when to seek legal advice.  And she pointed out, we've produced over 4 million documents to the DOJ in this case  alone, including many that employees had considered potentially privileged.  I think the government's going to lose on this one.  It's worth a try.  What they wanted to use as a litmus test is if it's an email chain where attorneys were  copied but never responded to or...  Well, they could have phoned.  Yeah.  You know, this is going to be a hard one to prove.  We'll see.  The judge may say, no, you're right.  But we'll see.  I have a feeling it's a hard thing to prove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If this were any other company, would this even have come up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, in any other antitrust suit, maybe.  Yes.  I think the DOJ probably looks for this all the time.  I just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I swear this just looks like some targeting that Google to me.  It depends.  But that just seems a little too odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you could also say X percent, like 80% of the things that we have encountered are  protected by attorney-client privilege.  But in Microsoft, our prior case, only 60% were.  This looks really suspicious.  Or actually, let me make it more egregious.  Only 20% were.  So this seems unusually high.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not in the Department of Justice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, except, Spacey, what if this case is just more clearly legally sensitive?  And so you do want more lawyer advice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you're saying of all the discovery things that they're pulling for, a greater  percentage of general discovery is protected compared to another company in that position  that might set off alarm bells.  I don't know if it's default practice or not.  I'm all speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Depends on the company.  Depends on the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But this is also why lawyers often rise to senior VP and CBOs.  That's right.  Because they really know the company.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although, my wife often says that she doesn't want to consult attorneys because they're  not business people, that they understand the law, but they're so exposure adverse.  Their advice is always to protect themselves as much as to protect you, to not do things  just because it's risky.  And she says, you know, they don't temper their legal judgment with business judgment.  So she'll often...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've had good lawyers in companies that, in Time Inc. especially, where they said,  my job is to help you do what you want to do.  Right.  Let's figure out a way to do it.  I'm going to help you find the way you can do that or tell you you can't.  And here's what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But the same can be said for HR too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, HR is there to protect the company.  I could tell you that right now.  They're not there to protect you.  Always and forever.  They are.  They are not there to protect you.  That's a very common mistake employees make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the thing.  Employees are usually told HR is going to protect you.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're just like a lawyer.  They're keeping us, they're preventing us from exposing, giving unsolicited exposure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially if there's been actual exposure.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No exposure.  Oh, here we are again.  No exposure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  We're right back there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love this.  Turnabout is fair play.  We talked about this on Mac Break Weekly.  So Apple, as you know, will not let companies like Amazon with their Kindle app or their  Audible app or Netflix charge people in the app without giving Apple 30% VIG.  And that's been a big issue.  A lot of that's they're being, they were sued over that by Epic and so forth.  They also have in their developer rules.  And not only can you not do that, but if you're not going to sell inside your apps because  you don't want to give us money, you can't tell people go somewhere else.  You can't say, but you could buy this on the web.  Click here to exit out of this app.  So Apple had an agreement with Google on the Android store and on Android TV that if you  bought something in Apple TV, you wouldn't, Apple wouldn't have to give Google 30%.  That agreement expired and they have not been able to reach terms on in-app payment commissions.  So Apple has now a button in the Apple TV app on Android and on Google TV says how to watch.  And it says you can buy, rent or subscribe in the Apple TV app on iPhone and iPad and  on other streaming devices.  Just not here.  How to do it?  How to do it?  How to get around it?  This is something Apple forbids.  But when Google said we want our 30%, Apple said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And isn't that called a double standard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we're going to put a watch button.  Google allows it.  But it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why Apple is one of the most profitable companies on the planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In some ways it's kind of like what's happening in politics.  Like Democrats can't go be jerks.  But the Republicans can take advantage of their silence on things and just push that line a little further.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It all comes down to norms and what you're willing to do and not do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which you can get away with.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's take a little break and when we come back we'll have the words of God.  So get ready for that.  Something you don't hear all the time on this show.  But first a word from...  Something you don't hear all the time.  Is Jarvis speaking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he's more like Moses.  Moses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Moses supposes his toes is with roses and Moses supposes erroneously.  Our show today brought to you by New Relic.  If you're a software engineer, you know that late night call.  It ain't working.  Something's down.  The server's down.  And you don't know exactly what.  That's the problem.  All you know is customers are screaming.  The boss is mad.  And you're up in the middle of the night.  Your team is scrambling around like crazy.  Like a long-tailed cat in a room full of rocking chairs.  And you're firing up tool after tool trying to figure it out.  And you just don't know what's wrong.  It's the worst feeling.  And if you've ever had that feeling, you know what I'm talking about.  You know who doesn't have that feeling?  People who use New Relic.  Unfortunately, that's only about half of all organizations.  Only half of all organizations implement observability for their networks and systems, according to New Relic.  Maintaining network observability is a big issue.  But you will not be in the dark if you get New Relic.  Imagine getting that call in the middle of the night.  Look, things are going to go down.  But knowing exactly what went wrong, maybe a line of codes that you just committed is broken.  You'll know.  You can fix it.  And you get back to bed in minutes.  Stop guessing where the problems lie.  New Relic combines 16 different monitoring products you'd normally buy separately.  So engineering teams can see across the entire software stack in one place.  You'll get application monitoring, APM, for your apps, your microservices, unified monitoring.  So you know exactly what went wrong.  Unified is a good word for this.  Their network performance monitoring ditches the data silo for a system-wide correlated view of where the performance issues are happening.  So you don't have to kind of page back and forth.  You can get distributed tracing, see all your traces without management headaches.  If you use Kubernetes, you'll love Pixi, Kubernetes observability.  And more importantly, you can pinpoint issues down to the line of code.  You will know exactly why the problem happened and resolve it quickly.  That's why the devs and ops teams at DoorDash and GitHub and Epic Games and more than 14,000 other companies use New Relic to debug and improve their software.  Whether you're running a cloud-native startup or a Fortune 500 company, it just takes a couple of minutes to set up New Relic in your environment.  And then you can go to sleep in peace and never have to worry about that late night call.  They may come, but you'll be able to fix it fast.  New Relic, that late night call is just waiting to happen.  Get New Relic before it does.  Get access to the whole New Relic platform and 100 gigabytes of data per month, free forever.  Wait a minute, Leo. You just told me it's free?  Yes.  The whole New Relic platform, no limits, 100 gigabytes of data, free every month forever, no credit card required.  So why are you waiting?  Sign up right now.  New Relic dot com slash twig.  N-E-W-R-E-L-I-C dot com slash twig.  We thank New Relic so much for supporting this week in Google.  And thank you for supporting us by going to that site so they know you saw it here.  New Relic dot com slash twig.  This was a great story. I read it in Input magazine.  And it actually has a happy ending, but it seems like a sad story.  It's about Thomas Buchler, who just passed away at the age of 65 and left behind a program he'd written pretty much on his own,  a program that stopped working when Windows 7 was no longer supported by Microsoft, when Apple abandoned 32-bit software.  So people were updating their iPhones, their Macs, their Windows machines, and no longer could use it and were devastated.  But they found out that this program, TROPE Trainer, was not from a company, but from one guy, a labor of love.  And when he passed away, suddenly in July at the age of 65, the code disappeared and no one knew how to update it.  I'm going to play it a little bit for you. In order to understand what it does, when you're, and I'm not Jewish,  but I know many friends who got Bar Mitzvah or Bar Mitzvah, you will sing from the Torah, right?  You'll learn to chant.  And of course, that's a big part of your getting ready for your Bar Mitzvah, is learning these chants.  Apparently, it can be very complicated because over time, it's a sing-song thing, and different traditions have different pronunciations.  So there's an Ashkenazi and a Sephardic tradition, and there's different ways of singing it.  But it's something you have to learn. In the past, what you'd have to do is go to the temple and be taught and listen and learn and memorize it.  But this program, which worked on a PC, TROPE Trainer, actually, I'm going to play a little bit of it for you,  because even though it's all lost, and they used, he went to Digital Equipment, which was the only one that had a voice synthesizer 20 years ago,  and got their voice synthesizer to be updated to work with this. It's kind of an amazing story. I highly recommend it.  Fortunately, the woman who helped him at DEC, unpaid volunteer who helped him at DEC, had saved one-way file of this.  So I'm going to play just to give you an idea of what it sounded like.  But the people who used it, the kids and the rabbis, the people who used it, loved it.  It was amazing. Let me scroll down and find the little way file that's on this article. Inputmag.com.  There's a picture of Buchler. Actually, I'm sorry, he died in 2019. I apologize.  Okay.  So it was several years ago. In fact, that was what happened was he died in 2019. And then shortly after that, Microsoft discontinued seven.  And shortly after that, Apple discontinued 32-bit support and so forth.  Here is a way file, 15-second snippet of a voice synthesized to sing sacred words.  So kids would listen to that, memorize it. Pretty amazing story. Highly recommended.  But the thing I loved about this, I read this story and then I saw Andy Bio of WaxeLinks and his tweet.  He figured out actually a guy named Jess5199 figured out how to do it. Everybody thought this is it. It's lost forever.  The source code, they went to Buchler's husband and said, do you have the computer he wrote it on?  He said, no, I gave that away to charity. The source code was long gone. And of course, they could have reversed engineered it.  But fortunately, people who did have a copy of the program running on Windows XP, thanks to Jess5199, he figured out how to run it in VirtualBox using a copy of Trope Trainer from archive.org  and the serial number. And so it is now running. I'll turn it on again. It is now running in virtualization. So saved.  That is cool. Isn't that great? It's a great story. And thank you again. Another great story. Thank you to Internet Archive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the 2005 version of the CD-ROM. Internet Archive just surprises me constantly. I'm doing research and I look at these HathiTrust and the other ones.  HathiTrust and my academic things. And my last resort is, I wonder if Internet Archive has it. And it's amazing all of the day.  Everything is there. Old magazines and publications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And I would have to think Buchler would be very relieved to know that this is his life's work. He spent 20 years on it. That it still can be used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really neat story. I thought I'd pass it.  Can you imagine however what Google Voice could do with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It would be so much better now. But honestly it's not as simple as, I mean it's a hard thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also tonality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And the way the tones are written by the rabbis on the Hebrew script is not a direct correspondence to how it's sung or played. So it's a very, very complicated.  It's nuance.  It's very difficult. And this thing would do it in a variety of different, you could even have a young kid or an old man sing it.  But yeah, if we had decent modern synthesizers working on this, it would be very interesting.  The DEC program that he used had only been translated to English, German, and I think one other language.  So he had to actually, they had to actually kind of teach it how to sing in Hebrew, which is kind of amazing.  What a story.  That's awesome.  Yeah. Lovely story.  I think, let me see. Just looking.  There's lots of stuff.  There's so much stuff, but we don't need to do all of it. Google, just because you've got...  Go ahead and Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like a lot of it feels so marginal. I'm like, I want to be excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, like Google buys a company called Raxiom for AR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Snap bought someone for AR.  I saw this yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're a small AR company.  The Android statues have been removed from Google.  They've been getting really run down and they stopped putting up pretty ones.  They were pretty ratty.  Filthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pollution.  Ron was hoping they were just being, you know, renovated, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that day is over. They're in an undisclosed location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there just going to hide them for now because they're probably going to put them somewhere else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the moment, it's uncertain what Google will do with the statues, assuming the company hasn't destroyed them.  Until then, fans will have to fondly look back at photos posted online.  This is from the San Francisco Chronicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was getting ready to say, you think Google would actually destroy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were fiberglass. They were not meant to last forever.  No.  They were really looking ratty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like putt-putt golf kind of statues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's exactly what they were.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it was for every version of Andres. So there was Kit Kat. There was a pie.  There was a frozen yogurt ice cream sandwich.  It was outside building 44.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They used to be on the main campus and then they moved them to the last store.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And do they still name things that I'm trying to think of the last time?  No, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, technically, they don't make a big deal of it, but technically they do.  So I think...  Oh, they stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they do.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They stopped, too.  Okay. Jason. Jason Howell. All about Android.  Colin Jason Howell.  He pops into the IRC app signal.  Reagan, help us.  They do it internally only.  So Q had the name Quince Tart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why it's internal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Quince Tart. Okay, I see what's happening here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why they're internal now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think the problem was they got to one letter that really wasn't a good dessert.  I forget which one it was.  Was it Quince?  Q is pretty bad.  Quince Tart or Queen Cake. Queen Cake is not so bad.  Which one was it?  That was Android 10. I don't know what 11 and 12 are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are S.  I am totally for that.  I mean, they're going to run out of letters, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Android 12 is Snowcone because it's S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I do remember this.  Yeah. So they didn't get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just don't make a big deal out of it anymore.  Tiramisu.  I believe when they said they were going to stop.  Tiramisu.  Android 11 was Red Velvet Cake, says Jason.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  And he says 13, as you said, he's like most likely Tiramisu.  But then you get to U and V and W and X and Y and X.  What's X going to be?  What kind of dessert?  Extra gum.  Extra gum.  That's right.  Xylitol.  I'm using Android Xylitol now.  No cavities.  Google has settled with the four engineers it fired for unionizing.  This was and then, of course, the employees went to the National  Labor Relations Board and Google finally has settled with them.  Google ran a secret campaign, according to the engineers involved  with workplace activism at the time.  Between 2018 and 2020 to crush union organizing, it was known as  Project Vivian.  Four of the workers were fired in late 2019.  We talked about it at the time.  Two of those employees are back at Google, I think.  But the four others will not be re-instated.  None of the four fired workers will be reinstated.  And of course, we don't know the terms of the settlement.  But I'm thinking.  Why did they call it Project Vivian?  Is that a terrible name?  Because it couldn't be called Xcloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't say like Project Bust the Unions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be a little obvious.  I mean, it's got to come up from somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was one of the Google employees Vivian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, are you ready for YouTube to take on over the air TV with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  nearly four thousand people?  Are you ready for YouTube to take on over the air TV with nearly four  thousand free episodes of TV shows?  With commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm down for this.  Hell's Kitchen, Andromeda, Heartland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You already can watch movies with commercials on YouTube.  I'm down for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes sense.  I use Plex from time to time to watch TV series or whatever.  I like Plex for the most part, but this live TV stuff seems to be a  little bit clunky.  And I would assume YouTube slash Google would be able to do it a little  bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's just a matter of time before the networks realize that's  where the kids are.  And just, you know, remember when YouTube first came out, NBC was  furious because Saturday Night Live skits kept ending up and they were  starting to sue them.  And then they realized, wait a minute, wait a minute, they're drawing  more people in.  This is great for business.  This is literally where people see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, 8 million people saw just this one segment.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they not only gave up, I think they started posting them themselves.  Twitter has gone, given us back the chronological feed.  Now Instagram is doing the same.  Although I've seen people say, just wait till you get that chronological  feed, you'll realize why you didn't want it all along.  I disagree.  I disagree too.  I love my chronological feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like my own rhythmic feed.  So we both can be happy.  Oh, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get both.  There we go.  Features had been launched into limited testing starting in January, but  today it'll roll out to the entire global base of Instagram users.  Are you looking?  Do you have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I haven't tried it yet, but there is one beef that I have with  Instagram and is when I launch it, it's going to have a post that's showing  and then it quickly jumps over.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you can never get back to that post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and now it didn't do it this time.  No, but it happened to me today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a picture of my daughter's birthday.  And then it's gone.  And it was gone.  I can never get back to it.  It's like, what are you doing?  It's like I scrolled and I scrolled and I scrolled.  So maybe that was just a bug.  Maybe that'll be fixed.  Maybe they fixed it now.  Yeah, that was funny because that happened to me too.  It just did it.  It just did it again.  It just did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why it does that.  So give me Chronological and fix that bug, please.  And thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is on iOS and Android, but not on the web version of Instagram.  They had to give you something.  Users will be alerted to the new options, following and favorites from a pop-up  at the top left of the app and under the word Instagram.  From there, you can tap on the feed.  That's kind of what Twitter does.  They have a little sparkle icon that no one knows what the hell is that.  It took me a while to figure out that's how you get back to the Chronological  feed on Twitter.  Let me check this.  Let me see what I've got here.  I'm finding myself using Twitter mobile less to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just did the same thing, by the way, to me.  It showed something, disappeared.  It showed a little pop-oink thing.  So annoying.  So annoying.  I wonder what Instagram's analytics are for people using the web interface.  Well, I use it for the show all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's so much a week for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use it when I click through.  I use it when I click through something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use Instagram less and less.  In fact, I just saw a story that they want to become a shopping mall.  It has been slowly changing to that from a photographic sharing site.  It just makes me want to use it less and less and less and less.  I don't want to go to a shopping mall.  They move that one button.  You buy things.  Another reason why I don't want to go is I'll buy things.  That's the problem.  It works on you.  They're good ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to admit they are good ads on Instagram.  I'm going to delete it tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People buy a lot of that crap.  Oh, geez.  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  Why do you think I'm sitting on a stick?  You think I would have bought this in a store?  You think I would have said, oh, that's perfect.  I need a chair with a little tiny seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a tenth the size of your rear end.  That's a tenth the size of my back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think if it weren't for Instagram, I'd be sitting on this?  He's been squirming all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  How long did this take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When did you get this?  Middle of the night.  It came last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to see your collection of Capitamonte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's Capitamonte?  That's the tacky stuff they sold on QVC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got a lot of Capitamonte.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not getting a lot of ads right now.  Normally I scroll through and see, oh, there's one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the other problem.  You're probably seeing a lot of ads not knowing it.  You're thinking, oh, that's a nice picture.  Oh, no, it's a stick you sit on.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I'll get one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me buy that.  That should be comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, help me understand why you purchased this.  What is the selling point for this?  Is it good posture?  It's a baby chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was for grownups.  It's for good posture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  And again, notice he's been squirming for the last hour.  Oh, yeah, he's been rocking back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  His ass is numb.  He can't feel it.  This is a really sad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's some sort of Stockholm syndrome, and I bought a second one.  It's like, oh, this really hurts.  I need another.  It looks like a chair photographers use out on a shoot,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but it's just not as portable.  It's like the walking sticks you get where you unfold it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and you're sitting there for about a minute.  That's exactly what it is.  That's the old man who goes to the parade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's good enough for a parade or for the golf course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's about it.  The Capo de Monte porcelain is one of the glories

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of Neapolitan homemade.  It binds their origins to the splendor of the Bourbon dynasty.  Wait, what?  In 1743, King Charles of Bourbon and his wife Amalia of Saxony  decided to found a center for porcelain production  within the Regine Regia di Capo de Monte,  driven by the desire.  People with all this stuff on QVC.  Oh, this lovely nymph with a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like humble figurines.  It's the same.  It's worse than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, like the Yardro things or whatever that is.  Yeah, like Yardro.  Worse, tackier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Show it to me.  Okay, here it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, audio people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Capo de Monte, which means top of the mountain.  Capo de Monte.  Oh, here's a beautiful $350 floral arrangement.  It's just the kind of thing your grandmother bought  and then you think you're going to sell it at her estate  and nobody wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, actually we had these when I was a kid.  We had these exact flowers.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is for you, Stacey.  If you send me that phone back,  I will send you Puccinello with a little bit of a little bit of a  If you send me that phone back,  I will send you Puccinello with fruit.  It is a gracious figurine with fruit punch made.  That was like you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is like a nightmare.  It's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think though it might be my new profile picture.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go for that.  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They would spend hours selling this stuff on QVC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd watch QVC if that's what they would sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  QVC is more modern now.  All the tech companies are getting into real life shopping.  It's actually kind of scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody was saying, oh, they've got the Xbox Series X,  which I've had a hard time finding on QVC.  I went to their website.  They're selling it for twice the retail price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My mom's is a QVC shopper.  I don't think it's a...  She quite enjoys it.  I'm about to talk to a woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you guys know her.  Hold on.  It's one of the co-founders of iRobot,  Caroline Greiner.  She has a new company called Turtil,  which is a it's like a Roomba for your garden that does weeding.  It's a 399 robot.  I'm very excited about it.  But they're going to launch on home shopping network,  which is basically like QVC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's money.  Right now on QVC, it's gourmet holiday at the moment.  If you go to qvc.com, you can go in and then click on what's now.  It's gourmet holiday.  You can get just bagels from New York City.  Oh, that's good.  You can get Landy's Caffe,  cups of meatballs and sauce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have now, by the way, changed my avatar  on the Discord.  So I think you're going to enjoy this.  It is just like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Horrifying.  This dude is so weird.  This show is not my daily to bring it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Caparimonte, the head of the mountain.  Let's play the sound and we'll do it is your totally your fault.  But then, but it was really Steph.  But it brought joy.  What's your name's fault?  That lady over on my right here, because she said, Oh, Jeff,  fully knowledgeable, I think now in hindsight as to the impact.  What's Capo de Monte?  It sounded delicious.  It's time for the Google, you know, the Google change log.  See how fast we get through this.  Android 13, the next one.  What do we say that is?  Tiramisu?  Tiramisu is what allegedly will ask your permission to send notifications.  As well it should.  It includes so apps will have to ask.  Oh, we'll have to get Apple does this.  I didn't realize that this wasn't on Android.  Does it too?  Allow app to send you notifications.  Allow don't allow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It gives you the option to manage it.  Like when you get a notification, you're like, God,  why is HBO Max sending me a notification to just open it up and you're like,  stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is now a requirement.  I guess I guess you could do it before if an app was nice,  but they didn't have to do it.  Apps targeting Android 13 will now need to request the notification  permission from the user before posting anything at all.  So that is a good improvement.  That'll be coming soon.  It's already in the dev versions of Android 13.  Speaking of Android 13, there is a new search in town.  Pixel launcher search is at least testing showing results from Google photos.  So when you search now, you know how you do a search on your Android phone for an app.  It will also, if you put a name in search for photos of that person,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it'll search across a whole bunch of domains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, as well as Google photos.  So searching for screenshots will surface a Google Photos branded carousel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said it'll search outside of Google.  No, I think this says it's going to search your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your phone.  Oh, OK.  But it'll include photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  That's interesting, especially if you actually tag people in your photos.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there.  Google Photos is updating its library and sharing tabs to make photos easier to find as well.  Shortcuts to your screenshots.  So that's a layout change basically to the interface.  Don't be surprised when you see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I appreciate them doing this.  I haven't really cared for.  It's not a great interface.  I like this service being pretty quick on backing up and so forth  and allowing me to just get my images off of them fairly quickly, but still just navigating on the phone is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also an update coming for the Google Home app.  Simpler controls, improved privacy.  I'm sure Stacey likes that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We talked about it on the show coming out tomorrow.  What did you say?  We said we liked it.  It's simple.  We like the privacy.  And apparently they're also going to change the event feed.  So it'll be a little bit more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll sort them and groups.  That's always been a problem of mine because I'll get a thousand.  If I go in the backyard, I get a thousand notifications.  There's somebody in your backyard.  So now it will kind of sort them into a group.  Things that happen within a short space of time into one thing.  The Android app will finally let you delete the last 15 minutes of your search history, just like iPhone users.  It came to the iOS app in last summer.  But for some reason, Google denied it to Android users.  They're now bringing it.  So why would you want to delete the last 15 minutes of your search history?  Depends on who's looking at your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's say you just murdered someone.  Oh, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not the great example of Mrs. Higginbotham.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the settings are now 36 months, 18 months, three months or 15 minutes.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was talking to a friend of mine who in his kid's school, his teenager's school, he had his laptop and it was on the screen.  And he started typing a letter, as you know, when it will auto complete.  P Pornhub fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just because he typed the letter P.  That's sad.  Did he click?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He must have clicked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to return.  But that's those keyboards.  Believe me, it's easy to get a kid was using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think a kid was using the computer.  Yeah.  And did that.  So I went through I went not before that I heard the story, by the way, I just happened to go through my entire alphabet.  Just to see what one letter will do.  Yeah.  What every letter will do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's boy.  That's bad.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to go to fizz.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pinboard.in Pam and Tommy panic Nova parks and wreck Anna the armist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Photographers Santa Rosa Putin speech and Paul Thomas Anderson.  I love it.  Lisa and I were having a fight.  We were watching Anna to arm us who is of course a wonderful actor in the late James Bond movie.  She's in a brand new movie on I think it's on Netflix.  It's terrible.  It's on Hulu with Ben Affleck Deep River water.  It's terrible.  Don't watch it.  So good.  You know the name of it.  But I I said oh yeah.  She said who's this woman?  I said oh she was in parks and wreck.  I was watching Cuba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think of Aubrey Plaza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I confused her with Aubrey Plaza.  Exactly.  I love her.  And so I'm desperately searching parks and wreck and an armist.  And you know what?  There are no search results for that.  You knew you were right.  This is my fairly recent.  All of this is like the last day or two history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Putin speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is why you might want to delete your search history before you go teach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I'm just not going to do any other letters.  That's all I could tell you right now.  Google is moving.  I'm going through them all.  They're good.  Yeah.  I mean I think it's kind of it's like a tour down memory lane.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh I remember when I was day of Amazon B for Bookfinder C for calendar D for Dark Sky E  for eBay.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or I typed a and I got and the armist parks and wreck.  I tried it two different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well you're not using.  Here's the difference.  You just knew she's on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I swear she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is wrong.  That's wrong.  Oh and now when I type C I get Capo de Monte.

Transcript:  Oh good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Finally.  Finally Google is moving the movies and TV app app tab.  Punchy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just try to get through this one more time.  Let's start over.  Right again.  Finally.  If you're asked for a number right now you're probably fine.  That's what you're thinking.  You're thinking I can't sit here any longer.  This is a great way to get us out in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's do it.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brand new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google movies and TV app from the Play Store to Google TV and that's the Google change  log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Another chair.  She wants to send me a different chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you want to send me.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No I was going to send you another one of those chairs just in case.  This is the QOR 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the end it's all about it's designed by a cardiologist.  That probably should have been a giveaway.  That a cardiologist.  Blood pressure.  This chair.  It'll give you a heart attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  More like designed by a proctologist.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well this don't know if it had been a butt guy I would have been.  I would have been a better chair.  Do I care about any of these other what phone does a POTUS carry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't just you guys might know take a look at the pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes it's an Apple iPhone.  iPhone 12.  Presidential seal case.  13 Pro Max.  I like the case.  That's probably more than just an everyday case.  Good old RFID lock down.  But if you look at that camera.  Don't you think Stacey that's a dead giveaway that square.  Look at it.  Here's the same camera on an iPhone 12.  But I think the 13 looks very similar.  So it's either a 12 or 13.  But there's the same camera right.  That square.  Yeah.  Square camera.  That's it right.  Looks like it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nailed it.  Here show the top.  Can you see anything from the bezel.  Show you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at the top of that.  I think this is all the same.  Oh Mike.  Oh no no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's his case.  Yeah it has little grills.  I think he's got a that's a special CIA NSA.  That's a something something.  There's nothing.  That's he's got a.  Oh you know what that is.  That's a cover.  That's a.  That's a.  That's a.  That's a.  That's a screen cover.  I bet you on a hinge because you wouldn't want people to read over.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would try to like look over her shoulder.  Oh yeah.  Sure.  Of course you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  President care that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah the Secret Service would be like ma'am ma'am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am actually surprised to remember when this all came up for the first time that I remember  with Obama who had a Blackberry in 2008 when he came into the White House 2009 and the  NSA took one look at it and said sir you cannot carry a Blackberry.  Yep.  Gotta go.  They gave him a felt bad for him a Windows phone that was specially modified to be safe  you know secure.  And ever since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Secure because by obscurity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I guess they had you know by 2008 there were iPhones but honestly they were Blackberry  probably would have been the first thing you'd expect Obama to be carrying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they have the enterprise presence at least back then.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everybody.  I thought the first iPhone came out in 2007.  It did.  So he was he entered office January 20th 2009 a day I shall never forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then Trump came along and used any bloody phone he wished.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah wasn't that interesting.  He fought it.  He fought it.  And in fact I think he did use an iPhone we know because he was tweeting from an iPhone.  Oh that's right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The first image from the Webb telescope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is actually kind of cool.  The Webb telescope was of course the space telescope that's sitting at Lagrange point  very distant more than almost a million kilometers from the earth.  So it will not be repairable.  So they took a big chance it had to fold up into a tiny little origami thing so it could  be launched into space.  It's been ever since it's launched several months ago unfolding and deploying and it  has done so with remarkable success.  Not one problem.  And now the very first image as they've aligned the mirror now is of a quote very boring star  according to NASA.  You see the you see the you would know about this and the the star lines coming off of  that that's because of the aperture on the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Tight aperture to cut down the light and it's the blades that you see that makes the little  starry extensions there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's it's false color because it's an infrared photo.  But here's the most interesting thing about this.  And by the way this is not the final quality.  There's still a lining.  They have a way to go.  But here's this is a star known as HD 84406 is 100 times fainter than a star that could  be seen with a human eye.  But the thing that's most interesting about this image I don't know if I can get a bigger  picture.  Be nice if I could.  If you go to NASA they will.  But the most interesting thing is those little dots.  Those are not stars.  Those are galaxies.  Isn't that awesome.  You can look at this galaxy here for instance.  It's a flat plate.  It's a spiral arm galaxy.  That's why they don't they're not pinpoints.  They're actually entire galaxies.  Isn't that amazing.  Yeah.  So this telescope everybody's very excited.  This is a very successful deployment.  They're not quite there yet when they are we start getting images.  Didn't it take a selfie of itself.  It did.  Here's the selfie.  Picture back down.  Those are the octagons one two three four five six hexagons that unfolded to form one  single mirror.  And so there's I think 18 of them John is that right.  So they had to align these hexagonal segments so that they would all focus on a pinpoint  and that's what that image is.  But now there's still very very small nanometer scale adjustments they have to make so that  they're exactly converged.  According to Jane Rigby Web Operations Project Scientist at Goddard the telescope's performance  is so far everything we dared to hope.  The engineering images we saw today are as sharp and as crisp as the images that Hubble  can take but are a wavelength of light that is totally invisible to Hubble.  So this is making the invisible universe snapping into very very sharp focus performing even  better than expected.  That is unbelievable.  Hey science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole story of this is so amazing.  They started figuring out that we needed this telescope like in 1996 and every year they  had to fight for their budget.  It was like 10 billion dollars.  It was way over budget.  Every year they'd go to Congress and they'd be like please please please please.  I mean it's just it's such an inspirational story.  Or disgusting depending on how you feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean I'm told by people like John who followed this and Rod Pyle and Tarik Malak who do our  space show this week in space that the things that we will learn from this telescope are  unheard of.  We don't even know what we're going to learn about the origins of the universe.  There's going to be amazing discoveries coming out of this telescope.  So this is a really very very important scientific project and it looks to be successful.  Great picture.

But then I look over next to it at my June oven the original $1500 June oven is getting  a little ratty a little long in the tooth.  Yeah.  I remember it.  Wait a minute Stacey says they've improved the June and my wife said let's get a new  one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah I got it.  I got a new one.  I mean because we had had ours.  I do love it.  I still love it.  They they took the scale out and it's only $500 $600 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But does that matter that they took the scale out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean no because apparently it didn't automatically incorporate the scale.  You had to actually do it.  Oh well that's no.  You're not going to notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'll tell you it took a while for Lisa to get convinced but she loves enough.  She said yeah let's get the new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  We got a new one and we still we used ours like probably four or five times a day every  single day.  So but the new one doesn't have the cool knob.  That's that's another cost savings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know I don't mind that much.  What's funny is it runs Android.  That's an Android little Android interface running there.  It goes out on the net.  It looks up recipes.  What turned her around was she put Brussels sprouts in and it said are those Brussels  sprouts.  Would you like me to cook them.  She said yes.  And 20 minutes later perfect Brussels sprouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did it add bacon.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's impossible to have a perfect Brussels sprout.  No she was what she was like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't have such a thing.  She was not a believer.  No no I don't believe it.  She believes today.  She does.  I'm telling you she loves them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Grab yourself a replacement.  I mean we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can use it as an air fryer now which is kind of cool.  You have to have baskets.  We use it all the time.  So thank you.  What is your new thing.  What else should I buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh by the way I have to.  OK.  This is before my thing.  Remember the cocktail shaker.  Yeah.  It turns out they didn't send me the small gasket and they did.  I just emailed them.  It's like hey.  So I remember that was why my thing and now it's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh good.  So they did send the gasket.  You just didn't see it.  Yeah they were super.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know they didn't.  They sent me two of the big gaskets instead of a big gasket.  Yeah I have small gaskets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't get one of those.  Oh good.  Because we threw it away.  So no we didn't.  It is however up in the cupboard waiting to make a martini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you should use it.  For the next garage sale.  No no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No no no no.  Use it beforehand.  I bought it right when you talked about it.  I bought it for Christmas for Lisa.  It didn't come.  But unfortunately her birthday is one month later so she had it for her birthday.  We haven't had a chance to use it.  Maybe tonight.  That reminds me.  We should do it.  Can you imagine the Laporte garage sale?  Oh you don't have to imagine it.  Aunt already knows all about it.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It happens usually every January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's in the conference room.  I just bring a lot of crap.  I love it.  Yeah.  There's one coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe he'll mail you a device and include some other unsolicited objects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I shed gadgets as I go down the street.  They just fall off of me.  It's pretty awesome.  I actually saw your article or maybe it was a tweet about these new Wi-Fi routers from  Eero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  So this is a 2000 word review and I feel like it didn't even cover all the things one should  cover.  That's how crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right up top 6E, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So that's because I'm not a gadget nerd.  I'm just a nerd nerd.  I'm mostly excited by the fact that this year we're getting Wi-Fi 6E, which to be honest  is not exciting in the sense that we can use it today because there's not a lot of 6E capable  devices.  But it's awesome because we have 1200 megahertz of unlicensed spectrum for Wi-Fi that we can  use, which is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it 6 gigs?  Where is the 6E spectrum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's technically in the 5.6, but it's called the 6 gigahertz band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a very high.  So first I thought when they started doing 5 gigahertz, I thought, well, that's going  to be so high it's not going to go anywhere.  But that actually turns out to be its real benefit because it doesn't go through walls.  You don't get interference from neighbors or anybody or yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And 6 is even better because you get these wide channel widths.  It supports 160 megahertz channels, which basically means you can pack a whole bunch  of information in those megahertz and just send it all in one go.  Like a really big dump truck full of stuff, full of data.  How much is it?  160 megahertz wide channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the entire FM band is 20 megahertz.  The entire AM band, I think, is 200 kilohertz.  So that's a lot.  You could get all the AM FM stations on there and then some.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty good.  But like 5G, it's up there.  So it does attenuate.  It doesn't go through walls.  This is a short distance for prime usage.  So there's a but Orbi, Linksys, Asus, they all have these routers out.  So this is just the latest is Eero's routers.  And I like testing them now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Miss Stacy, I've heard you say a couple of times short distance.  What exactly is considered short distance when you're talking about this particular  wavelength?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It depends on your environment.  But think a couple of feet.  Well, think not tens of feet, like 10 feet.  It's a room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's basically a room.  Yeah.  So that's good because if you have a neighbor in an apartment next to you or even a house,  nowadays people blast their Wi-Fi.  That won't interfere with yours.  Do you have any 6E devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  I have the phone you sent me.  It was the only 6G device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was so excited.  Because throughout the review it says, when testing speeds on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold  3 in my dining room and a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 has a Wi-Fi 6E capable radio, that's  good.  I'm glad that makes it even better that you got that because otherwise you wouldn't be  able to test it.  But that's a good point is most people do not have devices that will take advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't need to rush out and buy this.  Two years maybe?  I highlighted it.  You should buy it if you have a Wi-Fi 5 router just broke, then sure, go get this.  Or get a 6E capable router.  You can decide if you want this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would because it's a standard now and so devices will start coming out.  Most phones now are Wi-Fi 6.  It just took a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But don't, don't.  You don't have to rush.  If you're going to upgrade your computer or phone and you're going to have a 6G, I would  say whenever you get your first 6G device that you're really stoked about, then you  can go buy your first, sorry, 6E device.  Then go and get this to go with it.  Or go and get a 6E capable router.  I will say like the Orbeez and the Linksys, both of those are like $1,500, $1,200 and  they're multi, multi gigabit.  I think it's 8 and 11 gigabits respectively.  Eero's done a nice job in the sense that if you have a gigabit connection, this is going  to be fine for you.  If you've got a small office, go up.  If you've got machines capable of transferring data inside your LAN, or it would be your  WAN, or it would be your WLAN, sorry.  I'm like, let me get there.  Then I guess, but it seems like overkill.  The cool thing for this story is I think Eero's probably taking the right tack, recognizing  what we have available as bandwidth for consumers and serving something that is, it's still  kind of pricey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  It's about the same price as the older Eero's.  So they're kind of hitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so pissed that I have the older Eero's.  Because I spent a lot of money for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When Eero came out, they were considered really, really expensive.  Everybody else has gone up and gone beyond them now.  And Eero's just kind of stayed at that $500 price point, which is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so they also launched, I didn't review these, but they launched the 6 Plus and then  they lowered their price on their regular 6 ones.  So in honest, the final thing I'll say about this, because I really was curious and have  been for a while, Nick Weaver, who is the CEO of Eero, he said, hey, you know what?  I think five years is about the right time for transfer, like switching out.  I'd say that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd agree with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I agree with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because technologies change.  Unfortunately, security issues crop up.  Sometimes they don't get patched.  It's probably a good idea every every four or five years to update your router.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How fast is how fast did you do a bandwidth test on the fine Samsung Galaxy Flip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.  And you know, I can't get above 500 megabits per second anywhere in my house on the device,  which is yes, it is.  It is fine.  But I do have a gig of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wi-Fi is almost always half what the nominal speed is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Internally, the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a rule, but it's very common.  Seems to be the.  I'd say 50 to 60 percent.  Mm hmm.  Of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is.  So I will say these are like two and a half to three X faster than my existing.  Like all of my existing devices ran two to two or two and a half to three times faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's been a big change.  Phones have gotten even on 5G, but even on Wi-Fi, they've gotten much faster.  Used to be the phone, even if you could get a 500 megabit connection, couldn't do more  than 100 or 200.  They really they put better chips in there and better radios and they're much faster  than they used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know if the iPhones have an upload limit?  Because my husband noticed when he was testing on his iPhone, he could not get more than  like 120 something or 130.  And I didn't know.  Oh, they may.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They may be.  You know, let me look.  I don't think I've ever seen more than 100 megabits up.  So maybe there is a limit.  That may be.  I don't know.  Well, how would you throttle up?  Well, you don't for one thing, you don't want to saturate the connections, because  if you do, then if you're using the maximum upstream, your downstream stops.  So but it also probably is to save money.  I don't know.  I'll investigate.  That's a good question.  I do not know.  I'm actually pretty excited because the new Macs, the Mac studios and some of the M1s  support 10 gigabit ethernet.  And we, as it turns out, have 10 gigabit symmetric ethernet from Sonic.  Which nothing we've had has been able to use.  But I, but I now can.  So I asked Russell, I said, is there any way I can get a 10 gigabit drop in my office?  He said, yes.  So we'll see.  I will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're going to load a bunch of shows simultaneously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he said it doesn't really matter because there's no website going to be able  to keep up anyway, but you know, faster is always better.  We are at the point now where we're really as fast as any website ever is going to be.  I think.  But yeah, if you're downloading something from a very fast site, actually, you know  what he said, uh, that the Google drive storage, we are in our editors have 10  gigabit at their desktops as well.  And he's noticed that the Google drive uploads are very fast, not 10 maybe, but,  but much gigabits faster.  So yeah, you can, you can.  So here we go.  Support scooter X on the job for my chat room.  iPhone wifi specifications, channel bandwidths.  Does this say what the S this just says what they can do?  Oh yeah, here we go.  Uh, maximum data rate.  It does look like.  I'm BGN the, the, is this up or down?  I don't know.  I'll have to, it's hard to tell.  I have to look at this more carefully.  It may just be a weird thing on his phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should try it with the Samsung galaxy Z flip three.  See how it works.  I did.  What's the upstream?  It works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, hold on.  Let me go back to my head.  I do not realize off the top of my head upstream was.  Well, hold on.  Which is the right one.  Which is sorry.  I went, uh, 341 per second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, I could film a movie on my Samsung galaxy Z fold three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stream it live.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'll, I'll let you see if you want to do this.  Um, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll quick mention first.  Quick plug our friend near at Weisblatt, her book tech lash was on the show.  Cost a hundred dollars.  It comes out tomorrow on paperback and $25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a very good book.  Highly recommend.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Um, I don't know if you want to do this, Leo or not, but, uh, Corey Booker, my  Senator just gave an amazing minute, uh, during the hearings that's going around  video like crazy online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did see what he said.  Let's play a little bit of this.  This is during the, uh, Katanji Brown Jackson, um, hearings for Supreme court.  Booker of course is, uh, uh, taking her testimony among others, among  their other senators here was what he had to say about her experience so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wrote, Oh, let America be America again.  The land that never has been yet, but yet must be the land where everyone is free.  Oh yes, I say it plain America never was America to me, but I swear this oath.  America will be.  That is the story of how you got to this desk, you and I, and everyone here,  generations of folk who came here and said, America, I'm Irish.  You may say no Irish or dogs need to apply, but I'm going to show this  country that I can be free here.  I can make this country love me as much as I love it.  Chinese Americans first forced into near slave labor, building our  railroads, connecting our country.  So the ugliest of America, but they were going to build their home here  and say, America, you may not love me yet, but I'm going to make this nation  live up to its promise and hope.  LGBTQ Americans from Stonewall women to Seneca hidden figures who didn't even  get their play until some Hollywood movie finally talked about it.  And how they were critical for us defying gravity.  All of these people loved America.  And so you faced insults here that were shocking to me.  Well, actually not shocking.  Not shocking.  Oh, she's tearing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you are here because of that kind of love and nobody's taken this away from me.  So you got five more folk to go through five more of us.  Five more of us.  And then you can sit back and let us have all the debates.  And I'm going to tell you, it's going to be a well-charted Senate floor  because it's not going to stop.  They're going to accuse you of this and that heck in honor of your person  who shares your birthday, you might be called the communist, but don't worry.  My sister, don't worry.  God has got you.  And how do I know that?  Because you're here and I know what it's taken for you to sit in that seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said your ancestors would be proud.  That was a nice speech.  Now I'm cynical and I know some others are and it obviously was a prepared  speech, but still beautiful, really beautiful.  And it was Langston Hughes poetry.  Yeah, I love that poem.  That's a beautiful poem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Way to go.  Like saying, you've had a really crappy time and people have asked you  a tons of really crap questions.  Let me just give you X amount of time and just build you back up.  Way to be unselfish, Kourtney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was thinking that probably once they get to the Supreme Court in their chambers,  I mean, now they've crossed that final hurdle.  That's it.  That's it.  They don't have to worry for the rest of their lives about anything so bad ever again.  And I imagine they sit around going, when that a bitch,  man, that was bad.  But you made it. You made it through.  Well, we hope she does.  She's definitely qualified.  Good. Thank you, Jeff.  No, I don't think I'm going to play that, but it was a it was a good idea.  What else you got? Good pool.  No, I'm just kidding.  I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just like what?  Yeah, I was very confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you kept saying as if I had a choice.  Now, you may not want to do this, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but you can't say we don't do politics in the short course of the case.  Or you could have said, no, no, no, Jeff.  I really want that Benedict Evans advertising column for you to go through it in detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, we're going to skip that one this week.  How about you, and you got a thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. One thing is something totally random and odd that I do on Saturdays  or Sundays, and it's called L.A. Flights.  And it is a group of gentlemen that go to the L.A.  airport, set up a couple of cameras and live stream  a couple of days a week for like 12 hours straight  of just watching airplanes come in.  Wow. And they talk about it in this beautiful video quality, beautiful audio.  I don't know how they're doing it, but I'm sure Alex Lindsay knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know who knows Johnny Jett knows they hang out at the In-N-Out Burger.  Yeah. Outside L.A.  Airport, which has a very good view of the runway.  I think that's what Johnny said was the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is great. I love watching it.  And I watch it for hours and just it's like great white noise for me.  And I said, I should share this because I do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no wonder. I'm in the members only section. Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need to look.  But yeah, I like L.A. flights on YouTube.  And then next is a pic that came from a friend of mine and another listener of Twig.  It's the sound of Merlin.  I've never seen this app, and I thought it was quite awesome  because now I just go outside and hold my phone up  and it will help identify the birds that are making all of the dag gum noise  at 5 a.m. in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll give you a hint. They're all crows, every damn one of them.  Well, it ain't that it ain't crows.  No, it's the songbirds.

Transcript:  20th anniversary gift is a bird diagram.  This comes from Cornell, actually.  This is really cool. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It has like three or four different components.  You have a visual component.  You also have an audio component that you have to download.  And of course, it's going to want your location in the app to sort of help,  you know, figure out what's what exactly is around you.  But that's the sound of the Merlin app Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will tell you, I have used the Merlin app.  It's one of my you know, I've got like my identify mountains, identify planes.  I also have the Merlin. Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I also just I did miss Lisa because she's helping me get my my wine game.  She is super tasteful.  New to all this stuff.  And in that particular recently, we were discussing  it threw me off a bit because when I nosed it, it smelled like  fresh cut grass.  That's good.  I didn't like that.  I was like, oh, this is this is not my thing.  You have a very good nose.  But I had it with fish and it was delicious.  Oh, it was delicious.  But the nose just sort of threw me off.
