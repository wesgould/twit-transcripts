Kevin is a  Kind of the one of the spearheads behind the Indie web movement. We're gonna talk a little bit about that today  That'll be fun. I'm looking forward to that. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little bit before but I think going in depth is gonna be fun with you. Yeah, and I've been playing with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we should also welcome then our Indie web guests from formerly known as Idno. It's now called known  That's Ben word Muller and Erin Joe Richie  Hi good to see you your company is called known. Yes, and the website is with known  Known and I've been playing with with known  And am a quite a fan. So let's do the unboxing by the way  Please Ben and Erin just jump right in any you you're now guests not guests in the sense that we're you're gonna interview you  You're a part of the show. You're a panelist on the show. So  participate as you wish  Jeff has a box. He has a box cutter and he is about to unveil  A paper cut no something very exciting. I think  No packing material. Yes. It's a round box ladies and gentlemen and inside the round box a  little black watch so this was  Jason reason I kind of knew what it was because Jason Howell got his two you guys went to Google IO and  At Google IO you got to choose between the LG and the Samsung watches and then we're told  That down the road that sometime you'd get a moto  360 and there it is  It's kind of funny because you feel like  All of these watch companies need to get it in before Apple  Announce their watch then now that I've seen the Apple watch which by the way, the name of the Apple watch is watch  Now that I've seen the Apple watch yep and pretty  You're gonna it takes a little time to set it up mine was not fully charged out of the box  So I had to plug it in. Let me show you the charger though while you're unboxing yours  And again, this is this is Jason's so first of all, it's the first smart watch  Android wear watch that actually looks like a watch with a round face a lot of people have complained about the  The round face because it's the flat tire at the bottom  But you know, you know, especially with a black typeface  You don't see that if you if you tap the watch you can see it when you there's it's not too bad  That doesn't bother me. The bigger question on this is going to be oh and by the way  I'm dictating to it right now. The bigger question on this is gonna be battery life and  Responsiveness I fix it tore it down and they say it's a four-year-old  Ti Oh map system on a chip a very old one  Not a particularly low power one and that battery life on this watch some have complained the verge said was not even a full day  And the Anacos had his for a little bit longer and he says he's getting about 19 hours  We'll see that'll be the most interesting thing, but I do like the way you you charge it it comes with this dock  You know the the others the Samsung the LG have have kind of a flat thing  You snap it into with pogo pins and it charges  This is an inductive wireless charger and it sits right here in the wireless charger  Presumably on your bedside and then it does rotate. Oh, it's not plugged in so it's not gonna do it  But when it's plugged in it will rotate and show you the time  Sideways, so that's good. So it's nice. It becomes a bedside clock. There's the two together  There's Jeff. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gonna watch is all the way up his arm  I should go I should go out the street this way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You saw something right there that the the moto X fades out to save battery fades out five seconds after you flip it up the  LG which are you wearing the LG or the Samsung? I'm wearing the LG the LG which I have also  Stays on it dims, but it stays on  And gets a full day and I think this is maybe because of the battery weakness on this watch that it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It turns itself. I was that I just got back from EFA in Berlin  I was speaking at EFA plus which was a good event first time  They've had talks and stuff and I went up and saw the LG. There's another LG round. Why that's pretty the are  Which is really nice and it has the thing I Leo and I can't what you call it  but like a divers wash round thing and that hides the  The the  Mechanics that are in the flat tire. Let's ask the can to bridge over and maybe he'll know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bezel I think but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I would have to ask my wife because she's the one who's actually  As a jeweler, so she would know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks pretty nice I have to say  It does it does is it a tacky meter? That's what Joel says  But how that sounds sounds right?  if it's the cat if it's the calculator thing the anatomy of watch of course Chad has a  An illustration. What is the ring? It's the it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The bezel or dial ring or the dial ring. I think the dial ring is on the face itself. It's the numbers  That's the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, okay nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice  Try to read whatever points to Cambridge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fix or rotating unidirectional rotating bezel, huh? Huh? Why why does it rotate? What do you do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've diving and timing functions. Yes some watches the there for pilots. You can calculate how much gas you'll have left. Oh  I'll do that. It's a kid. So it's kind of almost like a slide rule  It's a calculating thing. Although if it's just timing then you would just put you know  But anyway, oh this ridiculous we've spent way too much time on something completely irrelevant  And this is my problem with watch the whole watch conversation  anyway  the smartphone meant people could finally get rid of that thing on their wrist and  How manufacturers are trying to put it back on our wrists and we say no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a great tweet. I saw yesterday said well now the device  I no longer use to tell what time it is is tied to the device. I no longer use to call people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I can't give credit where it was due. All right. Yes, so we'll have next week. We'll have a  You know, it's funny because I took it out and I and I said wow, that's pretty and immediately ordered one  It's two to three weeks back ordered now, which is better than it was you can't actually order

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's interesting google.com because I was thinking that you know Apple pre announcing this would basically tank  everyone motor over and everyone else's sales of watches over Christmas because  Everyone be waiting for the Apple one, but maybe the other way around  They've seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In a way that does doesn't it validates the category so okay and I won't be able to get it to some unknown time in 2015  So and I think the Apple one looks like such a Rube Goldberg  it looks like a  metal pillow on your wrist with with a button in a dial it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, why have the the buttonless company has the top? I think Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Contrary to what we were all hoping which is that Apple would solve this wearable conundrum  Apple's gone the opposite direction. They have little icons on the screen. They're tiny  Looks like you've got a honeycomb on your screen. You're supposed to navigate that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want a navigable watch the watch is there to give me alerts that are supplementary to my phone  And I find that all the time  I was sitting someplace and I needed to get a hold of somebody and I saw the SMS come in on my on my watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that interface, it's crazy and then  After everybody kind of why widely agrees around is the way to go. That's why the moto 360 sold out so fast  It's what LG is doing with the are Apple's declared. No. No, you know what a  Rounded pillow shaped rectangle. That's what you really want. Oh  and by the way  You can you can draw pictures and send it to somebody else on your watch  You can tap it send strange emoticons  I think I you know after thinking about this for a little bit this watch is designed for Japanese schoolgirls  This is the this is the this is a watch. I swear to God. Oh, I don't want a functionality in the watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is good thumbnails of your picture the size of it's only 320 by 320

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not like they said retina, but come on. It's 320 by 320. It's not  Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey and just what I want a map on my watch  I don't know it has something they call Taptic not haptic Taptic feedback. Oh look you could set the date. Whoa  Atomic clocks you don't need to set the date. Well, then they made the first thing they said is we consulted  horological experts  To find out what people wanted with the watch and this watch is set automatically to the atomic clock. I  Love atomic clocks. I do too. But you know what every smartwatch  That this is the feature  That's the feature  So well, Erin Joe, you think this is it? This is the watch for you. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know. I mean, I'm wearing the basis watch together. I like the basis watch. That's a health tracker data  Yeah, so and I wear a whole bunch of devices  I  Could potentially see myself wearing two or three watches at once to test them out if I had them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I mean, I'm constantly making fun of you because your watch runs out of battery halfway through the workday

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But so actually my watch the battery on this basis will last a couple of days before I have to charge it  I just forget to charge it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's to me. That's why any watch one day is all it needs is one day  You're gonna charge it every night anyway, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't charge the basis at night because it has the sleep tracker data so I wear  And unless I remember to take it off when I'm at my desk not doing anything and charge it which I usually don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then the battery dies you can see the that you should try the I think it's called sleep at Android  Yeah, I love that put the phone on your bed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but Jeff you can now choose your watch for that you do that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do that. I have that the iPhone app that I love I've been using it for years that and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Couple other things so it's a little crowded in your bed is what you're saying  There's lots of sleep tracking things that I've experimented with here is by the way. I just want to show you so  This is a nano watch. This is a this is the thing that started this whole silly category  It's an iPod Nano in a special band where it was a Kickstarter project  This is exactly  same  As everything else in fact, it looks a lot like the new Apple  That looks nice and it holds your music  Yeah, so I  Don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very much like the other watches. I don't want to stay on Apple for too long Leo  But but since I was traveling I couldn't hear you on Sunday or yesterday whatever the hell it was. I'm  It's Tuesday. I don't know where I am. What did you think of the rest of the phone announcements?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's an it's a new iPhone. It's huge. It's really interesting  I think really the thing to take away from the Apple announcement is this is Tim Cook's first  He's finally out from under the ghost of Steve Jobs. This is his first new product category  He announced two new product categories not just the Apple watch but also Apple pay which may be more significant  As many Android fans pointed out Apple and that's nothing that hasn't been on Android for some time in some cases for years  but because it's Apple, you know, they  They're not they don't need to hurry and they can spend some time and get it right and I think the Apple pay thing  particularly is going to bring some clout to the marketplace and I do believe this is the beginning of the end of the credit card and of  cash  At long last long last. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The end of cash, but I think it's it is potentially the end of the credit card  But the interesting thing that you know, I've been using  This this phone to pay with for at least two years  Because that's when they started doing that and the retail support in the US has been really poor  you know, I would spot a terminal and I'd pay with this and the  The shop will go what just happened. Did you have my term? Yeah  They don't like it look like I'd closed transaction out by attacking it with my phone  Because they hadn't you know, they hadn't seen these things in action, even though it's been widespread in in Japan in Europe for a while  and I think one of the things that the two things Apple brings two things this one is  The mind share and marketing muscle and the ability to persuade all the retailers to upgrade their terminals because all these high-value  Shoppers will be will be demanding it  So it's actually great for the people who are building retail terminals  but the other key thing that they've brought is that the fingerprint ID because when you use the  Android phone to pay you basically have to tap your phone unlock your phone type in your Google Wallet pin  so you're you're faffing about with a phone quite a lot before the  Transaction goes through whereas with the Apple one because you can do that with one grab of the  Fingerprint ID thing and tap and then tap and they can make that very smooth  And that that is that is a big difference in in user experience at the at the checkout

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think well and timing is it's funny. It's both good and bad  of course the timing is bad because Apple's iCloud was hacked and to the great embarrassment of a lot of celebrities, but  good because of the  recent hacks on  Target and Home Depot  Yeah, really making people very aware of the vulnerability of point-of-sale systems and Apple's done it right  It's a single use it's a single use number, but both credit card and a confirming pin one time only can't be reused  And this is even more important the retailer gets no personal information at all Apple maintains that so  Well, yeah, I mean that's to Apple's benefit and of course you have to trust Apple  Not if on two levels one not to invade your privacy and two not to accidentally be hacked  But assuming you do all that that's a far sight better than giving a credit card to a waiter who wanders off in Europe  They don't do that right Kevin you they actually bring a terminal to the table and show you swiping it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know at all cards most have chips and they have pins

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is better than that even though. This is a step beyond that yes the target wouldn't have any  Information about you at all that it could be could be hacked

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right  I mean the difference between this and the the iCloud hack is that money is fungible so if they  Take your money by mistake they can refund you whereas if they take your naked pictures. They can't take  No  There's so that so and that that means that a lot of this you know OX is security blah blah blah  That's not really a benefit for you because the credit card companies are already liable for doing things wrong  And they will they can be fun the money and that's why they ran the you know TV ads about  Identity theft sorry to take you seriously with a cat's tail tickle

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think and of course you know Google's you know start trying to do it has been doing this  But it doesn't have is to fragment  It doesn't have the cloud Apple does Apple has the the market cloud to make this happen  So this is good for everybody because your Android phone will also do it, but this is not an open system, right?  I mean, this is the it won't do Apple pay, but but this but it will do tap to pay and I think tap to pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is here yeah, it's it's it's based on tap to pay and it's not an Apple all Apple is doing  Internally is is is facilitating the merchant payment you still have to use a sign up for as a payment as a merchant in the payment  Processor and they're just making the transaction happen right so they they're not they're not becoming the middleman here  They're just becoming the the broker of the device effectively. Yeah now that may change  I mean to say this is one of the things where they've  Like when they launched iTunes originally they said okay, we were going to digitize your industry  But we don't actually want any of the revenue. We just want to sell the gadgets so they say to the music business  and  They may change over time with the ability to spend money that you've got in your Apple account by you know  I'm putting money in that way that that's the bit that's that's  Not clear yet that that happens with the Google account  You can you can put money into your Google account and spend that rather than actually using a credit card  And it's not clear that that's possible with the Apple Pay thing yet  It seems like you they're actually always broken in credit card at the moment, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, there's not I mean if you want to know more watch Mac break weekly and every other show this week  But no, but I think look Google's in these spaces  and I think the other thing that is  struck me last night is  Apple was smart to delay because their watch can now build upon what they've learned and what we've learned from previous watches is  and the end and by delaying they also avoid things like wearable glasses and  So Google takes some arrows in the back by being upfront on these  Apple's content to sit back say good luck have fun over there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm surprised so the glass just went for sale on play. Yeah, I'm actually surprised. I'm surprised. It wasn't just killed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no market for that. I can't I mean, they probably have some in the warehouse. What are they gonna do?  Maybe it's an embarrassing admission. Hey, I want to take a break for stacks  And then I know there are a lot of people from the IndieWeb movement watching  We've got Ben and Erin here. It's crazy to waste them  Let's talk we want to talk a little bit about IndieWeb Kevin Marx can explain what that means  I've set up a known and I'll show people my site and show you and and then I have a lot of questions for  Ben and Erin, so we'll talk about the IndieWeb movement  known formerly known as it no  And and Jeff Jeff sorry started on the snacks. What you know, hey, can you wait for one second?  I hope you brought enough for everyone Jarvis  We're talking nature  Nature box snacks Ben and Erin are not  Nature box are delicious healthy snacks delivered straight to your door every month  And when I say healthy I mean it these are nutritious approved never any trans fats HFC's  artificial color artificial flavor, they're delicious  Snacks comes it comes about this time of the day for a lot of us  We just want to get a little something and you don't want to go to that vending machine and buy that candy bar  It's wonderful if the office and our office does has nature box and your home can too  What am I holding up here? PB and J granola?  Peanut butter granola with dried fruit OMG  Pistachio power clusters there are more than a hundred different snacks from nature box praline pumpkin seeds  You can narrow it down by sweet savory or spicy  You can also if you've got special dietary needs specify vegan gluten conscious soy free  And a variety of other choices so you can get just what you want  But that first box is waiting for you absolutely free at nature box comm slash twit if you don't take advantage of this  You're nuts free snacks at nature box comm  Slash twit give you an idea of what nature box would be like for you baked cheddar potato fries sriracha  Whoo sriracha roasted cashews lone star. I think I'm gonna do the PP and J granola today. What are you eating?  Jeff looks like plantains  Yeah, I'm eating South Pacific plantains they have dried fruit the best pineapple rings I've ever had in my life  They are very good. They're ordered a box just of pineapple rings. We love them so much every all the bags are resealable  Which my favorite are the kettle corn?  Those are so good. Yeah, they're so good. I ate a bunch old bag of those  Anyway, I was for said mmm  nature box comm slash twit to start your free trial  Today imagine snacks delivered to your door. What a world we live in  Let's talk indie what is the indie web Kevin Marx you've been you've come on here several times and talked about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But can you can you in a thumbnail describe it? I'll have a go at that. The basic idea is  Going back to the the thinking that started the web of people having their own websites and connecting between those  Rather than hosting everything on a site that belongs to a large company like Facebook or Twitter or even Google Plus  and  This is in in a sense is going back to the the blogging web that we remember from ten years ago  But it's also not pretending these  Sites don't exist but working out how to incorporate them into into this as well  So making sure that you can post things on your own site, but share them out through these social networks and and  Connect things back and forth between the two

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it makes sense to me, you know because well for a couple of things come strike me first of all  Everyone here has pumped content into Twitter to  the benefit of  F Williams and company  But that content is theirs now in ours. In fact, I had I have this morning  I made a request to download my tweets and I'm still waiting for the email from Twitter. They own those same thing with Facebook  Same thing with Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you own them that they actually they say you own them  But they host them Twitter has got a fairly good terms of service on that but the terms of service where it gets sticky is  They don't want you posting to Twitter into other things in parallel. They've got some some weirdness like that  So you have to make sure you post to your site and copy to Twitter  Because if you if you try and do some of the other things then then they will refuse your app and maybe I but I also

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  feel like  Their silos of ultimately their data silos there they're they're they don't interconnect very well  You're you're giving people stuff. They're storing whatever their  Nice terms of service are they rate limit access?  You know, they don't new new developers can't write third-party apps Google Plus to this day doesn't have a right API. They read only  Facebook well, I don't even know what Facebook's policy is about your posts sure feels like they own them  And decide who sees them in a fairly draconian way. So obviously there's a better way. So  Ben word Mueller is here along with Aaron. I'm sorry Miller  Which Richie Richie, I'm sorry and they're the founders of a company called well was ID NO initially, right? Is that Id no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it no was the original name of the kind of open source software that became the core of no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it no was open and  Was that your software Ben or yeah, it was that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so I actually I started building it last year and I brought it into the indie web camp  Which is a regular meeting, you know of the indie web community and Aaron and I started collaborating over that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Kevin told me about it this summer. In fact, we corresponded at the time you needed to use MongoDB  and  So I said good. Let me know what I can use it with my SQL  You can now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that was actually one of the things that we found out early on through some user interviews  when we're reaching out to people who had showed early interest in using the platform and  From talking to a lot of them we found out that a lot of people really wanted to use it  But in order to make sure we had a product that was  Usable by the greatest number of people it needed to be compatible with my SQL. Well, and also switch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ironically you've now in a little bit it kind of contrary to the indie web tenant  You have a hosted version at known at with known comm. Yes, so we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Launching our we're launching the open beta for the hosted version. Yeah  Tomorrow and oh me. Yeah, so we're very excited

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not really contrary unless you're being dogmatic it's an optional somebody else is now hosting it yeah  It's a choice you're making

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  So yeah, and it is all about choice, right?  I mean if you want to run known on your own server  You can absolutely grab our code and do that and it's got all the same features  You've got lots of control if you don't have the technical ability or you don't want to worry about running your own server  You can run it on ours and you can move the site  We're gonna let you move the site so you can start off on our hosted version  Move to your own self hosted version or go in the other direction that solves it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you have to have that kind of starter that's all yeah, it was the same same with with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Workus and think up. Yeah. Well and and by the way, I mean I had an experience with six apart  I used to use type pad which was self hosted  And then they introduced a kind of an easy to use blogging platform called Vox and I loved Vox and I posted everything on Vox  Then they went out of business  I was able to get my content but not my pictures because they were all stored on Vox and so now my blog half of it  From a three-year span has no images because the images are gone. Oh  so  so I have some experience with  Letting others host and I really decided I currently run a WordPress blog  Can't wait to replace it because it's it's the problem I have with WordPress is big. It's clunky  It does everything and I don't need to do everything  What doesn't what is so I'll show you my  Personal known which is very straightforward very simple. Here's the experience that you'll get as a user  It reminds me a little of tumblr. So you have status updates  blog style posts photos  check-ins bookmarks and  Audio you also have which is kind of neat it will you can tie it to  Let me see if I can find that  Twitter  Facebook  You get uses SoundCloud  And there are all these additional features for comics  Let me enable comics events. You've added some Firefox and indie pub  so is the idea you're gonna have a whole variety of content forms and then I've just posting pictures and and  Text and bookmarks. In fact, there's a little bookmark lit that you can click that will create a bookmark lit status update

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I mean the idea is that you know, we shouldn't be limited to the kinds of content that you have on  Facebook and Twitter and so on and you know, those have sort of concealed around the same sort of you know  You've got status updates. You've got longer posts. You've got photos. You've got videos and you've got events and  You know, although those are the common content types part of control is, you know controlling the form of what you post as well  So we want to play with that over time and let people play with that too  And so if you're from if you're on the hurt self-hosted you're gonna be able to get you know community content types  For the hosted, you know, we'll take some of those as well and incorporate them in over time and the same goes for you know  Networks what you syndicate to so, you know in the general case  Yeah, you're you're posting to your own site and you're syndicating to Twitter and Facebook in education  You're posting to your own site and you're syndicating to Moodle, you know different different different different  different  Areas, you know  Have different needs and it'll be able to deal with all of them and because it's an open source layaway extensible platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's been very easy for people to pick it up and start writing plugins for things that they want  So it's easy to get started and get up and running if there's if there's something that you want that isn't there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What form of is plugins written? So the the plugins are PHP and  So, you know we did that  You know because it is incredibly widely installable and so, you know, they're really simple we had a guy  Who picked up known and 24 hours later? He'd written a WordPress plugin, which is you know, totally awesome  And then on top of that because the Indie web, you know  The the technologies that the Indie web community has created are so lightweight really easy to use  You know, it's it's actually pretty simple to put all this stuff together

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when you first look at it and I have showed it to some people they said well that looks just like tumblr  Or how is that different from another blogging platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a lot like owning your own tumblr in terms of the in terms of the interface and I think that's  That's actually great tumblr did  Did a really good job

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With all the other services that you can use it as your  Exactly publish once right once publish multiple times. It's funny because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Installed eight different kinds of tumblr software before tumblr came along because the idea of a tumblr log is predates tumblr  Yeah, and most of them were open source  There's you know similar ideas and I ended up using tumblr because it was just so damn easy. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I was doing. I've always played around with a lot of different open source  CMS's blog platforms tumble platforms all sorts of things in my own space  And that's one of the things that interested me in the Indie web community  Because I had spent so much time fiddling around with these other open source platforms the other people built  But I didn't necessarily have the technical skills to build a platform on my own  And when I met Ben he was working on the id no project and we saw a lot of potential in using that platform  So we like it's been really exciting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so I mean if you can take the you know, like tumblr interfaces like the interfaces that are  You see on the best of breed of the of the consumer web  But actually, you know use that as a really easy to use way to get at all this extra syndication power all of the  Indie web power, you know, we see that as a pretty good way to go  The idea is to make it that simple the reason that you pick tumblr the reason that you picked  You know you use Twitter and so on but actually give you control allow you to tweak it allow you to  Evolve your site over time. We think that's pretty powerful

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your I've got to ask you this as we have the conversation in San Francisco. What's the business model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's there's a couple of different things  I mean first of all, if you've got the technical ability you can just pick it up run the core software on your service  We actually think that most people aren't going to use the hosted solution  Most people aren't going to want to worry about running their own server  So, you know Pat you can start using that for free, but you can actually we're going to be selling higher capacity  subscriptions  We're also going to be selling support subscriptions for everybody  We're going to be selling customizations and for people like universities that want to run it campus-wide and for people who want to run it  In the enterprise, we're actually absolutely going to be selling those  Licenses as well. Yeah, so we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Education as our as our first market and we just had a couple of pilot classes  With the beginning of the fall semester who started up all their students are creating websites unknown  And we've got a lot of people interested in and working with us for the fall to get their students using the software

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who also did you like I gotta ask this is very inside baseball. What did you have to ask?  Did you drop this idea of going after journalists first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We  Happened actually is we decided that because education was so  Incredibly enthusiastic and we've been working with this guy Jim groom at the University of Mary Washington. He's just absolutely a he's like an edtech superhero the  You know we started decided that that was going to be our first  Market, but what's happened is actually really quickly journalists have been coming to us and and seeing this and seeing the publish  You know what Tantac tell it calls publish on your own site syndicate elsewhere, you know, they've seen that model and  You know they want us to integrate it with their ecosystems

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What we're also finding is that a lot of the things we've talked about with journalists and people in the wider media industry  Are actually also things that are applicable to a lot of students and a lot of people in the education space  So working with these education pilots will give us the opportunity to roll out some of these features in conjunction with classes of students and  Eventually, they'll also be well refined and applicable for people in journalism and media as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so I'm just going to show you the  So people understand a little bit better about  What some of the features are I'm now going to put a status update out?  That Ben and Aaron are on the show and I'm going to click Twitter and Facebook to right now of the social networks I've  Federated although I presume there'll be more down the road. There is flicker and many other now when I publish  It's going to publish this status update not only to my known blog  But also to Twitter and Facebook and I think it does a nice job by the way of handling the hashtags  Making it native on native looking on those platforms  If you watch if you look at my Twitter feed you'll see it's there if you look at my Facebook feed you'll see it's there  Although I often hear people say, you know, it's not right to do that  You should you should be posting natively on the platform that you're posting to you should post natively on Twitter  You put natively on Facebook post the kind of posts that are right for those sites  And by the way, we have to say there is no Google Plus because and there's there's the Twitter feed  And I think that looks good. That looks like a native post  So, I mean the the thing about the argument about posting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  differently to different networks is I mean, that's right  I mean you probably a lot of people have different communities on those different networks, but that's totally cool  I mean you can write a post and this is true of any into a platform. You can write a post  And just syndicate it to one of those networks and write another post and just syndicate it to another one of those networks  So I find myself posting a lot of photos that don't go to the same place  So I find myself posting a lot of photos that don't go to Twitter for example  Because not everybody wants to see yet another cup of coffee on Twitter or anywhere fair enough  But I do inflict that on my people on Facebook, for example

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody's Tantec is in the chat room. Hi Tantec. He says he's I'm demonstrating posse

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, yes, what is that published on your own sites and elsewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other thing is it depends on the post type if you've got a status update update like post  Then that makes sense to replicate to Twitter as is right if you've got a longer blog post you do want to send  a summary and  Which would be the title of the post and a link to it to Twitter and also on Facebook when you do that  you want to send it in such a way that it shows up as um,  I can't what they call it  But they have a special post type for that that that shows it like um like a news article or something like that  So they had they they have sort of moved from saying you should post everything in our form to saying actually we want facebook to  reflect  News stories and things like that. They've got a big chunk of guidance on their side about that  so part of the part of the value of um  This is coming up with ways to replicate stuff into these sites in a way that it does look native and make sense  In that form but also points back to the standalone version  So if you look at the the facebook replicate replication of this  And the link says see original to point back to the known version to make it clear that that is that is the source of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that does that here very nicely on facebook for instance where  Uh, it this is what the facebook post looks like and it's got a nice little, you know  It tells you what twit live is but it sources it as from known right there  in fact, if I click known I presume it's going to take me back to my  original post  Maybe not. No, it's going to take me to known

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, if you go back at the bottom, it says see original and that's the link. Ah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I clicked the wrong link. All right, let's as usual. I've used facebook incorrectly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, see original right there. It is actually that link will will eventually post to you post to your site  Now if you self-host what's going to happen is it'll say this was posted via, you know, leo laporte self-hosted  No, whatever you decide to call that and i'll name mine come in as stream

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So i've named mine stream and so things that show up on facebook  Come in as stream for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really like this idea. I uh, i'm a  after my experience with vox i'm a big believer in the idea that  All of your content should live on a site you control. I mean, I guess a hosted site  Is fine as long as you guys guarantee a you're not going to sell out to facebook and b you're going to let me get my data  out of it, yeah  Do  And uh or better yet if you're if you're savvy enough and you've got a server of your own just hosted on your own  Server is is I think the ideal way but it also feels that's a little retro, isn't it?  I mean the web has moved far away from that concept  Has it how'd you mean well  That's not how people do it anymore. Do people even create their own blog websites anymore?  Johnny do  No, your guys do people, you know your guys do real people have a facebook page. I'm on the web  I got a web page. It's called facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I know people and i'm not sucking up to another sponsor here, which which or square space

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Square space, yeah. Well square space is better square space. That is your own site

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's your own site, but it's also easy and hosted right and this is much like with known

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a site and you can get your data out of it. You're not stuck in it  But that's not what most people do most people say I have a twitter page. I have a facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  WordPress is 20 percent of the web as well. You have to remember that a big chunk of the web is posted on wordpress  So people are familiar with this idea. Why is this better than wordpress.com?  Um, because it's um, it's built on these indie web protocols  So it's designed to interoperate from the start  Um, you can make that work on wordpress, but you have to install a lot of plugins  So so part of the point of this is that you um, this is not meant to be a monolithic system  That is just one code base. It's meant to be using a set of protocols that will interoperate whatever site you're running  So i've got a statically hosted site at kevinmarx.com as well as the known one up there  I can interoperate back and forth with this by using these um web mention protocols by using um  the  the sort of  Marking up with micro formats to to point out that this is a reference to another site and so on  And if you look, you know, if you look at the post you just made erin parecki posted a comment on that on his side  He's not using known. He's using his own software. Wait a minute. That's interesting. I didn't know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so that so comments are federated too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, so if you look at the comments basically we post a comment our own site  But that is federated back to you because we use um, what's called web mention to say  Ping your ping your site and say we've mentioned you here's here's the link and you and your site fetches that link and it  As it to the bottom. It's like trackback  It's like trackback, but not ugly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it works. So, okay. I'm looking here. So so this is really cool  So this is on on my on my known page now and this comment here from ben roberts that was done from his

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Site. Yes, that's right  That's neat. In fact, if I click his name, will it pull me to that site? It will the the uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The comment lives on his own site, uh, but it also now lives on your site  So if your site for example goes away for any reason if you decided you don't want one anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He still has that conversation he had with you. Now. This is a little weird because it shows up as a post on his site  um  Which is a little out of context  But that's probably how he set it up, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right the beauty of the indy web everyone gets to do whatever they want for themselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, what we're trying to do is make that as easy as as easy as possible for people to do  So, you know if you are a developer you can use the micro formats  You can use the you know, you can build your own web mention clients and so on  What we do is is you know, try try and make that  Uh as simple as possible. I think it's not quite right as well that it's just sort of a prettier trackback  Uh, I think there's a lot more that's possible with it. You can rsvp to events  You can uh, you know the social actions that you're used to on sites like twitter and facebook  Are possible with this technology and so it is actually and you know, there are a lot of reasons why  Uh, there are better, you know ways to frame this but it is the framework for a more decentralized social web

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, erin erin has a similar  Trackback, but there's more context on his page. So that's up. It's up to them  These are all indy web people who are watching today. Thank you for joining us  Now somebody's already asked well, how do I install this?  Do they go to the idno github? Where do they get known?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So tomorrow, uh on our website with known.com you can be able to just download the installer. Uh,  so  That's something that uh that is going to be available. Uh, we're actually part of an accelerator called matter  Uh demo day is tomorrow morning and why in conjunction with that?  We're going to be we're going to be releasing both, uh, the hosted beta and the installable date beta

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  um then and in fact you sent me that tarball last night and uh,  I have some configuration stuff to do to my site mostly because I I long ago gave over  all control of it to an administrator, but  Once I get once I get bare to give me permission to modify my site again  I'll have that running and i'll probably just now what about the content i've posted on with known  Can I easily move that to my?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so what we're going to do is uh, you know as time goes on, you know  The ambition is basically to give you a button uh to allow you to do that  Because we're in beta it's a little bit more complicated than that  But it's something that you know will help anybody who wants to do it to do  um, so you're not you're not locked up in our service and um, yeah, it's going to be it's going to be a really simple thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To do now it requires a lamp stack, right?  Uh, linux apache mysql and php php 5.4 and about four. Okay. Yeah, pretty typical pretty common

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly the point. Yeah, so it's um, you should be able to install it on anything that supports php in mysql

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And right now your social media connectors and i'll show it right here include twitter facebook flickr foursquare and soundcloud. That's a nice set  Presumably ones you've coded yourself people will be able to add more and also will this list lengthen as time goes by

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It will lengthen a lot of people have asked us for linkedin for example, uh, google plus, you know, you can't do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no right api. What about companies like google that say uh, uh, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what about the google plus pages which have a bit more of an api  So that's that's something that we're going to be thinking about as well  and you know if anybody  From a network that is interested in you know, allowing people from known to to post to it, you know  We're going to be working we're going to be working with lots of lots of platforms

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And for universities that list would it would include the university's learning management system or any platform that the school wants to include there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  News organization. Yes. It's the cms. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, i'm running engine x on top of apache and it's working fine. Does it does it but it does require apache

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can we have had users who have actually installed it on straight engine x. There's a little bit  You've got to manually configure it  But uh, we've got some information up on our documentation page as well and we'll be expanding them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is very early days you ever it's free right now. You intend it to stay free

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so yeah, uh  You're always going to be able to take known and install it for free  But like I say, we're going to be selling support. We're going to be selling, uh,  You know higher capacity, uh hosted versions and we're going to be selling, uh, you know fully supported  Site licenses as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm replacing my blog platform with this as soon as I can because I just I feel like it's simple. It's clean  It's elegant and it encourages kind of this. I love federation. I don't know why but just this idea that well  I have a central spot. That's me  But uh, but I don't that doesn't mean it's a silo. It's it integrates with everybody else. I really like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great job guys. Yeah, kevin other other other members of the indie web ecosystem that you want to list

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Other people doing things with the same they're all in the chat room right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I put in a link to the um, so the best way to get in touch with indyweb, um is indywebcamp.com  Um, that's that page lists. Um the events that we that we organize for this  And it has a prominent link to the irc channel which has people in it 24 hours a day talking about this stuff  Um, but it's also a wiki that has documentation about these different protocols and and what we thought about that  What we're thinking about them and the assumption is we  Have to face meetings. We have discussions in irc and then we write that up on the wiki to document it iteratively  And in fact, there's a meetup tonight in san francisco at mozilla at um 6 30  And there's also meetups in portland and chicago. I think i'd have to actually look at the page to see exactly where they are but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, and I believe the next big indie web camp is coming up in october in cambridge

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cambridge can be Massachusetts. Yes  Yes, um just last weekend there was indyweb camp in brighton uk  um and quite a lot of  New bits and pieces got put together there. There's some people have been have been building a commenting system  That would let you post the comment on your own site  Without leaving the site you're commenting on  Um  That's so that so it's involved with some voodoo involving iframes and registering protocol handlers  But it means that you could click the comment button on your site and I would post write the comment there and get posted to my  site  This is just great  So the nice thing is is that because we've been building in this in this way, we've been trying very hard to make it so it isn't  Um, just one code base just on one big platform  But lots of people building the pieces independently themselves and that acts as a natural check on this stuff getting too complicated  Because if more than one person has to implement it and they're doing on their own sites  Um that stops us from going. Oh, well, we could just add this and this and this and this and going well  What's the smallest thing that we could do to make this work?  Um, and if you look at these protocols, they are very um, sort of neat in that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, there's a lot to be said for building lots of tiny prototypes. It's sort of you know, it's what we do  Uh all of the startups are mad to do it's um, you know  It's what we trying to make a part of our process and it's definitely something the indie web community does very well as well  um, it's a it's a great thing to do I wanted to add actually, you know, I said that tomorrow we're going to be announcing the the  Beta service and the and the download, you know, if anybody does want to try what we've done which you know to emphasize is one  uh indy web indy web platform, but  Uh, you go to with known.com slash beta  You know, feel free to feel free to sign up for a free account great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With known.com slash beta if you want to know more about the indie web  indie web camp dot com  A people focused alternative to the corporate web. Your content is yours. You're better connected. You are in control  This is this is really the the how how it should be how it's supposed to be  It doesn't replace the corporate web. It's just uh, we get to have our own little corner. Yeah, I like it  Erin and ben, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it. Thank you for having us. Yeah, wonderful  Good luck and thank you for helping me get mine set up  I'm excited  You've added, you know since last night you've added features. So I just went back there and I go.

Yeah neat

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh my site is uh  Going to be there for a little while longer, but then i'm going to move it local  leoville.withknown.com and then sign up for the beta with known.com slash beta so you can do it yourself and again  It's hosted. You don't have to uh be mucking around with your database unless you want to  I like to do that kind of thing  Bear said I could he says you won't break anything because you're not attached to anything because we made sure that you were completely isolated  from the rest of the servers  So have at it  Thank you guys. Take care. Thank you. Yes. We got more to come in fact a very big changelog. What are we going to do?  Uh, uh jeff. I jean is not here to do the change. We blew it last time fella  I don't think we should do the changelog  But boy, there's some big changes with google voice and more we'll talk about that as we continue  But first, let me talk about my mattress  You know this show rapidly is becoming about my needs my snacks  my mattress  I got one for henry, too  This is actually a great mattress for a kid going off to college henry, you know, uh is out of the dorms now  he's in a  Place with a bunch of other guys and he has to get furniture and I thought I don't want to do the whole mattress thing  Casper we sent him a casper mattress. It comes in a big box. Look take a look. I have my casper mattress  These are the most comfortable mattresses  Ever this is a queen size. Excuse me queen size mattress that comes in a box  Look at the size of this box and you open it up now. They say open it up  Near your bed. I didn't I'd open it up in the hall front hall, which probably wasn't a good idea  They're foam mattresses with memory phone on the top and they are super comfortable  It's going to take a little getting used to if you're used to those mattresses with springs in it. There's no lumps  It just feels good. See look at that. It's it's opening up  It's firm but soft. I don't know how to describe it  When you have the pillow top  It gives you it it it it conforms to your body and yet there is the firm support that I need for my back  I just love my casper  mattress  Uh casper is a kind of a neat startup  They're slashing the cost of the typical 1500 mattress they cut out the resellers in the showroom  You buy it directly now that I know that makes people nervous. They go. Oh wait wait, but you get a hundred days  to try it  Even ozzie loves our casper mattress. That's lit and strakey on my face by the way  Even lisa loves our casper mattress  It is so comfortable  And because they don't have a showroom they pass the savings on to you  You buy it online completely risk-free 100 days to decide whether you want to keep it 100 days  And if you don't want it, don't worry. You don't have to put it back in the box. I'll send somebody your house to get it  I was wondering well, how do I get it back in that box? Once you take it out of the box?  That's really a one-way trip  Statistically lying on a bed in a showroom has no correlation. I can tell you right now to what the experience is of sleeping  On a mattress casper mattress is made in the usa only 500 for a twin  950 for a king king  And uh, you're gonna save 50 if you go to casper casper sleep.com  Slash twig and using the promo code twig. They'll save you 50 and not only that but for every 50  For every mattress that you buy they will donate 50 to child's play, which is a great group that helps  needy and sick kids  casper  sleep dot com  Slash twig you'll know when you see that what I can't read it's too small what chad just speak to me talk to me chad talk to me  casper sleep dot com slash twig  Using the author code  Twig you'll save 50 bucks off and they will send 50 dollars to child's play  um, I just I  In fact, i'm gonna have some nature box on my casper mattress and then my whole world will be complete  So they said they sent you one you should get one jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd love it one. They just they they offered to send me one, you know who would like it jake would like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Henry I asked henry because he was home over the weekend. I said did the mattress come he said yeah  I said you I wanted you to do a vine  Of you opening the mattress. He said well, we didn't do that. But I said do you like he says I love it  And henry's finicky he would not I get the so I got him a mattress in my house when he was staying with me  And he says I don't like it. He wouldn't sleep at my house and he's on your mattresses. It's too hard  He loves the casper. So I get that's why I got a casper for our guest room  I got a casper for henry. We got caspers ever. I wish I could take one with me to hotels. I would go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In berlin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was it was plan wood the hotel mattress is the worst ever  They really are  Oh, yeah, i'll shave with harry's shave  Cream in my casper mattress eating snacks from nature. I I use harry's too. Yeah  We're rapidly becoming a lifestyle network  That was always kind of my goal by the way, I didn't want to do technology ads because then with technology ads  There's a little bit of the the ideas  You know there maybe is a conflict of interest because then you can't report on the company, but if it's casper mattresses and harry's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shaving and nature box technology is lifestyle way back when when I worked with condé nass when I was at the same company  Yeah, um my proposal for what to do about wired magazine at the time was to make it a lifestyle magazine

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because that's what condé does there's there's well think about it. This is what's happening with technology. It's no longer a niche  Or as you would say kevin you kent of berghien's  niche  It is I get criticism all the time for saying niche  That's the american way to say it. We're in america. Okay, you're probably that probably that day  in the niche that we're in  It isn't a niche because it's technology is now everywhere  Everybody uses it. It's a part of our lives. So how can you say this is a specialty? It's not  All right moving on I do love this uh with no are you you are using this at all  Kevin or do you have something else you want to do with the  I really like this known  We've lost kevin. He doesn't he's just looking. Oh, oh, sorry  We he went to sleep on the mattress commercial I know what happened I was chatting to the chat room

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, I love this known stuff. I really do. No, I think I think it's it's very good  I mean, i've i've been i've been doing indy web snap on kevin marx.com  But that was a statically hosted site, which means that i've got to do a lot of it by hand  Yeah  So not all the pieces get get built as quickly because it's I have to do it myself and the nice thing about known is  It means a lot of these protocols are built for me by by ben and by other people working the open source project  Yeah, and it just makes this stuff this stuff work. I can't do it. So is it using

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rest and it's you know, kind of ap well-known apis or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, um, it's it's basically it's it's pretty they're pretty much all rest apis  um, there are some there's some subtleties that we can probably go into another time if you if you  Bring people on about auth  Because there's this thing called indy auth that lets you authorize your own domain by using the logins from twitter and facebook and so on  right, um  Which means that you can you can prove that it's your domain and that you can prove that you're connected through another service  Um, so that that means that if you use that you can use that to authenticate posting  To your own site from somebody else's site, for example  So there's there's a bunch of subtle stuff like that going on, but each of these pieces have been built  As a standalone component and then wired together to build other things. So we have the idea of  Um web mentions which we discussed which is if I link to you  And then I look on your site for your web mention  Url and then I send a post to that saying I just linked to you. Here's the URL of my post  And then you can go back to look at that post and see that's the thing that puzzles me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That seems complicated this kind of federation that's there's that micro pub and indy auth is that so so there's there's there's straightforward different bits

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This here so indy auth is when you want to author authenticate that you own a site and and so that a service can post to it  Micro pub is an endpoint that lets you post to your own site  And uses indy auth to prove that it's you  and then  Web mention is this i've written a comment on your site and here's a link to it. Um, and each of these  Um, you know, they're all fairly straightforward services  But you can couple them together to do interesting things and the nice thing is because we've had we've got multiple implementations of these by different people  we've been  We've been several which are open source some of which aren't  Some of which are services that that other people run  There's a there's a web mention service that I use on my static site that will detect web mentions and post them in line there  so if you go to um kevinmarx.com and scroll down to the bottom you'll see there's web mentions there even though it's a static site because  I've got some javascript that's calling a  Service that someone else has written to absorb the web mentions and present them for me  So there's there's the ability to do yes  You see down the bottom there those those web mentions and comments have been pulled in from um other people's sites because they've  Um, because i've got a link in the head that points to a web mention service that runs on app engine  So there's a there's a there's the ability to build with these components independently and plug them together into different sites  Um and known is known as this sort of wraps up a set of protocols that we've developed collectively over  Three years or so in in indyweb and gives you a service that does that directly  Um, you know, there are wordpress plugins that we do on wordpress as well  There's a set of you know, well known ways to do this so other people can add these things  But the point is to make sure that they're um  They're not monoliths. They're well defined. Um point integrations that you can do incrementally and each one you do add some value to your site

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um  I feel like this um is really great and cool and I also wonder will anybody get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, I think  It was well one of the interesting things with this was um  Getting my son set up on this because they're both off at university and they wanted places to post stuff and they have you  They're in some ways. They're the target that ben and erin were talking about for university students  and  You know as with any user testing what asked the questions they asked were very interesting because their reaction was  Oh, this can post to facebook. I'm wary about things that post to facebook because i've been bitten by those before  Taught me through what this actually does. Oh, okay  It posts exactly what I say and does what I want. I can see where I might use that right and then my  My elder son was like, oh it posted soundcloud. That's really useful because I make mixes  Um, and I want to post those to soundcloud  Right, the problem is sometimes soundcloud will take them down because of what he's mixed together  And so having a copy on his own site will be really nice for him. So there's  There's a set of issues like that that um  The thing you said about losing the stuff you've had on on on some content silo that's an experience more and more people have  There's there's you know, there's a running joke about it  About a wonderful thing just happened. We got bored and all your content's going away. Yeah, it's happened again and again  And you know, yahoo is a serial offender here  Google does this too facebook does it too lots of the companies buy these buy these little startups shut them down and take  Their engineers and get them to work on their stuff instead

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, so vox was a really good experience. I loved vox. It was kind of like this but because it wasn't open  Uh when ben and mean had decided to shut it down  Boom, i'm gone. My blog is gone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And all your your ios now get us some new sites. Yeah  Because they sold the domain as well. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's right they did didn't they come to think of it they made more money from that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, actually this that's this there's a fun there is um, do you remember upcoming?  Outcoming.org. Yeah upcoming so upcoming had went through this process bought by yahoo  bought by yahoo  Um, yahoo decided to shut it down  but they um  Andy bow who founded upcoming bought the domain back from yahoo and is reviving it. I love that  So does he have the old data?  He has the old data which is getting for the internet archive  And he's setting up new day. He's he's a bit busy because it's xoxo conference this weekend, right?  Which it also doesn't matter because it's an invite. It's an invite event upcoming. Yeah. Yeah, so old invitations who cares but  Still that's great. Well old events old events are interesting  Historically, you know  We organized a lot of events through upcoming and it will be it's nice to see those old events. I guess so  Yeah, um and what you know what I hope to do is  I showed you certainly some of the indie web events that we've posted on  Our sites here and and they have the distributed rsvps. So I send you I post an event on my site  Um, you post an rspp on your site and that shows up on my side  Um, so that stuff would be great to integrate into into upcoming. Yes  We've already got gateways that bridge it over to facebook, but it would be really nice to have something that does it natively  so i'm hoping to um  Chat to andy about that, but I suspect it's gonna be a bit busy over the next over this weekend

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's but your soundcloud example was a really good one. I I would love to post audio on soundcloud  This is a better way to do it if I do it in with known  Uh, it posts to my blog. I can I continue to own that wave file  But it's then cross-posted to soundcloud where the audience is mp3. I hope yes or whatever. Yeah, you know, yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh god, I was afraid of my son was up. Yeah, I think I think those are still geeky concerns  I think I think the two consumer  Abilities for this are one  The convenience that I can I can choose let's imagine. There's a mobile app  To post whatever I want wherever I want it from one place. Yeah, there's no mobile interface to this yet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a mobile web thing hang on sorry, there's a mobile web interface there isn't a mobile app  All right, so I can use a browser because this because it's been written by people who understand the web  Um, you can just use a browser on android and that works pretty well  It's it works well for posting photos and posting text  The web ui for posting mp3 files is a bit tricky because you have to have already recorded it  And there isn't a direct record button, right? But you can you can post that the second appeal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think is is is not so much that you're going to save it against a site going down because people are fickle  I don't think that's the big deal. But I think instead that you have your kind of portfolio place  This is my stuff. This is all my stuff in one place as a presentation of me  And that's going to require some subtle as you just pointed out about having a comment there that's on the context  They're going to learn a lot of how to do that. But I think those two things together are consumer propositions  But but the business irony here is that only works in a sense if it remains independent if facebook buys their butt  Then you lose a lot of the benefits of it being in a indie anymore  um, right  but if you can get some investment to make this big on consumer proposition and make it the interface to all the social networks and  And the place to present my entire personality to the web. I think that has consumer well, or even even more than that if

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Companies like square space and wordpress see this see the value in it and decide to participate  Then square space could do that you stay on your square space site, but you were able to now be part of the federated  Internet, um, that's even a better scenario. So yeah, so you're right  I just launched this on uh on chrome on my android phone  And I logged in so I get it's it first of all, there's a it's totally mobile responsive  But I can now post effect if I I think I could take a photo. We'll see  Uh on my phone. Yeah  And uh and post directly from my phone  To the indy web. Well, that is cool  Um, I like that  So this so this post this is going to post to not only to with known but also I could post to twitter facebook and flickr  same photo  Love that  So you're right. In fact, this is also better kevin, isn't it because it's the web the web is the web. It's not an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Yeah, and the the challenge is making sure that it's um  You know that this stuff it does integrate well on the web and part of that is that  Not all of the web stuff is ready yet  Like the the web ui for recording sound is kind of broken right on on the on the mobile thing  So part of what we're gonna have to do is go and lobby the browser  Um developers on ios and android to say hey, you know that feature that's supposed to let you record an upload a file  How about you actually implement it rather than pretending to implement it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but so that's why I want to throw some weight behind this  I think this is and behind indie web because this I really believe like  That I believe that this is this is important to the future of a free and open web  So thank you for doing this and and I wish I had the coding skills to do this  But thanks to people like ben and erin who do  We get the right benefit of it. That's that's that that is the very yeah  By the way, if you go to a lot of sites on the internet today, there's an internet slowdown  Uh going on if you go to my site leoville.com for instance, uh, you'll see I do I chose to do the little  Tag in the upper right hand corner. It says protect internet freedom defend and net neutrality  if there were  Fast internet slow lanes, you'd still be waiting for this site to pop up  And so you may see that all around the net today see that chat in the upper right hand corner of my site  Protect internet freedom. You can tell I haven't posted on my upper right hand there but do but up  And and you'll see a bigger one on a lot of sites  I went to a site this morning  That had a big banner right covered the whole page a takeover  Um, you know what's unfortunate about protests the the sopa protests going dark everybody did it  But you can only go to the well so often like once apparently right  Because here we are. This is only the third time we try to do an internet-wide protest and nobody's doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So  Well, I think that the the the threat is a little vaguer right now until man  It's very this is the right time to put pressure on the fcc  This is the right time to be heard as a community in an industry, right? But the consumer threat isn't as imminent  It's not reached isis level yet, right? Maybe that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is I remember now it was beer advocate. So if you go if you show my screen up  Too late  Don't do it again. Anyway, so it's doing a little bit of a bigger one  Um, and then it says sign our letter to lawmakers tell lawmakers protect protect internet freedom defend net neutrality  They make it very easy. So this before you get to be your advocate  You get this big pop-up  But again, not you know, you see it on reddit. You'll see it on a few sites, but it's not not nearly as widespread  Um, here's the uh, see I don't see it on like yeah, they do a little one on uh on reddit  It's over here in the right hand corner  Um, all right  I think we've done our ndweb good deed for the day  Let's talk about something bad a bad deed for the day. Are we worried about this?  4.39 million gmail usernames and passwords published  Google says no evidence his system were compromised. I saw this last night. I thought oh, yeah  A russian bitcoin coin forum  Uh says they have almost five million  Uh passwords company says it's not from a security breach  We have no evidence our google says we have no evidence our systems have been compromised  But whenever we become aware that accounts may have been we take steps to help users secure those accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if there are five million, how else would you get them?  That's a lot are there really five million usernames and passwords or not the forum downloaded it and my email was in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was it yep, and was the password correct so the password was one that I had had about two years ago  And I don't use it anymore luckily on google on google. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, it's about that's what the next web is seeing a quick analysis of the text file shows it includes mainly english spanish and russian accounts  But it seems to combine older lists accumulated over a longer period of time  So it could be a link to hacks of sites unrelated to gmail was it your google a password only chad  Yeah, it was only mine was it hadn't you hadn't used it anywhere else, right?  The site has pulled the passwords off luckily I had semi good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Password this this goes to the discussion about payments earlier  Can we not just assume now that there are going to be data breaches full stop?  And we have to have systems that operate with that that makes that meaningless

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, it's going to get breached. That's one of the things google said if you have two factors  This is one another reason you should turn on two factor. Yeah, because even if they got your password, it's not enough  Um  Does anybody read russian  Google does uh  Oh wait a minute. Here's an american flag. I'm showing the site where you isly is  Uh is leaked.com, but let me click the american flags see if it's if it translates  I think it's I think you enter in your email here  And it will tell you if your email was in the database of uh hacked emails  I believe that's that's what it's going to do. It's pretty slow right now is leaked  Probably because I just gave out the address is leaked.com  Google says there wasn't a hack  I don't know what to make of that if it really was your google password jad, obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well the thing is google doesn't store them in the clear. They store them cryptids sorted properly  So if they've got this they've either done a decryption  Run on a password file or they fished it in some way or want you to enter it from somewhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they fished it. Maybe it's fishing. Yeah, if google's storing your passwords encrypted and salted  Yes, which google is then there's you know, so just if you listen to security now, you know all this but  Many a surprisingly large number of sites just store your name and password in text  So if that data that file which is not necessarily visible in public  But if somebody could get into their systems and steal it they'd have it  Better is to use some sort of encryption technology often as a hashing  Technology and what they'll do is they'll hash it in a known way  And then when you log in they'll hash what you offer in the same known way and if the two hashes match  uh, then  That's the right password. That's a little bit better. But the problem with hashes is something called rainbow tables  It's possible if you can figure out how the hashing has been done  To create a table of possible  Results and in effect a table of backwards backwards unhashed stuff. So  There's an even better way to store hash passwords and that's with salt  Kevin you better explain that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um, that means you um  Before the hash you add something to the the password so that it's um  Even if you reverse the hash you you still get some some garbage that doesn't tend to the password. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, and sometimes they double or triple salt them. Yeah  And that's and that's pretty effective if you do that  It would it would be impractical for a hacker even if he owned the database to crack all the passwords in it, right?  Unfortunately, people use bad passwords sometimes and if you figure out one like if if okay  So here's what's happened in some cases the the hacker gets email password and password hint  And some people in their password hint will write password equals  password  And then they look at the hash and they go. Well, I know that hash equals password and now they've got everybody who use the same  crappy password  Yeah, so that's another so if you but if you use a good strong password and they're salting it and hashing it you're probably all right  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google does that and absolutely and and what's um, but what may this may be is it may be like the  Image leak this may be a compilation that someone's put together over a long period of time  And then has leaked it in one go  So that the image leak last week was very much that it was it was a set of people who've been trading these things back  And forth right? Um, and somebody in that group leaked a chunk of it  And this this looks look at looking at the reports of this. It sounds like these are  Email addresses and passwords that have been phished or collected or used over a long period of time  That the people in the chat room are saying oh, yeah, there's I've it has some old password of mine in there  um  so  This may be some hackers cache like that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has rolled out the long-awaited  Terrifyingly anticipated  Integration between hangouts and voice they haven't eliminated voice  yet  Um hangouts, but the good news is hangouts can now make voice calls your voicemail can go into hangouts  You need to get the latest google hangouts and that's being rolled out slowly. I hadn't gotten it this morning  But I was able to find the apk  Don't recommend people do that  um  But I I did it for you so I could talk about it and it's pretty cool. I made a phone call  Voice quality is quite good  As always with google voice, there's a slight bit of more latency than on a regular point-to-point phone call  But I found it not bad at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I use it I use it. I tend to use it from the browser using the nice mic like I have yes  I do all the time. Yeah, so i've got a long call to make i'll do that. So we had the open rights group  Um the advisory board meeting this morning  Which is a call to the uk that lasts an hour and a half  And so I could sit there at the computer and and have the conversation and and do it this way and it works quite  Well for that, um, I haven't spent much time using google voice  on the phone but  Um the value again there is when traveling because it means that your number can can replicate to somewhere where you have wi-fi and you can  Make calls. Yeah, so i've i've  I've used it there when i've gone to the uk and my bank has done something stupid  Um, and I have to call their 800 number  So you can't call 800 numbers us 8 numbers from the uk  But because my google voice number is an american number I can call it from that so there's there's a set of  Uh, like arbitraging around the brokenness of the phone system that the voice makes very useful  So it's nice to see that they're still supporting it and keeping that running the downside on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that hangouts is becoming more and more of a beast?  Yeah, it is  It was already too big for just using for sms's but now it's got a but it's kind of cool because if you're so I did  You know  There's a couple reasons to use hangouts if you're using android wear device hangouts allows you to reply from your watch  Not all of the sms apps let you do that evolve will do that that's kind of nice but also now when I choose a contact  I can choose whether I want to hang out them sms them or call them  And that's kind of nice too  Much like facebook messenger  Yes, facebook messenger will do that too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they've they've had a um a call that is that is a void call. They've skype. They own skype. They're partnered with skype

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was it was it was it?  So that's kind of nice. I mean  But i'll use hangouts, uh, I guess for my sms app until it finally I it's it's so it feels so big compared to just  Playing all sms app  There's so much stuff in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's because they've got hangouts on air and all these other things in there  So I I did I did a hangouts on air with somebody last week  It was it was like wow, where did all this extra ux come from and why is it so hard to use? Yeah, that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unfortunately, that's the name on the other hand. I like  Adding all these new features on the other hand. It's it's uh, it's I kind of like the facebook model of separating everything out  Into single apps that do one thing. Well the old linux old unix point of view right do one thing. Well, and then pipe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's this you're sounding like you're talking indy again  That's right. No, but that's I think the the separation there is um  I think the app separation is driven by notifications

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um and permissions because the permissions list gets really long

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So but so hangouts and facebook messenger have a similar set of permissions and sort of notification model  Um, whereas you don't want that you wouldn't really want that wrapped up in your your facebook app and your google plus app  Um because they you get a different set of notifications from them and you have a different idea of what those are for  Because one is interpersonal communication and one is publishing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing that's nice is hangouts now can do images  Or voice can now do images because the text messaging and voice was did not support s uh mms. It was only sms  Oh, so they fixed that. That's good. So now  I can send photos locations rich text messages  Uh using hangouts via sms. I believe that's the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's yeah, because that was that was clunky before if somebody sent you an image it would give it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, it's 2.3. Is that right? I think it's version 2.3. So you can look in hangouts and see you you'll it  The update started going out today. It'll be over the next few days  Um, if you look at help and feedback  Uh, it's two point my current version of hangouts is 2.3.7  Make sure you have that version. It's 2.3 or later. I think all right  Uh, I had 2.2 this morning and I actually found an apk somebody posted on google plus and took a did a very stupid thing  Which was downloaded and installed it  Which means now the nsa has everything in my phone  Wait till it best thing to do wait till google pushes the update you'll get it soon  Google is also putting a password generator. I think it's a good idea a password generator in chrome  If you have chrome canary  Uh, you will have now the ability to generate a password. This is actually I think coming from the chromium project  um  Yeah, I think so. It's a good idea. It's a phipps 181 compatible automated password generator  Spits out a strong and pronounceable  password  You do have to use canary and then enable a couple of flags

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh  This should replace then this would replace one pass you're saying no because it doesn't remember it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't recommend. Oh, it's just a generator. That's a generator. Well, google will remember passwords, but I don't I mean chrome will remember  Yeah, but I  I'm not crazy about the idea of the browser remembering the password frankly  I I prefer to keep my passwords encrypted

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends how they do it yeah, the value is that it lets you do it between machines, right? Yeah  It's a you're making a convenience versus security trade-off there as ever right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, uh, I I still suggest using last pass but hey, it's a step. It's a step forward. That's good  We're doing the changelog just in case you didn't know so we just didn't want to let anybody know  Because then they messed it up compare it to gina who does it so  So  And finally google play music. I'm sorry movies and tv on ios lets you download and play videos offline  I don't think you can do it on android. Can you I don't think so, but can you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, sure. I do it all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then you can also do it on chrome so I can do it on my chrome book. Apparently you could not do it on ios  I didn't know that didn't either

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you're an ios user, that's how I watch movies and shows on long flights such as the one I just left

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so yeah, so do you is it like a pin or is it actually say explicitly download this movie

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little pin. You click on the pin. Okay music play music pin. Yeah, it's like music. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love I love google play music and I do do that for the trips. I download  beautiful music to listen to  Google has unveiled the cartographer  It's indoor mapping backpack. Everybody ought to have one of these  Uh where everybody's useful as glass  Uh, only 10 times heavier did I say 10 a thousand times heavier  You wear the backpack you walk through the building the floor plan automatically generated in real time  The wearer also uses a tablet to add points of interest

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a bit it's  What's the what's the look at this jed the version of an android tablet the map 3d map spaces  What's that called again an android tablet the 3d map space, you know what i'm talking about old chat room

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe still photo you mean the software that did it or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's there's it. There's the project  Tango tango. Yes, thank you needles remembers project tango

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank give that boy a popsicle

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  potentially do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Atap the project tango tablet  Is it  I don't remember. I must have been on vacation when they came out with this  You know, the idea is you have mapping devices that you can map the whole world. Everything should be mapped  Right. Okay  You sure project tango wasn't an april fools joke?  No, no  There it is  You sure it wasn't an april fools joke  All right, is it like an augmented reality kind of a thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a  It's to map inside as the buildings. Okay. Well this must replace project imagine how blind people could I think it's working in conjunction with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the conjunction. Okay. All right. Well, yeah, they've got multiple ways of doing this  So they've they've had you know, the street view cars and they had street view bikes and then had street view backpacks  Um at one point they had a service  Was part of google local where they'd come to your business and photograph it for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, third parties do that. We did that with our with the twit studios  You can if you search for twit llc on google maps. You can go inside and tour around

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that. Actually, so this is all I think these are all variations on the theme of that  How do we get better indoor data inside? Yeah  Yeah, because you know google maps has that for certain buildings. It has interior maps  Things like that, but they obviously won't walk through as well as as just mapping

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Digitize the world  By the way, we were talking about hashes. There is an encryption technology sha1  That is known bad. It's been cracked. It's not very it works, but it's not very strong. Google has decided to remove support  for certificates encrypted with sha1  From chrome  Uh, this is really interesting google has seems to have decided  That they can use their immense weight their immense clout  To get people to do something that googled in its infinite wisdom thinks is right  Remember a couple of weeks ago. They said you'll get a better search ranking if you are using secure http  Well, google says most of the web is is using an insecure algorithm 90 of websites  That use ssl use sha1  For their certificates  Uh, unfortunately, it's dangerously weak has been for some time gets weaker every year. There's a replacement sha2  Google announced if you use chrome  You're going to start seeing warnings for sites that say they're secure  But aren't the first set of warnings will hit before christmas and we'll keep getting more stern  Google's turning into like a  A headmaster or a vice principal or something  You're not secure over the next six months eventually even sites  With the sha1 certificates that are don't expire till 2016 will be given a yellow card  Sha has got to go.

It's the largest  Uh consumer electronic show I guess anywhere and the reason I was there was to speak  They never had a program before they just had the honey. Oh cool  So but I went up and and wandered as best my knee my aging knees could take me through the show  And right above us in the the city box  Uh was the samsung and and you know, just amazing stuff samsung has entire lines  Devoted to retail hotels. Yeah restaurants hospitals airlines schools  I mean, it's really quite amazing. They're looking at that as as  Companies that have service touches with public they want to be there and so they do some phenomenal things in the refrigerators are great  And this and that why do they have to keep on ruining the phones with all the garbage?  Ah, that's the only thing that frustrates me about them because they do need stuff  I touched the the phone with the thing on the side. Yeah the edge absurd think yeah, it's in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like that's a very it's innovative. It's an interesting idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really is it really is it kind of works and you kind of roll it around and I kind of like that  And they have a gigantic watch ridiculous. It is like wearing an iphone on your wrist  uh, but but samsung does some really really neat stuff and it's impressive and and um

I love seven seven was perfect  Yeah, uh, but it's that new fast tegra k1  Um, which is a really nice processor by the way, if you're going to get an iphone  The reason to get the iphone is this processor is just blazingly fast if you like games on a  A five and a half inch it'd be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the tegra that's the same chip that's going into the new chromebooks, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, unless i've got this completely modeled but I think so and then there so we know they're going to keep the nexus name  Which is is good. That means there probably will be a nexus six  Uh rumors say probably this year, but we don't know  Uh, maybe it will be time to uh coordinate with the release of l

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Oh, we don't know the time. My problem is i'm not you  So I would I would have you don't like changing your phones do you  Well, that actually is a pain in the butt  But but besides that it's also just kind of a money thing that after ever having just bought the one plus I can't really justify buying both  The moto x and the nexus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, look at this. This is a tweet a tweet  From the android twitter account of a nexus. No one's ever seen with almost an edge to edge  screen  Big phone it looks pretty big. I would guess that's five and a half  Um  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could be a mock-up. We don't know. I saw the new note four also. That's big, isn't it?  Well, no, that's it's the same size as this thing. I'll put this phone right over it and it's the same really but the screen's bigger  Much notes felt so huge more pixels

It's nice  Um, the nexus six would be five and a half inches according to the rumor mill  Um  I don't know maybe larger maybe even larger  The thing is it's all rumors. You don't know and the x1 is here. Well, it will be here sometime this month  They say they I also like  Unknown oh wait a minute. No, they did say a price. It didn't say the price. It's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you have the turbo charger, which is also nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know all qualcomm chips support this and I think almost all  uh  Flagship models have have this high speed charging. I don't I didn't know that. Yeah, it's not clear  If they're talking about something different from the qualcomm high speed charging  Got it  They're claiming you can half charge it in 15 minutes if that that's pretty darn fast  By the way, the I think the htc one has that in the qualcomm 801, but you'd have to buy a higher power  Dongle for it and you will also with his charging speed is the real issue. I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So can I say on the show how I drove the um,  Um bmw electric car. Yeah, you said you liked it. I did I talk about that, right?  But it's it's it's the speed of charging that's gonna be the issue. It's not so much the capacity

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's how fast you can recover. Well and and to do it with a car you have to put a 240 volt  That too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Yeah, nobody nobody goes to see theater  Oh, no, none of they do but you can see any disney movie on stage. They got them all. Yeah  But but you know, I recommend actual theater because that's um, I think the curious incident of the dog in the night ask  Ask your son about that. Oh, I see what he thinks about that. I think he's I think he's putting a play on so  Probably won't be in time for you  That's interesting. There's a lot of good student theater as well that i'm finding out through him  the other things that are touristy um  There are you know, there's lots of obvious ones  The ones that are sort of subtle and different is if you go to it won seven olivier awards. Is that a good thing?  Yes, that's a good thing. I would see that i'll go and see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Including best new play  Yeah, yeah

It can be interesting  It can be very dialing can be just them like reading out their constituents complaints. Yeah, but but it's it's it's it's  It's worth visiting the parliament building that way. What else I hear they're good walking walking tours are fun  Yeah, there's the the the nice thing about london, especially if you get the weather is that it's a very walkable city  um, yeah, you get you get sort of  You get sucked into the tube because the tube connects everywhere that sounds painful  If the thing is you look at the tube map you go  Oh, we should go there by by going this line and then this line and if you actually look on the physical map you go  Oh, I can just walk there in three minutes. Yeah, and actually there's a map that i'll recommend  We're staying in mayfair. So we're kind of central which is i'll say you're fairly central. But but the thing is that there's  London has lots of like like many like any real city has lots of different neighbors that are from bits in  Yeah, um, so getting a sense of the different neighborhoods is nice mayfair these days can be a bit empty  Because lots of people from overseas have bought flats that they don't live in. Oh dear  So there's a certain um, it's it's fancy and it's nice and there's some some historic buildings  But there's not a lot of life there compared to other bits of london where people actually walk around and live  Yeah, i'm looking forward to it.

Transcript:  I don't know if I got a notable point that seemed too big and this this now seems quite normal get used to it. Don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't understand that objection because if you look at a classic telephone, it's eight inches long and has a thing that goes to your ear

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's big aren't they and all you can do is talk to it. Cool. You can do is talk to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whereas this thing is like well, i've got this on my ear, but the microphone is somewhere around my cheek  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not big enough you're right  These should be bigger and they should wrap around and they should have a shoulder thing  Oh god, I remember those yes  Well, that's not a surprise and I you know  It's very interesting because apple really made a big jump for this. This is an example of tim cook  Saying i'm gonna do my own thing because steve jobs. It was pretty clear. He did not like the idea of a big screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He could have done it earlier, right? What did they do? But they did it with the ipad. That was the thing  They decided there were two there were two good sizes, right? Um and and steve  Followed down your fingers joke and all that stuff  Um, and they're still kind of living in that interesting about this announcement was watching the rea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the design thinking for ios is still in that world  There are there are small things in your hand that you have to use with one hand with your thumb  Then there are big things that you hold out here and read that are that are ipads and that mental model of that dichotomy  Define the design thinking for ios  Such that you build an iphone app or you build an ipad app, right?  But you don't think of it as a continuum and now they have to think it was a continuum because there's a continuum of sizes  in the iphone line  um, and the other and the other reason that that that you needed that split was that this screen was  320 by 480 and couldn't really show much  And the other one was a was a full-size screen, whereas now this screen has more pixels than the original ipad does  um  And so thinking about everything in pixel terms makes much less sense  Um, because you can't you can't see the pixels anymore  um, so I think we're we're we're going to have a transition into people designing in a much more  um vector based smooth way and having things very  Depending on how big is the thing how big is the thing you're holding and how big is your finger are the two sort of key variables?  As opposed to is this a specific size is this is an ipad or an iphone and to some extent web design has gone that way already  We've had a lot of responsive design and thinking about  Um, how do we make this the same site work in different places and how do we add stuff in for the bigger screens?  um, I think that  That will come into its own  In the broader design community on ios as well where they've been able to say up to now  Oh, there are two things there are phones and there are there are ipads and they're they're different and we should do separate things for them  And they realize that there is actually now a continuum across there  Um, and that will map to and that may map to making things work more smoothly across different platforms as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you know haven't spent that much time thinking about it. I just like to  I'm old. I want to see bigger pictures on my screen and I just think using it as a camera  It's going to be great now the burke has made some mock-ups and you'll be interested to hear this jeff  Because you have a one plus. This is the five the six plus is almost identical  in size  Yeah, boy is that and it's much thinner and then uh, we call this the iberk six and the iberk six plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Half of san francisco has made cardboard iphones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I see lots of people do this, you know why because you're trying to decide should I get the little one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should I get the biggest little one compared to the present iphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh god, it's a bad. It's not much bigger  It's actually thinner  They've got they made it thinner. Do you have an iphone for us?  Oh, actually john's bringing me one. That's cool  That's an iphone 5. All right, same size  So I know it's a lot bigger. So oh, that's a lot. Yeah, that's the five  Then on top of that's the six and then on top of the below that is basically the six is like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  nexus five sized and the and the six plus is um  One plus sized. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because this is the yeah, there's the six on top of the one plus  It's almost identical in size to the one plus  That's that's actually encouraging because I really like this and it's got a better camera. It's got uh, optical image stabilization  So I think this would make a great, you know way to shoot movies 4k movies as you're holding it like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They had two nice things. They had obstetrics and they had um  Um  Autofocus at the chip level. Yeah phase detection auto focus built into the sensor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the eyes for to my knowledge the only phone that does that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So those those are both very cool and  That that combined with actually having a 1080p screen should mean that you can do some very nice stuff  And also as they said 240 fps  Yeah, slow mo super slow mo. Yeah at 720p, but still that's still very interesting  Yeah, it sounds like a really nice camera, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The you know, I have no trouble with the hardware  I don't know if I i'm so spoiled by android and its customizability  That I don't know if I can go back to that grid of icons. I just don't know if I can live with that  It's kind of limiting  Yep  So kevin I share your uh conundrum. What do you buy what right? Okay. I'm not in your position  I my this phone is only about a month old  But still I have to have a line info so my  I can get you an invite you want an invite? We'll get you an invite. Will somebody tweet kevin marks an invite?  Oh, that'll be nice. Yeah. Yeah for i'll tell you for okay if you include the price the price  This is a great idea. Yeah 350 bucks for this but that's 64 gigs  Now how much would you pay  So my actually my tip is something for anybody is the three of you will have one plus one phones  This is actually a really nice case. I don't know if you noticed I have a case on it  I'm, not crazy about that weird texture on the back there. So it's actually nice. This is a clear case. It's eight bucks  Um, it's uh, it's kind of hard soft rubber  So to protect it against drops it's from ring key r i n g k e  They call it their fusion case fits beautifully  Does not get in the way i've been able to use the chargers the earphones without  Problems, although you'll you'll have to have earphones that have a little bit of a depth to them because it does it's a little thick on the  Top, but i've been very happy with this and and I don't normally carry cases  This one's so unobtrusive and invisible that I like it  In fact, I hope they make one for the iphone 6 plus because this is exactly what I need  It's called the one one plus one case. It's available from  amazon for 799 and includes a screen cover which I you know a screen  Protector, which I don't use so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because i've been using this one for um  The nexus 5 which is tech 21 which is very similar. It's like transparent kind of a clear case, but reinforcing the edges. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
