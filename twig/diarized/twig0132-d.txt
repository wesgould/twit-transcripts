Transcript:  This Week in Google, episode 132,  recorded February 1st, 2012.  The Google Father.  It's time for Twink This Week in Google.  And we're back to talk about Google and the Googleverse  and the cloud and Facebook and Twitter too and all  of that stuff with Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism  at the City University of New York, the author of a great  book, two great books, What Would Google Do in His Newest  Public Parts, talking about life in public.  Thank you for being here, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org,  founder of Lifehacker and the creator of the amazing Think  Up app.  Thinkupapp.com.  You must have been given your association with open  government and the White House excited about the Google  Hangout that the president did.  Was that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was.  I was pretty geeked about it.  In fact, Expert Labs had a conference call scheduled for  around the time the Hangout was supposed to happen.  And I said to Anil, but the president is going to be on  Google+.  And he was like, OK, we'll move the meeting.  So we could all watch.  I thought it was pretty cool.  I was pretty geeked out about it, actually.  You know, I mean, of course, it's an election year.  So we see a lot more engagement on social media networks and  all that.  But it was neat to see the president  interact with real folks, even though it was a little awkward  at times.  And pretty scripted.  Pretty scripted.  But yeah, I mean, the questions were certainly vetted.  And those people all kind of approved.  And they had a moderator from Google.  I mean, that's true.  But at one point, there was a woman whose husband's been out  of a job for three years who really took the president to  task for that.  But then they had a section where they could ask a  personal question.  And she asked him to do a jig on camera.  Yeah, that one I could have done without that.  Yeah, I couldn't have done without that, too.  That was very disrespectful, I thought.  I agree.  But you know, this is what happens when, you know, I mean,  the state of the union address, when real people are involved.  A speech is not interactive by definition, right?  A speech is the president talks to you.  But this was real people talking back.  And I thought there was something refreshing about it,  if a little annoying at times.  Real people can be annoying at times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny.  That is exactly the point where I got a little cringey is when  she asked me to do a jig.  It was almost like dance monkey dance.  It was like, it was.  This is the pre- you're talking.  I understand that because it's a Google Plus Hangout, perhaps  you feel like it's informal.  But this is the president of the United States.  You don't say dance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree.  But you know, I thought he was gracious about it.  He handled he answers questions well, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he was great.  What I did think is this medium suits him well.  And of course, he's done a lot of town halls, which is pretty  much the same thing.  But he was very genuine, very authentic.  I thought he did a nice job.  Jeff, go ahead.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which one was worse, that or Boxer's Briefs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I missed that.  Somebody did next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bill Clinton.  Not bad, Bill Clinton.  MTV town hall back in the day.  Students stood up and asked the president of the United States,  Boxer's Briefs.  And this was before Lewinsky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Boxer's Briefs is a stupid question.  But the problem with dance is there's an undertone that I  don't like.  Got it.  Got it.  Yes, you're quite right.  It feels racist, to be honest.  It's like, hey, you're putting on a show.  Can you dance for us?  It just did not.  I don't think that that's what she was saying.  But it felt like, ooh.  There was, I think, a higher cringe factor in some regards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I mean, he did sing Al Green at an official event.  It's true.  And he handled it beautifully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Instead of taking Umbridge, he said, well, I've sung.  But if you listen to Michelle, I shouldn't dance.  And I thought that was a good way to respond to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's he going to say?  I'm the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't do that, right?  Right.  And actually, that's an interesting issue.  Because using social media brings you down  to the level of the public.  And notice I say down.  Because I do believe that because you're  president of the United States, you deserve a lot of respect.  And you are not of the people.  You work for the people.  And Obama said that, which I thought was good.  I think that that was really good.  But I don't know.  Maybe a president should be populist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, he's the one who talks about the bubble  that Washington is and trying to be more in touch with the people  that he is serving.  So I think it was a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was interesting to see.  And I'm going to see if I can find that picture.  They had a picture on Flickr of the setup  that the moderator at Google, what was his name, Steve,  was using.  Wow.  Pretty nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course you were interested in that setup.  I was very interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's interesting is the magic of TV.  Within the square that you could see, it all looked like this.  But then you go immediately, you go outside the border.  And it's just like all this crap.  And that's what we don't do here.  I thought it was a very traditional TV moment.  The poor guy sitting with all this gear and lights  and all that stuff around him was not very relaxed.  But I haven't seen the president's setup.  I imagine it was equally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the president was in the West Ring, right?  So that was the Google moderator's setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google moderator's setup.  It's not much different from when Obama was at Facebook  and doing a town hall at Facebook.  It's kind of the same idea.  In a way, it is saying it's making a statement  that Silicon Valley and geeks like us  like acknowledging our importance,  Mark Zuckerberg's importance, Google's importance.  But it's not so very different than any other town hall,  maybe even less open than a regular town hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't, but it was a big commercial for Google Hangouts.  I mean, it was the tool.  I mean, that's exactly what the tool looks like, right?  And people who use Facebook don't get to sit down on a stool  with a Zuckerberg in a suit, right?  I mean, it was, you know, it felt much more.  I actually kind of wanted to see the president  on a regular webcam sitting in front of a regular desk  instead of having, you know,  his kind of nice oval office or setup.  But of course, it makes sense that he was there.  But it felt a little bit like,  oh, this is the president using a tool  that anybody can use and this is what it looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're gonna do another one Thursday with Anish Chopra  and Steve Case, founder of AOL and Gene Sperling.  It's gonna be focused on Startup America.  Which I think is kind of interesting.  That's Thursday, 5.30 Pacific, I'm sorry, 5.30 Eastern,  5.30 PM Eastern.  So this isn't just a one-off.  And in fact, in some ways, I'd like to see this used more,  not by the chief executive, but by people like Gene Sperling,  who's the director of the National Economic Council.  Yeah.  Anish Chopra, our outgoing CTO.  Those are the kind of people who couldn't really  answer some questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve Grove, who did that,  who really, he started the politics channel on YouTube  and did a tremendous amount of work there.  And now he's doing this at Google+.  We gotta have him on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very nice guy and really built something very impressive  out of nowhere.  And he's not necessarily a news guy,  but he created something that has real news value  across these services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're also using, I think, look, it was this,  Obama followed in probably in John Dean's footsteps.  It was Dean, of course, who first started realizing  the power of social media for fundraising.  Obama took it to the top level in 2008,  and then disappeared.  We actually had Clay Johnson on our show last week  on triangulation.  Clay was the responsible for the digital strategy  in the Obama campaign in 2008.  And I said, what happened?  It was a real letdown because we thought that they would  continue this.  And he said, we would have liked to,  but you have to understand when you move into the White House,  you're moving into Windows XP,  you're moving into a situation where technology is backward,  and there are all sorts of reasons why you can't  just start tweeting.  And I think that that's true.  He said, though, that progress is being made,  and you're gonna see more and more and more.  And I would hope in 2012, whoever gets elected,  that we do see these tools used as they are using ThinkUp  for more transparency.  As they use the, you know, the petition, let's face it,  and I think Clay actually implied this.  He said, the petitions are really just a way  of harvesting email addresses.  Don't think, he didn't say this specifically  about the White House petitions, but he said,  when you're asked your opinion, take it from me  as somebody who ran these campaigns,  it's about the email address,  it's about getting you to donate,  it's about getting back to you and saying,  hey, we're so glad to hear your opinion,  and your opinion is so valuable to us.  And you know, we sure could use some help here.  And so I think that that's the problem,  and we're such a cynical electorate, aren't we?  I mean, that residents.  With reason.  Yeah, with good reason.  I like what they did with the State of the Union.  Have you seen this?  This is a YouTube, they posted a YouTube enhanced video  of the State of the Union where they had  the speech on the left, they posted this early,  and then on the right, graphs, charts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this is how I watched it.  I didn't watch it on TV.  Isn't this great?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, admittedly, this is a way of manipulating  the message a little bit,  because this comes from, well, it comes from the White House.  So I guess it's not from the campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's not the campaign, that's the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't know if people make that distinction,  but you should, folks.  Stuff like the Google Plus account, the Twitter account,  that's the campaign.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, the Michelle Obama and Barack Obama accounts  are the campaign.  The White House account is the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so this is on WhiteHouse.gov,  so this is the executive branch  trying to give you more information,  and using YouTube for it.  I love that.  Go right to the people.  Disintermediate the networks, the news media.  That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's a WhiteHouse.gov iPhone app  you could stream live at the State of the Union,  the enhanced version on your iPhone.  Which, you know, it's not the best app in the world,  but it works.  And yeah, you know, at Expert Labs,  we did analysis of activity, Twitter activity,  on the State of the Union, around the State of the Union,  as many people did analyzing the hashtag,  the S-O-T-U hashtag.  We actually analyzed the conversations  that had involved mentions about White House or at WHLive,  which is the White House live account,  which basically just live tweets, speeches,  you know, sound bites from speeches.  And that was really interesting to see.  I mean, we had, you know, we were getting,  I'm just looking at some of the numbers right now.  We had a 30% increase over last year's activity.  We had like 21,000 tweets come in  that mentioned the White House or White House Live.  That's cool.  We had like 6,200 people, unique people responded.  And it was interesting, you know, the people responded.  The moment during the speech that S-O-T-U hashtag peaked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's perilously close to STFU, by the way.  STFU, it is.  They need a new acronym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is.  The spilled milk joke was the kind of moment  where it had the most tweets of the hashtag overall.  But it was actually the mention of Lincoln and Steve Jobs  that resonated with the people  who are actually following White House  and talking to White House directly.  So I think there's a big difference  between talking about an event  and talking to your government.  Right.  So that was interesting for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yet that kind of engagement,  talking about an event is the kind of,  I mean, that's the start.  Engagement is what it's all about.  By the way, after you go to the hangout with Anish Chopra,  then you can hang out with the Giants.  Yeah.  They're doing their hangout.  I love that.  Uh, Jake Ballard, Steve Weatherford, Tyler Sash,  Prince of Mukumara, and then, and then 20, oh no,  and then live video chat with Victor Cruz, Corey Webster,  Mark Herzlick, and Henry Hynosky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be just like a sports interview.  So what's the game going to be like?  Well, we're going to try hard to win.  It's just, it'd be magnificently meaningless,  but that'll be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We came to win.  Yeah.  They came to play.  Uh, that I, you know, you've got to think,  I'm starting to see now circle, on CNN, circle us,  that Google plus could be possibly  because of search plus your world.  I have to think it has something to do with that.  Here's Conan O'Brien talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To show you how much times have changed.  Yesterday, President Obama did a live question  and answer session on YouTube.  This is the world we're in now.  Yeah.  Now I don't know if YouTube is the best forum  for the president to appear on.  It seems a little less than dignified,  but the president did it and take a look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mr. President, welcome to Google plus.  Great to talk to you, Steve.  Mr. President, our first YouTube question today  comes from a YouTube celebrity, actually.  And I think he's someone that you're going to recognize.  Let's take a look.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This did not happen by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although it should have.  Keyboard cat on YouTube.  Now, one thing, the reason I,  other reason I played that clip  that I think is kind of interesting  is the kind of the conflablation,  confabulation of YouTube and Google plus.  Yes.  Another trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it really, I guess it doesn't hurt Google.  It doesn't matter.  It's all the same company.  It's all Google now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, who cares?  I mean, I think that's probably a good thing for Google.  Wouldn't mind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, it rubs off a little of the magic glitter  from YouTube onto Google plus, right?  I think so.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's another, go ahead.  I believe you could have watched the live stream  on YouTube.com versus on Google plus itself.  So I think it was a cross-border product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how I watched it.  Yeah, it's the same thing.  Google is, they're clear.  They're not making a distinction between their services.  Google plus, Google YouTube, it's all the same.  And that's the new privacy policy, the whole thing.  We knew that when they started the Google bar.  And it just shows you how powerful that is, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  And again, I think it's not,  the privacy thing is not a big deal,  but there's, I was on a NPR show today  with Mark Rottenberg from Epic  and he's insisting this is illegal, what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  On what grounds?  Is it antitrust?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That they're changing,  that people gave them information under one guys  and they're being used in other guys.  I don't think so, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's as long as we're,  cause this episode's already now banned from YouTube  thanks to that clip.  So let's just.  Let's just go for it.  Let's just go for it.  John Stewart on the Daily Show,  his take on the, he calls it the Panda Express.  Do you have audio?  Let me rewind.  You potted it down probably when I was making noise earlier.  So let's try that again.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're not getting audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rewind, what a retro word.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I'll leave it for you to play John Stewart's comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You sure John?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I can't understand why that would be the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had that happen to me the other day

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  where I played a YouTube video and suddenly the sound was out  and I had to refresh the page and then it played.  Well, that's all right.  The sound was out and I had to refresh the page  and then it played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the way fresh the page.  Of course, if we refresh the page,  we get it once again, that fabulous 10 second commercial.  Commercial, yeah.  For laundry detergent.  Let's see if we hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the worst part.  Here's the worst part about all this pandering for votes,  the speaking Spanish, the singing.  Once you become president.  The singing?  You have to keep doing it.  Exhibit A, while Newton Mitt  are out on the campaign trail yesterday,  Barack Obama was conducting a virtual town hall  on Google+.  Yes, Google+.  Or as all Gmail users know it,  what the f*** is that thing up there?  Is there any way I can turn that off?  Actually, I give the president credit for doing a web chat.  It's a risky move given the likelihood  that one of those windows is gonna pop up  with a shirtless Joe Biden.  Hey, who's ready to party, huh?  During the chat, the president was in full on campaign mode  with a warm greeting for every questioner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm from Fort Worth, Texas,  and I have two beautiful girls.  Nice to meet you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't beat daughters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you really have to remind people that they can't,  that they can't beat daughters?  Seems odd that you would feel compelled to just, you know,  I have two beautiful daughters.  Well, you can't beat them.  You just can't.  But the chat mostly boiled down to,  so, Mr. President, help me.  Yeah.  Sometimes on a surprisingly micro level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My husband has an engineering degree  with over 10 years of experience,  and he was laid off three years ago  and has yet to find a permanent job in his field.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you send me your husband's resume,  I'll be interested in finding out exactly  what's happening right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're taking resumes?  Don't you have to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you remember, do you remember when Jimmy Carter  did the same thing many years ago  in Saturday Night Live, got a great bit off  where they had Jimmy Carter answering questions  in the White House and the Oval Office about everything?  Because Jimmy, remember, was a nuclear engineer.  So the whole bit on Saturday Night Live,  Mr. President, I'm having trouble with my HVAC,  my heating system, and Jimmy would say,  well, what you gotta do is, it was a great bit.  It's exactly the same.  So nothing's changed.  That was 30 years ago.  36 years ago, nothing's changed.  It's just more of the same.  It's called retail politics,  and the social media makes it easy.  Let's see.  Giants are, going back to the Giants,  I'm gonna go back and forth, see,  so if you don't like politics, you got sports.  The Giants are actually using YouTube and Google Plus  to stream stuff as they arrive in Indianapolis.  I mean, they're really using the medium dramatically,  effectively, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I didn't know the NFL was putting up highlights  during the games on its site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, you'll be able to, this is, I think,  the first Super Bowl you'll be able to watch  on your phone or your tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ooh, how, how, how?  Because I'm gonna be driving, how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, this is not recommended, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're driving.  All of my wife drives.  All of my wife drives, how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let your wife drive.  So if you're on Verizon, there's an NFL app  for Verizon phones only that will let you stream  the Super Bowl.  Do you have a Verizon phone?  You probably do, Aaron.  No. No.  No, that's right, we made you buy an iPhone, didn't we?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We made you buy an iPhone.  See if you just had that Android phone.  Let's see, I think,  it's streaming on the web, too,  so if you can pull up the web,  I wonder if it's flashed, though.  Here, let me check, because it is the first Super Bowl  that you'll be able to watch online, in high-def,  on stream, online. Wow.  Let me see here.  NFL.com is streaming it.  Smartphone, looks like you have to be a Verizon customer.  That's just this year, you know, next time.  Yeah. Everybody.  Yeah. They got a little,  something, something from Verizon for that.  I think, what you should probably do right now  is go to NFL.com on your iPad.  I will, wow. And see.  If you had an Android tablet, no problem,  but an iPad, of course, because they don't do flash.  I wonder how smart NFL is about that.  Are they going to use HTML5,  or are they just going to put flash up?  We were talking on the Twit,  and we haven't talked about it on this show,  but I think we should, about the poaching situation.  Yeah, this is interesting.  Yeah.  Steve Jobs sent an email to Eric Schmidt,  bitching, in fact, but this has all come out.  Now, there was a settlement a couple of years ago,  the Department of Justice sued these five companies,  Apple, Google, Twit, Pixar, and Adobe,  I think was the fifth, I can't remember,  about colluding not to hire one another's employees,  a no-recruit policy, which is illegal.  I didn't know this, but it's illegal.  Anti-trust law prevents companies.  I can't say to our competitors, like Revision 3,  hey, I won't hire your employees if you don't hire them.  The reason is, it makes perfect sense,  it prevents a fair market for employees.  You can't say, well, I'm going to go across the street  and get a better job if you don't give me a raise.  And that's exactly, by the way,  why Google and Apple don't want that to happen.  They don't want their engineers saying,  I'm going to get a better job.  So apparently, Apple...  Now, so there's a class action suit from the employees  who say we were discriminated against.  And so as a result, all of these email exchanges  are coming out.  There was an email exchange in which Steve Jobs  asked Eric Schmidt, he said, very politely, he said,  I would be very pleased if your recruiting department  would stop doing this.  Now, I'm hearing Steve's voice,  and it's not quite that polite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would be very pleased if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a scary phrase coming from Jobs,  if I got that email from Jobs.  Now, is this when Schmidt was on the board of Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it's 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And now my other question about this,  is there a difference between poaching employees,  meaning like, I'm going to cold call an engineer at Apple  and like make them an offer to come to Google,  and an Apple employee coming to Google  or applying for a job at Google?  Like, isn't this like cold calling?  No.  Recruiting?  No, this is straight up like we don't hire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to these emails, they were also told  if somebody comes to you from Apple and says, I want a job,  you say, sorry.  And there's some smoking gun emails on this one as well.  But listen to this.  So Schmidt took Jobs' email, passed it on to employment,  the employment department saying,  I believe we have a policy of no recruiting from Apple.  And this is a direct inbound request.  In other words, Steve's calling.  Can you get this stopped?  Let me know why this is happening.  I need to send a response back to Apple quickly.  Please let me know.  Eric is jumping.  Please let me know as soon as you can.  They fired the Google employee  who made the recruitment call.  The Google staffing director wrote back to Schmidt saying,  please extend my apologies as appropriate to Steve Jobs.  It was an isolated incident.  Jobs said, we want this firing to be public.  And we want it to happen immediately.  Wow.  Their Pixar, same thing.  Now, what's interesting is if you look at these companies,  it's because of their interlocking board of directors,  Google, Apple, Intuit, Bill Campbell,  Apple board of director, also Intuit, former Intuit CEO.  All of this is because it's the board of directors going,  hey, don't worry.  We won't hire him if you don't hire our guy.  And it's highly illegal.  They settled this a couple of years ago,  but this isn't over.  And when you read it, it's kind of shocking.  It's also a little insight into how Eric Schmidt was kind of  how far up Steve's Levi's Eric Schmidt was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very different, very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was tickling the prostate, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's another email between two vice presidents at Google  in which they talk about ways to, quote,  never get into bidding wars.  And they CC not only Schmidt,  but Bill Campbell on the board at Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who was it who was frying the bacon  outside Facebook's headquarters to hire people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  That was good, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook is not mentioned in this.  It's just those five that I mentioned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think by the time Facebook became a force,  that practice had to be over.  Yeah.  Speaking of bacon, did you see the meme on Google Plus  this week of bacon donuts?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ooh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  I'm gonna search plus my world, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am doing it now.  I am doing it now, I'm searching now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the greatest hiring tool I can imagine in the valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is actually, let me see.  This is something else.  Boy, bacon is just really huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bacon is a meme.  It is the Mondo meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have bacon every morning for breakfast.  You do?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm on a, that's that paleo thing, right?  I'm on a no carb diet,  but you're supposed to eat a lot of fat.  Here's Steve Garfield.  No, that's not it.  Is that it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google, you're failing me here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got the post from Jeff that said,  he's no longer an optimist about the fate of mankind.  These bacon donuts look ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bacon donuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought the bacon would be baked in,  but it's actually sprinkles on the topping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, so I could eat the top.  Here it is.  I could eat the top, but not the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Paleo, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God, that looks good.  That's a cafe dulce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So do you just eat like steak for every meal or what, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you saw what I was eating.  I had a delicious meal of chicken  and Brussels sprouts and broccoli.  I eat vegetables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Brussels sprouts, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Love Brussels sprouts.  It's that time of year.  You know what?  You know what, I'm sorry I don't have more time in New York  because I would prepare for you Brussels sprouts and bacon  with a little balsamic drizzle and stuff  that you would die for.  It's all in the preparation.  You've got to braise them just so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's Fukushima cabbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is cabbage.  It's little tiny cabbages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's radioactive.  Yeah, it's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Matt Cutts, you got to love Matt Cutts.  Look at this article in the Search Engine Land  by Matt McGee.  Matt Cutts, international diplomat.  Of course, he's a Google,  early global employee and a regular on this show.  According to the Wall Street Journal,  Cutts is in South Korea in a presentation on Monday  for about 80 government officials, webmasters,  lawyers, and journalists.  He convinced Korean government reps to let Google  crawl and index their websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, can you believe that?  He's giving a presentation and one of the,  a senior judge in the Seoul High Court  sees in Matt's presentation that the robots.txt file  on the court's website prevents the Googlebot  from crawling it.  He calls his people, says, hey, take us out,  allow the Googlebot in the robots.txt.  They do it and by the end of the talk,  he lets Matt know Google has indexed the site.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kang Min-Koo, senior judge in the Seoul High Court,  he actually texted the court's webmaster from the speech.  Said, fix it.  That's amazing, said Matt, calling you an example  of Korea's Bali-Bali or hurry up culture.  And he said, I'll use this in my future speeches.  That's a nice victory.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Go Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as Wall Street Journal points out,  it's a competitive issue for Google.  If you can't search those sites,  you can't deliver those results in your search engine.  And it's in Google's interest to get everyone in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Once again, Matt proves himself one of the company's  best folks with people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, now you know why he has carte blanche.  To go anywhere, say anything, do anything.  So Google's response to our criticisms,  Danny Sullivan's criticisms on search engine land  about search plus your world is people like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Real people like it.  Oh yes, important.  Not you bloggers, popular people,  but regular people really like it.  The data shows.  Now I'm not making fun.  I just, this interview that Danny did was actually,  was very good and very interesting.  I think that it's with a meet Singhal,  who's, it looks like he is a product manager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he's Google's search chief,  as it says in the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google fellow.  I think he, I think Amit said at least 10 times,  the product is only two weeks old.  Right.  So he's kind of blaming it on the beta.  Right.  You know, the early beta story,  which we get from Google a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a great excuse now.  Hey, we're not done yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, right.  Well, it does look that way.  I went to the Google updated Davos with Eric Schmidt,  David Drummond, Marissa Meyer last weekend.  One of the reporters there did give them rather holy hell  for spamming the results of Google Plus  and asking about antitrust.  And not much news came out of this at all,  but I found it interesting that David Drummond,  the council repeated more than once the idea that,  see if I get the quote here,  was that a search engine is not going to be  10 blue links forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It really is to me.  So we should answer a user's question.  And as for antitrust, he said,  how exactly are we foreclosing anybody else,  anybody from using anyone else's competitive service?  We're not, nothing in antitrust law says,  or should say that we have to be 10 blue links.  So I smell in that the idea that they're going to,  start messing with search.  Right.  And this is what they have already,  but I think they're going to mess with a lot more ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's also crafting or presaging their defense, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, oh sure, sure.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really, really interesting.  You know, so their defense is now several parts.  One is nothing makes us, nothing requires us  to just be search results.  But I don't think it responds to,  I think the perhaps, and I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know,  but I would guess antitrust would say that,  now see Google's not a monopoly yet.  So that's really the real reason.  They're only 65%, but let's say they were a monopoly.  Let's say they were 90% or 95%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which they are in some European countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you are a monopoly,  seems to me very analogous to the Microsoft issue.  If you're a monopoly, are you allowed to favor your sites  in the search results?  It would be like in my mind, again, I'm not an attorney,  my mind, it would be like Microsoft favoring  Internet Explorer.  Of course you can use other browsers on Windows,  but they got in a lot of trouble  by bundling Internet Explorer in.  It would be like that.  Yes, of course you could use another search engine  or massage your results,  but you are favoring your own product, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, look at it this way.  Facebook, see Facebook doesn't get this  because Facebook is one integrated whole.  If Google didn't acquire these things  and add Google Plus and add YouTube and so on and so forth,  if it had been born whole, right,  then it's just part of Google.  The only reason that we taxonomically argue  that Google Plus is different from Google Search  or YouTube is different from Google Search  is because they got added later.  You know what I'm saying?  Right.  So, I'm not making this as a legal argument at all,  but I'm just saying that I think that they're  in a different position than their competitors  are like Facebook.  Facebook obviously promotes its own stuff  and only its own stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Google now, especially with that  and the privacy stuff we talked about last week,  it puts them in a more difficult position.  I don't know how they're gonna argue it.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we shall see.  They're not a monopoly, so right now they can do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so they can do anything.  I mean, the thing that,  whether or not they can do something legally,  for me isn't the question.  Oh, I agree.  And I think I agree with MG Siegler

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  who said it hurts the results.  That's the bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the question for me is,  is it good for the user, right?  Like, is Google serving the user?  That's what I mean by saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  service users love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, he's saying that it does.  I have a really hard,  I really go back and forth about this.  I have a really hard time believing that  given the focus on the user work,  given the idea that Google knows about  the other social media presences of different,  of people that, celebrities and popular people  that you might search for  and the fact that they choose to show Google Plus  over those other sites.  And I get that they don't have the data.  That's hard for me to believe  because Google has a lot of data.  They've been really successful getting data from the web  for years and years.  And I just, I don't have a hard time with it.  So, I mean, I think whether or not they can  really isn't the question that bothers me about it.  It's whether or not they should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I asked them about the Twitter firehose as well.  And they lamented that they believed  that they had a really good deal before.  Marissa made that deal originally.  They said they wanted the deal to happen.  It didn't happen after much negotiation.  And I said, okay, well, what caused,  what were the issues?  And then they wouldn't answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, speaking.  Speaking. Go ahead.  You speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At some point, I'm not gonna hijack the show again,  don't worry.  But at some point, I would love to hear your,  the reaction of YouTube is I'm still cannot figure out  what I think about the Twitter censoring by nation thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good, let's do that now.  And then I'll mention Facebook.  I should tell everybody that Kara Swisher says,  go the F back to sleep.  It's not gonna happen until after the markets close,  which is in the next two minutes, the Facebook filing.  And I have it right here.  And I'm refreshing again and again,  the Facebook filings on the SEC.  And to date, no filing for an IPO,  but it could happen in the next few minutes.  So I will watch this with great interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm refreshing Google News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll have it first.  I've got the SEC site up here.  So let's talk about that.  Twitter's announced that it will end.  This means to me a little analogous  to what Google went through in China,  that it will adhere to the laws of various nations  and allow those nations to censor tweets.  And it seems to me that this is exactly  what you have to do.  If you're gonna be in a country,  you have to adhere to that country's laws.  We wouldn't like it very much  if a site from another nation in the US  didn't adhere to US laws.  We'd have to do something like SOPA.  And similarly, if you're in Germany or France,  for instance, it's illegal to tweet Nazi propaganda, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, I talked to somebody from Google about this,  and I tried to understand on a level of principle here,  which is what I don't quite understand  about the Twitter thing,  the analogy to Google,  and was told that in France and in Germany,  they are given a list of sites by the government.  These are illegal sites, block them, don't link to them.  Whereas in China, I said,  what's the difference with that in China?  In China, they were never given a list,  and so they would actually crawl  to find out what they couldn't serve.  That's tough.  And that's what they put up,  so it became a dirtier thing in their view.  Google was censoring things kind of on its own  under the presumption of what China was doing,  and it sounds like a fairly fine line,  but there's still a line there somewhere.  The Twitter thing got two drastically different reactions,  and I really don't know,  it's a rare moment when I say  I don't know what to think about it, but I don't.  On the one hand, slippery slope of censorship,  you're doing the government's bidding, blah, blah, blah,  but you're right, Leo,  and given the country, what are you going to do?  However, they're not in China.  Is this a way cynically to get them into China  is the negative argument.  The positive argument is, as far as I can tell,  well, no. Oh, that's interesting.  Right, so that's the problem.  Is this just a cynical move to get you in?  And I was with some Chinese activists  who were absolutely irate about this,  were very unhappy.  Even though they don't have Twitter now,  they felt that it was pandering to the government.  On the other hand, the tweets that don't appear in country acts  will appear in the rest of the world.  So is that, as someone put it,  and I wish I remember who, I think it was Reid Wright Webb,  or Reuters, said it was a gray box of shame,  not for Twitter, but for the governments,  that then becomes publicized around the world.  And I just cannot get my head around  whether this is a good or bad move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me understand that.  So if I am in Germany  and I tweet a pro-white supremacist Nazi tweet,  Twitter will block it in Germany, but will not.  In Germany.  But will not, so they won't block it at the source.  They won't say, no, you can't post that.  They will just block it in Germany  and not block it everywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I understand.  I could be wrong, chat room, please correct me.  And also-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if we know.  I mean, that's kind of-  We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Part of what Google was,  what this Google was saying too,  was that if they did it on words,  that would be a bad thing.  If they just preemptively  wouldn't let you publish certain words,  that would be a bad thing.  And I certainly agree with that.  I think censorship at all is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we know now that you should never tweet the words,  destroy America.  Did you see that?  Yeah.  I'm embarrassed.  Yeah, I am too.  To be honest, I'm embarrassed.  Look, I understand the need to protect this country  against terrorists, but not-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, I didn't hear that story.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two British tourists,  Lee Van Brian and I guess his girlfriend,  coming to the US,  Emily Banting,  this guy Lee tweeted,  Melissa free this week for a quick gossip prep  before I go and destroy America.  Somebody tipped the Department of Homeland Security.  When the pair arrived at LAX,  they were detained by armed guards.  He was handcuffed and thrown into a cell  with Mexican drug dealers for 12 hours,  flagged as a potential threat to our shores  and then prevented.  They were both prevented.  Oh, there was another tweet,  which was quoting the family guy,  but apparently the DHS doesn't watch the family guy.  Three weeks ago, we're totally in LA people,  off on Hollywood Boulevard and digging Marilyn Monroe up.  They actually searched his suitcase looking for shovels,  thinking that they were looking to raid Marilyn's tomb.  And if you are in the UK,  you know that destroy is common slang for like,  rip it up, have a great time.  He said, I almost burst out laughing when they asked me  if I was going to be Lee's lookout  while he dug up Marilyn Monroe.  They asked me why we wanted to destroy America  and we tried to explain it meant to get trashed and party.  And spend money here and create jobs for bartenders.  And so they were not allowed to enter because of tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So don't, just a word,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we have a large international contingent.  If you plan to come to the US, please,  we have a large international contingent.  We have a large international contingent.  If you plan to come to the US, please watch your tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To get back to the Twitter blocking censorship per country,  the one thing that I think that they did very right  is that they're actually going to list in the API.  So when you request tweets that have been blocked  in certain countries via the Twitter API,  the payload will actually specify which countries  certain tweets were withheld in.  So this means that programmatically,  developers can make apps which show the tweets  that were censored around the world.  Wow.  So that's pretty powerful stuff right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is very powerful.  You're right, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go to chillingeffects.org.  You can watch as it happens in real time.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  So that is pretty powerful stuff.  I think that that can be used as a tool to stop censorship.  You can argue that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm coming to go on that side,  but just like Google,  I don't think they did a great job of explaining  and announcing the rationale.  Maybe they didn't want to  because maybe there is politics behind it.  But we're all going to tear apart these decisions  and try to figure them out pretty quickly.  And after China, Google, and after some of these other things,  we want to find out what's good and bad.  So thank you for the help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that you just,  I mean, it's the reason Google stopped being in China.  You have to adhere to the laws of the country you operate in.  I mean, I understand that that's not,  that seems reprehensible to us in this country  because we support, supposedly support free speech.  Apparently not, but supposedly support free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think the company has to have principles  and it has to state where those principles are.  So Facebook, if Facebook gets to the point  and they've had talks with China,  if they say at some point,  okay, we're going into China  and yes, we'll require a real identity  and yes, we'll pass that on to the authorities.  Does that make Facebook evil?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so, we're going to expect these companies  to say what their principles are in these activities.  That was the issue with Google and China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think making the API is a very good, clear statement.  It's very good, yeah.  Saying, all right, we'll comply with the laws of the country,  but we'll do it in such a way  that it's completely transparent to everybody else is perfect.  That's a great response, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and I didn't think that got as much coverage  as it should.  I like your answer. Yeah, that the fields are  withheld scope, withheld in countries.  So something withheld in Greece, Hong Kong,  and Malaysia would say withheld countries, GR, HK, MY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say let's generalize from that,  that that's a great rule of thumb,  that you follow the laws in the country that requires it,  but that you also support the free flow of information  everywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, and you're completely transparent  about what you've held back and where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's a pretty good solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, of course, you couldn't do that in the United States  if you got one of the secret subpoenas here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  You know, you had a great,  I thought a very interesting conversation in email.  Can I talk about it with this fellow from Germany?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, just where he has won his ID out, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No names.  But what at first I thought was a flame, to be honest,  mostly because of the subject line,  was really a very thoughtful piece about,  because as we all know, Jeff, who is an honorary German,  and spends a lot of time in Germany and speaks German,  has talked a lot about how this obsession for privacy  in some ways in Germany,  and he said, well, you know, look at the Patriot Act.  Yeah, he's right.  The privacy regulations that we were talking about  last week that are proposed in the EU  are in many ways protect individuals  and compare and contrast to our own laws here in the States,  whereas in fact, individuals are,  we can find out whatever we want.  And we can't, and no one can say a word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know, what he also made the point of  is there are so many unintended consequences.  I saw this, and I went to a meeting on privacy at Davos  after I took over the show last week on the topic,  and don't worry, I won't do it again.  But one software services company said  that they got a request from a European client  to give them unlimited protection from liability,  and the software services company wasn't involved  in anything having to do with privacy,  but if they got a core dump from a frozen machine  sent over to them as hexadecimal data  to try to figure out why the machine had crashed, right?  If in that hexi data somewhere in the core dump  was some private information,  then there's liability involved,  even though they're having nothing to do with it,  it has nothing to do with what they do,  but it got transferred across,  and oh my God, what are we gonna do?  And that's the problem we get now  with various regimes trying to regulate the internet  at one level or another.  And there are so many unintended consequences of doing it  that I just still see danger, danger, danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  From our chat room comes a story.  I've always thought that,  and it's always been thought that the antivirus companies  perhaps overstated the risks,  security risks from viruses to promote their products.  Symantec has now backtracked from assertions last week  that 13 Android apps on the Android marketplace  were malicious.  It now says, oh, whoops, no, it's just an ad network.  Symantec found code within 13 apps  called android.counterclank and said,  oh, it's a Trojan horse, it's malware.  In fact, it is not.  It's completely legitimate code.  Comes from an SDK distributed to third parties  to help to monetize applications through search.  And Lookout has said this all along,  Symantec now acknowledges.  It's aggressive, but it's not exactly malware.  It's changing the homepage.  Now this actually, I think, is malware.  It changes the homepage of your browser,  and adds some shortcuts to your phone's homepage,  and it may add and remove bookmarks.  So, eee, it sounds kind of malicious.  I'm not calling it a Trojan horse,  but it is a little, something you don't want on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like crapware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Crapware, thank you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The technical term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The technical term is crapware.  Teenagers now may use Google+.  I didn't know they couldn't before.  You had to be 18, 21?  Yep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is definitely a nod to Facebook, right?  If you want teenagers, that means you want the Facebook.  Yeah.  Started on Thursday.  Teens and young adults, says Bradley Horowitz,  are the most active internet users on the planet,  and surprise, surprise, they're also human beings.  Those of us who are the parents of teenagers  might dispute that.  But miners can now use Google+,  but there are some security changes  that Google+, is implemented with that in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I presume not below 13, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would guess, because of the,  COPPA 13 is the key.  Anybody who's old enough for a Google account of any sort  can get Google+.  That means 13 years old in the US,  in Spain, 14, South Korea, 14, the Netherlands, 16.  13 almost everywhere else.  Just like Facebook, 13 and up.  So they're gonna change.  Online sharing is still second rate for this age group,  he says, in life, for instance,  teens can share the right things with just the right people.  So I guess they're limiting the circles.  They have to share to their,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  or you can't share to public?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, some of the defaults are different.  I'm not, I, hmm, that's a good question,  if you can't share to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  by default, only those in teens circles  can say hello to those teens.  So I guess it's not outbound, it's inbound.  So that's appropriate.  In fact, I'd like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly, we've talked about that.  That's Bob Wyman's argument about email,  is that the recipient should control.  So what that's saying is that the teenager,  the recipient is in full control,  and will not get stuff from unwanted people.  That's not a, you're right, that's not a bad,  I want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm 17.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like a good feature.  Actually, you can't, that feature is a click away  for everybody and for teenagers too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if you're in a, if a teenager is in a hangout  that someone who is not in their circles joins,  the teenager automatically gets booted from the hangout,  what?  Well, not booted, but there's just a little,  they go off camera and there's a notification,  hey, someone else has joined, do you want to rejoin?  So it's, yeah, kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess that's okay, I don't mind that.  Stranger, stranger alert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, which is, which is data boys.  All right, but we've made every adult dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't like that.  But I guess-  But they gotta-  It's kind of-  Cover their butts, yeah.  A minor-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a higher likelihood of penises on webcams,  don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  I mean-  Yes.  Look at Joe Biden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry to put it that bluntly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm just joking, that's a joke.  Joe Biden has never showed his penis on a webcam,  to my knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shortlist Biden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shortlist, that was funny.  That was funny.  He is a good, I like Joe Biden, he's never done that.  I'm looking, there's still no filing from Facebook.  The markets are closed now.  So maybe they will, but Edgar search results  on the SEC site for Facebook,  show nothing.  I think that, did they say that F,  what would be the clicker, what do they call it?  The clicker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, the code.  Ticker symbol.  The joke here was like, poke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like or poke?  Poke would be good.  No.  Would you, FB?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Zuck would be very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  FB is available on all exchanges, so FB-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we even know whether it's NASDAQ or NYSE?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, we don't.  You know that they bid, both NYSE and NASDAQ  try very hard to get those guys on there.  New York Stock Exchange, Apple's always been  on the over-the-counter NASDAQ exchange.  New York Stock Exchange very famously went to Apple,  said, we'll give you A, a single letter,  if you come over here, and they never did.  A lot of value in this Facebook, would you, we can't,  I don't, and I'm pretty sure you guys  don't buy stock, tech stocks.  No, actually you do, you do.  I do, I do, I've been transparent about it, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, I chose to buy a little Google  so I had some skin in the game, just so I'd watch them.  So would you buy some Facebook,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would you try to get in on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm not gonna get in on the IPO,  but at some point I would like to buy some Facebook.  It occurred to me, I wrote a piece for The Guardian,  I think it'll be up tomorrow, and it occurred to me  that Facebook has a staff the size of a large newspaper,  which at most might have a million audience,  and of course it serves a billion people.  It's a pretty damn good business.  Yeah. You know?  Yeah. It really is.  It's so darn efficient, and the engagement is so high,  and the data value is so high,  and even, I saw Nikesh Arora from Google at DLD in Munich  before Davos last week, and he was talking about  how we move from the information age to the people age.  This is Google talking, it's Google talking.  Yes.  And that to me puts Facebook  in a rather preeminent position strategically.  Now the irony is, of course, I don't actually use Facebook  as much as I used to.  But that's just me, and I have great hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just you.  It is.  Everybody else uses it 10 times more.  You know, I had a really interesting conversation  with my 17-year-old son last night,  in which he was very clear that Facebook's intent  was to get him and all his friends  to not use the internet just to use Facebook.  He said, oh, I said, because you don't use email.  I said, I send you email, you never see it.  He said, you got to Facebook me.  He said, everybody uses Facebook messaging.  He says, everybody's using Facebook for IM, for Skype.  Facebook has its own currency.  How long before Facebook currency  is a global world currency  that supersedes the dollar and the euro?  And finally, right now, Facebook doesn't sell much.  We both agreed that we still would go to Amazon  to buy something, but how long before  you buy everything on Facebook too?  I'm sure Mark will launch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that goes back to the vision of Beacon  and of Blippi and things like that,  is when you know what your friends buy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let it all, and of course, we got 800 million users  who spent all their time on Facebook.  We had a great discussion on Twitter on Sunday,  Jolie Odell Averde, I'd be curious what you guys think,  that if it weren't, if Facebook did not exist,  we would all be using the internet less.  And I said, well, how much less?  She said, well, let's say 20%.  Maybe not 100%, but a significant less amount of time  spent on the internet if it weren't for Facebook.  And I said, oh, if Facebook didn't exist,  we would have had to invent it.  Something would have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you're on Facebook, are you actually on the internet?  And I'm being a little facetious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that was what Jennifer,  okay, so we're having this conversation.  My wife's at the table as well.  She said, well, Facebook, I mean,  you have to use the internet to use Facebook, right?  I said, yeah, well, you're still on the internet,  but you're in Facebook's little walled garden  of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel pretty passionate about keeping the web  decentralized and not spending all your time  within certain walls.  The idea of Facebook currency superseding,  that's just deeply depressing to me personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But don't you think it could happen  if they start selling stuff?  They've got Facebook credits, Facebook currency.  Oh yeah, oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook currency probably has a better chance  than Bitcoin.  Right.  I've been seeing those Facebook currency gift cards  at Target and places like that.  They sell them at stores.  For a while, but I never hear anything about it.  Are people actually using it?  I just don't see a lot of stories about it  just kind of in tech news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or kids buying these and using them.  Yeah, they use them for like Farmville and stuff.  But right now, I don't think there's much you can use it.  But what if they started selling real goods on Facebook?  And you know, I mean, or, and this is more Facebooky,  they did a deal with Amazon, let's say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think Facebook is gonna, you know,  Facebook and Google both know where we are.  And that's, and local commerce I think is gonna  become a matter of instant gratification at a premium.  And otherwise, commerce is consolidated  and distributed from a distance, Amazon.  And so they're both gonna try to tell us  that thing you want, here's the best way to get it.  You can get it right now here.  You can get it wherever you want there.  And Amazon, hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know, I don't know.  If I were Amazon, why wouldn't you?  Why wouldn't you?  That's the, that's the, see, this is where Facebook  has this great negotiation.  Yeah.  All we want is for people to,  there's two things we want at Facebook.  We won't charge Amazon.  All we want is for people to live in Facebook  and we just want the signals back.  We just wanna know what they buy.  Yes.  That's all we ask.  Now, I don't think Jeff, I think that's valuable.  Everybody knows now.  And that's why Apple would not do a deal with Facebook.  That's what happened to Ping, surprisingly,  is Apple said, you can't have that information.  And Facebook said, well, that's all we ask.  But how long before the value of having,  of living on Facebook becomes so great  that you, that it's worth it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Facebook and Google are both,  I've said it a million times in the show,  they're both in a single generation.  And so if you look at the newsreader  that Group Guardian and Washington Post  and Wall Street Journal have on Facebook,  that's valuable to both, right?  And what I don't know is how much data  has passed from Facebook back to those media companies.  Right.  How do they know who's reading what?  But content's primary value  was gonna be in single generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Facebook knows it.  And people aren't willing,  everybody knows it now.  So nobody's willing to give it away.  Facebook, I predict, watch, I predict,  we'll need to watch for this.  Facebook needs a stick along with a carrot.  So there's lots of carrots.  We have 800 million people.  You know.  Soon a billion.  We'll have our own currency  and we'll give those people 5% off  if they use Facebook currency, whatever.  You know, there's ways, there's lots of carrots.  Facebook needs a stick.  Remember Apple's stick was,  you're gonna rob blind with piracy,  so you gotta sell your stuff on iTunes  because that's gonna save you.  There needs to be something pushing Amazon  into using Facebook.  Maybe, and maybe search,  maybe this is why Google's so threatened.  Maybe search is it.  If Facebook's search for goods is superior  because of the social signals,  it can apply to it.  Maybe that's a way, you know,  hey, if you don't participate with us,  you won't show up on our search.  Certainly that's what Google is.  This is why it's an antitrust issue on Google.  Google has a stick now.  Their search results.  Well, we're gonna favor YouTube.  We might not see your results so high up on the page  unless you, you know, do something for us.  That's, I mean, that's what you do, right?  When you control a market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got it, Leo, Leo, the movie, The Google Father.  The Google Father.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google Father.  The Google Father.  I'm not gonna lie.  That's what you're gonna see.  Someday, and that day may never come,  I will ask of you a favor.  Facebook, according to Bloomberg,  has picked Morgan Stanley to lead the IPO.  I do think they're gonna file today.  That's what everybody says.  They still haven't filed.  We keep checking.  The amount is unknown, between five and $10 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're saying whatever amount comes out,  it's just gonna be a placeholder,  and they're gonna adjust it later based on the pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think they'll do what Google did,  the Dutch auction?  That was smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would, you know, God, I wish they would do something  that would be different,  but they're gonna give 2.5% to the likes of Morgan Stanley.  It's the same old, same old.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was Bill Hambrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How wonderful would it be?  How wonderful would it be?  The people who made Facebook, Facebook,  are the members of Facebook.  Right.  Give it to us.  For them to have a piece of the company  would be the greatest symbolic thing you could imagine,  to find a way to do that.  God knows they're on SEC rules,  but it just would be so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be cool to give 800 million shares  to the Facebook users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe there's a stick in there somewhere.  All right, we're gonna take a break.  Come back with our,  unless you guys have another story you wanna cover,  there are a few more in our rundown  that we haven't gotten to,  but if not, we will come back with our tool tip  and number of the week.  We got Duck Duck Go setting new traffic records.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know, I know.  You know what's cool about Duck Duck Go?  What?  It publishes its traffic charts,  like its public is traffic charts.  And since the Search Plus Your World stuff,  or actually, sorry,  since the privacy policy changes-  It's gone through the roof.  That Google announced, it's gone through the roof  and it's still going through the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does Duck Duck Go use Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even it does use some of Google's signals,  but its whole cell is that it's a private structure.  So it would be a way of using Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  without telling Google what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, without telling Google what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they do publish, this is from duck.go.com  slash traffic.html,  direct queries per day have jumped, skyrocketed,  but it's still only like 700,000 a day.  It's not-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's not anything.  You know, I thought, I put the story up there  and I thought it was interesting  because there's a post I put in the rundown.  It's by a former Googler.  Last week, we debated the question  about whether or not Google has become evil,  but Nelson, who's a former Googler,  that's not the right question to ask.  The right question to ask is Google still  as deserving of our love as it used to be.  And he says no, right?  And he says that he doesn't feel like it does  and that he's gonna spend the time  that he would have spent explaining and defending Google,  focusing on interesting, plucky upstarts  who are trying to do something different.  That Google has become so big and so powerful  and so entrenched and has proven itself kind of clueless  recently with a few different moves.  The privacy policy announcement and Search Plus Your World  and Nim Wars, the Macalady thing,  that there have been just so many,  there's a laundry list of things that Google has done wrong,  whether or not they did it maliciously  or just because they're sort of clueless  or it came off the wrong way,  that he wants to focus on kind of smaller upstarts.  And I gotta tell you, that really kind of got to me.  So I think it's interesting that DuckDuckGo  is doing something different  and hooking itself on the privacy issue.  I think that all of us type very personal things  into our search engines every day.  And in fact, a friend of mine who listens to the show  kind of called me out and said,  you all said that the privacy policy change  wasn't as big a deal as people made it out to be,  but you didn't spend enough time talking about  how much data we really do shovel into Google every day.  And I thought that was maybe a fair comment  and he uses DuckDuckGo every day.  So he knows who he is.  I put it in the rundown  because I thought it was an interesting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room says,  the Firefox and Linux Mint is configured to use DuckDuckGo  by default, which is interesting.  By default, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm actually thinking about switching to DuckDuckGo  just to try it out, to see how it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the deal, if the chat room's right,  they use the Yahoo API, which means you're using Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And absolutely, Microsoft's sharing signals with Facebook.  Absolutely.  But do they know who you are?  I mean, I guess it depends on how-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, they don't, because you're not signed in.  Right, right.  Right, so if you want to search anonymously on Google,  you have to open up an incognito window  or you have to sign out of your Google account,  which to me is a big deal because I'm in Gmail all day.  I actually don't feel so bad about keeping my email  with Google because those are messages  that I'm sending to humans.  Those are messages that I'm assuming that anyone can see.  It's the search engine stuff,  where I feel like I'm just having this private conversation  with a machine.  I shouldn't have said private,  but I'm having a conversation with a machine  about my innermost thoughts and concerns  that help me choose sensitive topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You search for psoriasis, you're telling the world, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's really amazing  what your search history can really,  I mean, if you turn your log on  and just look through the past couple months,  you're like, oh, it's a guide  to what's been going on in your head.  What's so then your email or even maybe IM conversations?  Anyway, I didn't think to hijack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to do it for the,  let's do it for the next week and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And see how it goes.  Jeff, I want to hear your rebuttal.  I knew that this would be Jeff Bate.  It's so easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so simple.  So what if you have psoriasis?  I mean, I guess come back to that.  You could, I was on a NPR show this morning  and some woman had type 2 diabetes  and she got mad that they were giving her ads.  And I'm kind of saying, okay, but why?  What's the harm to you that they give you ads  that might actually be useful or relevant?  We're still in this world of creepiness.  Like, I don't want people taking my picture.  It takes my soul.  You know, it's, we've got to get down to the real harm  at some level and not have this discussion up here  in creepy land.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's reasonable.  That's reasonable.  But coming from a place of, I mean, you know,  if you're a gay teen or if you're a woman  who wants to get pregnant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I get that.  Yeah.  But then even then, if Google revealed our data  in such things, the, you know,  it would plummet the value of the company.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Google has said that they actually filter  this behavioral data that they use to inform  to inform other products.  That they filter it for health and other sensitive topics.  I have no idea how they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And under the rules, health, all health data  gets a special treatment, which, you know,  is unfortunate for society.  But I think I certainly understand the reason why.  But I don't know if I said this last week,  but I met with the Google engineers at Google in Munich  where they do the privacy stuff.  They said that after all that street view stuff  and everything else, they haven't heard any burps  about priority inbox.  And priority inbox is reading your email  and making judgments about that.  Doing all these things about who matters to you  and who doesn't.  But it's so useful that everybody ignores  all the creepy problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Right, it's true.  Priority inbox is really pretty great.  And I have never given it another thought.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay, sorry, Leo.  Carry on.  I know you've got to catch.  Oh, there was one other.  Now that you got me started,  there was one other story I wanted to do.  Oh, the crunchies.  I forgot to mention Google Plus was the best social network  on the TechCrunch Crunchy Awards yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it was booed, I heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two boos.  You know, somebody wrote an article that said there was boo.  I don't think, I wasn't there,  but were there a lot of boos?  They were mocking Google Plus, you know, in that stand.  Why would you boo Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yikes, yikes.  But I thought it was interesting  that they were mocking it during the monologue or whatever.  And then it won the award.  And then I read this article that said that there were boos.  I was like, wow, Google Plus is really,  there's a good butt of jokes in the valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, listen to what the competition was  in best social application.  Facebook timeline, Instagram, the new Twitter, or Path.  I think Google Plus in that group, I think Google Plus is.  It's pretty impressive, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Gina, how many, I don't play the game,  but how many followers do we each have now?  The numbers are unbelievable.  Plus, yeah, they're growing fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the numbers are, they're so big that I almost don't,  I'm skeptical. It's absurd.  Well, there's spam. Yeah, it's absurd.  There's definitely spam. There's spam, yeah.  I'm up to 590,000.  Holy cow.  Yeah.  I think I'm one of the suggested lists.  Yeah, I'm only 278,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What? That's clearly broken.  That makes no sense.  Yeah, that makes no sense.  Cause you're the king.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I think I would follow,  I'd rather follow Gina than follow me.  Well, we all would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The weird thing is they put Gina, right?  Gina, you're on the news list,  and I'm on the tech list,  which is exactly reversed.  Yeah. Right, that's right.  Maybe that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That just means you're twice as cool as me, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is the only, this is the only moment in time  where I would be more popular than you  on any social network.  I'm sure that's going to change this afternoon  while you're in the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One last refresh real quickly.  Nope, no, no filing.  Our tool of the week, Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tip of the week.  So-  Tip, I'm the tool.  You're the tool.  You're the tip, I'm the tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're no one's tool, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think getting the data you put into any app,  having the ability to get it out should be feature zero,  but we all know that a lot of apps launch  without the ability to get the data out that you put in.  This is why people has the data liberation front.  This is why you can't get your old tweets.  Well, Google Music, if you haven't looked at it in a while,  Google Music just gave users the ability  to download their songs, any songs that have been uploaded,  and that all happens kind of in the background,  and there's massive amounts of storage.  You can download your songs that you've uploaded  from anywhere, from the web or from the client.  It kind of makes it a little bit of like a drop box  for your music.  The only restriction is the songs that you've purchased,  you can only download like two times, two or three times,  but if you've just uploaded songs that you owned or ripped,  MP3s that you ripped, you can download any number of times.  And that's new.  Yeah, so it's not like a shiny new feature,  but it's useful, good use,  and maybe a good reason to upload your music  to Google Music if you haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking at my Google Music,  I don't see a download button.  Is it just like on Android or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you click on a song, there's a down arrow  that expands a menu and there's a download the song.  Got it.  On the menu, Adam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep, yep, very cool.  Good.  Tyler, the creator, Yonkers.  And now our...  Not my music.  And now our number of the week.  Do you have one for us, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, thanks to Gina Drapani, God bless you, Gina,  who got it from your pin board, God bless you both.  Here's a number, I'll do two.  One is that since the F8 conference in September,  over five billion songs have been shared.  Wow.  That's the new radio, right?  That's a piracy, folks, it's people passing it around.  If you create a frictionless way for people to share  and you create the business model around that,  it can really happen.  That's amazing.  That embedding stuff, embedding content,  that's really powerful.  And then my other number of the week  is that a French court fined Google $660,000  because Google Maps is free.  Oh, Jesus.  So another map company didn't like that.  So that's watching out for the people.  And now last week I pissed off somebody in Germany,  this week I'll piss off somebody in France,  that's absurd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Global trolling.  I like it though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My tool, I'll give you a couple.  One is how to make DuckDuckGo your default search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, oh boy.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can make any search engine your default search,  but you need to know what the search string is.  You click the spanner, as they call it in Britain,  the wrench, and you go to preferences.  And in the basics, you'll see right there,  there is search.  And unfortunately, the defaults are Google, Yahoo, or Bing.  But if you click manage search engines,  you'll see that there are other search engines  that they know about.  And if it's not in there, which it's not,  it's funny, they have Pirate Bay, but not DuckDuckGo.  You can add DuckDuckGo, we can call it DG for the keyword.  And you just need a special string,  which would be DuckDuckGo, slash, question mark,  Q equals, exclamation mark, plus percent S.  That S will be, percent S will be substituted  with the search string that you type in.  So once you do that, now you can add,  now you can use DuckDuckGo for searching  by typing in here, DDG.  I don't think you can make it default, unfortunately.  That would be nice, but I think that that's maybe a little,  that's something that they don't let you do.  And then my tool is a little Facebook tool that I,  all right, I'm a sucker for this crap.  Such a, this is why I will, Facebook's got me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The time-  You rejected them before, and you came back,  and now you are their-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I'm their puppet.  Thank you.  TimelineMoviemaker.com makes a movie.  Now you have to have a timeline,  and everybody's got one now in the next couple of weeks,  we'll all have a timeline.  And if you click, if you go there,  it will actually make a movie out of your timeline  with music and everything.  You know, I love these.  And if you've put some energy into the timeline,  there's music on this too, I think.  If you put some energy into your timeline, you get,  you don't hear in the audio?  That's exciting.  Yeah, that was a mistake, but you can change anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They look for, apparently, you saying the word Facebook,  because that's the only place I ever say it on video,  and they found it.  So you can change these defaults.  This is just the random, this is my life.  Las Vegas Hilton, Cal Trans Worker.  But it's pretty dramatic.  Is it recording?  Yes.  The way they've done this is actually pretty cool.  It is.  And I think this is a Facebook company,  TimelineMoviemaker.com.  And you have, after they've made the movie,  you have your choice of different music,  and you can actually say, don't use that picture,  use this picture, and stuff like that.  I think that's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So if you're gonna, you can share it on your page,  and you can make your own movie,  and change settings and so forth.  Pretty clever, I say.  Sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  One last check, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One more time to Edgar search results.  We go into the breach, dear friends.  Nope.  Last thing they posted on Edgar is 2008.  So maybe it isn't today.  You did see Loic Lemur posting on Path,  saying, I asked Sheryl Sandberg at WEF,  I congratulated her on the IPO, and she just smiled.  But he says the smile was the kind of wide smile  you'd make when you're gonna be a billionaire in a vat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much is she probably already worth?  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, she has some stock, right, I presume.  That's what I mean from Google.  Oh, from Google, yeah.  Hey, you know, you can always, another billion,  it's always welcome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good for Sheryl.  She does good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm envisioning the Sheryl Sandberg scholarship,  but that's just, there.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  There you go, let's see.  That'll happen.  Yeah, let's see.  You know, I actually really am starting to admire Bill Gates.  He did an interview I just read,  where he's really putting,  he says, my kids will inherit nothing.  I'm gonna take it all,  there's a small trust for each of them,  and then I'm gonna take it all  and put it back into the world for good.  And I just, that's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All around, I mean, he's a creature of Davos now,  and so all around, people would just pop up and say,  boy, I can't believe it, but I really admire Bill Gates.  And you just see that meme happening again and again  and again, and for good reason.  He's doing amazing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It probably was an interview at Davos, actually.  Yeah, and he's no longer the richest man because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No?  Oh, by the way, our friend Bill Gross,  who was on the show once before,  has a neat new company, I forget the name of it,  but Idealab, that I saw at Davos,  where it's a $1,500 solar electric powered house.  That's, they built their first one.  It's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  So.  Good on Bill.  We should get him back again.  I love him.  Yeah, he's great.  Jeff Jarvis at the City University of New York.  Read his book, Public Parts.  It's a must.  You gots to read it.  Gina Trippani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
