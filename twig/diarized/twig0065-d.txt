Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's great to be here.  Great to be back from my offline vacation.  There's actually a world out there, you guys, like off the internet.  No, no.  I have pictures, swear.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if I can get my Google car to drive there, I'll go.  Okay.  Okay.  Only if my Google car will go there.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis with BuzzMachine.com and he's a professor at CUNY and our CUNY,  as they say, and the author of What Would Google Do?  Just the three of us today, which makes it nice and easy.  We just got off Steve Jobs' surprisingly, actually, elaborate presentation.  They announced new MacBook Airs.  But more importantly, and I'm curious what you guys thought about this, announced a App  Store for OS X, which will be available when Lion comes out in the summer of 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry, Jeff.  No, I was asking you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My first reaction was, oh, God, like if they're going to take, they're going to turn the MacBook  Pro, which is my machine, they're going to take the laptops and make them into iPads,  which means they're going to be the gatekeeper and I'm going to have to ask Apple for me  the time I install something, which is not the case.  Right?  I was kind of saying that the App Store is going to be one way to buy apps, the best  way Apple will believe, but it's not going to be like the iPad where you can only get  apps that way.  But I just felt myself kind of full of dread.  There's this dichotomy with OS X.  There's this appeal to the consumer.  It's so easy and so pretty.  It's just you don't have to think.  But then there's this appeal to geeks.  The reason why the Mac is my development machine is because I can fire up a terminal and have  all the Unix tools available to me.  It's a power user's machine.  And so when I hear about things like the App Store, it makes me nervous.  I think they're dumbing down this operating system, this machine that I really love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And in some ways, it's a response, isn't it?  It's a response.  It's almost as if the real...  You see this every time we saw it on Twitter, Facebook, every kind of time the geeks have  something, AOL even, then the real people come along and they ruin it.  It's like the Nehru jacket.  Yeah.  We've been wearing that for a while, you and me, didn't we?  My parents wouldn't let me.  And then everybody's wearing polyester with flower prints on it and it's ruined.  Is that what's happening?  Is this the gentrification of computing?  There must be a nice way to put this, but the universality of computing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think after I kind of thought about it a little bit, Apple gets the consumer market.  This is what people want.  I mean, we're geeks.  We have our networks.  We have our blogs.  I want to know what the best app is.  I know to check with Leo, right?  But a normal person doesn't know that, doesn't know about Lifehacker or CNET.  So I can understand the need for having an app store where kind of the best and the brightest  apps are featured there.  I get it and I can see that it's smart and Steve is steadfast in his position about curation  and about making it very easy and so people don't have to think.  I do think it's smart.  It's not really my style.  I'm not the target market for the app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think there's two things about this.  One is I think it's a howitzer, yet another howitzer across Google's bow with the Chrome  marketplace of apps there and that the architecture of having apps through Chrome and through  an online marketplace is where Google was headed anywhere and Apple rushed and announced  as getting there perhaps first.  The second part about it is I think you're both right and I have the same fear interpretation.  On the other hand, as I'm thinking about it, I'm wondering whether this doesn't open  up the ability for more developers to get more apps out into the computer marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's probably good for developers.  Developers like the app store on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly.  And I think that before if you wanted to create an alternative to Microsoft Word, well, you  know, Star Office did.  That was about it.  Right.  And you really couldn't do it.  So if you wanted to create a great tax application and people were going to buy and download  and install, you know, the CD shelf version is long gone.  CompUSA may you rest in peace.  And there was no way to distribute it.  So at least it is a way for developers to distribute.  But like you both, I fear that when it comes to Chrome OS, Android OS, iOS, and, you know,  and what kind of rules they're all going to come up with, especially Apple, who knows  how that gets bifurcated and messed up.  And the irony, by the way, too, is that Steve is schvitzing all over Android for being,  you know, split apart in various devices.  Fragmented is the word he used.  Fragmented, thank you.  And in essence now, he's just fragmented Apple a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, somebody's pointing out in the chat room, look, there's app stores on Ubuntu.  Ubuntu has actually is one of the things that Michael Rogers did back at Linux.com.  He made an app store.  The idea being, well, it was really hard to install apps on Linux.  So why don't we make it easy?  But that doesn't preclude, you know, using RPMs or even make and build and doing your  own thing.  I'm not, we don't know if Apple will.  I just, I worry because I do see this as a theme in Apple, which is we know best.  We want to control the experience from end to end, whether it's music, video or apps.  And this is going to give a better user experience.  So we're going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a valid approach and it's worked for them so far.  So I say go for it.  It's not my style, but I can understand.  I mean, it's working for them.  And to their credit, they do a really good job with the exception of a few problems of  controlling, of, you know, creating a great experience.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me ask you both another question if I could real quick.  Sure.  And I watched my 13 year old, my 14 year old daughter teaching herself Final Cut.  My son basically taught himself programming at a high end.  Android now has, you know, the make it yourself app device.  If we bring that level of creativity down to more people, do you think there's ever  going to be authoring tools like Final Cut, like WordPress that come to making applications?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that what the Google Android app is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the start of that.  I mean, it's awkward, but, but, but, you know, that could be something that comes and goes  when we reminisce about it in five years and thought that was cute.  You know, is it possible for the, you know, if you're making a video, it has like Haiku  or Shakespeare, right?  It has limits around it.  You know what it is and you have it.  You can make a tool to do that.  A blog, you're writing things, you can put videos on it again.  It has space around it.  Can you ever imagine doing that with applications such that you could have, you know, citizen  programmers like crazy out there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's, yeah, I think that's definitely possible.  I mean, when the World Cup was airing, if a sports fan, you know, could just download,  you know, a net SDK and make the Vubazela app, you know, that's a very, very simple  app. It was up to the moment.  It was the kind of thing that you'd want to be able to create.  It would be very easy, easy to create and distribute.  You know, that's something that kind of, you know, anybody should be able to do.  You shouldn't have to be a programmer to make an app that simple.  I think, yeah, creating simple apps with kind of, I mean, the danger is that it's just  going to be kind of templates.  You know, you need people who have, are clever and can, you know, if there's a news item  or a hook or an interesting, you know, the true innovation is probably still going to  become from programmers who can dive in a little deeper and go beyond what the scripted  actions let you do. But I do think that there's definitely a market for apps, you know,  civilian programmers who can make apps that do things, especially, especially timely  things. You know, someone should be able to throw together a timely app and get it out  the app store who doesn't know a whole lot of programming pretty easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So there's the more I headed here then is I wonder that the irony of the closed  anti-democratic dictatorship of Apple is whether there's a possibility here of more  of a democratization of applications between that and and Chrome with its model that more  people can get more apps to more people and can make them more easily and can get revenue  for them. And do we create a new application economy here that then, you know, it's like  blogs. It encourages the creation of better and better tools.  Yes, blogs are formatted, perhaps still too much, but you can do an incredible amount  now with WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you can. I think blogs is a really good is a really good metaphor for this.  You put easy blogging tools in the hands of folks who are just really smart and don't  want to have to deal with writing HTML and you get some really great blogs.  And I think this can definitely happen with the app store.  And it's already happened. You know, you know, the distribution channel is a good thing  for developers. And if we can make the tools really easy for anyone to make apps and get  it into that channel, then we'll be rock and rolling.  That would be a good thing for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Apple agreement in the store, somebody just sent me a link to it, says that we may  we reserve the right to reject any app any time for any reason, even if it meets our  even if it meets our standards.  So they're going to tightly control this in the same way they control the iOS app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you think Steve wishes there were a day that this kind of architecture could have  existed from the beginning of Macintosh's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe, you know, he may not have consciously known it, but I think as time goes by, this  becomes more, you know, I think Steve's gone maybe through some changes.  Apple used the next operating system, which was open and based on open source software.  Darwin is open. So I think Steve showed support early on for open software.  But I think as time goes by, he for business reasons and perhaps for aesthetic reasons  and maybe even for user reasons, wants to close things down and control it much, much  more tightly than before.  Let's play the this is this is Steve Jobs.  On Monday, he joined the rare made a rare appearance on the earnings call with analysts  jumped in to rant against Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen, and have around 90,000 apps in their app store.  For comparison, Apple has activated around two hundred and seventy five thousand iOS  devices per day on average for the past 30 days, with a peak of almost three hundred  thousand iOS devices per day on a few of those days.  And Apple has three hundred thousand apps on its app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he's saying the numbers Google's giving out on activations, the number of apps in  the Android store don't even compare.  And it's certainly Apple had a lot to crow about 14.1 million units sold over the last  quarter is a lot of iPhones, more than they've ever sold before.  But he goes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unfortunately, there is no solid data on how many Android phones are shipped each  quarter. We hope that manufacturers will soon start reporting the number of Android  handsets they ship each quarter.  But today that just isn't the case.  Gartner reported that around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sounds like he's reading.  Yeah, this is prepared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ten million Android phones were shipped in the June quarter, and we await to see if  iPhone or Android was the winner in this most recent quarter.  Google loves to characterize Android as open and iOS and iPhone as closed.  We find this a bit disingenuous and clouding the real difference between our two  approaches. The first thing most of us think about when we hear the word open.  It is Windows, which is available on a variety of devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not in anyone else's world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, and this is this is so clearly misdirection from Steve Jobs.  He knows better than that.  He is he is conflating open as an open source with something completely different.  And and he ends up calling it fragmentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen like Windows, however, where most PCs have the same user interface and run the  same app, Android is very fragmented.  Many Android OEM, including the two largest HTC and Motorola, install proprietary user  interfaces to differentiate themselves from the commodity Android experience.  The users left to figure it all out.  Compare this with iPhone, where every handset works the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is so carefully crafted.  Every word in this now that I hear it, he's clearly reading and every word is very  carefully chosen here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No doubt. Would you expect anything less from him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's double. It's double.  It's right. Yes.  But this is double speak.  This is this is open as closed.  I mean, this is something very different.  It almost I have to say it does not.  It feels a little evil.  Steve is really taking the Google threat quite seriously here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Obviously, right. He wouldn't have showed up if he didn't.  And I and I love how this kicked off this whole conversation about what is open.  There was quite a few responses, right.  Andy Rubin, Andy Rubin responded on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Joe Hewitt. I loved Andy Rubin's response, which was open equals and he shows out of  he gives the commands to build Android right from from GitHub from get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you you and I love that.  Right. But I think a lot of other people were like, well, I had no idea what that meant.  But that is open. The source is available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's publishable. You can build it from source.  You can modify source.  Trust it. Yes, that's open.  Windows is the right area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He used that you reminded me of that.  That's that's so much a tie to my wonky media world is fragmentation.  And when we got new choice in cable and VCRs, the big old media controllers,  the centralized companies whined about fragmentation.  Fragmentation is just another word for choice.  Yes. And so that's that's the war that Steve's having within himself is he hates  choice unless it's his choice.  This is what's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is, you know, I don't this.  I don't know if this is always been Steve's always been this way or he's suddenly gotten  some religion. He's certainly the time is right, because with the security problems  that you see on Windows that you you're absolutely going to see on Android.  There is going to be a battening down of the hatches and consumers are going to,  I think, flock to this notion of choice is bad.  Fragmentation is bad.  We want somebody to hold our hands, but that's a dictatorship.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's listen some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter client Twitter deck recently launched their app for Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, it's tweet deck, Steve and the CEO of Tweet Deck said this is all BS.  This is all BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's so clueless about social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twitter deck.  You think if he wrote it, he'd have written it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That they had to contend with more than 100 different versions of Android software  on 244 different handsets.  The multiple hardware and software iterations presents developers with a daunting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  challenge. The CEO of Tweet Deck, by the way, said, no, we actually were very happy  to develop for Android.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm really amazed that it worked.  What we were saying was we were amazed and delighted how it worked across.  It worked fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is this, you know, Steve would have had the same ran against Windows  10 years ago.  Look at all the different choices.  You know, you just want one choice, don't you?  Let's continue on.  I'm sorry, it's getting me angry as I listen.  You're so right, Leo, it's so scripted.  It's not only scripted, it's it's  it feels  it's disinformation.  Yeah, this isn't just advertising or marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But this is this is the revolt.  The irony is, is that he's such an old fart at such a young company age,  but he's acting just like Rupert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Murdoch strikes me as Rupert Murdoch would say stuff like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, exactly what is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I can't I won't play anymore.  By the way, the audio comes from Business Insider dot com slash  SAI, the Silicon Alley Insider.  Thank you, Blodgett. Thank you, Henry, recorded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it sounds like Harry Truman talking about the atom bomb, you know,  that is that that ghostly feel.  That little voice of Steve's.  I'm very unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did Chris DeBonis say? He said something like I'm so glad that Steve  talked about Android. I like Android a lot, too, and I talk about it a lot,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Chris is telling you that he spent so much time talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it is, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, he's clearly threatened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's almost an E-Day fix.  It's like he can't get off of it.  Yeah. Yeah.  OK, I know we can.  This is just amazing.  It's fascinating. I have to say it's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think we're seeing we're seeing a clash of,  you know, of of cultures and economies and ways to do things.  Yeah. And that's what Eric Schmidt always says is that Google disrupts.  And it's as simple as that. Google disrupts.  That's what they do. That's what I realized as I'm writing the syllabus  for my next course in our entrepreneurial journalism program.  That's what I have to teach is disruption.  How do you look for the weak underbelly and go for it?  And so Steve comes back once disrupted and has to defend  his worldview against the disruptor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, in maybe in kind of well, not in.  I don't think it's in his defense, but Joe Hewitt tweeted a long stream.  This is all in TechCrunch in response to all of this.  He says, how can Google how does Android get away with the open moniker  when the source isn't public until major releases and no one outside Google  can check in, which is a technical thing, meaning that you cannot add  to the Android source code tree unless you are approved and at Google.  So it's not a fully open source project in that sense.  Does that but does it still qualify as open source, Gina, in your opinion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I thought that Joe's points were very, very good  and definitely gave me pause.  I mean, the way most open source projects run is that you earn commit access  to the repository regardless of what organization that you're with. Right.  But but he's saying that only Google, only people at Google can commit. Right.  So any any developer can submit a patch, but only someone in Google  can commit it. And he's also saying that daily progress isn't public  and is not available like the source code.  You know, the daily nightly build from last night of Android is not available.  The source becomes public after each major release.  And this is this is unusual.  This is not the way most kind of, you know, you know, in Joe's view anyway,  truly open projects are run.  I mean, I think the reality is that the word open and open source  represents this like really big community and concept  that has lots of different factions inside of it.  You know, you're going to the Stalmanites have different definitions.  That's true. Or free and open.  And I was I and you can run open source projects in a lot of different  a lot of different ways.  And Google controls Android.  They build Android and but you know, but they're they're using kind of the open name.  I do believe Android is open source.  It is open that you can download the source and compile it, as Andy said.  But I thought that Joe's point was very good and kind of interesting  that he was making it right.  He was saying, look at Firefox as an example of a true open source project  where people from lots of different organizations earn commit access over time.  This is the way, you know, generally a project comes up with guidelines  and you have to kind of earn your stripes to get commit access.  And that, you know, all everything is public.  And that is kind of a core community value of an open source project.  Everything is public always. Right.  But this is this is a very difficult model to have when you're building

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a commercial product, especially a cell phone product  where security becomes a big issue. Right. Absolutely.  I mean, Motorola, you've got to think Motorola, HTC  and all these other companies are saying, well,  you're not going to open commit access to anybody, but somebody that, you know,  we vetted and prove of or we're not going to use it.  And you're not going to open it.  However, Hewitt says, and I don't think he's wrong, that is disingenuous  is the term he used of Google to claim it is open.  He says, Andy Rubin bragging about downloading a month old code dump  is not open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. Let me ask it this way.  Is it as open as it can be, given the limitations you just had?  Well, that's the question. I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The opener, I think we're in a different we're in a new world.  Yeah. And this isn't and I bemoan it.  But this is not developing for a desktop computer.  This is developing for an inherently closed device  because it gets on a network and and, you know, you've got to get a wireless  carrier to carry it, you've got to get a handset carrier to manufacture it  and adopt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, but the thing is, is that people people to earn commit access  because they go through thorough code review through the whole community.  I mean, these aren't you just don't give out commit access randomly.  You know what I mean?  And so I feel like Google could probably give commit access to other people.  Eventually, I don't know, maybe the product is too young.  Maybe Google is super crazy about being controlled.  Maybe HTC, maybe the manufacturers are pressuring them to say that only  only Google, you know, only Google employees should be able to commit.  Maybe Google and this is probably surely what happens.  Google probably has a whole battery of tests and and  checklists that they go through before they commit any sort of patch.  And they don't and people outside the organization just don't have access  to those tools. You know, I don't know.  I don't know. But I have to say, he would points really kind of made me pause.  I've been learning a lot about open source, you know, kind of community  and culture just through my own work.  And it was a very interesting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, was WAVE going to be different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, a lot of WAVES code was was not public either.  I mean, they were kind of releasing it in in WAVES.  Excuse the excuse the bomb.  But but, you know, even WAVE in a box, I think they're they're getting there  to releasing it to the point where it's all out there.  But you could not when I wrote the book, you could not download  all the code of WAVE and run it right because it was it was it had its tentacles  into sort of internal Google systems.  But that but it should get to that point.  So but but so WAVE was similar to the way Android is run.  And I believe I'm not sure how Chrome is done, actually.  I'm not sure if nightly builds of Chrome are.  I guess maybe a little more.  You can get nightly builds. You can get. Yeah.  And so there's the Chromium project and then there's Chrome.  And Chrome is kind of this the official Google release of Chromium.  So I'm not sure why they don't run Android the same way.  But you can build secure software using open source model.  I mean, Firefox has to be secure and they ran it kind of the open Joe Hewitt way.  So I don't know if that's a reason why they would limit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Part of this, too, is if we get to the problem with religions and purity is  well, the advantage of it is it holds somebody true to a principle.  The disadvantage of it is that it gets all snotty and kind of lost in the navel.  And I don't know enough to know which this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that the main point, I think Andy made it earlier,  is that open is not a user feature, right?  This is a developer religion fight, you know, and I feel like in terms of the consumer,  can Android claim that the label open?  I would say, yes, it's open enough as far as I'm concerned.  That the really religious open source folks might not agree with me.  But but he was points are good ones, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My favorite point in the Woody Allen movie, Annie Hall,  is when he's standing in line at a movie and some blowhards going on and on about  Marshall McLuhan and Woody Allen says, well, I happen I think you're all wrong.  And I happen to have Marshall McLuhan right here.  And I want you to know what he thinks.  So I got Kevin Marks right here.  And I thought, well, let's see what Kevin Marks thinks, because Kevin worked at Google.  Kevin is a developer. Kevin knows open source.  He's currently at British Telecom, where he's working on it.  I just reread Medium is Massage this week while we wait for Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's incredible how much he predicts the world you are in today.  He was prescient, wasn't he?  Boy, Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin, I'm glad you were in the chat room and I saw your tweet and in the chat room.  I'm glad I'm glad you're listening and I'm glad we could get you on unplanned.  Thank you.  Nice to join in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was I was fascinated by Jobs Rand because he has been on both ends of this argument.  If you actually look at how they work with Darwin, Darwin initially, though, you were  you were you there at that time?  Were you?  Yes.  OK.  And we also did this with some of the QuickTime stuff we did with the streaming.  We had open source streaming services.  We did it the proper way where we were using the source code that was publicly released.  And that's ideally that's what you want to do.  You want to release the source code you're actually working on as the project.  You want to make the commits go across across the boundaries.  And there are some issues with that.  There are places where that's valuable and where that isn't.  The other classic example where Apple has done this right is WebKit.  WebKit, the foundation for the browsers on the iPhone and the Android and Safari, is  And Chrome was an Apple project originally.  And they did this right.  They made it a fully public open source project with public bug databases, commit trees and so  on.  But they did have private forks that they would use to build the next version for the  Safari and for the iPhone.  So that that's if you want to precedent for something that's been that's done this better  than Android has, that would be one.  Android does it the other way around where they do the private development and then every  time they release a new version, they push that out to the public one.  So they have a Git repository, but it's not a GitHub repository.  It's a repository that lives at Google and you can pull from it, but there isn't any way to  request for them to pull from you.  And that will be one way they could do that will be to bridge that to a public GitHub  repository so that the public forks of it, variations could be connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So is Android open the way it's constructed now?  And do you think it's, you know, it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this is what Gina was saying.  It's one of these fuzzy boundaries.  It's an open source project.  The code is available.  You can build the whole thing.  And that that is very powerful.  And I was saying this is the first time we've had an actual open source consumer operating  system that has widespread adoption.  And that is this sort of weird, powerful thing where there's this Cameron explosion of devices  appearing in China that have got Android deployed in it.  But Android has two halves.  There's the lower half, which is the fully open source piece that you can download and deploy  that on a device, write some drivers and then have the apps run on it.  And there's another piece that you don't get unless you make a deal with Google.  And then you get the little thing on the back of your phone that says with Google, which  that means that you have signed a deal with Google and done a business business with them.  You've got you then get the app store.  You get Gmail.  You get maps and nav.  You get a bunch of the Google specific apps that aren't open source.  And in order to do that, you have to comply with Google's definition of what they consider  an Android phone to be, which is a long list of must have a camera, must have this, must have that.  So there's a set of things you have to do to comply with it.  So that's the way they've done this.  They split it that way.  They said there's an open source piece at the bottom.  And then there's a piece at the top where we can still have biz dev and control and do the thing.  And a lot of that is negotiating with the carriers.  They want to make sure that they can release the source for the carriers.  The carriers were aware of this initially.  And so they would do a fork for each new device.  And for each release of Android, there will be a couple of manufacturers they work very closely with.  So initially it was the G1.  And then there was the release they did with the Droid and then recently with the Nexus 1.  And they were saying, OK, we will iterate on this with you.  You will get first down to date and then we'll push it out to the world.  And they're still broadly doing that model, I think.  And they may change it over time.  But the interesting thing for me is that there's an opportunity here for somebody to say, well, OK,  we take the bottom half of here.  What about this top half with Google half?  Could somebody build something to swap in on top of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, isn't that kind of what...  Isn't that kind of what Whatsisname is doing with these ROMs that he's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cyanogen?  Cyanogen, yeah.  Not so much, no.  That's more modifying the bottom half and releasing a new bottom half.  And then you can fiddle around to bring the Google pieces on top.  More interesting there is that Facebook could say, OK, we will build you the contact manager,  the mail manager, all the bits on top.  They'd have to license the nav part, but they could probably swap in most of the pieces  that Google have there.  Or Microsoft could do this.  If Microsoft wanted to...  Wouldn't that be interesting?  Microsoft could say, OK, we have email, we have contact management, how to do this.  We could put this stuff on top.  Because of the way it's constructed, Google couldn't really stop them.  Or again, Apple could do this.  Apple would probably not have any interest.  But in effect, this is what Google did with WebKit for Chrome.  They took the core of the open source piece that Apple had built for their browsers  and built desktop browsers on it of their own and mobile browsers on their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Will there ever be a mobile Linux?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Android is mobile Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Android is Linux.  Android is Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The bottom half of Android is Linux, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In terms of the way it operates, the structure.  Do you fork off the open Android, as Kevin is suggesting, and make it as open as Linux is?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  The other Android is under...  Which license is it?  I'll just double check the license.  I think it's Apache license.  Am I right there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's something as unrestrictive as Apache, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's where I'm going.  It can be as open as anything else.  The question is, when Google stands as a middleman to add applications and security,  are they adding sufficient value?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But the interesting thing for me is that it's already being used in this way by these  hardware manufacturers around the world.  That's the fragmentation that Steve was talking about.  Yes, this is the fragmentation, Steve Sumner.  The Android manufacturers are building little tiny tablets or great big tablets or seven-inch  tablets.  They're charging $100 for them.  They're deploying Android on them.  They're often a bit underpowered and they don't behave well.  They're subject to the kind of criticisms that Steve is making of them, potentially.  He says, no, if you put too slow a presser, it won't feel right.  Yeah, that's maybe potentially true.  On the other hand, if you're a manufacturer who's making photo frames, you can make a  photo frame that runs Android and integrates with Flickr and Facebook because it's running  the Flickr and Facebook apps.  If you were some guy before who was building the little photo frames that you buy in Walmart  for $50 that you use to display digital photos, suddenly you've got the ability to put a much  more interesting device in that domain.  I think we're going to see a lot of this weird set of applications that work there.  Yeah, the developers have to go, wait, I have to make this work on a photo frame?  But half the time it will.  And if you're doing something that's straightforward, that is basically a display-like app,  like most of the iPhone and Android apps are, it's like pausing information some way displayed  on there, those will all work.  If you're doing something subtle and complicated that's integrating with a subtle UI and things  like that, yeah, that will be more work to port.  But the easy things to port will be the ones that are these most display-like apps or these  information sharing apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is Joe Hewitt right when he condemns Google and says it's disingenuous to call itself open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not disingenuous.  He's worked for a company that has something called the Open Graph Protocol, which is a  proprietary node schema.  So it's easy to sort of be snotty about open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is more of just the open source nitpicking and infighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's lots of definitions of open.  It depends what you're trying to say.  Right.  But it is not Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we can agree that Steve is at most.  We can all agree that it's not Windows.  Now, you must know Steve fairly well, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not that well known.  I never, I didn't work that closely to Steve.  I'm just curious.  Has Steve agreed to move?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeff asked this great question.  Is this something Steve has been planning all along or did he suddenly get an insight  and say, hmm, forget open, we're going to go to proprietary?  I have to think that the bottom line profits that iOS has brought into the company have  certainly influenced him just a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's, I think it's, it's products.  Steve cares most of all about products and making a beautiful product.  And so he, you know, he doesn't care about open source politics.  He does not care about it as far as particularly, no, you know, the fact that they did the whole,  you know, that they did web get the way they did, which was absolutely right.  It was a great thing.  And it has been a massive contribution to the, to the web.  No, no argument with that at all.  And that that is that team there is doing sterling work.  And the fact that WebKit now is an open source project by even Joe Hewitt's definition.  And there's no majority of committers from any one company is a great thing for the future  of the web that we've got.  You know, we've now got two competing open source browsers.  We've got the, the, the Mozilla browser and we've got the WebKit browser.  Then we've got the other variations on the theme from that from other companies is a great,  you know, is a great and wonderful thing.  That's and that's, you know, that's gave them the advanced initiative, the original iPhone.  That was the development method.  It did the sort of releasing their internal OS thing came later.  I'm hoping that the FaceTime thing will go the same way.  I was really surprised.  They did a standalone FaceTime app on the Mac and they didn't integrate it into iChat.  That's just bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, we, we had Becky grabbed Steve at the demo and asked him and I'm going to point,  you know, I should play the actual quote because I think I'm misquoting it, but basically  asked him, um, are you going to, are you, are you going to eventually release as you  had promised released the open, uh, cause he says it's based on an open stack.  Are you going to open it up to other developers like Skype?  And he gave a non denial denial.  Basically he said, that's not what I said.  So we don't, we don't know.  I, I suspect that he gave what he did say.  Okay.  Yeah, I'll get it.  We have it.  I have it right here.  I just have to play it.  We can, we can hear it directly.  It was by the way, there's some irony in this.  It was via Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Becky's trying to go over and talk to Steve jobs.  Let's listen in and see what's going on.  Forgive me.  Becky and approaches Steve jobs here.  I'm sorry about the speed.  I like it Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Steve's making the rounds, talking to the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something's going on with the chipmunk.  This is by the way, a first for us, a FaceTime call to the Apple campus.  I do a FaceTime work on the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think that I do think that there's a question whether the Macbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Makes sense.  Hold on.  Hold on.  She's, she's talking to Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Say that again.  Yeah, one of the machines.  I've been using one and they're great.  You like it a lot?  He's never said it better.  It fits in the bag and you take it with you everywhere?  You don't even need a bag.  2.3, 2.9 pounds.  Can I, can I ask you one other question?  Does the fact that we now have FaceTime just on the Mac mean we won't see APIs for other  video conferencing?  We didn't say any such thing.  Okay.  Just checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We didn't say that.  Now there you go.  I think that's our first.  That's a first.  I'm sorry about the chipmunk.  I don't know what that's all about.  Same job.  Sounds like this.  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead.  So that's interesting because what he said before at the iPhone launch was this is built on an  open set of protocols.  You want to standardize it.  These are the people who can work with them.  Right.  Since then, silence.  And other people have poked at it and they said there's a, we found the set of open standards  here.  It is using vanilla sip and stun and to do all the conferencing stuff.  But there's a piece that isn't there, which is the ID.  Apple.com thing that you do when you start it up where it says, okay, give me your handle.  And then it goes and looks the handle up in their database.  On their server.  Yeah.  And gets back your endpoints.  And they have a mapping from phone numbers and they have a mapping from emails.  But don't they have to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you have to do something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to do something like that.  But that's the piece that would be really nice to do in an open way.  You know, Blaine and I here are working on Webfinger.  Blaine is doing huge amounts of work getting people to adopt this and build it around the  world, which is designed to let you go from an email address to other services in a general  open way.  And it'd be great if we could use something like that for this.  Apple has built another little closed thing and they've made it very closed and not published  how to do it.  Which means that the moment you have to be running their software and connecting to their  servers over a secure connection to do this.  And that's the sort of the missing registration piece.  And that means that it is very smooth.  It means that you can click through very quickly.  But it means that that is the piece that has got the lock-in baked into it.  The rest of it, they've done a really good implementation of these standardized internet  protocols for doing video calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to let you go, Kevin.  Thank you for jumping in.  Our Marshall McLuhan.  Hey, by the way, did you see the FaceTime movie?  What did you think?  The Facebook movie.  Facebook movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, yeah, I thought it wasn't as good as The Man in the White Suit.  It was, it was, it was against geeks and against women.  It was this sort of shocking thing.  I knew you said that, but I just wanted to get you to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was a great comparison you made.  I love that.  Yeah, the great Alec Guinness movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you haven't seen that movie, that is a great geek movie.  I would recommend everyone to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All of the, that was an Ealing comedy, right?  All those Ealing comedies.  1951 it was.  Brilliant.  But he's an inventor, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He invents, he invents a kind of fabric that is a single molecule  and therefore cannot be snapped and also repels dirt.  So he makes them like the perfect cloth.  And there's a, but the way, the way the invention works and,  you know, he's doing it for the sake of it and everyone doesn't believe him.  You know, the actual structure of the story is so much better.  And it has like plausible female characters in it who actually make sense  and contributes to the plot rather than just being eye candy for the, for Alan Sulk.  And that was 1951.  And this was 1951.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing.  We're regressing.  The Man in the White Suit?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Man in the White Suit.  Look at any Alec Guinness movie.  That and Horses Mouth is my favorite.  Horses Mouth.  Brilliant.  He's the painter.  I love Alec Guinness.  Any Ealing comedy, any Alec Guinness movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's what you just said, Kevin too.  It's what Mark Zuckerberg said at TechCrunch, which is that you make it for the sake of it.  You don't understand making something because you want to make it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And that's the thing Jobs says too.  Jobs is making these products because he loves to make the products.  But he's a very physical hardware focused guy.  The software is a means to the end.  And you know, a lot of media people project on he wants to own media.  No, no, he wants to keep making beautiful products.  These other pieces are a means to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's good to remember that.  Although on the conference call, he said,  you're thinking like a hardware guy.  We think like software guys.  So now I'm completely confused.  Steve, he'll say what makes sense.  Steve says what Steve says.  He's got his own agenda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We know he's a design guy.  That's the point.  He's a design guy.  Integrated design.  I think that's the thing as a whole.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's about making hardware that's just a canvas that the software can paint on.  You know, it's all it's really it's about the aesthetics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love this word platform.  And that's really the question.  Are you building a platform or are you building an end game?  If you're building a platform, it has to be open so that others can develop for it.  And, you know, maybe Windows wasn't open in the open source sense,  but it was an open platform.  And that was the secret of the success.  And the revolution, a PC revolution occurred because of that.  The Internet, an open platform.  That was the secret of the success.  The minute you close your platform,  I don't know what you have, but you don't have something that really is good for the ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And that's the challenge is always balancing between the development you can do,  sort of sitting alone without having to talk to everyone and the development you can do  where you're building a platform that connects.  And the biggest challenge is building a platform that's open enough that everyone can contribute to it.  It's the same thing.  That's what we have with the web.  Yeah.  It's the same thing Facebook and Google have to do with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Twitter and Twitter and Twitter is not an open platform.  I mean, they have an API, but and all these people built on what they thought was a platform,  their third party Twitter clients.  Sorry.  Rug pulled right out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But again, it's more open than Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting.  There's something.  Facebook are getting better at this.  Facebook actually have a large install base of apps that they were installed inside Facebook,  and they've edged them off to the edge of Facebook.  They've connected to the web now.  Twitter seems to be sort of edging away from that.  Facebook has done a bunch of stuff recently where they have been  more prone to work with the open standards staff.  They say they want to be a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Explicitly.  They say we want to be a platform.  Yeah.  And I think Zuckerberg said we made a mistake early on with FBML.  We are now moving to open APIs and open standards because we want to be a platform.  FBML was a bad mistake.  I thought that was very telling.  It was interesting.  He said that recently.  I think that there are this is a natural tension, the tension to being an open platform  and the tension to doing what's good for your business short term.  Because what's good for your business is saying, I want it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it isn't.  It isn't.  I mean, but that's naturally constraining.  And yeah, the challenge is looking at the longer term and saying,  can I build something that will last?  Can I build something that could survive this company going out of business?  I used to say this at Google when we were talking about open social.  Open social can survive Google going out of business because it is fully open sources  deployed by lots of companies and so on.  And Google has got a bit bored with it now and they're not paying as much attention.  But IBM is working on it.  Salesforce is working on it.  Bunch of other people are working on that same code base because they found something  to value it and they keep growing it.  And because it's a fully open specification and there's a big chunk of open source code  there to implement it, they can do that.  And that's what makes it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I guess you could say that for iOS too.  300,000 apps.  It must be a platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, sure.  It is a platform, but it has a bunch of lock in there that means that Apple can change  their mind on you.  They can pull the rug out for you.  They can do it very explicitly in the short term by throwing your app out.  But in the longer term, they can do it by not developing it anymore or deprecating it.  Jobs stood up at D and said, we were right to kill Hypercard.  Well, he can say that.  And the rest of us out here were using Hypercard.  We're like, wait.  I'm dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dying.  We interviewed Woz on Wednesday and I asked him what was the most important technological  invention of his era.  He said Hypercard.  Not the Apple II, not the Mac, Hypercard because it let people write their own stuff.  Right.  Yeah.  It's that what you were talking about right there, Jeff.  It was something that made it easy to develop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a combination of tools, distribution and monetization.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My installation with Hypercard was never that easy, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I remember there were some little tiny things at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It never had a way to package your stuff and distribute it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we had to do commercial CD-ROM publishing.  Now I built, I sold a bunch of those in the 90s.  They worked and people would buy them, but it was expensive CDs in shops type publishing.  It wasn't web distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll always love getting Kevin on.  It gets your mind going here.  Thank you, Kevin Marks.  Ribbit.com from British Telecom.  We're going to take a break, come back with more of this week in Google.  Thanks, Kevin.  Take care.  Cheers.  Bye-bye.  We have such smart people who are listening and following us and I love it.  They tweet and they chat and they say, let me on, I want to talk.  It's a privilege.  More with Gina and Jeff in just a bit.  I want to talk about carbonite.com.  It's a privilege to talk about them.  I'm very happy that if we didn't have the sponsors we do on these shows, we would not  be able to do these shows.  Companies like Carbonite say, hey, we love supporting what you're doing.  I say this back to them.  We feel like you have a product that our audience wants to hear about that is a great product that  really solves a problem, a need we all have for backup, reliable backup.  And not just backup to an external drive next to your computer, because that's not really  backup if the worst happens, a fire or flood or whatever, you've lost it.  It's backup to the cloud where it's secure.  You can get it anytime from any computer, anywhere you can get online.  You can even, they have free iPhone and Blackberry apps too.  You can get your data from that.  And it's automatic so you don't have to think, oh, did I back up this week?  No, it's always backing up.  As long as you're online, it's always backing up.  And because it uses SSL, even if you're an open access spot, it doesn't matter.  Your backup is secure.  It's safe.  You use AES 256.  If you want to really make it private, I can go on and on.  I want you to try it free for four, for two weeks, 14 days.  Go to carbonite.com.  Use the offer code TWIG.  You can see how it works.  If it fits your needs, and I think it will, then you can buy it and get two months free  using the offer code TWIG.  It's only $55 a year, PC or Mac.  It's designed for one machine, one internal drive, or the internal drive on one machine.  They do have a Carbonite Pro that is a little different.  It's based on the amount of storage.  But I think for the end user, this is a great solution because you don't have to think,  do I have a terabyte?  Do I have like, you know, two terabytes?  It just backs it up.  That's it.  carbonite.com.  Use the offer code TWIG.  If you decide to buy it, use the offer code TWIG to get two months free.  Carbonite.  You got to back it up to get it back.  So do it right.  It's Carbonite.  Okay.  Somebody revert mics in our chat room.  He says he has two terabytes on Carbonite.  That's, holy cow.  That's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are other stories besides this one.  We could go on.  I love this story, and I'm sure we will go on.  Verizon is going to be the first to have the Samsung Galaxy Tab.  Jeff, you say you want one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I want one Wi-Fi.  I don't want to get another damn phone company.  Oh, another 3G.  Set of handcuffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It'll be $599 on Verizon.  Seven inches.  Even though Steve Jobs says that's too small, Jeff.  Size matters, says Steve.  Steve says that's 40.  Do the math.  That's 45% of the iPad.  That's too small.  We'll see.  He even said, even Google says don't use Froyo on a tablet.  Use Gingerbread, but this is going to come out with Froyo 2.2 on it.  It'll be a 1 GHz Hummingbird processor.  16.9 aspect ratio.  I kind of like the way the screen looks.  Seven inches.  And front and rear facing camera.  Bingo.  But no FaceTime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the great eye.  How long is it going to take for the camera to finally get on the iPad, by the way?  Yeah.  Well, next year.  FacePads on the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Verizon is going to throw in its Vcast, its music and song ID VZ Navigator,  which you don't need because Android's got it.  Slack or Radio Kindle for Android, which you don't need because you can download it.  Blockbuster On Demand, which I wish I could erase.  Is Blockbuster even in business still?  Bankrupt, but barely.  I thought they were.  They're bankrupt.  Yeah.  Great.  Give me an application so I can access a bankrupt company's database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the deal's worse than what Verizon's doing with the iPad,  where you get the iPad plus the MiFi for a better deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A locked down MiFi.  And it's the same price as buying a 3G iPad.  Yeah.  It's bizarre.  This is contract free, by the way.  3G data plans start at $20 per month for a gigabyte.  That's a new pricing.  A gig's probably enough.  I'll buy one immediately.  It'll be available November 8th.  Same time that the Windows—I'm sorry, November 11th,  three days after Windows Phone becomes available on AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I'm counting the days for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I just saw a story that MSNBC is confirming the Verizon iPhone,  that Apple is confirming the Verizon.  How many times has that been confirmed?  This is the first time from Apple, I guess.  I don't know.  Moving on.  We're just going to click right through these because we're running out of time here.  Did you see that?  Kind of like this chart of the day.  This is from Silicon Alley Insider.  I guess it's another Henry Blodgett.  No, it's Jay Yarrow for SAI.  Google's profit by segment.  Search—oops, let's get the right screen here.  Search 95%.  All the rest 5%.  And I really particularly liked the reinvention of this graph done by Gizmodo.  Search 95% and it looks like a Pac-Man about to eat bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it used to be 98%, so it's an improvement.  It's down.  That's $3 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It kind of reminds you, though, of all the products that Google has,  that that's still the one that's paying the bills.  It's a search company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know, I think about it with my own little business that—I don't want to admit it,  but this is still a podcast business.  Almost all the money we make, probably on the order of 95%, is from downloadable audio.  So why do I build a video studio and put all these cameras up and go to all the trouble  to put out video?  Well, you got to bet on the future.  You got to go to the next—you know, kind of say, what's the next thing?  Absolutely.  You can't do this.  And mobile is—Google has dominant market position in not just search, but in mobile,  in Android, in a lot of things.  So they've got some good investments, even if they aren't yet a big part of the profit picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I'll ruin my numbers of the week right here and now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you don't have to.  Save them.  They're coming in five minutes.  Google says, we're not going to do—I think they already—I thought they already said this,  but they now—I guess it's official, according to the Search Engine Journal.  We're not going to do any more Wi-Fi data collection in our Street View cars.  No plans to resume it.  This is in response, of course, to the leak of information,  and the Germans getting all upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They did a whole other story now as if it was new,  declaring that they'd gotten personal information.  There was no news in it at all.  The Germans just went on the attack again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, those Germans.  You're friends.  You're friends in Germany.  Do not know when to stop.  Dead Sea Scrolls, coming to your couch thanks to Google.  Is this Google Books?  Google really, really, really old books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  God's the only person who won't sue them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They finally figured it out.  Well, we found a publisher that won't sue us.  The Israeli antiquities authorities teamed up with Google to digitize the  Dead Sea Scrolls and make them accessible to anyone with an internet connection.  At a press briefing in Israel, the IA's Panina Shor talked about how the Google  deal will help preserve the scrolls.  From the minute all of this will go online,  there'll be no need to expose the scrolls anymore.  I didn't know they were exposing the scrolls.  Anyone in his office or on his couch will be able to see it.  There's a movement to do this with artworks too, isn't there?  Where you can get these super gigapixel images of the Sistine Chapel.  I hope that they don't just start putting all this stuff in climate-sealed rooms.  Well, that's where Bill Gates was going a long time ago, right?  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He has the video frames in his house.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he has a cave where he's buying all these collections, like the Betman Archive,  and sticking them in a cave.  Literally, they're in an old salt mine.  And then he's digitizing them so that you don't need them ever again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Gates is buying a cave and Google is digitizing them and putting them online.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And they run into the Chilean miners while they're down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These guys must know something.  They must know something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of love that they do this kind of stuff.  It's not quite in the 95% revenue source, but it's important to the world.  It aligns with their mission to digitize the world's information.  It makes sense.  It's a good PR opportunity for them to say,  Hey, look, the Dead Sea Scrolls are live on your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  Here's a...  I don't know what this is.  I'm just going to play it because I'm running through the stuff real quickly.  This is...  Oh, yeah.  You saw this.  You know what this is?  You want to set this up?  Do we need to set this up?  You just play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll do a little setup.  There's this whole video campaign called It Gets Better,  where gay, lesbian, transgender, queer people kind of talk to gay youth  in the light of sort of recent suicides about how things get better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I should point out because it's Spirit Day, Gina and I are both wearing purple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're in purple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think Jeff's wearing purple socks.  I messed up.  Jeff is wearing purple socks.  He didn't get the memo.  So this is Google employees saying It Gets Better.  Exactly.  I think this is great.  Let's play a little bit of this and then we'll get to our PICS tips.  This is based on that Google search ad, right?  That we saw in the Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Similar.  Hi, my name is Cynthia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I work in the Strategic Partnerships Development Team at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi, I'm Eric.  I'm a System Administrator at Google.  I'm Scotty.  I work at Google.  I'm from the Chicago suburbs.  My name is Randy Reyes.  I grew up here in the San Francisco Bay Area and I currently work at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember when I was younger, I had four brothers,  which it's not easy to be gay when you have four brothers  because there's like so much masculinity in the house.  I remember sitting in my bedroom when I was younger,  laying on my bed and just feeling this dread in my chest,  like knowing someday I have to tell my family or I have to tell somebody.  And that alone was enough to terrify me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I grew up at the dinner table hearing conversations about  how gay people should die of AIDS,  how gay people were less than straight people.  And it really caused me to not feel very safe at home.  And at the same time, I didn't feel very safe at school either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then I went to a public middle school and high school  and it was full of jocks and I didn't know any gay people.  I'll rest this to you.  It's on YouTube. It's pretty long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's seven minutes and 30 seconds.  We only have five minutes left in the show, but that's really great.  I'm glad.  Now, this is actually published not on Google's.  It's on YouTube, but it's in Better in Tech is the URL.  YouTube.com slash Better in Tech if you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's pretty amazing that the company sanctioned this.  It's a pretty disarming video.  They've always kind of come out in support of the gay and lesbian community,  but really great, great video.  One of the best ones I've seen.  A lot of these at Gets Better videos are a little cringeworthy,  but that one is really top of the horse.  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  YouTube leaned back.  I pre-ordered the Logitech review and they say it's on its way.  Have you gotten yours yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I went to Best Buy and said, please give me the demo unit.  And they didn't have it yet.  So I'm going to go.  I want to try it out.  They kind of looked at me like, oh, I must have been like,  I need the Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm Joneson, man.  I'm Joneson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they gave me the whole Samsung demo and I was like, no, no, no.  I want the Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want the Samsung.  I want the Google.  Samsung's done its own thing.  By the way, Apple did say on Monday, 250,000 Apple TVs.  The new Apple TV says a lot.  So there's definitely a market for this stuff.  We'll see.  YouTube lean back has launched on Google TV.  You may have seen it in beta.  The whole idea is you watch YouTube just like we just did.  Sitting back with your arms back and your feet up on the table  and you can enjoy it in a lean back way.  youtube.com lean back.  Videos start playing immediately, are always presented in full screen  and HD and you can browse using the arrow keys.  The whole idea is you're watching it on your big screen,  not on your computer anymore.  And lean back will be on Google TV.  So that's very, very, you know, actually, it's great for people  who publish on YouTube because now you're really,  you're really at a parody with a network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, getting in people's living rooms.  Distribution, just like we were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  And free because Google pays the bill.  youtube.com lean back if you want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And if they can start monetizing it, that's the other.  You got the tools, you got the.  Oh, that.  Well, I think I'm getting pennies now.  I have a video of the people who surf in Munich.  In the middle of Munich, there's a surf thing that you can buy  that happened by accident.  And I got the invitation.  You can monetize this video, says Google.  So I said, sure.  And others ads appearing on it not make free sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what do you make, Jeff, of the Wall Street Journal,  which is really, you know, banging the gong on privacy lately.  They talked about cookies and so forth.  And just this week they say Facebook, which, by the way,  I don't know, do they disclaim this anywhere is a competitor to.  They did not.  News Corp's MySpace.  Facebook third party applications leak your information.  Facebook said, yeah, that's a that's a bug.  We're going to fix it.  It's not a good thing.  But I it seems to me that the information is leaking,  which is already public.  Your ID comes.  Your name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's your name ID number, which can lead to your name.  Big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like, what is the journal worried about?  What is going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I happen to see the reporter who started the series last night  at an event at Columbia, and I lost it with her and used words  I won't use on your clean air.  Really?  Yeah, I just I just I just had it.  I think it's irresponsible and it's trying to ruin the Internet.  And she said, well, you know, River Burdock never called me.  Well, of course not.  You're being used and it fits into a strategy of the company.  And I'm not a conspiracy theorist.  I keep on saying that.  But in this case, that's what's happening is that Burdock is giving up on digital  advertising.  And so now he's trying to ruin it for everybody else.  I'm sorry, but it's that simple.  This story was incredibly irresponsible.  All it did was put out the IDs.  It was written in pure tabloid form.  I know because I'm a tabloid guy.  I know all the tricks.  So day two, there was the Congress.  People are looking into this.  Sorry, there's my lights.  It's sensationalistic.  Oh, absolutely.  And and the real problem here is that it has no context whatsoever.  Yeah, it scares middle America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So now go to News America, which is a company owned by Murdoch and News Corp that does  coupons and online coupons.  And it does all kinds of incredible by name targeting.  Go to another company called Axiom, which has been in the database business for the  publishing and marketing business for decades.  And I went on there just as a demo.  And just to be as creepy as I could be, I put together a list of women, 18 to 25, who  are single, who live in my zip code, who have at least a high school education because I  have standards and, you know, hit the button and I could get I could harass every one of  them for sixty dollars.  Wow.  That's been going on for years and years and years and years.  So the irony of this is that Facebook's standards on personally identifiable information are  way higher than old medias like the Wall Street friggin Journal.  And no one, Henry Blodgett and I went back and forth and back and forth because he was  kind of buying the he was drinking the Kool-Aid of it.  I said, you know, stop.  We need this context.  We need other reports.  News Corp is not reporting on its own subsidiaries on its own method.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even the Journal does considerable cookie setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Of course they do.  And they have your PII.  They have your name and address and credit card number and phone number.  And no, and though they don't put all of that out to third parties, they do put data out  to third parties as does the New York Times, as does most every other site out there.  And what Esther Dyson said in Twitter, which I think is true too, is that part of the problem  as the whole industry now is that you kind of have to police your third parties and no one does.  So you put up an ad network, whether you're Facebook or whether you're the Wall Street  Journal or anybody else, you put up an ad network and they have their own rules and  they aren't your rules.  And you disclose that you have a third party and then you wash your hands of it.  And so that's part of the problem is that, you know, I think this was a wrap leaf.  It was fairly accidental.  They, you know, as far as I could see it, again, it was a higher standard in the first place.  It was broken.  Everybody said it was broken.  It wasn't just Facebook's fault.  It's also part of the architecture of the web and how information gets passed in URLs.  And they're fixing it.  And so it wasn't a big scandal, but that's what's so irresponsible about the Wall Street Journal  is that they're trying to make it look like a scandal.  And that's where the story lies.  And why are they doing that?  Because they're leaving advertising behind and they're going to hurt for everybody else.  And if we get FTC regulation, sorry, rant almost over, if we get FTC regulation of things  like cookies, we're going to devalue the entire internet overnight and hurt everyone who's  trying to make money on this, including my pennies on my little Munich surfing video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I like this because it's even I kind of said, oh, well, maybe it's anti-competitive  because they own MySpace.  No, no, no, it's against the web.  They want to kill the web.  Yes.  They want to kill the technology to power the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They put the Times of London and now the News of the World, a fine,  upstanding publication that has been bugging the phone conversations of the Royals.  And next to the Sun, a fine, upstanding publication that has bare breasts on page three.  Page three girls, yeah.  And they're going to put that women, say please, women.  Thank you.  They are women, actually.  I can tell.  Absolutely are.  There's the proof.  Yeah, they're going to put all this behind paywalls along with the Wall Street Journal  and paywalls that are more impenetrable than the journals, by the way.  And they're giving up on advertising and this is their shtick.  And they're trying to draw other publishers into this.  He was going to start an aggregator that was going to be a pay aggregator and he'd share  revenue basically.  But he couldn't do it.  No one would salute.  No one's going along with the pied piper here.  Yeah.  And it's become a religion and it's become dangerous.  And my friends in media need to expose what Murdoch thinks he's exposing isn't.  Sorry, the rant continued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, you're right to rant about this.  And unfortunately, I don't think that the truth is coming out.  So you're absolutely right to rant about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It means that it's part of the problem.  I go, Gina said long ago, and I love that is, you know, the hackers go around.  And in our culture, we just kind of say, oh, that sucks.  We ignore it when we should be reacting to it with facts.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I also have a feeling that we ain't seen the end of this, that as these old media companies  get cornered, they're going to fight dirtier and dirtier and dirtier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I see what's happening.  So you see in Germany, that's when they're going after trying to extend copyright even  more and hurt fair use.  And I just filed a friend of the court brief today to the Supreme Court of Canada.  Ain't that cool?  In a case where media companies in this case, in their interest, are trying to cover the  events of a guy who was found liable for something he linked to.  If we end up killing, making the link, put a chill on the link, we've killed the entire  infrastructure of the web.  So there's a lot of people who can do a lot of really damaging, stupid things to our world.  And we got to stand up people, Bill of Rights for cyberspace.  Thank you.  We've got John Perry.  John Perry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Coming on at 7 p.m. Eastern, 4 p.m. Pacific this afternoon.  And the very first thing I'm going to do just for you, Jeff Jarvis, is have him do a dramatic  reading of the Internet Bill of Rights.  I presume he will be willing to.  I'll print it out for him in case he doesn't have a copy to hand.  You know, I just think what happens is you push the knowledgeable users underground.  And then essentially, you're going to create an underground of open,  with a sub as a substrate underneath this closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's a metaphor for everything we talked about at the beginning of the show, right?  The open web and the closed web.  Yes.  Transparent and opaque.  And these are choices that we are making for a new culture, a new world.  The CTO of the Veterans Administration calls it the eighth continent.  We are now deciding what this culture is going to be operating like.  And we're letting it go to old defaults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, what saddens me is, you know, I'm watching the chat room as I'm as we're  during Macbreak Weekly as I'm talking about the fact that this is a bad trend  towards a closed ecosystem.  And they're going, oh, you sound like such an old man.  You say that there's a great comic, XKCD comic.  And I'll see if I can find it in which the open source hacker guy is saying, well,  I'm fighting to keep this stuff open for you.  And oh, but I like it closed.  I like it.  It's good.  And then, of course, it closes in on the normal guy.  And the hacker said, I told you, we're fighting for you, baby.  You got to understand it feels good now, but it's not going to feel good in the long run.  So what are we going to do about it?  Damn it.  Well, I'm doing everything I can on this network to raise people's awareness.  You are.  Unfortunately, the people who watch this are probably already aware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we all have the same email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, we're all preaching the choir.  Preaching the choir.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we need to save the link and save cookies, t-shirts.  Jeff, you really are doing a lot.  I mean, you're really getting out there.  And did you say you filed with the Supreme Court in Canada?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they came to me on this case.  And because I write about the link economy and the value of the link,  and they recognize these lawyers recognized, they were smart enough to realize that what  could happen here is the degradation of the value of the link.  And so I gave them a bunch of my stuff and I filed this little affidavit.  And I amended what they wrote for me.  They interviewed me, then wrote it.  And they use words like verily.  And so I added something in there about how doing this to the link would put a chill on  free speech.  And they said, oh, no, sorry, that would be very cheeky to say to the Supreme Court of Canada.  I said, I'm American.  Of course I'm cheeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the XKCD cartoon, 2003.  Did you get my essay?  Yeah, it was good, but it was a doc.  You really should use it more.  Oh, give it a rest already.  Maybe we just want to live our lives and use software that works, not get wrapped up in  your stupid nerd turf wars.  I just want people to care about infrastructures we're building.  And no, you just want to feel smugly superior.  You have no sense of perspective and are probably autistic.  Flash forward seven years later, 2010.  Oh my God, we handed control of our social world to Facebook and they're doing evil stuff.  Do you see this?  It's the world's tiniest open source violin.  Says it all right there.  Love XKCD.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The smallest open source violin.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break.  We come back.  We're going to have Gina's tip, Jeff's number.  I saved it for you, Jeff.  Thank you.  You did.  But first, let me talk a little bit about Ford and the Ford Motor Company.  They're supporting the show.  See, there is still hope.  One of the great American industrial giants and they are moving forward with a great set  of products, including the new Ford Fiesta.  With an EPA estimated 40 miles per gallon highway, no other compact cars more fuel efficient.  And it's not just economy of fuel.  The Fiesta is awesome.  You may remember we went out to the Rouge plant, I guess that was in July,  to visit where they've been making cars since Henry Ford's day.  He built it in the 30s.  The idea, actually earlier than that, I think the 20s, the idea was raw materials come in  and a car comes out the other end.  I mean, incredibly vertically integrated.  Like they talk about now, a mile and three quarters long, half a mile wide.  And Ford is now, they're putting on the rooftops, green rooftops, which keep the facility cooler  in the summer.  They absorb water, reduce energy costs, of course, cut CO2 and generate oxygen.  Ford's commitment to the environment is not only in the facilities, the cars too, the  EcoBoost V6 engine.  Incredible 365 horsepower engine that saves gas.  Standard in the Taurus SHO with the power of a V8.  The 2011 Ford Fiesta, which is the most fuel efficient compact car on the road today.  I'm just, I'm really pleased to see what Ford's doing and I invite you to reward them by at  least going to a Ford dealer near you, trying out the Ford Fiesta or the Edge.  Take a look at the SYNC, which are the incredible hands-free in-car communications and connectivity.  They're really, it's a 21st century vehicle.  Give it a try.  The Ford Fiesta, drive one at a Ford dealer near you and thank you for it.  A real tip of the hat.  I think what Alan Mulally and the gang are doing there is just mind boggling, mind boggling.  Now time, Gina Tripani for your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina Tripani Quick tip.  If you are logged into Facebook, but you don't love going to sites like Yelp or Lifehacker  or different places where it says, your friend Leo has liked this, you know, like this here.  If that kind of creeps you out a little bit, there is a Google Chrome extension.  It is called Facebook disconnect.  And I think this is kind of funny.  This extension was developed by an engineer at Google who works on the Chromium project.  But this is this, this extension is, doesn't have anything to do with Google.  It's not endorsed by Google.  But the like button goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Facebook connect, every, all of that stuff goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All that stuff goes away.  So it doesn't say, so it blocks the flow of traffic from third party websites to Facebook.  So it's really kind of a privacy protector.  So if someone has a direct link to Facebook, you will still see that.  It blocks those JavaScript embeds that say that list your friend's faces and say they like this  or instant personalization is turned on.  So once you install it and Leo's doing that right now,  if you go to sites that have that Facebook integration, you won't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, let me try it now.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can try going to Yelp.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I hate it when I go to Yelp and it says, hey, Leo, how you doing?  You know, your friends.  Yeah.  Oh, nothing.  Nothing.  Up at the top.  I love it.  It's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing.  Kind of nice.  So it's kind of like a condom for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It does work on Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it has a Chrome extent.  I really didn't plan to say that and I'm kind of regretting that I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think of it as a latex sheath to protect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gets Facebook out of all your other third party sites that you'd like to keep  your activity there private.  Thank you very much.  Sure.  And I'm going to stop blushing now and you can continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'll continue with Gina.  I'll get that going.  I just saw a tweet that the person doing the Canadian suit or involved his name,  John Newton, and it's the P2Pnet is his case.  And so he just tweeted, oh, we're talking about the case, his case on there.  And I look at his feed and I see this from four hours ago, Google Android,  a little bit open source, quote, sort of like a partial circumcision.  So there, Gina, that's the theme of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There you go.  Well, when Jeff's on the show, it always is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's always about penises.  And your number of the week and it better not be nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Thank you very much, boss.  So Google announces $1 billion annualized in mobile revenue, which goes back to your  chart before that says that there are new things growing here.  Also, TechCrunch did a calculation and tried to figure out Google's display revenue versus  search revenue and calculates it at about 2.5 billion and says that it's about to  probably surpass Yahoo with that Yahoo money.  They gave up on search to concentrate on display.  And so if you add that up, that's, you know, 3.5 billion of non-search  out of about 32 billion annualized in total revenue.  So, you know, they went from 2% non-search to 5% non-search to 10% non-search in about a year.  Wow.  Ain't bad.  We'll take it.  There's a reason the stock's over $600.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My tool is not a tool.  It is a way for you to kill your productivity.  If this sounds familiar, then you've already been captured by the angry birds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Green spines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You took my eggs.  Those horrible pigs have stolen your eggs.  This is an app that has been huge on iPad and iPhone.  And it is finally available now.  It has been available in beta for some time, but it's finally available in its full version  and free, I might add.  Nice one.  Get those pigs.  Come on.  Come on.  I'm after you, pigs.  It is ad supported.  They have ad mob ads in it.  So you don't have to pay for it.  Yes.  Dead pigs.  I love them.  The birds are cheering, by the way.  I love the cheering birds.  It is a killer application, which you're just going to absolutely love.  Free on Android now.  And it is every bit as good.  It's just as complete as the iPhone and iPad version.  They really did a nice job.  The company Rovio is in Finland.  It's distributed by a company called Chill'n'Go, which just got purchased by Electronic Arts  for some ungodly amount of money.  $20 million.  Apparently they didn't get angry birds.  Oh.  Yeah, I don't know what they got.  They got, you know, I don't know what they got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More than anything, angry birds makes me want an Android tablet  because it's so much better on a big screen, you know?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It wouldn't be great.  But is seven inches enough, Gina, not to continue our thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is a 4.3 inch screen.  I think it's pretty good.  It's nice to have an angry bird in my pocket, you know?  That's true.  That's true.  Gina Trapani.  I'm sorry.  I'm not going to get anything done now for the rest of the day.  Gina Trapani is a blogger, but boy, that just really doesn't say it all.  She started Lifehackers.  She's at smarterware.org.  She also writes for Fast Company.  Go to fastcompany.com slash work smart for her new work smart series.  And she's also working on that great program.  What is it called now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think Up.  Think Up.  Yeah, Beta 3 out this week.  We're marching towards 1.1.  Yeah.  Where do we go if we want to know more?  ThinkUpApp.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very cool.  ThinkUpApp.com.  I can't.  Glad to be back.  So good to have you back, Jeff.  Jarvis is here.  He's also from the City University of New York where he teaches journalism  and excoriates the Wall Street journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or some would say ruins journalism, but what the heck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
