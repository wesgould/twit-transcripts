Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's back.  Yay.  Yeah feeling much much better.  I missed you guys last week.  I listened to the show and was talking to myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's talking like this because she has a cold.  But she's oh Jeff you're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that is that a feeling better too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah and I did not catch it miraculously.  I had I got my prepared myself for the baby to get sick and somehow she did between me and the sitter being sick.  She didn't catch it.  So I credit her super baby immune system.  Awesome.  She hasn't been sick yet.  So but I'm feeling much better.  Glad to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Knock on wood.  Also here Jeff Jarvis professor of journalism at the City University of New York and how and off time Howard Stern.  You've been on Stern every week now for the last two weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I I well yeah two weeks.  Yes I called in yesterday.  Katie Kirk was there.  Howard starts to explain to Katie and she says oh I know Jeff.  It was my ego moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  And I know him.  So one one degree of separation from Katie Kirk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Squee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was pleased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you called in to say hi Katie.  Hi Howard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know I called in because Howard has been doing phenomenal interviews.  It was a great interview with Katie too.  And and so on my third I use this as an excuse to have Katie give Howard career advice.  Oh that's Howard.  I think I swear he denies this but I think what he's doing is doing he's doing amazing really deep hour and a half interviews that go like no other interviews you've ever imagined.  Gina mentioned Louis C. K. there's a long list of them.  And and so my theory was he's doing that he he had to be says no I'm not I'm not auditioning for anything.  I had the chance a few years ago they were going to ABC was going to give me Barbara Walters quarterly interview show.  And I insisted on being part of the news department and the ABC guy would said not not my family.  I'm really kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That long hair freak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Times have changed a little bit but I don't think Howard should get involved with mainstream.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well he's the way but he but that's that he's on America's Got Talent.  He's proven that that's true.  People still hate me but he's he's really showed his mainstream now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you see I haven't heard his long form interviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Louis interview really kind of blew me away.  I never really liked Howard.  I think I'm stuck back in the time when he was just the shock jock that made girls kiss one another in his studio which just I thought was just like gross.  Right.  And it creeped me out.  Like he just strikes me as like this creepy guy.  But he but I but I watched the Louis interview and without intending to watch the entire thing I was like oh I just want to hear Louis.  And I was amazed by what a great interviewer.  I mean he asked questions that I was just like wow.  And Louis was obviously very comfortable and very forthcoming.  It was really great.  I enjoyed it a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would guess Louis CK is a good person to interview because he is kind of let it all hang out.  But even even what does Howard do that makes him so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does he do.  I asked Katie that I asked my my goomba Katie that and and you know she said that he asked unusual questions.  He doesn't ask the same questions you could ask all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's actually good because a lot of the people and I found this when I was in radio a lot of the people you're interviewing have been are coming off 20 straight interviews with the same question.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So he's asking yes he's going to sneak and you know he's going to sneak in the question of your sex life or whatever.  But he also cares about you.  It's well researched.  And he's on an hour and a half with some people.  That's a really long interview.  No breaks nothing.  And somebody is comfortable all time.  Katie also said it's about radio.  She said if there were cameras on me right now I'd probably be different.  That's very true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were cameras on radio is a wonderful medium for really long in depth interviews and the best interview shows are all on radio.  So maybe Charlie Rose would be the exception.  And I you know maybe.  Even then Charlie talks a lot.  He talks too much.  He inserts himself too much.  And I'm surprised to hear Howard doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean he was asking things out of people.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  He went into into Louie being a really dedicated father and started asking about Louie's father and like really got in depth about Louie's relationship with his father to the point where Louie at one point was like wow I haven't really thought about this because I haven't talked about him this much.  And you know years you're really kind of getting down to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Howard will psychoanalyze people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes absolutely.  Like my line about Howard is that he's exactly you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so that's Howard's enough therapy.  He's an amateur therapist.  My line about him is that he's greater than the sum of his farts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bring on the coin bank.  We got a farting coin bank over here.  No the challenge with the challenge of being a good interviewer especially if it's your show and you're a superstar like Howard Stern he's a bigger star in many cases and the people he's interviewing the challenge is to get out of the way.  That's why it's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's curious about you.  He's very curious about the people and he draws that out.  He draws out things that everybody's curious about but not obvious.  You know he's quite amazing.  I learned the thing about Howard when I first became a fan I saw the same thing you did Gina.  He farts that's it.  And one quiet summer I was going to review his TV show for TV God.  And so I said I should listen to a radio show for a week.  And when it was on a full week and my epiphany was that he's better taken in big doses than small.  In a small dose you get the fart joke you get the lesbian kiss which is fine is what it is.  Lesbian kisses are a wonderful thing right.  But when you think of it in large doses you see.  So I put a creepy ugly guy staring at them.  Yeah.  Kiss for me.  Kiss for me.  I ain't faking it.  But the people who are on the show have more problems than that.  But what you get is a charming guy.  Intelligent.  Quick.  Then you also get this drama of the show.  It's like Dilbert brought to life.  It's every screwed up office.  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was about to use a bad word.  I admire Howard because of his realness and authenticity.  When he started doing radio it was not known for that.  And he really was the first I think to be very genuine and real and talk about real  stuff on the radio.  It was awfully scatological.  It felt for me like you're listening to a kid who still likes fart jokes who's a teenager.  And so I wasn't really crazy about his sense of humor but I did admire his authenticity  and the fact that he was willing to talk about real stuff on the radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think you would also admire his skill.  His craft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interviewing is so hard.  It is actually something I love.  You do it on triangulation every week.  Yeah.  I really love doing it.  I've done more than 5,000 interviews in my career.  Many more actually.  I think it's probably more like 8 or 9,000 now.  And I'm still working at it.  It's hard.  So I like to listen to people who are good at it and see what they're doing.  Hey, let's talk a little bit about since we're talking about interviews.  Kara Swisher, Walt Mossberg, last night interviewed Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.  I was stunned to see all the gadget blogs live blogged this.  Like this is going to be breaking news.  This is not a keynote.  And as far as I can tell, there wasn't anything particularly revelatory about Tim Cook last  night.  Oh.  Did you guys hear anything you thought was worth paying attention to?  It's a CEO.  He's not going to say anything on somebody else's stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did imply that he said Google Glass is not mainstream.  But we're very interested in this space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right and wearable technology.  There's a lot of opportunity Google Glass isn't it?  Nothing interesting there.  He said that the fuel band is cool.  He wears one.  Of course, Apple and Nike have a partnership.  So that wasn't unexpected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wasn't wearing one as far as I could tell on the stage, but maybe I missed it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess he just said that he wears one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just put mine up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a wristwatch, dude.  I've started wearing a watch again.  Yeah.  I've started wearing a watch again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I don't know if it's a very good, I think frankly the Google Glass is a better form  factor of what you're looking at as wearables much better than a wristwatch.  Yeah.  For one thing, you can hear it.  You can talk to it without doing anything.  A wristwatch, what are you going to put it up to your ear?  For another thing, you can read it without doing anything.  I mean, if it's raising my hand, I got the phone.  I've got a better screen on the phone.  I'm really not sure why a wristwatch would be such a great form factor.  I'd like to see what Apple has in its upgrade.  What if it buzzed?  Well, I have a Pebble watch which buzzes.  And that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That you can feel versus hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but so I can feel my phone buzz too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Pebble watch, you can look and you can see who's calling without taking your phone  out.  You can look at a text message and read it.  You can't respond to it, but you can at least read it.  Calendar notifications, things like that.  I guess it's nice to be able to do that.  I think Glass is going to be as good.  The question is...  How many notifications do you really want?  Well, one of the problems with the Pebble, and it would be a challenge to solve this  on any device with a screen that small, is how do you stack notifications?  On the Pebble, you only see the most recent one.  On Glass, at least you can do this.  You can scroll through them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they stack on Glass.  You can flip through them vertically as well.  If there's more than one New York Times headline, you can flip through them.  It's got that little corner, that little white corner.  That's how you know they're stacked.  And then also, of course, you can flip through the horizontal time.  Do you wear your Glass still?  Not as much as I should.  It's one of those things where I'm like, oh, I should have...  I'll be out and be like, oh, I should have put on Glass before I did.  You forget to wear your Glass.  Is it charged?  Do I have enough battery on my phone?  It's one of those things where I'm lucky if I get the baby's diaper bag packed.  So for me, it's one of those things where I've been meaning to wear it more.  I haven't been wearing it as much, but I think it's just because life has been busy.  And it does drain my battery on my phone, which has stuck me in places where I don't  have any phone battery, which is not a good thing.  So I think I just need to get an extra battery and just get more into the habit of putting  them on.  I have to remember to put them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think, I mean, I would disagree.  I wouldn't disagree that Glass isn't mainstream yet, but I would disagree that there are better  form factors.  I think Glass is probably the right form factor, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I actually went to my ophthalmologist and for the first time in my life asked about  contacts.  I've now, I can't stand the idea.  I've never done it.  For Glass?  Oh, for Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  So have you gotten, do you know when you're going to pick yours up, Jeff?  Have you picked yours up?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But as always, what do I have to do?  Write a Kiss Ass book.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, I don't think that if I had Glass, folks have gotten them yet.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're almost done giving out the 2000, right?  And then, yeah.  Well, anyway, anything else Tim said that we, I mean, we'll find out on June 10th.  That's when Apple's WWDC hit San Francisco.  Tim Cook at, in fact, we're going to cover that live as we usually do at 10 a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the minimum that's going to come out then?  Is it a new iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The minimum is iOS 7.  The minimum is no hardware at all.  It's almost certain that they'll have new MacBook Airs based on an Intel Haswell chipset.  Here's my question about phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I can't, I wrote a post this week when I said ignore everything that says the death  of or the last or the whatever.  But I wonder how many advances there are in phones, right?  There'll be, there'll be more sensors, there'll be better screens, better cameras, this and  that.  But have we arrived?  Pretty much what a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Apple's arrived because Apple's, I think, painted itself into a little bit of a corner  because of their insistence that they control everything and that it all comes through Apple.  I don't, I think that's one of the beauties of Android and one of Google's advantages  with open source is you've got an infinite number of monkeys typing on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we haven't really seen, except from having, you know, Note 2, pretty much, you know, because  I'm having gadget lost, right?  And I want to buy the next gadget and do I go buy the, the, the, the, the, the, the,  the Samsung Galaxy S4 that's going to be with pure Android.  And I think, oh, no, I pretty much got it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The HTC, you have a next, here is a Nexus 4, right?  Nexus 4, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so I'm dying to kind of get the next thing.  And I don't know that there is, you know, the truth is this Nexus 4 isn't that much  better than my Galaxy Nexus was.  You know, so I already did that once.  I haven't seen anything that really moves the form and I'm not sure that what I would  do to move the form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you would like the HTC One.  I think there's some things about it that are preferable to the Nexus 4.  I mean, since you already don't have a removable battery, it won't be, that won't be a disadvantage.  It does LTE, which I think you'd like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you could get that with pure Android as is rumored and the Nexus.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now this is an interesting question because I am not necessarily a pure Android fetish ist.  I think that's a fetish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, but you didn't like the layer on the HTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and as a result, I put CM10 on it, the Cyanogen mod, which is essentially 422 pure.  But the camera is not as good.  The camera app is designed for this particular camera.  There's some customizations HTC makes.  And in fact, I think I'm getting better battery life.  And so in other words, HTC knows this hardware more intimately than a generic ROM can.  And so I think there's a middle ground where you don't do, A, you don't have all the carrier  and manufacturer cruft.  AT&T put so much junk on there.  And HTC put some cruft on there as well, although much less than some.  And then somewhere in between with the UI, now see, I am not a fan of, and we talked  about this before, Google's no physical buttons.  You got to have a menu, all the buttons on the screen UI, I think is a mistake, especially  since apps don't seem to be consistent where they put that overflow menu.  And so one thing I don't like about the HTC one is it doesn't have a menu button.  It has a back and a home button and no menu button.  The Galaxy S4 has a menu button.  And I use that all the time.  I mean, I know where the menu is because it's always in the same space.  And I mean, Gina, you're a developer.  I think you like the new UI, the 4.2 UI, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You like the action bar.  So you define the number of buttons that you need on the action bar.  And then depending on the screen size, the Android layout manager collapses them into  that dot dot dot, that drop down menu.  And that's what you're talking about, right?  Yeah, I mean, I like that as a developer because it makes me go, it makes me think about what  are the most important buttons.  And I know that the action bar is going to be filled in appropriately, given the right  screen size or the right orientation of the device.  So yeah, it appeals to me as a developer.  But I do understand as a user, if you're not using standard Android design, not just hollow,  but the action bar kind of design.  I mean, there are lots of apps like games and things which are full screen, for example,  that don't necessarily use that action bar, where it can be confusing.  Where you're like, where's the button?  So I get that.  I totally get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a fan of an Apple invented, or at least was the first I knew of to do it, what they  called it monotonous design.  There's one way to do it.  Your brain learns that way.  It's always that way.  You know, buttons don't move around.  Menu items don't move around.  And it's still somewhat true on the Macintosh.  That's one of the reasons they don't attach a menu to the window.  Big difference in Windows and Macintosh.  Windows has menus on the window.  Each window has its own menu, which makes a lot of sense.  But Apple says, no, the menu is always exactly the same spot on the screen.  And that's because that's where you learn to move that mouse and it becomes part of  your DNA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But iOS only has that one hard home button and it's up to the developer to build the  button, the UI into it.  And I think that's a disadvantage.  Yeah.  I mean, when I went from Android to iOS, I was like, how do you go back?  I was lost without a back.  How do you search?  I was also lost without a search.  I was used to having a search key everywhere.  So you're so constrained.  And I think that Google is just a lot more likely to iterate very quickly over versions.  That's why we've got apps that were designed for gingerbread that can still run on your  jelly bean device.  But that seemed completely different than the ones that use the new design and the action  bar.  Although those kind of forced the old school menu button kind of on the bottom with the  three dot menu.  So I hear you.  I definitely hear you, Leo.  If it's not an easy solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm not like hankering for, I didn't buy a Nexus 4.  I'm not hankering for the new Google experience Nexus GS4.  If on the other hand HTC, I hope this rumor is true because I really like the hardware  on the one.  And actually my pick at the end is going to be all the tools I use to finally get battery  life to something closer to a day.  If you were unhappy.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, and the GS4, by the way, both of them with heavy normal in my way, heavy  use eight hours, nine hours.  But with a removable battery, that's not a problem.  I have literally three batteries for my Galaxy S4, but it is a problem for this.  I don't want to have to go home after eight hours, but I have tricked this thing out.  I've turned off all sorts of crap.  But if HTC one were to make, let's say kind of a hybrid where you've got the one with  4.2.2, this is only 412 for one thing, but also with maybe an HTC camera app to take  it to bring us always and stuff because that's the ultra pixel technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's software.  You lost that when you went to see him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you still get a four megapixel camera, but you don't get a lot of the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They could make an app that does that, right?  They could just put the app in the app store and you can put it up there.  Put it in the app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Whether they will is another matter.  So it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, wouldn't work on any phone except.  One.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you could do that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And what Zoe's are basically what Google Plus is doing now, right?  With multiple photos that are similar.  Sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sort of.  It's interesting now that Zoe works great with this.  What is it?  Automatic anywhere?  Anywhere?  It's great.  Auto Awesome?  Auto Awesome.  That's it.  Auto Awesome.  It's great because what the Zoe, what a Zoe is, is a three second movie and then it takes  20 stills out of the 60 stills or whatever it is that the three second movie has or yeah,  60 stills.  So you get 20 stills plus a three second movie.  And then what's great is Auto Awesome looks at those 20, picks the ones it likes and makes  a animated GIF, which is not as smooth as the movie.  But you see now you have a three second movie, you have an animated GIF and you have the  stills and that's really kind of nice.  Works really well.  Plus the other problem with the Zoe was that it would put 20 images in Google Plus photo  bucket and because Google Plus didn't know to combine them.  The special gallery software and the one says, oh yeah, yeah, those are, that's, that's all  one thing.  But the Google Plus didn't know that.  So it was just overflowing now because it takes the best stuff and puts the rest aside.  All that what it sees is duplicates.  It's putting in that, you know, see the rest button.  So actually works quite well with Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Zoe isn't an animated GIF.  The Zoe is just, that's just the gallery on the cameras showing it that way.  It's a movie.  Okay.  So you don't see it, the movie any place else it has to be on your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's an MP4.  You can upload the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gotcha.  And then there's, I think you're confusing with this highlights film that it makes.  So then the next thing it does, and I would love to see this, this is in the gallery app,  is it will make a highlight of your day and it puts music behind it and it.  Really?  Oh, you haven't seen these?  These are great.  No.  Oh, it's fun.  I guess I could show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you're selling them in the HEC software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that's why I don't want to go pure vanilla.  Right?  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we were talking about this on all that Android last night.  Were you?  Yeah, I mean, we're all kind of, you know, pro kind of Nexus experience, pure Google  experience.  And I mean, for me, that's, I guess it is a little bit of a fetish.  We were also talking about how hacking your phone is a little bit of a fetish.  That is a little bit of an addiction.  I should, we should say we're using the word addiction.  How it's always getting the latest ROM and I, you know, get the name.  There's a name for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is the, I just read the name for people who update every day.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Crack, romming, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rom cracking or something.  Crack, romming.  Crack, jacking.  Yeah.  And I am that.  Clockwork mod, ROM manager on there.  A crack flasher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crack flasher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Tash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was from Jason.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Once I, well, and it's a real term apparently, but once you put clockwork mod on there every  day, you check for the new CM10 and you put it on there every day.  I have a new firmware.  It's crazy.  So here's, this is, this is the highlight that Zoe makes and I have it in the French  thing.  So I put it up here.  So it puts, it makes a black and white movie automatically out of all the pictures I took  that day.  Some of them moving, some of them pan and scan, you know.  But let's say, oh, well, I don't, I don't like that.  Let's change the theme to something a little more jazzy.  How about, how about Vega?  Same day, same pictures.  Much more jazzy.  That's automatic.  I'm not doing anything.  Wow.  I think, Jeff, you should look at the HTC One.  If the battery life, that's the, that's the real key on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing about this is I want to tell one of my students, I've mentioned this before,  as a business to enable people with the beginning, the early stages of dementia to use wearable  cameras to kind of recapture parts of their day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So get ready because I bought a Mimoto.  Oh, you did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So remember Gordon Bell, who started-  No one's going to be private around you.  Nothing private.  Forget the glass.  I got something better.  So Gordon Bell was the first to do this.  He wore a camera, looked much like this.  He was a, found one of the, I don't know if he was a founder of digital equipment, but  he's certainly one of the big haunches there.  Later founded the Computer History Museum in the Bay Area.  He wore and wrote a book about this.  Well, a Swedish company is making them.  And that's, I ordered one.  It's not out yet, but every 30 seconds it takes a picture.  It clips onto your lapel, it geotags it, and it uploads it to their server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you seen the whale hunt, Leo?  Jonathan Harris, we talked about this before?  No.  Oh, we did talk about this before.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He took a picture every five minutes of a whale hunt.  Yeah.  And he just did his new project.  I think it's something like, I'll love your work or whatever.  Where he was with, so the whale hunt first is he took a picture at least every five minutes  while he was on this trip with whale hunt.  And you can see the colors and you can see the bio rhythm of the photos.  When he takes more photos than once every five minutes, something's happening.  Guess what?  They got a whale.  So that's one form he did.  And then he has a new one now where he was with lesbian porn makers.  This is a theme today, Howard Stern moment, but making a serious film where every, I think,  five minutes it was 10 seconds of video.  And sometimes they'd be aware of him and talk to the camera and part of the story.  Sometimes they're just doing what they're doing, getting makeup or whatever.  And it becomes a narrative and a story.  It's absolutely fascinating.  This idea of this constant flow of photos can be turned into a narrative.  And Jonathan's proved that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I never wanted to bring this up on the show because I don't want to necessarily  encourage this, but one of the conversations around glass is that one of its biggest uses  would be in porn, which we talked about a little bit, like first person porn, but particularly  like lesbian porn because you really kind of get a view in those hard to reach instances.  You said it, Gina.  We didn't.  I look, I forget.  I held back.  I had it set up wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying it now.  All right.  So this is the adult portion of the show.  Kids, turn out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Turn out the TV.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So no, no, we don't have to.  I just.  But that's what's wrong with porn.  No, no.  Real porn is not about real sex because you have to have the camera get into these various  positions.  And so performers are acting in a very abnormal way.  And I feel bad for my kids because I think a lot of kids of their generation, they think  sex involves a leg in the air, another leg on a couch.  You know, I mean, because but that's the exigencies of getting video of it.  This is a real love making your balled up together.  Yeah, there's nothing to see.  So maybe Google Glass would be good, but I think all you would see is like somebody's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  forehead squished up against the glass.  I don't know if that's going to be sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think it's funny that wearable computing is like, you know, of course, any sort of  new technology, you know, porn, but particularly there's plenty of ways to make first person

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  porn.  We don't need glass for that.  I'm going to take a stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's there's a story on the rundown today, which is actually kind of silly because  it tried to imagine somebody making porn to watch on class.  No, no, no, no, no.  You've got that all wrong.  That's really bad.  Isn't that stupid?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You can really look creepy.  But I don't know.  I I will.  I'll bet you there will be clever filmmakers who will find a way that makes the point of  view interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is this is this is well, OK, I'm not a hesitate to speak too much on this subject.  I don't want to come off as like a porn expert, but this is already a kind of porn.  There is a kind of porn called point of view porn where one of the performers, usually  the male, is holding the camera.  And it's so it's as if it's you.  Right.  And a camera works perfectly well.  You don't need to have glasses.  In fact, the camera might work better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not that I want to be expert either, Leo, but this is going to be the my girlfriend  motif.  Oh, maybe of amateur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this this now raises the whole privacy issue because.  Well, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  We're stopping and you got the stupid glass on as if I had.  OK, so so all passion.  People are going to have to know we are recording.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are going to have to stop stopping with glass on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not going to work with class on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that's the application for glass, but I do think the so we just chased  the one woman in the audience completely out of the audience.  She's running as fast as she can.  Oh, no, there's another one.  Oh, thank God.  There's two girls here.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You called them. You called them girls.  And now she's leaving, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, she's gone, too.  So we're really pretty much it's a bunch of guys with the with the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so I had I had to bring it up with class because it was one of the one of the first  like stories I got from a friend of mine about class.  I was like, oh, no, yeah, we hadn't discussed it.  So I felt like, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any new technology?  You nailed it. Pardon me.  You got it right, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Porn applications, porn applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first thing. Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, did I mention I'm using a Linux laptop now for the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I shouldn't I shouldn't have gone there.  I apologize, audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, at least it was you.  Normally it would be me.  I'm thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what's great about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does seem to be I blame Howard Stern.  Let's just play. Yeah, we got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got off on a wrong foot and it's and it's it's gone downhill ever since.  On the brain.  Let's take a break.  The foot that's in the air.  Can we take a break and do an ad?  Because I know every advertiser wants to be right next to the porn discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why we didn't like my space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

We thank you so much for supporting this week in Google.  Look, I finally got my Linux laptop working.  Can you see that, Chad? Look at that.  Isn't that pretty nice?  Yeah. 19, 1920 by 1080p.  This is one Dell sells pre-configured with Linux.  Ubuntu 1204 LTS comes with LibreOffice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they have a cheaper one, too.  What was all that that you're just doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You first boot was installing stuff, downloading stuff, updating.  That kind of thing.  And I slowed it down because I started making a recovery  thumb drive, and that's what really slowed it down.  So I stopped that and started over, redid it.  Anyway, yeah, I think it's interesting to see.  Dell's done this before, I think, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, the first one came out of Dell IdeaStorm.  Oh, really?  It was a reaction to Dell Hell, right?  Where people said, we want to do these things.  And then the first idea that came out of that, the customer saying,  we've been telling you we just want a Linux machine.  The discussion came back and Dell said, yeah, but there's so many flavors.  We don't know what to do.  The community said, no, no, we'll tell you what to do.  This is the one.  Then Dell came back and said, yeah, but there's just too much support.  And communities, we don't need your support.  We got support over here. Right.  And so Dell said, OK, they made one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an i7, eight gigs of RAM, expensive, 15 or 16 bucks.  1920 by 1080 screen SSD.  It's an ultrabook.  In fact, you could tell it's a reconfigured  Dell Windows ultrabook because it has a Windows key.  Oh, I should have at least given you.  Could you pry that off, please, and put a, you know, a penguin on there or something?  It's the only thing I would change.  I wonder what happens when I press this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God, Windows 8. Oh, sorry.  It crashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, this seems to be working nicely.  So I think I'll I'll keep using this one for a while.  Not a touch screen, unfortunately, but I don't know if Linux Linux does support touch, but  probably don't need it for Linux if you're that kind of person.  All right. So let me get  let's talk about some new social offers from Google.  Actually, you know what I would like to do instead before we do that?  Let's do the change lock. What do you think?  Oh, yeah. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, we give you trumpets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And now, Jita Tripani with the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Drive for Android updates to version one point two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Big, big update.  New interface, optical character recognition, biggest, coolest new feature.  You can scan documents and receipts from your Android device direct to drive,  and then you can search for their contents.  So this is a great solution if you're the kind of person that needs to scan receipts.  This is a great solution if you're the kind of person that needs to scan receipts  and do expense reports.  Really, really great for stuff like that.  See in the screenshot there. Yeah, there's a new there's a new button in the in the camera.  When you when you launch the camera or sorry, when you tap the add new item,  scan is one of the options.  And so so you take a picture of your receipt or document  and it scans it up to Google Drive.  Really nice. And a bunch of UI improvements, a new grid view, new quick preview.  You can download a copy of your file.  So local device for Honeycomb and greater spreadsheet editors is better.  So, yeah, really nice.  Google Drive interface update.  If you haven't launched on Android in a while, do so.  Some more Google Drive updates in Gmail.  Gmail users will now be able to see drive documents  and calendar events from their Gmail search box.  So over the past week, this has been rolling out to US English users  and unfortunately, just not apps users, just vanilla Gmail users.  If you type a query, yeah, now boo, boo indeed.  I had to I had to fire up the only thing I could solve this problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know. At IO, I went to a session of Google Plus and then everybody in the room  just beat them up.  Yeah. And basically, we think this is a lot better than it used to be.  And we said, no, it's a huge problem.  You guys, you know, yeah, it's not just you and the dog food.  It's everybody who is a power user and you've got to fix this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really frustrating.  It's really frustrating when the other account.  And I'm now stuck in the I had I had been able to avoid  starting a plus account with my apps address,  but I fat fingered something on my Android phone and hit next or whatever.  And then it made me count.  And I'm doomed.  Like I've gotten all these circle requests for this account.  I'm not using the worst and people message.  It's the worst. I'm having the same problem with Hangouts.  I had people hang out, hang outing me, chatting me on both addresses  when I only use one.  So, yes, this is a problem.  There's only for vanilla Gmail accounts.  But so you'll see when you start searching in Gmail,  you'll get calendar events and drive  documents. Google rolls out Street View imagery for New York  into Google Maps, including Central Park and the 9-11 Memorial.  And for images of Hurricane Sandy as well.  If you go to for the Sandy images, you go to history pin dot com slash Sandy.  Google partner with History Pin.  And there's a it's a it's a community photo and video album  called for Hurricane Sandy.  It's called Hurricane Sandy Record.  Remember, rebuild.  And you can see images that have been uploaded and you can add images as well.  You can now tour the 9-11 Memorial and lower Manhattan.  Look at Street View. Yeah. Yeah.  Panoramic images of the north and south pools of the memorial.  And you can see the victims names engraved on the on the edges of the pools.  Haven't been able to look at that myself yet, but it's there.  If you can't make a trip to New York, it's tough to go there.  Yeah. Yeah. And Central Park.  In partnership with Central Park Conservancy, a street street view crew  went around Central Park, I guess, on bikes on 360 degree.  Yeah, 360 photo or cameras took pictures of imagery of the parks  and trails and paths and plazas.  So really, really cool way to check out Central Park as well.  I love maps. I love that.  Street View isn't really it's amazing.  It's amazing the places that you can see and do and street view.  YouTube gets the YouTube editor gets a new slow mo effect, slow motion effect.  I thought this was really interesting.  Yeah, this does look really interesting.  I'm actually I'm curious to know if Chad, if you played with this at all,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you visit the enhanced movie and every every editing program does this built in.  So I'm not sure.  I guess if you're uploading directly, maybe look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yes. I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it do Chad a better job than like, you know, Final Cut Wood  or so it's doing? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the slow mo than Final Cut Seven would do.  I haven't played with X, but it is interpolating frames between the frames.  Right. So this is, you know, what Final Cut Seven will do  is it'll just fade between frames.  So this is doing a little bit more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what they're saying?  The whole point of this is to show server side processing.  Right. Right. If you've got a Chromebook, you don't need any more  because we'll do it all on our server. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So and unfortunately, at the moment, the biggest issue is that it's not really  if I'm going to do this, I'm not wanting to do this to my entire video.  I'd want to take a clip.  This is a great first step.  It's it's a cool, you know, first proof of concept.  The power of the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't you can't select a part of the timeline of your video.  It has the whole video or nothing right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So far from what I have noticed, let me because that's normally  how the YouTube editor works is you can enhance an entire video.  You can replace audio on an entire video.  So that is what I assume.  I actually haven't done any slow mo stuff yet.  It looks pretty smooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look, yeah, it does look very smooth.  Makes it look like it film film with a high speed camera.  That was a nice, nice example in Times Square.  Finally, just after the stable version of Chrome 27 came out,  Google announced the release of Chrome 28 beta for Windows, Mac and Linux.  And the biggest new feature are these is this new rich notification center.  So this isn't Google now.  These are just browser notifications that are really nice.  They include images and and big text and small text.  They kind of look like Google now cards.  Actually, this this may be what they're talking about  when they say Google now in the browser.  This is only working on Windows.  I actually haven't seen this working yet.  I've only seen screenshots and it's going to come to Mac and Linux.  Eventually.  But this is this is really nice.  You know, I just built browser based notifications into ThinkUp,  and it's just a really nice way to know what's going on with the Web app.  And this the screenshots there on the next Web look look really nice.  Do I have to use a beta track?  Yeah, it's a Chrome 28 beta and it's Windows only right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Getting my Windows machine out of the trunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi, good friend.  Haven't seen you in 15 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you have to you have to go to a site that triggers a rich notification.  Oh, crap. Yeah, we need to find no sites.  Let's see. Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do use actually of Canary Chrome as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Looking for.  Oh, yeah. Google has a notify test app.  Yes. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me just make sure this is the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a GitHub link.  That is the code. That is not the actual page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, version 28 is coming in now.  All right. Well, we'll play with it later.  I'll put this. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all I got for the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the Google timpani drums, please change long.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Thank you, Gina Trapani.  It's a long segment.  Every week, they got lots of new stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I cut stuff.  I cut stuff.  Like that was that was the edited version.  It's amazing. Yeah, amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know the Gmail thing is back in the main one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a new we're trying that out.  I don't know if you like that sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was me making sure that slow mo works.  So I actually have done a little slow mo music.  Yeah. So I was playing with a little  clip of my own.  So what you can do is you can slice a clip that you have into multiple clips.  So you can actually pick pick a frame.  You can also do things like combine videos and  you have like a section of slow mo. Right.  So so like I have a I have an intro that I was working on.  So let me hit done.  So if I wanted to slice the clip, I can move the play head  to where I want to slice it and then hit the slice button.  And then there we go.  And now I have two separate clips.  And let's say I want this first clip.  I hit the enhance button and then I go to slow mo and let's choose 25 percent.  I hit done.  And now that first clip is now a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This looks a little like a timeline interface, you know, right.  They're moving.  I got to tell you, if I were Apple, I'd start looking back to those pros  because I don't think the low end is going to be available anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Wow.  And then you can even preview what you're doing.  And that's what you were hearing, unfortunately, was the and even does the audio.  Oh, the audio is not going to render. Wow.  Yeah. No, no renders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is key. No rendering. No, no thumb twiddling.  No, that was instant.  Powerful machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so let's let's find out.  I may publish this really weird video.  Stop, stop there.  May publish this really weird video to my YouTube account. But  so there's a little bit of processing on their side rendering.  But from what I have, you know,  from any time that I've uploaded a video, their processing is way faster  than just uploading it. So exactly.  We can try to find out.  Let me have a few more computers than you do.  They have a few more. Yes. Yes, absolutely.  So, yeah, and it's actually more featured than than I originally expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is amazing.  I I really do think that's the first of you'll probably see,  just as you did with the Picasso and then eventually Google plus  more and more smarts on the server side.  And eventually who needs a video editing program?  You can do it all in a pixel. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And from this, I can choose multiple videos to merge into one video.  So if I've taken five different clips on my phone that automatically were  uploaded, but in a private fashion to YouTube,  I can now take those three clips and make them a full video with editing  in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, darn, this content has been flagged as infringing.  I'm sorry, Chad. They just pulled it down.  Darn. Very slowly.  You know, that's not slow. That they do that quite.  No, I'm just kidding.  That's the only we can only it just got pulled.  No, I was joking.  Getting. Oh, OK.  Oh, but you believe that, which is kind of the point.  It could happen. It has many a time.  Well, that's neat. I think that's really, really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that is really cool.  I got to play around with the YouTube editor a little bit like when I was  when I was watching the the the the all about Android fan  who had edited together Ron Richards reaction to Glass,  which was the greatest thing, which was so great.  But I was like, wow, you know, could you do something like that?  You do an edit like that.  That was a great edit, very quick at it, though, in the YouTube editor.  Has it gotten that good? It seems like.  I don't know. It's just clip to clip to clip to clip.  Yeah, it was just clip to clip to clip to clip.  Yeah. So you'd have to just slicing it up and then, you know,  the hard part is when you're going to start mixing soundtracks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and that kind of stuff.  Yeah, that's where I can imagine it getting a little more headache.  But if all you're doing is slice, slice, slice, slice.  Yeah, I would imagine YouTube could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call it simple A.B. editing in the biz.  Thank you. It is what most people do, frankly.  Yeah. I mean, yeah, if you're doing something fancier,  you probably do want something fancier, but you don't need it.  And for 90 percent of editing, you probably, you know,  server side is probably the way to go.  What's cool? Yeah.  I mean, they're not doing that much yet, but I just I can see them  adding a tool every few weeks to the point where by the end of the year  you got something amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they even have like Creative Commons music that you. Oh, they do?  Yeah, that's in video.  So like right now I hit the Creative Commons tab. Oh, my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they have quite a bit of capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm in I'm in stock footage of Alcatraz that I never had that,  you know, I didn't own.  I can click music. Let's choose home.  I don't even know what this is. Throw this on.  Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is that? That's the Creative Commons music.  No, I'm playing Roll It. Go ahead. Roll it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now this is Open Your Eyes with Alcatraz in the background.  Heck, yeah. That's right.  It's the rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We love little Mars Ulrich hears that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we won't get pulled off of YouTube because that's that's their music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. This is the next YouTube.  This is the next awesome thing.  Roll it. Have you guys played this? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I it crashed for me last night, but I got it working today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is on Chrome.  You go to chrome.com slash campaign slash roll it down low needed  and no download needed. Open your phone's browser.  All right, let's do that.  And now I'm going to do this on the air.  But guys, please don't steal my code. OK, it's not cool.  OK, T.I.T.V.F.  Got to do this quickly before somebody else does T.I.T.V.F.  in my mobile browser.  And you could show it over. I said it out loud.  You can show it. OK, so now I don't know how they do this,  but somehow match. Oh, wait a minute. I did it wrong. Try again.  Oh, you got to enter it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  T.I.T.V.F. Where's the music coming from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The laptop from the lab, the roll it game.  We're in the roll it arcade.  OK, now they're synced up.  Now watch I tilt to select the number of players.  One, two or three.  This works.  Is that wild?  I'm playing it on my phone. I don't know how they do this.  I guess the I guess it's all HTML5, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The phone is sending it right now. Watch this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So first I aim it.  I'm going to aim a little bit to the left now.  Chad, you're going to have to see the whole thing because I'm going to swing it.  Oh, a little too vigorous there.  Let's try that again.  Roll. Oh, just missed 50 there.  Ten points. Ten points.  Ever play Skee Ball?  This is an interesting, I don't know what use of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ten years old and at Chuck E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cheese. Yeah, the music, too, right?  So and you do get tickets, by the way, at the end of it.  I don't know what you can do with it. Oh, so close.  Let's aim a little bit more to the right here.  Just a little left. I mean, OK, you can get a Bitcoin.  Yeah, get a Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have to be running Chrome on Android, right?  This doesn't work in just browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says any browser, but they prefer Chrome.  They prefer Chrome. But it's a show of five.  So, yeah, developer lady, tell us how they do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying to figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's obviously not Wi-Fi.  It's connecting back to the obviously.  So here's what I think.  The there's an HTML5 app in my phone that can see the accelerometer,  something you can't do on an iPhone. Right.  So it can see the accelerometer and it's just sending that back to the website.  And the website's updating based on accelerometer information from my phone.  Oh, I hit a cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everyone in the chat room is saying, yeah, device API plus WebSockets.  Yeah, WebSockets, no big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever. Isn't that cool?  But Google is so smart to do this for several reasons.  Of course, it promotes HTML5, but it also promotes open  access to the hardware, which is something.  Remember, I said Apple's painted itself into a corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, if we had three players, is that three players in the same place?  Or could you and Gina and I play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that is a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I've had enough. But yeah.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's a code, I mean, it has. Yeah, we could we can play remotely, right?  It's a code that you just give you the code.  I don't need to be there. Yeah.  Is that wild? It's pretty wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, it's a dumb game, but that's not the point.  The point is the technology involved.  I think that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We used to have to go to Chuck E.  Cheese for this people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just think there's there's Gina being nostalgic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, like back in my day,  we had to touch the gross balls that everybody else touched to play that game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I really do think that it underscores.  And, you know, over and over again, you see that that there's stuff  that you can do on an Android phone you will never be able to do on an iPhone  because only Apple has the keys to the kingdom.  Only Apple can look at the right, you know, a hardware.  Only Apple can do a lot of things.  And I understand Apple's made that choice, but they've made their bed.  Now they got to lie in it.  They made the choice for security that we control this very, very tightly.  And I think it's smart for Google to say, OK,  but you can develop for the Android phone.  Wait a minute. It works on an iPhone.  OK, I take it all back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, if these are standards, it works on an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm shocked.  The browser is just HTML.  Well, yeah, you could say that.  But for Apple to give access to hardware level  APIs is unusual.  I'm shocked. OK, never mind.  I take it all back. Everything I said was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Meanwhile, however, somebody from Adweek still managed to write  the negative story about this.  I don't know. It's just yeah.  Can you believe this? Spoilsport was big bad.  Google, I don't know.  What's big and bad about this? It's a skeeball.  Nothing. I'm so sick of media, technical panic at every possible turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting.  So Apple gives HTML5 WebSockets access to the gyroscope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, an app developer gets access to it through through  making the game app or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's different because then you can vet the game app.  Oh, I see. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, I mean, the the device is giving the gyro or to access to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an HTML5 API, right?  So it's it's merely supporting HTML5 fully, but I'm just surprised.  Is it Chrome or Safari that's doing it?  Well, is anybody playing on Safari on the iPhone?  Because Chrome. Oh, wait a minute.  The iOS folks are saying you have to use an app.  Oh, you can you do it with your browser is the question on the iPhone.  No, Safari, they're saying Safari works.  And then it asks you HTML5 Excel.  It asks you it asks for permission and says, can we access the hardware?  That I would expect Chrome works on iOS and Safari works on iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK, I take it all back.  Thank you, Apple. That's the right way to be.  It's just that's the kind of thing Apple normally would do.  All right. And I have rebooted my Ubuntu desktop after installing Chrome.  Let's move on.  Something else. What should we talk about, kids?  Well, I'm trying to get this thing working.  I apologize. I'm using a new computer for the first time.  It just came and I wasn't really prepared to use it.  Are you ready for the new Gmail, the first story?  Yes, the new Gmail iOS or Android or desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Both. In fact, I didn't include this.  I didn't include this in the change log because it's coming out  in the next few weeks in the coming week.  So I actually haven't used it yet.  So I tried to keep it down to stuff that's coming.  You know, it's pretty available, but it's basically it's there's  that there is that smart labels lab, right, which automatically  sorted your mail into promotions and social and updates and forums.  And it looks like they are graduating that to be.  Native and that those labels are going to show up in the kind of native  the native apps on Android and iOS, it appears.  Tabs the top. Uh huh. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is that better?  It looks like they're a bunch of ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what strikes me.  Oh, great. I'm never going to click on.  I can see more ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One tab for promotions and offers. Oh, boy.  Is that your Gmail making that sound?  Yeah, that's the ad that's making that sound.  Oh, Lord above.  Do you think we're going to get pulled down by the Delphonics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. This is part of this this video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so paranoid now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it all makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can see that in the tabs, really.  The inbox has gone Google again, but the tabs.  What are they? It said social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Social promotion, offers and updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's too much.  Basically, I have things I want to read and the rest.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe if it moves all the crap into promotions, I wouldn't be unhappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then it's already in the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is primary priority inbox or is that just?  Thanks for confusing the hell out of us, Google.  Yeah.  I want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm actually worried because I use the Chrome offline Gmail app  and they've oversimplified it to the extent that it's hard to get to some simple functions  and it's it's dumbed down too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it looks like you can disable the tabs if you don't like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can. It says you can. Yes.  Yeah, but that's always maybe temporary.  That's for now. You stick in the mud. You.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it a form of filtering, though?  I mean, what are they?  There's also a plus over on the other side, so you could create another.  You can make more tabs so I could have a Gina tab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's labels.  So that field trial, that smart labels field trial is basically just labels.  But that, you know, it's much like priority inbox except divining,  you know, is this a mailing list message?  Is this a promotional email?  Is this an update, a social update, which is somebody circled you on Google plus  or followed you on Twitter?  So I've had I've had that on for quite some time and it's actually pretty good at it.  Yeah, not if you choose forums.  Yeah, it's not so bad, but this is this is a huge.  I actually had only seen the mobile app screenshots.  I hadn't seen the desktop screenshots.  I'm a little kind of put off, honestly, by the giant tabs across the top.  I I'm sort of I am too.  I live in the in the in the the web based version of Gmail.  So I'm a little bit like somebody came into my house and they've rearranged the furniture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'll play back to pine for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you won't get this unless you're part of the of the field trial.  Or who gets this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because I don't have it yet.  This is rolling out gradually, they said in the next few weeks.  Oh, if you'd like to have the new inbox on desktop sooner,  keep an eye on the gear menu and select configure inbox when it appears in the settings option.  OK, let's see if I have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in the settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see. I've got a menu.  Oh, you do.  Yeah. So do you want to turn it on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Turn it on. What do you look for, Gina?  In the gear menu, there's a configure inbox button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not in mine. So I don't have it yet.  OK. Yeah.  I don't have it. Do I have to go to settings first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, just the gear menu and then configure.  OK, so yeah, I don't have that.  It's display density and it's above settings in mine.  Oh, yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm. I did just get a notification.  Popped up triangulation because it's in my calendar.  So I got a pop up notification on Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Huh? So are you using your apps address or your Gmail address?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't use apps.  I don't want to. This is my apps address.  Oh, Gina's using her apps address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is my apps address, which is exciting.  Let me see if my other address has it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I just wanted to go.  Gina was saying I don't like this.  Well, something new. It doesn't matter.  She's in before the rest of us.  She's excited. I'm here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got it.  But, you know, if you could make tabs of your own,  get rid of their stupid tabs and use filtering into tabs.  Now, how is it different from folders?  It's just a different presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just it's just a list.  It's like looking at a label.  It's like looking at all the messages in a label. So.  But but but Google makes the does these labels.  So Google figures out.  So my social tab is is is packed with Twitter, Facebook, Flickr,  all these sort of notifications from from social apps with with  promotions is empty for me.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, nothing news come in since you turned it on, probably. Right.  So it's not backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it did. It autosorted my my mail.  So like my forums tab, I'm on a bunch of mailing lists because I'm open source.  But so that that's all.  Those are all listed there.  Yeah, this is I'll leave this on and try it out.  I'm a little dubious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Too bad they don't have a buzz tab.  Move all my Google Buzz messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you notice that the Buzz email went out like at midnight  on Friday night before Memorial Day and so I happen to be up online  and working because I'm a night owl.  And I was like, wow, this is very well timed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're moving it to they're moving all your buzzing to your Google Drive.  Yeah.  Bearing it.  Yeah, at least they didn't throw it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was nicer than the way Yahoo shuts down sites. Right.  That's one thing you got to get.  Well, they always do the takeout and the export takeout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's going to be a massive XML file that's completely useless.  Right. I mean, what are we going to get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty much. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That won't happen until July 17th.  I loved Buzz.  I was an early buzz adopter, as usual.  What is this Google code download option deprecated?  What happened there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think they had so you know, GitHub did the same thing.  So this actually isn't a huge news update, but the Google code,  much like GitHub, like it gives you the it would give you the option  to upload files that that people could download.  So you would do that, say, if you had a compiled version of your code  or, you know, a zip package, for example.  And I think it was just getting abused.  I think people were using it to host, you know, I don't know,  pirated material, pornography, of course, that makes sense.  How about a Dropbox kind of thing?  So they disabled a good download similarly a few months ago as well  saying, hey, there are better solutions out there for hosting downloads.  And they're right, it is.  So, yeah, no, no big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When a bridge goes out and you're using old GPS maps,  that could actually be very dangerous if the GPS steers you onto the bridge.  If you're using Google Maps, nothing to worry about.  They when the Washington State I-5 bridge collapse  happened on Thursday evening by Friday morning, Google Maps was fixed.  As soon as the local news picked up on the bridge collapse,  somebody used the map maker tool to go into Google Maps to edit it  and reflect the bridge collapse.  Volunteers, man.  That's where crowdsourcing is so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't Google still pop up a disclaimer, though, with navigation?  For the first time, it says like, hey, you should actually pay attention  to signs and maybe not exactly check other maps, right?  They always kind of have to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and part of the reason is that the turn by turn  has to be updated by engineers.  So the turn by turn could still have sent you to that collapsed bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, of course, you would you wouldn't go out, get onto the bridge.  You would see the signs. I mean, you know.  Well, that's why you should pay. It's actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably is true.  It is the case.  Do you get your new Google Maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even the turn by turn, though, Leo.  I mean, you know, whether it's Google or whether it's Waze,  you know, they're rooting you around traffic. Right. Instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Waze is great that way.  Waze is wonderful.  And I think if a bridge goes down on Waze, they will route you around.  And they do it silently, by the way.  No, it's a hazard. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Market is a hazard. Yeah.  Way. Last night, I was going out somewhere and it was  it was having me go off on a service road.  And I thought, this is ridiculous.  Why? I'm going to come right back on.  But it had me miss a half mile of traffic.  It was just smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do love Waze.  Now, Facebook was rumored to be looking at it or talking.  Yeah, that's now Google as well.  Well, the Facebook fell through or has been can't.  I don't know what they the latest is.  No, they're not going to buy it.  I don't know if Google needs Waze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Google. I don't think they really need it.  And I would rather have had it in Google's hands than Facebook's hands.  Just right. Because the community that adds up to a really useful map. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with you on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wrote a business plan for this.  Fifteen years ago, where our New York traffic reports suck so badly,  the rule is an old colleague of mine said that if you hear that there's a crash on a bridge,  go to where that they say don't go, because by the time they've learned about it,  it's already cleared up and nobody else is going there.  And you're going to have better traffic than you ever had.  That's so sad. It's true.  And so what I wanted to do was this this crowdsourced notion,  but it probably wasn't back in the day.  There was no way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Once everybody's carrying a cell phone.  It's a you. I wish that's I mean, it's a brilliant idea.  And anybody who's tried to listen to radio traffic reports to save time realizes it's hopeless.  It's not going to help you at all. I gave up on it myself.  But now with this, I mean, even now, Google now will tell you.  In fact, Google, that's what I'm saying is Google may not need Waze.  Google now will say, hey, there's bad traffic.  Don't you know? Speaking of Facebook, they've decided not to bring the HTC first to the UK.  That was the phone that came out of the box featuring Facebook Home.  I guess Facebook Home is kind of flopped.  I think it's safe to say that now. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a surprise?  We thought that if you were a heavy Facebook user, it might be desirable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe not. It does surprise me.  I did assume that if you were a heavy Facebook user and the numbers support  that most people spend time on their phone on Facebook,  that Facebook Home would be a good solution.  But it sounds like Facebook is kind of pulling back and retooling based on customer feedback.  They've decided to add to focus on adding new customization features.  So I wonder what that means. I wonder if that means what I hope that that means is  we're going to open up Facebook Home so that it's not so entirely Facebook, you know, centric.  It felt like you had to dig deep to do anything but Facebook other than Facebook.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I put it on and immediately, you know, 15 minutes later took it off.  And yet, and you were standing there.  You remember when we ran into Bradley Horowitz at Google I.O.  I said, boy, I'd love to see a Google plus kind of a Facebook Home.  And what was it he did, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He kind of said you'd like to see much more than that.  And you will. Yeah. Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He pretty much said, yeah, we're working on it.  And he probably already knew that Facebook Home was not a success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Presumably.  I've heard zero discussion about it either way.  Yeah. It was so limiting to have to get a limited number of phones to get this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I like chat heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've used chat heads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a there's a notification system, the chat head style notification system for Android.  That's what I've been playing with.  It's kind of cool. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, which one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called pop pop bubbles or something.  I can't remember what it is, but your notifications come up with little chat heads  and you can do all the same things you do with chat heads.  But it's all the notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was all notifications. It's not like your friend's face.  It's yeah, it's whatever the app is.  Yeah. Very cool. Very cool.  Yeah, I don't use Facebook heavily, but a friend of mine just I have a few friends who  message me on Facebook.  And recently that happened this week in it.  And it showed up on my phone or chat heads.  I was like, oh, that's nice.  And I'm just running, you know, messenger updated to chat heads.  And I actually I liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room, web 3778 says he loves the new Gmail inbox.  This new inbox is amazing, he says.  And another chatter, Jester is saying CNET is reporting that the HTC One  vanilla Google experience phone is a go.  Confirmed and coming in the summer, according to CNET news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? How much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, 650 bucks for the Galaxy S4.  And this is probably in that ballpark, I would guess as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so this inbox was interesting about these tabs and the G.  Sorry to jump around, but like if you get a new message under a certain tab,  like you get a little notification on that tab, which is kind of cool.  Saying, oh, hey, there's new messages here.  Yeah, this is this is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I want it, even though I didn't before you made me want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google gods, please bestow the configure inbox option in the gear menu upon my co-host.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This week instead of that, I'll take I'll take a screen invitation to the internship.  I've been trying to I've been trying to get a screening so I can go see it and talk about  the show and I can't get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, was I wrong? Apparently all the reviews are positive on this new Owen Wilson.  Yeah, Vince Vaughn movie where they play interns, superannuated interns at Google.  And we saw the trailer and at least I thought, oh, this looks really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it does look really bad.  Apparently it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great to Eric Schmidt had a cameo that was left on the cutting room floor.  Oh, that's too bad.  Sergey's in it twice.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when is this?  When is this?  June 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the so who is it does this?  Jeff, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Katie cork knows who I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A friend of Katie's.  You're you're a reviewer from years gone by.  I mean, I used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said I said this twig has an audience of six million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd bring in your that's a lie.  But OK, you'd bring in your Pixel Chrome.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll I'll I'll I'll wear a chrome sticker on my forehead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do we get Jeff into a screening in New York City?  I used to be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I used to be I was on all the lists.  Now I'm nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I was in San Francisco radio, I was on that list.  And there's this beautiful screening room down on Market Street.  And it's small.  It's maybe 20 people each.  Everybody gets like a beautiful reclining.  She's cushy.  And you know, you're special because you're seeing the movie.  I don't know.  Those were the days, weren't they?  Yeah.  Mick LaSalle sitting there in the front row going, I hate this.  I hate this.  I hate this.  It's great.  It's so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need to send you in with glass so you can live stream it.  So the rest of us can watch it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How long before movie theaters bang glass?  That's next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that'll be such a great way to watch a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when you go to the bathroom, you just leave the glass on the seat.  Yeah.  Won't miss a thing.  No, you need two glasses for that.  You could have a hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, live hangout, live streaming hangout.  The internship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of Nexus style phones, apparently there's a leak that says the Nexus 4 will come out in white.  Does that does that excite you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We want the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will we see a Nexus X?  Remember we were all excited about that before Google.  Yeah, the Motorola, the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still having hardware lust, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's something new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jared Pixel didn't quite do it for you because he had it already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, it does, Gina.  It does.  It most certainly does.  Oh, it does.  I'm excited.  I'm satisfied.  I'm happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, having played with this just for the last hour, this new Linux laptop,  because you're using a browser so much, it's fine.  You don't feel like you're using some oddball operating system.  I mean, I'm sitting here in Chrome doing all that same stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does it take to update Ubuntu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a little update program you run.  I already did it.  I did it while we were talking.  It's a program we run, okay.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see.  I gotta take Linux lessons.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel really bad for these guys who basically used a Google search  to find a security flaw at Scripps News.  They discovered personal data for 170,000.  Oh, no, they were reporters for Scripps News.  They found a security flaw.  They were reporters, yes.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to imply that Scripps had the problem.  TerraCom.  Actually, it's kind of relevant because this is not only a cell phone  company, but it's the one that does the free phones.  YourTel and TerraCom are owned by Vcare, which is an Indian-based service  that verify applicants for the free cell phones, the low-income free cell phone program.  Apparently, 170,000 customers' personal information, including social security numbers,  was sitting on a publicly accessible server, which the reporters found with a Google search.  They have now been branded hackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They use the hacker program, WGit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they use WGit.  That was what got them in real trouble.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, they literally used WGit?  Yeah.  They did the search in the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They used WGit to search for and download data from this open FTP server or whatever.  Yeah, they used HTTP and FTP.  Bulk downloaded.  And of course, they didn't hide their access to it.  TerraCom said this came from a Scripps IP address.  They identify them as the Scripps hackers.  These hackers.  That's a moral panic.  A P request.  Yep, moral panic writ large.  Amazon's launched a login service, a la Google and Facebook, Login with Amazon.  Single sign-in.  Works on Android as well as iOS and through the web.

Transcript:  Is there any AWS advantage that comes with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  It's just Amazon's another player in the single sign-in.  You had another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  Well, Amazon's got the advantage of...  You go to Amazon to buy stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've got your credit card.  Makes it easy to buy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of like what Google does with Wallet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I think the user mindset with Amazon is a little bit...  When I think Amazon, I'm going to purchase something.  You know what I mean?  I feel like I'm more on that mindset.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tell you what.  Unless you guys have something else I'm looking through here that you want to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you see the Hitler teapot?  Did you see the Hitler teapot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Godwin's Law in effect already.  Let me see.  It's a viral sensation for JCPenney.  Is it an actual Hitler teapot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go open it up and you'll see the picture.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a social media uproar.  Sensation.  It is a teapot that looks a little bit like Hitler.  But only...  You got to really...  You got to have a good imagination.  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But once you see it, you can't get out of your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So on the right, the billboard for JCPenney, it's just a normal teapot.  A little handle, a little knob for the lid.  I'm a little teapot, short and stout.  I got my arm to pour it out.  But then if you juxtapose it with a picture of the Fuhrer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it does kind of look...  It does.  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is fantastic.  I mean, the sweep of the hair and the nose.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It became a huge sensation.  I don't know if it was sold out or it was pulled down.  The teapots are now already selling for higher prices on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Poor JCPenney can't catch a break and then they have this.  So JCPenney put out all kinds of tweets trying to say,  we were going to design a teapot to look like something.  We designed it to look like a snowman.  They put up a picture of a snowman teapot.  This was not designed to look like anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of...  You can't imagine that they did that on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, having seen it, it's hard as you said, hard to unsee it.  Yeah.  I don't know who saw it first though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't either, but I think it's Reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's probably Reddit.  Wow.  And JCPenney, of course, trying to do damage control.  That's tough.  Because people probably assume, oh, they did it on purpose.  Yeah, there you go.  That's much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what JCPenney says that they were designed,  if they designed a teapot to look like something.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They responded with a little sense of humor anyway.  Yes, they did.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess, hard to have a sense of humor, but we...  It's pretty good.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I gotta say, I do like that this one got 300 retweets and 57 favorites,  but JCPenney's got five retweets and three thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'll favorite you, JCPenney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  JCP.  FTC beginning a new inquiry on Google.  We should probably mention that.  Although these things go on and on.  What is the FTC now?  It's business practices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's now display ads.  Display ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're specifically wondering whether the company is bundling advertising services  in such a way that it prohibits rivals from competing for the business of advertising.  An investigation doesn't mean anything necessarily.  They're just looking into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you guys get to talk to Matt about XMPP and Hangouts last week by any chance?  No, we didn't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shouldn't ask him about that.  At the time, it wasn't clear that they were abandoning it.  I think he mentioned it a little bit.  It wasn't clear that they were abandoning it completely,  but now it feels like maybe they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, it was weird.  It was a weird under-sun kind of thing.  There was that Verge story that had that one line about how it was a difficult decision,  but not a whole lot of coverage, but the EFF  posted Google abandoned open standards for instant messaging.  I mean, I have to say that this put me off a little bit.  I was like, hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  XMPP, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol, is a really great standard.  We, for a long time, ran an XMPP server.  It's very flexible.  It's very interesting.  And Google did use it because originally Google Talk was Jabber compatible,  and Jabber is an XMPP client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jabber is XMPP, right?  So now that Hangouts is taking over Google Talk,  so it's possible for...  So if someone is a Jabber user or an XMPP user and is connected to Google servers,  that's fine.  They can use Hangouts, albeit, I think, in a limited fashion,  just text IMs come through.  Chad, we talked about this.  I forget if it was AAA or Twig, but it's as if you're connected to another XMPP server.  That server can't communicate with folks using Hangouts.  And it's not obvious.  It just looks as if they're not there.  So they just decided that XMPP didn't do what they needed for it to do,  and so it's no longer interoperable with Hangouts.  Which kind of sucks.  For a company whose CEO got on stage and talked about how he's so disappointed  that other companies would support interoperability with them,  which is what Larry Page is saying at Google I.O.  I think this is a legitimate hypocrite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I want to hear them talk about why they did it.  Maybe there's a good reason.  Maybe security or something.  They need to respond to it.  The problem is it's such an obscure thing that there's not a big drum beat about it  that they haven't responded to it.  They need to talk.  Somebody needs to step forward and say,  look, this is why, this is what it is.  We needed to do this because.  In the absence of that, you're going to assume  it's something anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't want interoperability between chat clients.  In fact, that's what Larry was specifically complaining about, wasn't he?  That who was it?  Was it Microsoft didn't allow Google to interoperate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was he was talking about Exchange and Gmail, right?  ActiveSync, right?  With Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I thought they were talking a little bit about IIM as well.  Or he mentioned IIM in some context.  He may have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he brought up the Java Suite with Oracle, right?  He mentioned Microsoft.  Although Google had just seen Microsoft for their YouTube app on Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've worked that out.  They've worked that out, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're working together on an app for your Windows phone.  All is well.  Kissing made up.  I would like to hear more about why they dumped XMPP.  I'm willing to have an open mind that maybe there's a technical reason  why it was something they needed to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, what if the answer is we just needed to move forward  and XMPP just didn't do what we needed it to do in order to work with Hangouts.  I mean, like this is kind of the same thing with Blink, right?  Well, we forked WebKit because we have a different vision for what it should be.  And we need to move it forward on our roadmap.  It feels a little with Blink, I'm kind of like, well, OK, I guess I can see that.  With XMPP, that feels a little flimsy.  But you're right.  I would love to get somebody on to actually to discuss it.  It hasn't been a really big issue.  I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more coverage.  But the critics have definitely picked it up as clear evidence  that Google really isn't about openness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The implication is that is there an API for Hangouts?  I mean, is Hangouts open?  The implication is that only Google could make a Hangout client if it were XMPP.  Anybody could make Hangouts in a rough way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I don't think so right now.  I think Google would say that it's early in there, that there will be an API eventually.  But this is what XMPP is for, right?  This is what you would do to chat with someone on another network.  You would use XMPP and you were able to do that before Google Talk.  It's the backslide that's troubling.  It used to work and now it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, there actually may be a response.  Here's from Computer World.  Thank you to F. Alex in our chat room.  Google argues it had to use proprietary tech in Hangouts.  The company is catching flak.  Let's see if there's a quote.  Google spokeswoman said via email, Google had good reasons to go down the path it chose  for Hangouts.  Over the past several years, we've worked to bring the world an open messaging system,  but no company has been willing to join our efforts.  After seven years, it's evident that the rest of the industry is not moving to embrace this  open system.  If at some point in the future the industry shows interest,  what about open source programmers?  What about open source code?  What about Pigeon and Trillian and all the other clients that support XMPP?  What industry?  You're talking about Facebook and Apple?  We would be open to discussions about developing an interface that's designed for modern needs.  That's, you're right, that's exactly the wrong answer.  That's exactly the wrong answer.  They said the openness of Google Talk yielded bad user experiences,  making it vulnerable to spam attacks.  That's true.  If it's using XMPP, you could write a bot that would use it.  It sounds a lot like Apple.  Yeah.  When XMPP was designed, said the spokeswoman, smartphones and social networks didn't exist.  Both trends essentially transformed communication, but the standard remains unchanged.  I think my experience with XMPP is a very flexible standard.  It could be adapted.  For example, mobile has several requirements around bandwidth and battery that are simply  not part of the standard, and audio and video integration are not well defined.  It's XML.  It's extensible.  I don't know if I buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I am.  I am disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No response immediately from Peter St. André.  We've interviewed him, by the way, on our Floss Weekly podcast.  He's the executive director of the XMPP Standards Foundation.  In Twitter, he said, Google can stop supporting XMPP,  but it's impossible for them to kill it.  That's the beauty of distributed technologies.  As you said, the EFF is saying, make it public, make it interoperable.  Releasing, says the EFF, releasing the specifications  for Google Hangouts would be a good first step.  I agree.  I mean, you could make, if you made it open,  and you said, look, we got a better way, it's open, that would be different.  If you don't make it open, then what you're really saying is,  we want to own this space and we don't want Microsoft and others to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, we'll wait and see.  Uh, Tolly says Facebook Chat does support XMPP.  I'm not aware of that, but that's interesting.  XMPP client to server will be supported by Hangouts, says Winster.  It's about server to server federation,  which means anyone could link to Google's servers with their users.  That, that, you know, maybe that's, if that's all it is,  then that's maybe not so bad.  More to be, more to read about on that.  Android 4.3, according to Ars Technica, slated for June 10th.  Just came out.  That would be interesting.  We're waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't really know what's in it except the new camera UI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just know we won't get it unless we're running a Nexus 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all we know.  I hope the Galaxy Nexus gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the new, the new Galaxy S4 will play vanilla, we'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bear is in the chat room.  He's our assistant and is actually an expert on XMPP.  I don't know if we can get him on.  I don't think we have time, Bear.  Can you give us a one-liner in the chat room as to  your position on Google Talk or Hangouts Abandoning XMPP?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We'll wait and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You say that Computer World article is very controversial.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll let him speak.  Sorry, that was a little bit of a Hitler teapot buzzkill.  Of a Hitler teapot buzzkill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were all high from the Hitler teapot and then you, you brought that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and then the chat room said, the chat room said, by the way, Google, Google, Hitler House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there's a Hitler House?  A house that looks like Hitler?  A Hitler House.  You know, Hitler kind of was a graphic meme.  All right, let me try it.  Anyway.  This just doesn't get old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, the house looks a little bit like him, but not exactly like him.  Looks like the teapot, actually.  That's really silly.  You'd really, you'd have to have a very good imagination.  It's from, the house is in Wales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right.  Can you imagine all the geeks who go on Pilgrimages, that house, the poor people were in it?  Take pictures.  Look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Let us get our tip and number and tool of the week, starting with Gina Trapani, your tip, my dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, tip of the week is that Google has incorporated your photos into the regular search box.  So we talked about before how you can search for my flights and get your flight information from Gmail.  You can do this for your photos now.  That's wild.  And which is cool.  And Google is, these are Google Plus photos and Google's using computer vision to figure out what is in your photos.  So for example, if you search for, this is the exact same.  My photos of flowers.  You will see photos of flowers you've taken with your phone and uploaded to Google Plus.  If you have instant upload on, you've got lots of them and you can see all your photos of flowers.  I didn't have a lot of photos of flowers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not perfect.  I had tons of pictures of trees because they all fell down around me.  They caught like two of 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, look at my thick pictures of flowers, ladies and gentlemen.  That's all flowers all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is all flowers.  I did my pictures of my photos of food and it did a really good job of figuring out like plates of meals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, I got bacon.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think about how difficult it is to figure out what's food.  This is very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got people eating.  It's got my mom and my daughter cooking.  Wow.  Okay.  I'm impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm impressed.  Does this work with any arbitrary noun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so.  Yeah.  I tried baby and it didn't find Etta.  So I don't know.  I don't know if I had the facial tag.  If I had to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My photos of animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Nice.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Damn, Google's smart.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, Google's really doing recognition, object recognition in our photos.  And now you can get it right from the search box.  It's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm looking at my photos of cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is another case though.  It doesn't come up with any.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You take way too many pictures of cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  I do.  Yeah.  I did flowers and it only got one tree that I apparently...  Oh, this is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I entered my photos of cats, I get a picture of cat Schwartz.  A woman I used to work with named Cat.  She does have a horse on her shirt.  No cats.  That's interesting.  So you got to do animals, broad nouns.  But this is a new game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  Now I'm trying animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My picture of genus.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah, because I'm tagged in that photo.  I think we're on the food attack.  My search of furniture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is ridiculous.  Wow.  I searched for my photos of animals.  I went to the San Diego Zoo and it found...  Wow.  Yeah.  So tip of the week.  I guess it was a winner.  This is pretty awesome.  Who needs a brain?  Wow, my photos of furniture.  Do you think about that?  How it's recognizing furniture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What that means, by the way, is this has all been done already.  Whoa.  What'd you search for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My photos of hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, only Chad could...  That search only works for Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is weird.  I didn't think it would have done that.  But look, it got photos of people's hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is so funny.  I tried it and it's all pictures of...  Mine too.  ...long hair, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that.  It came up with that picture we were talking about of me when I was 14.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  My photos of cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is kind of...  Okay.  This is a little scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So JBR in the chat room asked, and this is a good question,  do you think that this is less or more exciting than Graph Search on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's all of a parcel, right?  I mean, what it means is they're categorizing everything now.  Everything.  Yeah.  Wow, that's wild.  We could just do this all day.  My photos of Hitler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just ask, if you do this in Google+, where do you do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you do it in Google Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google Search, yeah.  So it's photos of...  It's in your search results.  So I think you can do my photos of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a problem.  My search, my machine is signed in under my apps account.  Right.  And my...  Google, fix it!  You're smart.  If you can do this, if you can find furniture, you can fix this.  Look at my photos of sunsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, nice one, Leo.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't know you were such a romantic, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, look, Paris.  It's Paris, the sunset over there.  Oh, it's a beautiful, beautiful night in Paris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if this makes me want to upload more photos or fewer photos.  Like, I'm kind of off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because now it's going to find your best photos.  It's going to fix your photos.  It's going to understand what your photos are.  Now, when you start clicking all day long, you're going to have access to your photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to have a window into my brain.  It'll know exactly what I think is valuable enough to snap a picture.  It already does.  I should just give up.  It's got a window in a brain just based on my search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I, for one, welcome my new brain.  You too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, when you get old, you welcome anything.  It can help you remember stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a who found it.  Did Google announce that or did somebody just find it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this was an announcement.  I actually, I cheated and I left this out of the changelog because I wanted to use it as my tip.  They announced it this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is so neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Last question.  Number of the week, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I've got a lot of choices.  I'm going to skip the Mary Meeker has her annual PowerPoint porn,  but I'll skip that because it's full of numbers.  I'm going to an event tonight.  Amazon is holding.  They have sold five million Kindle singles.  I find that big.  Wow.  A few of them are yours.  And then also Kickstarter just has a new project up called the Arkid.  $1 million goal to put up a space telescope with $164,000 raised already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, let the government do it.  What do we need to do that for?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a million enough.  Really?  Oh, wait a minute.  There's a scientist.  He's wearing a lab coat.  So it must be true.  He can't hear you.  And apparently protective goggles.  Whoa.  Now a physician.  Listen, like the same guy.  It's some guy.  I wish to build a space that oh, it's got a Nexus seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can get your picture.  You can send your picture to it and get a picture back of you with your picture in space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the guy.  I don't know if this is a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The idea they're saying is for students.  This opens this up and opens up the satellite open source for students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the resolution?  Do we know?  Here, I'm going to listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel better about backing this than Zach Braff's new movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  That's true.  I'll go for you on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, the amount pledged actually updates live on Kickstarter.  I didn't know that.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it does.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's new.  That didn't used to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's going is clicking over like here's the staff that will be running the telescope.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's like eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.  And apparently they couldn't afford monitors on those desks.  So they've got a printer straps to it and nothing at all on com.  She's reading a note.  She's reading a notebook.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a little bare bones.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A million does seem low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how you can do that for a million.  The gas alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you're probably putting it up on something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my tip is remember, I really want to use this HTC one, but the no replaceable battery  means I got to get it through the day.  Hard to do, especially when something's got a great screen and you want to use it  and take pictures all the time.  XDA developers, a great resource for anybody who uses Android,  has a battery savings tip page that actually I found useful for any Android device.  Things like, for instance, turn off the auto sync on the Facebook app.  Set the auto refresh interval to never for massive battery savings  because Facebook's always downloading crap.  A number of settings that you might want to do disabling apps.  A couple of really good apps.  One called Greenify that lets you force apps to sleep.  Apps that would otherwise be running in the background downing stuff all the time.  Greenify is a very cool app.  I already mentioned Lux, which is much better than the normal auto brightness settings.  Really lets you control it in a granular way.  And here's a really great app that I installed.  Now, my question always with these apps, and I should warn you,  you know, if you don't get great results, maybe you should take this app off,  is that can you monitor battery life without killing battery life?  Task switchers for a long time were one of the biggest problems on Android phones  because they were eating all these CPU cycles.  But this is really an interesting battery monitor.  It used to be called Badass Battery Monitor.  They changed the name to GSAM Battery Monitor so we could say it on the show.  And it's free and it installs.  There may be a pro version.  Yeah, there is $1.99 for the pro version.  But it really does a great job of monitoring more than the stuff that you get from  what I used to think was awesome.  The settings power information.  Now I get a very accurate, based on previous results, timer.  62% left.  That means I'm going to get 13 hours and 45 minutes.  When I did these, by the way, all of these settings,  I've now gotten 15 or 16 hours out of this phone.  It more than doubled the battery life on the phone.  You can drill down.  So I now know because on the HTC One, this information is hidden.  7.6% screen time.  But I can even see which brightness levels used how much battery life.  Screen was on 14 minutes, 18 seconds.  And 91% of the power was used in light brightness.  There's all these little granular details.  Bluetooth, app usage.  I can drill down to see which apps use how much battery life.  And further drill within it.  So you often get information about an app like Kernel.  Kernel used 23%.  Well, here's the processes that we're running.  If you're a geek, this is a great little app.  It's GSAM battery monitor.  There's a free version.  I paid $1.99 for the Pro.  It also lets you change the battery icon and things like that.  But mostly, I think the stats are useful,  particularly if you're trying to optimize your phone for better battery life.  XDA developers had a very good article about the One,  but I would imagine many phones with battery problems,  they'll have similar articles on things you can do.  If you're just using an Android phone in general,  just read the One about the HTC One because most of the tips apply  to every kind of Android phone.  And it did. It more than doubled it, which is amazing.  Yeah, basically, you take all the fun out of the phone and it works along.  I had to give up a few things, but not a lot.
