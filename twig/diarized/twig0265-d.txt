And of course, as always, this wouldn't be Twig without the great  Gina Trippani of ThinkUp. Always great to have her. Also host of All About Android.  And she got up early with me this morning. Not so early for you, but 9am your time, 6am ours  to do the Samsung event. It's good to see you again. Thank you for doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good to see you again too. Hello again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really nice to have you and Mike Elgin. And we did a special which is available now on our feed.  We'll talk a little bit about what Samsung announced because it is Android focused.  Also here Jeff Jarvis. Couldn't do it without him. Professor of University of City University of New York  of journalism. He is at BuzzMachine.com is where he blogs.  It's great to have you again, Jeff. And we brought in Gina's partner, Anil Dash.  Hello everybody. So nice to have Anil here. If you're not familiar with Anil, you ought to be.  He's been involved in the community for so long. I mean, your tweets often are,  the conversations you have on Twitter are so important, so valuable.  I became aware of Anil when he was an evangelist for Six Apart, right?  Yeah, like a decade ago. Has it been that long? Almost. Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where else have you been? Oh, a bunch of stuff. I was in the music biz for a while,  newspaper biz for a while, and then of course the last several years has been working with Gina  on Think Up and that has been super exciting and fun. Really neat.  So are you the founder and CEO? What is your co-founder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is your co-founder? With Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we started the project as sort of an open source thing we were doing.  We were working on a non-profit and it's just snowballed and grown.  I think Twig folks especially probably know a little bit about Think Up.  It's been really, really fun to kind of watch everybody jump on board.  And I think just the last month I feel like we've done the best  new features and exciting stuff around it. So that's been the most fun I've had on working on this  even for the past couple years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, Anil is well known as a blogger at dashes.com, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and I've been contributing at Medium and used to write for Wired sometimes  so a lot of different places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has the pre-sampling led to growth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I think it's been, it's one of those things  where you sort of cross your fingers and you hope that you're talking to the right people that are going to understand  what you're making when you make a new product.  And I think fortunately you talk to the Twig audience and they're actually curious and interested.  So that's really, it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's the story with this Prince blog post from last month, from July?  This is all, I wanted to ask you, what is going on?  You have a very long blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so I'm a fan of Prince. I think everybody who likes music, right?  But I almost never write about him.  So I think all my friends that are really, like, oh, you're a huge fan and he does something  and they sort of say, oh, you're going to write about it.  And I never, pretty much never do.  And last month, and I'll apologize in advance for all of us that are going to feel the pain of this statement.  Last month was the 30th anniversary of Purple Rain.  Oh my God.  Yeah, yeah. No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  30th anniversary. Wow.  Yes, yes. 30 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so I thought, what would be something fun to do about the anniversary?  And everybody would sort of do it.  It was a big album. It sold a lot of tickets as a movie.  Fairly obvious things.  And what I did instead was, because this is, I'm okay at technology.  I'm pretty good at Prince.  I wrote about...  Your secret power is Prince.  Totally. I wrote about how the song Purple Rain came together  and it was basically, you know, a good five, 10 years of Prince's career had sort of come together in this thing  and had all the members of the band contribute to it and what were the aspects of it.  I actually cut some stuff out that was about how the housing policy and zoning regulations  in Minneapolis at the time influenced the song being created.  But other than that, pretty much everything else is in there that could possibly shape the song.  And it was one of those like, I've been meaning to write this for about 20 years,  so let me get it out there.  And the response has been great.  For music narratives, it's been really nice.  And then for everybody else, they sort of politely distance themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It reminded me of Wendy and Lisa, who I hadn't thought about in 30 years.  Sure.  Wendy will be celebrating her 50th birthday this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're fantastic.  Are they still around? Are they still...  Yeah. So they do a music composition.  They got like a special, I want to say a special Emmy this year for...  Oh, good.  They composed for a bunch of TV series.  So they're great.  They're active on Twitter and Facebook and like really just sort of smart and engaging with fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm glad to see that.  I'll have to find them on Facebook.  Now that I'm a big Facebook fan.  So Robert Scoble came in.  He had been challenging me, saying, you're doing it wrong, Facebook.  He literally said, Facebook is going to be it.  In a year, you'll come back to me and say, oh, you are absolutely right.  There is no other social network.  Nothing else matters.  Nothing else matters.  Facebook is number one.  I said, you're crazy.  I mean, Google Plus is so much better.  He said, that's because you're doing it wrong.  So on Sunday, he came in and we recorded an hour.  And you know what?  We were going to release it as a triangulation later this month.  But there's been so much interest.  I think we've got to move that up.  People really want to see this.  He showed me how to go through Facebook, how to categorize everybody, how to give Facebook.  It turns out if you are assiduous about giving Facebook signals about what you want, Facebook,  he says it's artificial intelligence.  There's a lot of smart software behind Facebook to give you what you want if you just give it enough signals.  And so I did that.  I'm still not sure if I'm getting a great experience, but I'm giving it a try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A very bold Robert Scoble prediction that Facebook will be a popular social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it is kind of bold.  I mean, I keep waiting for Facebook to go away.  He convinced me to put Facebook back on my mobile device and messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  Any place you get a billion people showing up, it's probably not going away anytime soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I guess.  Yeah, there's that network effect.  I don't know.  Anyway, it's still just as goofy as it was to me.  In fact, the saddest thing is that Google Plus is getting more like Facebook, not less.  And that's, I don't like it.  I've decided I'm going to do, and I've registered the domain names.  And I think this is what the world needs is a verified social network.  Google can't do it because of tying the Google services into this real personality,  but anybody else could, where you have to send me a driver's license picture and today's newspaper  and I can demonstrably prove it to you, and this is going to be a verified social network.  Wouldn't that solve all our problems with Twitter, especially?  Jeff, what do you think?  I already registered verified.zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know a lot of a-holes by name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but don't you think that if somebody, if you do know who they are,  that really tempers that conversation a little bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I've been thinking about our talk last week.  The show does that.  And the idea that we're acting as if we're in crowded space  when in fact we're in this wide open space.  And you look at Twitter and say, oh my God, I've got to talk to those people.  Well, it's not actually that many people who actually see the tweets.  And so, okay, you can announce some things there and do things there,  but the world doesn't demand that you're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know that now thanks to Twitter Analytics, how few people see our tweets.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm not sure it's worth all the hubbub and hoo-ha.  I remain troubled by the places that come up with difficult people  and difficult behavior.  And I think that's really what you're trying to answer.  And I don't know whether identity is it.  Maybe it's, Gina had the kernel of it, as is her habit.  Maybe it's more about sharing signals about people who are nice people  and people who aren't acting nice.  I had a case where somebody we all love retweeted a tweet  and said, oh, I'm not going to do this.  And this person retweeted an anti-twit troll  who trolled me into his tuna net.  That's how I noticed.  And this person we love had retweeted it or had responded or something.  And I said, that's a twit troll.  You're feeding him.  And our friend said, oh, okay, great.  Thanks for telling me.  And I killed the reference.  And so I think that in a society, you kind of band together in ways.  So I think you're onto something partially,  which is you want to know who someone is.  But I think there's another thing,  which is to get clever about how we recommend people to each other  and what that matters.  And there's got to be friction.  There's got to be loss, which is what Mike Elgin's point was.  You have to be able to lose some value by acting like an a-hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there were some a-holes out there this week.  This was the week that pictures of a great number of Hollywood celebrities  were leaked.  Apparently, hackers got into their accounts.  We think, the best thinking right now,  Apple said there's no structural flaw with iCloud or Find My iPhone.  These were targeted attacks.  And the best thinking is that there was, in fact,  we know there was a flaw in Find My iPhone  that allowed unlimited brute force style attacks, password attacks.  It wasn't what we call rate-limited.  In other words, most sites, if you enter a password and it's wrong,  it tells you, but it limits the number of times you can do that,  or it slows the process down.  It makes it difficult to do a high-speed brute force attack.  Find My iPhone was not one of those.  That, by the way, flaw was fixed on Monday  after these photos were released.  So the best guess of many, including Jonathan Jadarsky,  is that this brute force attack was used to get the passwords of these celebrities  and that their iPhone or iPad backups, which were stored on iCloud,  were then grabbed and it was there that the photos came from.  That's a little scary because that means other information,  lots of information was also grabbed in those backups.  The photos posted on 4chan, most sites, including Reddit,  responded, and Imgur responded pretty well.  Even Perez Hilton, after initially posting images,  realized what a mistake that was, pulled it down and apologized  and said that in the heat of the moment I posted that,  but that wasn't a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in some ways...  Which is a really important moment, I think.  Yes.  I think we saw the beginnings of norms being agreed upon here.  Now, it's weird to me that we gathered around nude celebrities,  not around beheaded journalists.  Well, a similar thing happened with the beheaded journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was a one-two punch, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a good point. Yes. I'll buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the second time that these beheading videos went up,  they were not nearly as widespread, were they?  That's true. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like...  Maybe we're getting to some level of norms on this,  and that includes the technology services.  If it gets sufficiently egregious,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  reasonable people go,  whoa, wait a minute, let's just hold on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right.  And it would be wrong to even look in both cases.  So it's not just about being wrong to post them,  not being wrong just to spread them.  It's also wrong just to look, I think.  Yeah, so there's an interesting thing here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  where people make jokes about nudes leaking, right?  And there's this sort of fake distance.  One, pretending as if every attractive 20-something-year-old  doesn't have nude pictures somewhere.  And two, as if this was...  Even some of us older, uglier fellas do.  Right, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, TMI. TMI, Leo.  Forbidden visual.  No, stop it. You can't handle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. You can't handle the nudes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jokes aside, to an approximation, everybody has something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is normal behavior, and there's nothing wrong with it.  There's nothing wrong with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's totally normal.  And then, so there's at least a pushback against the sort of  joking or I have a right to see it or whatever,  and that's really good.  And then the second step, the deeper conversation,  especially in our context where we're talking about tech,  is what were the defaults?  What were the choices the platform made?  And you look at, in the case of Apple,  assuming that Apple is obviously a big player  for most of these images,  what Apple does with your thumbprint  is this really deeply secure,  designed to never let it off your device,  really smart decision  about what the default thing it does  when it can scan your thumbprint.  It's treated like important private data.  And the contrast to the default  for iCloud being accessible,  two-factor auth not being encouraged,  the rate-limiting bug that you described,  a whole series of choices,  five, six, seven, ten of them,  that all could have gone the other way  that would have had an impact here.  And they haven't felt the pain of that.  And I think it's interesting because this is happening  right before their big announcements next week,  one of which we know from the developer conference  is going to be about,  please upload all your photos into the photo roll  on iCloud by default with iOS 8.  And that's going to be a real challenge for them  because their whole value is simplicity,  ease of use, user experience,  and cool factor,  and all of that is being threatened  by them having made, frankly, the wrong choices  about their defaults and security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And defaults is another way, Neil,  I agree, and to say policies.  And so Twitter had a policy previously  of trying their best not to delete accounts.  And when it came to both the beheading  and the slab photos,  they started deleting accounts.  And I'm OK with that,  but now that forces Twitter to say,  well, what is your policy?  Where are your lines?  What are your limits?  And you're forced to have policies now,  which platforms are much like it.  Emily Bell wrote in The Guardian  that pathology companies aren't accountable.  And I disagree with that strongly.  I think that they're highly accountable,  but they've got to recognize

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that they have to document that accountability.  I think Apple's going to suffer a big blow from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole cloud is going to suffer  because of the stupidity of the press  making this a cloud issue.  It wasn't a cloud issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you put something on the Internet,  there is a risk,  and I've said this for a long time,  that it could go public by accident or by flaw.  So you should be kind of aware of that.  Apple's default was to upload those.  I suspect that the people whose pictures were revealed  did not even know that they were being uploaded to the cloud.  Anybody who has pictures like that  probably exerts a little bit of caution  about how they get distributed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you could do everything right.  You could follow the defaults,  listen to Apple saying,  it's secure if you do this.  You could even do what Apple said  and enable two-factor authentication,  which I think maybe the four of us have.  Their two-factor sucks, I might add.  It's terrible, right?  But you could do all those things right  and still be vulnerable  because of the choices Apple made,  and they could have been different.  Obviously, if something's online, connected,  ultimately somebody can crack it.  But we're talking about reasonable defaults,  reasonable security,  being less vulnerable to brute force attack,  and Apple's made bad choices here  and should be held accountable for it.  There's nothing wrong with us,  especially if you have this kind of platform,  put some pressure on them to say,  okay, now there's hundreds of millions of people  that all have at least something incriminating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about the notion that maybe Apple  should modify its camera program?  Should every company modify the camera program  so there's a switch, just as there is in your browser,  that this is now going to be private browsing,  this is going to be private photos?  Please make sure that these are stored more securely.  That's a good idea.  That would help.  There's a ton of ways to make a good experience.  Look, the real solution,  and Google's done it quite a bit towards this in Gmail,  is end-to-end encryption.  Trust no one encryption.  There's nothing wrong with putting stuff on the cloud  if only I can decrypt it.  And Apple needs to give us that tool specifically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, theoretically,  if you can make the experience good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and this is the problem.  Apple has a huge investment in this notion  of it just works, this thing about magic.  And this is one of the reasons there's two factors so poor.  And why they still use security questions,  which by the way they implicated in this hack, is...  But the thumbprint's secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thumbprint works well.  And it just works.  And it never leaves your device.  Remember, Apple has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're pretty sure,  because there's been numerous stories about this,  Apple on Tuesday will announce  that they have deals with MasterCard, Visa,  and American Express, Nordstrom, and others,  to do payments using those services on your iPhone,  presumably using Touch ID and Passbook.  Are people going to think twice now about using this?  This is a huge blow to Apple.  This couldn't have been timed more poorly  from their point of view.  Yeah, hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just Apple.  I think it's going to hurt Google as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as we talked about on Windows Weekly,  Google and Microsoft should step forward and say,  unlike Apple, if you turn on our second factor,  you cannot, without this second factor ID,  you cannot get any of your data from our cloud.  You can with Apple.  That's part of the problem,  is that you don't need two factor to get the iCloud back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How can second factor...  Gina, you talked about this a little bit.  How can second factor be made easier  so that people will just...  For the default, people would not complain  and they'd adopt it and we'd be in...  What does it need?  Yeah, that's a really good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I had the answer,  I might not be sitting here right now.  I'd have a really high-paying job at one of these companies.  Well, you lose it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've talked about this on security now.  When you do end-to-end trust, know-when encryption,  you lose some of the capabilities people want,  the ability to go look at your data  on multiple devices, for instance.  The ability to dedupe and stuff like that.  Those things go away.  They'll say goodbye for shifting from an iPhone  to an Android or vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  No cloud's going to let you do that  if it's all encrypted until...  We'll get to it next quarter or next year.  Something like LastPass is multi-platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and does end-to-end encryption, right?  Yes.  I can decrypt locally on wherever I have LastPass installed,  which is across multiple devices.  That's true.  It's a lot of data.  It's possible.  That's a good point.  It is possible.  LastPass is great software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We use it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very reliable.  It's also probably the most challenging user experience  of any app I use regularly.  Really?  Just because there's always something  that feels like a pain.  Security is a challenge.  That's not LastPass.  That's called security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly why Apple has been so reluctant,  I think, to do the completely secure thing.  They want it to just be a little bit more secure.  They want it to just work,  and that's a trade-off between convenience and security.  That's part of the problem.  The two factors are something you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and something you have.  Or something you are.  There's three possible factors.  Right.  And then the biometric is something you are.  Those things, clearly, there's a lot of room  to innovate around.  There must be better ways  than typing in that code before the timer runs out  on your app.  There are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve's doing Squirrel,  which is a very interesting form of authentication  for websites, Steve Gibson.  I think there are other ways to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's more interesting  than can we make the screen more curved  and add one more inch of diagonal resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you think these companies are doing  what people are asking them for  and what they think will sell?  A curved screen is something that everybody grasps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think after this week, people will be asking  for how do I know they're buying.  Or who is the safest?  Yeah, I think it's a real question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about it on MacBreak Weekly.  It's my opinion that Apple has to grasp the nettle  and step forward on Tuesday and say,  yes, we have always believed in protecting you online  and we now know we need to do even better.  What are the odds you're going to say that?  Yeah, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not Tuesday, but they could say it.  I think they have to grasp the nettle.  I think it's not a pleasant thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if they don't address it, there's going to be...  Everybody knows this happened.  And not everybody is clear on why it happened.  I'm not even clear on why it happened  or whether Apple is at fault.  Apple needs to address this very aggressively.  Steve Jobs never would.  Okay, bets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bets around the table.  Bets that they're going to address  in a blunt and direct way, I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Their press releases tend to have less BS than most.  They're a little more direct.  There's no way they're going to do it on stage at Tuesday.  That's all about selling their new phone.  No chance.  I think what they do is they let it cool a while.  This is what they did with AntennaGate  and all the other things.  They let it cool a while.  That was a mistake with AntennaGate

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that allowed it to blow up.  Yeah, it was.  Well, for better or worse, this is their pattern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe they changed their pattern,  but at least what they do historically,  they let it cool a while.  They'll come back maybe that Friday after  in the lull between when they announce  and when they ship a new device  and say, we hear you loud and clear, security matters.  Here's what we're doing, steps one, two, and three.  And by the time the new phone ships,  we'll have this in place.  Maybe they can do that.  I think the biggest challenge they have  is internally they're going to say  it's not a big deal if people's passwords got guessed.  That can happen to anyone if your password gets hacked  or guessed by somebody.  And that resistance is what they have to fight internally.  That sort of deny, deny, deny, hope it goes away,  which every big company does.  I predict that there will be at least an update  on the security and security of the new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I predict that there will be at least  an oblique acknowledgement of this.  And it wouldn't hurt Apple to say,  we're going to do better, we're committed to doing better,  we are going to protect your data.  That's their selling point at this point over Google.  They have to.  Is that we are the one place  you can put your stuff that's private.  And if they can't address that,  if they don't address that, that's a huge advantage.  Look at Apple, stock price today lost $4.36,  almost a 5% drop.  Go back to Google, go back to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What could Google do?  Why are you saying that they can't possibly do?  This is an opportunity for Google to strike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To say, we know better, we're geeks.  And we, I mean, this is, again,  nobody says this in an outright fashion,  but you make it clear, you know,  we're the computer scientists, we understand security  much better than Apple does  and we offer you a secure solution.  Do we believe that?  Well, I don't, it's not whether you and I believe it.  I don't know if I believe that,  but I certainly do believe it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as a marketing opportunity, as Leo said.  I mean, I also like, you know,  I'm not to be a cynic, I think I'm getting a little sick,  so I think maybe I'm just a little down.  But, you know, all this has happened before,  all of this will happen again.  I mean, saying that Perez Hilton, you know,  after thinking about it a little bit,  had a revelation and took the photos down,  like, this isn't the first celebrity,  like, nude leak or sex tape that's ever happened  and it won't be the last.  Like, is Perez really, or Gawker, or any sites  really gonna, in the moment of heat,  to get page views, gonna not do that again in the future?  Like, I have a hard time believing that.  You know, Matt Honan, two years ago, got hacked.  What was Apple's response then?  I mean, he, you know, it wasn't news photos,  but his, they fixed it, right?  They addressed it, right?  And it was a combination of Amazon and Apple  and Apple did suspend password resets  over the phone immediately after, whatever.  And I feel like these things have always happened.  They will continue to happen.  The systems will iterate.  The companies will make statements.  But ultimately, you know, like,  the whole thing is kind of flawed  and we all just decide to live with it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because the other option is...  You know why it's gonna be better,  it's gonna get better, Gina,  because I think the people are saying,  you know what, this is wrong.  And I feel a distinct,  but remember in these previous releases,  there wasn't this kind of disgust with it  that there is today.  And I really feel a distinct shift on this.  It's like, this was too much,  this is out of control,  this is wrong.  Yeah, if we go back to, you know...  And companies are gonna respond  to what their customers tell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's ancient history, but if you go back to,  you know, the Paris Hilton sex tape or something,  which is a decade ago now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was generally greeted with  salacious excitement and exuberance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it was also sort of people just joking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody said, poor Paris,  that is sexual assault, that's a crime,  and that's what people are saying today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She was a very young woman  and all these other things,  and I think there's been a change there.  There's obviously still tons of pigs  that are reveling in this  and not dismissing that,  but saying that there's some shift there.  And then at the tech level,  I think after Matt Honan was hacked,  is when Apple introduced its sort of weak  off around iTunes,  they did sort of put out a statement,  which at that point was still very rare.  They weren't just weighing in on things back then,  but they actually responded.  Amazon made some changes.  None of these are solutions,  but in terms of moving the ball forward,  it had an impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's not gonna be a fix.  But, I mean, Gina, I don't remember people saying  is it right or wrong to look at these.  I don't remember anybody saying that  with Paris Hilton.  I mean, I think that's the thought.  You shouldn't even,  you're committing,  you're part of the conspiracy,  you're part of the crime to look at these.  That's a very big shift, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is, and I wonder,  I mean, whatever,  I think that it's like culturally,  it's more acceptable to slut-shame Paris Hilton  than it is Jennifer Lawrence  for whatever reasons in public culture.  I think that people love Jennifer Lawrence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, people laughed and made fun of him.  He had agency, but then the less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He shared his photo. It's totally different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, with another person, not publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I often think it has to do  with a lot of things.  The people involved. I think Matt was a very  sympathetic character in his situation.  I think Jennifer Lawrence is very sympathetic.  I think that, you know, whatever,  Kim Kardashian, Paris Hilton,  they're just like, oh, these dummies  who are famous for nothing, they deserved it.  And I think that that definitely plays into it.  I do, look, the optimist  in me does want to believe  that this conversation evolves every iteration  of it, right? But this will continue to happen.  And I like to think that I surround myself  with folks who, you know, will  speak up about not saying,  you know, about avoiding  victim blaming, which is what goes on  a lot. It still goes on. Maybe it's  going on less. I hope so.  But yeah, I mean, the whole  thing's a bummer.  But I think it will continue to happen.  I think, you know, are people really going to demand?  There's a data breach every  few months. It feels like a major data breach  at all different companies.  And I just don't know.  I've just sort of accepted that that's  part of this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but, Regina, part of what we have to do is change the rest  of the architecture where, I mean,  putting nude pictures aside,  talking about just matters of  transactional security.  Oh my God, they have my credit card number  and blank and they can now rob me.  And what's wrong in that picture is that  if all you need is a number,  you know, you can get, years ago, you can still get them off  carbon copies of credit card slips.  That's what we have to change.  So we have to look at a lot of  the ways in which a leak  causes harm or causes  a vulnerability and come up with solutions  from the other side of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm on the board of the  Data and Society Research Institute, which is  Dana Boyd's Institute for  looking at big data and all the implications  of the big data that we have in our society.  And she'd hosted an event,  the White House was doing a report on big data,  one of the questions was basically about  Social Security numbers,  when they get leaked, and basically you had a room  of, you know, a hundred  experts on big data and then  me sort of crashing the party,  and they're asking, what  are the odds that 10 million  Social Security numbers get leaked,  let's say in the next decade?  And, you know, show of hands, how many people  goes up? They say, well, what are the odds,  you know, how many people think 100 million  Social Security numbers might get leaked?  And most of the hands are still up.  And then of course credit cards,  I don't think there's anybody, certainly in the  United States, there's nobody that hasn't  gotten that letter saying your credit card number  was probably leaked and  you can free enroll in credit protection  from us and we'll pay for it, whether  it was Target or, you know, all these  other hacks. So  the universe of like  what if, can I be secure?  It doesn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so engineers, right, Neil, engineers  presume a system is going to be gamed.  This is the way now the data is going to be gamed.  Full stop.  So what we have to change is, again, it doesn't address  nude photos and theft in that sense.  That kind of violation.  But in terms of the data breaches that you mentioned,  Nina, I think we're looking at it the wrong way.  How do we, it's, it's, it's, it's  how do we stop the data from being breached?  That horse is running over the horizon  and it's halfway Australia by now.  Instead we've got to presume  the data will be breached.  So then where are we vulnerable then  and stop that?  And that's where it goes back to things like how to do  transactions. Does the fingerprint thing  do it or other things? I don't know.  I wish I could write about this with any authority.  It's the Steve Gipsons of the world who are going to  tell us better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I now remember why we had Neil  on because of his great post on Medium  about public. And  when you mentioned Dana Boyd, that reminded me  that you had had a back and forth with Dana over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure. And I loved the conversation  by the way that you all had about that.  I appreciated that. Oh good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought, really interesting. We'll talk a little bit about that.  We also have a Google changelog coming up.  I'm sorry to hear you're not feeling  well, Gina. Do you feel up to the  Google changelog? I always.  We have worked you hard. You've been on, this is your third  show in 24 hours. It's not fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. It's been a marathon.  I don't know how you do it, Leo. It's really terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one should have to do three shows. Oh, never mind.  Don't say it. Don't say it, boss.  No one should ever. Never mind.  But anyway, hang on  and hang in there. We're going to  wrap this thing up as quickly as we can.  So you get to go home and I get to go home.  Our show today brought to you  by Squarespace. Love  the Squarespace.  You know, it's funny because  Neil, you know, I got to know Neil  through the blogging platform  and through his entire  entities on that website.  We finally got an online  website.  And I have learned now  after doing this for a few years  that keeping up with the web is a  non-trivial thing. The styles  change, the technologies change.  The good news is with Squarespace  you don't have to. They've got the  best engineers working day and  night to create modern sites.  Their current templates are  mobile responsive. That means they  look good on any size screen.  They are e-commerce enabled.  Even the $8 a month site, you can sell  something or take donations.  I'm a big fan.  They realize that the mobile  experience is so important  not only for your viewers but for you.  That's why they have some incredible  mobile apps like the new Metric app  for iPhone and iPad which allows you to  check site stats like page views, unique  visitors, social media follows,  their blogging app makes it easy to post  and even monitor comments.  They have a logo creator on their  website. I love this new one. This is the  Portfolio app. If you're a photographer  this app pulls your images  from your website to create  a beautiful online portfolio.  The kind of thing you would show your  clients for instance on your iPad  or your iPhone so you can go up to a bride  with the iPad and have a beautiful  presentation and not have done  anything. It just comes from your website.  All of this starts at $8 a month  and that includes the domain name free  when you sign up for a year.  But you can try it.  It's even better.

Anil Dash joins us from ThinkUp  Gina's partner  at thinkup.com. Jeff Jarvis is also  here.  We do a thing every week Anil. I think you  might know about it. It's called the Google  Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chad just got back from vacation.  He's still a little...  still ending the  sponsor raid there.  Now Gina  Tribani with the latest from the Google.  That's Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry Chad.  Chrome's 64-bit  build for Windows  just got promoted from the Canary and Dev channels  up to the Stable channel which means  that if you're running 64-bit Windows  you can get 64-bit Chrome  and that means that it's just faster  and more secure and more stable and can  take advantage of all that extra  memory space to address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Chrome 64-bit on all  the other platforms? I know I'm in the beta  channel on the Mac. I'm 64-bit.  I think this was the last platform  maybe to go 64. I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that it is.  Yes indeed.  Google rebrands Google Enterprise  with a friendlier name,  Google for Work.  That's just this week. The new name is supposed to be friendlier  and more inclusive of small businesses  and organizations and even loan entrepreneurs  and hackers using Google services  like search and Android and cloud  platform. Nothing about Google Enterprise  products actually changes. It's just the  name. So it's now Google for Work.  Which, you know, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how friendly that is.  I mean nothing to you guys  but let me think about Leo. I'm reminded  of Maynard G. Krebs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do you always  do the old crap with me?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell us, let's gather around  the campfire and hear about Krebs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who is that? Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do a search.  Chad, please do a search for  Maynard G. Krebs. It's like Dobie Gillis reference,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right? Right. If you want to search for Krebs, you have  to look on Alta Vista because it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pretty stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maynard G. Krebs  was the character played by  the character  the beatnik character on Dobie Gillis played by  of course, Gilligan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you just  play golf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like I'm home.  Yeah, it's alright mom.  I have to go upstairs anyhow and start my homework.  Maynard, I meant the kind of thing we do  at school, not the other kind.  What kind of what? Work. Work. Work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go. Work. Work.  I was waiting for that punchline

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there. It was like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the problem is, Jeff, that  people don't know what enterprise means.  For the longest time, I didn't know what it meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true. That's right.  You know what, Leo, worse than that, I sat in business  meetings where people talk about enterprise.  It's one of those words like fungible.  I was embarrassed to ask.  And I just waited until a definition  would walk my way. See, we got a B2E

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  solution here. We find that the B2C solution  has been migrated upward to the B2E  solution. And we now feel the enterprise  is the future for this company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I go, ah. Enterprise is easy.  You just add three zeros to the price.  That's all it means. It's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, enterprise means that you gave  up your dreams of serving consumers.  And so now you're going to try to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  block your company. That's a little too close  to home.  It is.  When I met Leo, I was selling a product  that had just become an enterprise product.  Yikes. I've been there too, friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, aside from Bob Denver's  least interesting role, there's  an interesting thing here with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He had more than two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  I can't imagine that...I think Gilligan is clearly  the superior. I'm not going to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I think Maynard G. Krebs is kind of  seminal role.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wasn't alive then, so I'm guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bob, by the way,  Bob Denver looks more and more like Bill Gates  as he ages. I don't know  what exactly is going on here, but this  is the place. Doesn't that look like Bill Gates now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a tech hook for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For everything, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think that going from enterprise to  at work is really a reflection  of Google Apps succeeding in  government, succeeding in education,  right? And all these things are all, we're not  business. Because why else would you have this meeting  and say, look, we're going to rebrand.  The most important thing we can do is change the name  from enterprise to work.  And it's, well, where are the dollars?  They want to put Chromebooks into schools, and they want to put  Google Apps and Google Docs into  government, and those  are the only places that are going to object to calling  work enterprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I was trying  to get to a long-winded joke there,  but I agree. I think it makes sense.  And I think it says that this is ready for  prime time. It's ready for your office.  I have this, we're trying to convince my  institution to switch over to Google Docs.  And I'd be a lot happier if they  did. I'm not sure the word change is  going to do it, but maybe if they believe there's a suite  of seats there, suite of  services there that makes  sense, all right.  By the way, a little known fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is Google Apps for Education.  Yeah, I think that's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they went work in education.  I think they wanted parallelism.  There is what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the URL is still  google.com slash enterprise, so I think that  kind of tells you most of what you need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Move on, on the  change. Well, one last  Dobie Gillis fact. Bob Denver  received, according to IMDB, $250  an episode for his work as  Mayer G. Krebs.  Work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Work?  Work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, moving on.  Google Play's beautiful  design collection of apps for Android  just got updated. The beautiful design  collection features apps handpicked by Google  to show off great Android  UI design. Today's update includes  apps starting to implement UI elements  from Google's new material design. That's coming  in Android L this fall, of course.  New apps in the collection include  Airbnb, Duolingo,  Lumosity, Spotify, RunTastic,  and Yahoo News  Digest. So starting to get a peak  material design ahead of time  from these apps.  And finally, this is a new  one on me. Apparently it's been a while, but  they're testing some tweaks to it. Google's  been testing a new search box  inside their search results for  certain sites like Amazon,  the White House, or Stanford.  So to see an action, and I got this for  some of my trials and not all, so this might be an  experiment that won't work for everyone.  But if you search for Microsoft, say,  you'll see  the top result for Microsoft will be Microsoft.com  and below that there will be a search  box to search inside Microsoft.  So a site search box in their search results.  Works for Stanford, works for White  House, they all do Google site search.  But if you search for Amazon  and you get the search box, it will actually take you to Amazon  search results. So clearly  kind of one of these, one of Google's  experiments with making the search results  more useful.  And interesting to see them pointing to someone  else's, particularly Amazon's, search  results as well.  So not everybody has it, but kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It augurs against antitrust complaints  if they do that. Ah, very clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yep, yep.  And actually we should, outside of the change log,  we should discuss the how to eat sushi  Google search results as well.  But we'll do that later. For now,  that's all I've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't want to leave that on you, huh, Gina?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Am I going to get nude pictures or something?  And that's the Google change log.  Apparently  this advice from Google, no longer  there, by the way, on how  to eat sushi.  This is from,  should I even mention this?  Yeah, I think I can.  This is from Google  Answers. And so it showed  up in a knowledge box, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the knowledge graph, right? Which basically  just parses data from other websites  and presents it inside a search results.  So you would Google  how to eat sushi and you get a few  whatever, instructions back  from a housing site. It's okay to use your fingers to eat cut

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sushi rolls. Don't combine ginger  and sushi or ginger and soy sauce.  Ginger, the pickled ginger, is a  palate cleanser. When dipping  sushi in soy sauce, dip fish side  down. Didn't know that. Very useful.  And never shake the soy sauce off  sushi. That's like shaking your wanker  in public. What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's, you know,  thank you Google. It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a big deal. Obviously, it's text  scraped from another site. But  people made a big deal about it because  it was kind of like what we're talking about with native advertising.  It may be, it may, maybe  is not clear that this is text from another site.  Right? So people are saying, Google's  saying this thing about how to eat sushi. When Google's  not saying it at all, but it's the presentation  that creates some of the confusion. And to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  their credit, it was a Googler who outed  Google. Steven Lau,  a software engineer with Google Glass, tweeted  PSA, public service announcement.  Google, how to eat sushi, do it  now before it gets fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is  sort of live by the sword, die by the sword  in terms of the knowledge box or one box.  Right? Because this is, this was from a Vice article  and Vice of all publications  should be pretty obvious. It's going to have some stuff  that maybe you don't want to show on a Google page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Despite its name, I thought Vice  was actually pretty credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do great journalism and then they also do  a bunch of this.  Right? Okay. So it's both,  well, like everything. There's no, every media outlet  is very, very highbrow and very, very lowbrow  today. Right? It is true, isn't it?  Yeah. And they're used to, I don't think it even  happens anymore, but there used to be these objections  about bringing content in on one box as  a knowledge box is because  you're competing with publishers in some  way and they don't have any  real  choice but to accommodate  that because it's also the thing that's going  to drive more traffic.  And so when you bring in, you know, with Wikipedia,  I'm sure there  are tons of Wikipedia articles that have been defaced  at the top, you know, automatically  scraped into a knowledge box on Google and you can  get some ridiculous results  if you take a look.  That should be one  of the reasons that Google should even be more cautious  about bringing this content in. I mean, I think  I'm old fashioned, but I remember a time  when Google would give you results that took you to another  site. And as much as  it sort of has been conventional wisdom  that, oh, it's convenient, it's easy, and it's faster  to get it here, I still like that  idea that they used to be about taking you to  the content as opposed to bringing the content

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  into their site. Well, you do sound like an old timer  when you say Google gave you results that brought you  to another site. Those days.  Wasn't that the purpose  of Google? I think it took you all

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to listen. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina and I got up a little bit  early this morning, a little earlier for me  than you, 6 a.m. for me, 9 a.m.  for you to go to Berlin  virtually for the  Samsung Unpacked event. They called  it, what, Chapter 2?  Because it was the second, Part 2?  The second Unpacked event. Second unpacking  of the year. Of the year.  They did the Galaxy S5 earlier  this year. This announcement  was the Note 4, Galaxy Note 4,  a 5.7-inch phablet  that features an improved camera  both front and back. They made  a big deal about selfies. I think selfies are  increasingly going  to be something important, the front-facing camera.  And not for Skype or FaceTime,  but for pictures. They even showed  what do they call it?  AUSI?  A WIFI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the WIFI.  So you could pano. It was like basically  a selfie pano, right?  I really liked the shutter actually. There was a hardware  shutter on the back of the phone. That I actually was like  yes, I want that. We've seen that on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  other phones, of course. Yeah, but no, that's a good idea.  I mean, this is Samsung. They just throw everything  against the wall and see what sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How wide does your head have to be for a panoramic  selfie?  I don't... It was to get the people...  Big head. I have a big, fat head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To get the background more. And that's what you're seeing in  these selfies now.  And that's why the selfies stick. Because you don't  want just you. You want...  You want you in context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That live demo was great. They got the three  announcements, plus the entire  audience behind them. And of course they did the  callback to Ellen's selfie at the  Oscars, the WIFI with all the celebrities  in it or whatever, which made a lot  of sense. And which they paid for.  Which they paid for, I'm sure, handsomely.  No doubt.  And of course they had the iPhone using...  Go ahead, Jeff. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to get choked.  But, I mean, Obama needs it to get the ears in  the selfie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I do mean I have a giant  pumpkin head. And I actually...  I'm fine with people having the selfie stick.  I was down by the World Trade Center  and these tourists had a selfie stick  out. And it was sort of... I mean, at first you're like  that's strange. And then after a while it's like that's not  actually that different than having a tripod  or something that people have been doing.  So I'm fine with that. But I'm  a little... Like some of the things...  Well, this is very Samsung.  They just are trying whatever and seeing what sticks.  And I'm like, be about something.  Have a point of view. Say this is what we're trying to do.  I wish they were more directed and said, okay,  this is the selfie feature we want to enable  and this is the reason why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to see if they posted  on their Samsung account  the picture. They have... This is the image  from the event of the wide  selfie. But I was going to try  to find the picture that they took.  They should have tweeted it.  Because it really did... It looked good. It was really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pretty impressive. And it was a portrait  pano. I was deeply troubled that these photos  were taken in portrait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you're going to do a pano  and you do it in portrait, you get more pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. You get more height. I get that.  I get that. Still, it troubled me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a shot from  the video of it.  It looks like, although it's hard to tell, it came out pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Forever, I will credit Bradley  Cooper for landscaping that business  on the Oscars. Ellen was going to portrait it.  He knew what he was doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nowadays, that counts as a cinematographer.  Oh, that's probably why. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These people stand in front of cameras for a living.  They kind of know a little bit about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope so.  They also showed the  Note 4 Edge,  which is a little tiny bit smaller  than a Note 4 because it  then has a kind of like 150, 160  pixel curved screen  on the side. They say that's a separate screen,  by the way, now I'm reading.  That shows you

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It shows you what? It's like a ticker.  But it goes up the side of your phone  diagonally.  And it's got its own SDK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It shows you that one engineer was able to get  a little sliver of curved screen working and they  wanted to ship it no matter what, even if  it had no point. Well, in fact,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when they showed it,  I don't know if I can. Yeah,  here's the publicity shot.  In the publicity shot, if you look closely,  you'll notice  that the  look at the temperature on the right there. It's upside  down. Perfect.  So then this is in their  this is in their shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At least maybe the photo's  not faked then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have a little bit of something to work on  there. It also means it  would be very hard to hold that phone  because the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mashable. You're going to hit buttons when you don't mean to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mashable has video with a  hands on once I get past the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll make another old person reference, which is  do you remember side talking? Have we  Side talking? So side talk  is probably 2003.  Nokia released the first  N-Gage and they had some other business phones like  this where instead of you  talking into your  your phone like a normal person would you talked into the  side of it. See it's upside down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it  reorients itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And everybody made fun of it on the internet for like  a good couple weeks about why would you ever talk  to the side of your phone?  Side touching.  Side touching.  Sides are for buttons.  Sides aren't for buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are buttons. They're just virtual buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With this phone I pulled out of my pocket  and it's like it's a gigantic  USB because I'm constantly turning it around  saying is it upside right? Right side? Right side?  This way you'll know.  This way you'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm on a reserve  judgment. On the face of it looks like  it's not going to be great but  and then they announced  also a watch that is clearly  way too  big.  This is, we were just counting  off the air. I think there are six  or seven watches  from Samsung. They actually showed three  today. Including  a watch that looks like it's an iPhone  strapped to your wrist.  They didn't, by the way, none of the prices of availability  was  revealed for any of this.  And they showed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  three watches today? I thought it was just the  curved six icon grid  watch today and the VR

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and the edge. Well they had a band  remember that had an e-paper.  They didn't call it a watch. That was Sony.  Was that Sony?  You're right. Sony had  you're right. I'm confusing the two.  Sony had their first  Android Wear watch. There it is. Right.  And the band. And it was this big Galaxy  watch that they showed. You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Samsung might only be offering five watches

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not six. I might have miscounted.  The Gear S  Smartwatch is the size  of an iPhone on your wrist.  And  has a band to match which is interesting.  By the way Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're unfashionable now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  officially. I'm so out of it with my  old Android Wear watch.  And your white band. And my white band.  Oh no. I tried to change the band  and it didn't work so I'm just going to stick with the white band.  Well I realized I'm going to have a new watch any minute  now anyway. Why bother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Either the Gwatcher or the 360 is  going to show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also announced  a virtual reality helmet  that they've worked on in conjunction with  Oculus Rift. John Carmack joined the  stage to talk a little bit about  the technology. And they modified the Android  kernel to make this thing fast. You slide  a Note 4 and it will only work with  a Note 4 in this headset. And you've  got Oculus Rift style  virtual reality. This is just  of course like the Google cardboard  version that was given away  at Google I.O. A little spiffier  and I'm sure a lot more expensive.  And equally nauseating

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  probably. Who is the  Fablet headset user?  Who's that person?  Who is that?  I've never met the Fablet  headset target audience.  Scobel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scobel. They made one  use case which actually I thought  wasn't bad which is in an airplane.  They said it's  like having 127 being  two feet away from 127 inch  screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So watching the movie on the airplane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not something I want.  That's like Clockwork Orange. That's a threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how you program people's brains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can keep your eyes open and the students could drop  a little Vision in once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The chair in front of you will slam  back and hit your head.  It's so far extended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well anyway. And that looked like  it was a prototype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that was not a state.  He'll put anything on his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And has.  And this does require the  Note 4. This won't work with just any phone.  You can see it's carefully  made to fit the Note 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really it's crazy  how well Google preempted this whole thing  with cardboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They knew it was coming.  It's also a brilliant thing Google did  where they literally took  the second most costly  acquisition Facebook has ever made  and said we can do this  for one dollar's worth of cardboard.  Like in terms of just  you know  getting in the punch bowl.  It was such a beautifully  tastefully done completely mean spirited  thing. I loved that. That was great.  We can do that. Oh yeah we can do that.  Just ruined their birthday party.  It was so good. Right after the Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  event at IFA. By the way all of those  devices will be  available someday.  They announced that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No one is going to be in October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah the phone the Note 4 will be out  in October and available in all four actually five  U.S. carriers including U.S. Cellular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that strap a strap a note to your  head thing is ever going to be available.  Well I think they'll say it got released  but there will be no actual human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe Google Glass. How many people  bought Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A few schmucks like me.  Asked me when I  last turned it on. Right. I spent

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a considerable amount of money  on the Kickstarter project for the Oculus  Rift and I just yesterday  gave over Sunday gave away my Oculus  Rift dev kit to  a young lad on the  street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are protective safety goggles that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  look nicer. I know it's silly.  They made a point about how good it looks actually.  Right after was the Sony  event and the Sony folks  announced a new Z3  phones with very high resolution screens.  Very high quality 20 megapixel  cameras.  And then of course this is just  the beginning. Tomorrow is the Motorola  event not in Berlin  but unaccountably in Chicago  where no one is  right now.  Actually the entire city is empty.  And they're  going to announce the Moto 360 flat  tire watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Flat tire watch. The 270.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And then yes.  And then the Moto X  and the G2.  Both of which I think the G  has turned out to be kind of a successful  surprise success.  I love the Moto X and I'm looking forward to the  next generation. I think  it was Android Central that said it will be called the Moto  X. Just the new Moto X  and the G will be called the G2.  And still be very affordable.  Well your guess is as  good as mine. This fall.  I guess.  These companies have been a little bit cagey about release  dates. Which inclines  me to think they're rushing to get these announcements  out before Apple makes its announcement next

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  week. For sure. And you know what  model was that Motorola that I loaned you?  I don't remember what that thing was. It was the Moto X.  Yeah. That was a great phone. That's a great phone.  I just liked it but I don't remember what model it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the best phones of the year even though it was  kind of a little bit below par on  specs. I just loved its functionality.  If this Moto X brings it  up to flagship standards  and retains some of that always on  functionality I think it's just going to be a great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  phone. Despite the red hat  it wasn't a terrible phone. It was a pretty good phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I liked the red hat.  Oh man. You could do that on your cardboard.  Did you know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The red hat thing? Yeah. The flying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hat? Yeah. Well it makes sense right? Because that's what it was.  Yeah. You know  Anil got like the special edition  that came with like a  special box with like a forest that  you'd unfold it or whatever and it came with a little plastic  red hat that had a magnet on it.  You could touch to the screen to invoke  the software. Oh cool.  It was like absurd beyond  I couldn't believe it.  It was literally the prettiest

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  packaging I've ever seen certainly of any electronics  device. How do I get on that list?  I don't know. I think it was like it must have been  an error. They must have mistaken it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If anyone on earth should have that it's  Chad. Because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  he's got red hair he should have a red hat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  along with it. Yeah I got on the wrong  list somehow where they mistook  me for somebody that was literate in these things.  Perhaps you mistook me for someone who cares.  No no. I mean it's a great  phone. It's an amazing phone.  And I actually I liked the red hat experience. I thought  it was very cinematic and engaging.  There's two of them. So there's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  red hat and then there's a squirrel in his nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You're right.  The mouse and the squirrel yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I got an email about  you can go check that out. I didn't do that.  The phone itself  is great. It's a great piece of hardware. So I think any  improvement to that will be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tomorrow there will be I am  told a Dyson vacuum cleaner announcement  as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well there you go. Secret product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm headed to  IFA on Sunday night. Are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh good for you. It's over isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are there good IFA parties? No there's some extended  you know IFA plus thing  that I'm speaking of. Oh good.  So hello Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then  somebody in the chat room apparently  talking about our mocking of the  virtual reality helmet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  says you guys don't even  know what it's for. You're not funny.  So apparently one guy  wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last week this was the problem  last week with Twitch.  It was plain Twitch to me. Oh the  abuse  we got.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I will

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I will gladly fall on the sort of unfunny  about wearing a  phablet on your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where do you stand on Twitch.TV  the gaming network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it is every bit as interesting as  watching sports. Okay there you go.  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so you two like me  are not a real man. Is that it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anil? I  I meant exactly what I said. You can tell  from my tweets I tweet a lot during award  shows. Yeah  the Golden Globes maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody watched the Emmys though apparently.  No real  award shows. Real award shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Show the count. Grammys Oscars that kind of stuff.  So it's the crazy season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lots of products coming out.  Next week Apple's announcement.  Will we then be done? I don't know.  It's kind of hard to imagine.  When do we get into watches you think? No idea.  I think none of this is  apparently they don't even have FCC approval  for the Note 4. So we're a  few months off maybe even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The iWatch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're asking about the iWatch? Is the iWatch  going to happen? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it will happen and Apple wants to freeze the market.  So they want to say don't buy before Christmas.  We're not going to be ready until next year.  We're going to show you something really cool but you got to wait.  It's a perfect way to do it because it gives developers  time to get ready. It ruins  Christmas for everybody else.  And still we'll sell a bunch of iPhones  while people get ready for  save up to be able to buy a watch in the new year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a question in the email.  So if you're an Apple person, you're an  Apple person. If you're an Android person, you're an Android person.  Can Apple  announce things  that will  convert people back  from Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean I think there are already  I think there are a lot of people  I think there's actually a lot more flux and movement between the  platforms than people realize.  People are up for renewal. They look at all the  phones that are out.  But on the other side of techies, there isn't a huge amount of  allegiance. So like all the screens bigger or  my friend has this app and I should get that.  I don't think it's much more thought than that.  I think the conversation is Android or Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tried to woo my kids with Motorola Xs  after they broke their iPhones. I said well I'm not buying another  iPhone because a new one's coming out.  But try this Moto X. Both of them  well Henry said oh I can't  figure out how to charge it. That's such a lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Well kids are a different thing.  But that's the market.  Right but there's no question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in 2022 these are the guys you want to get  if you're Apple or Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  High school and college there's no question Apple is the cool brand.  They want Apple.  And this is where the brand, I don't buy into a lot of the  fragmentation story around Android.  But in terms of brand fragmentation, Samsung is not  cool in this way.  They're respected. They're fine. They're not cool.  Samsung is not cool. Google's own phones  are not a factor.  You don't have a brand that has that cache  that they do of having an  Apple logo on something. So I think  in that regard for young people  it's not the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am probably going to go back  to the iPhone with a bigger  screen and customizable keyboards.  But I am also  bracing myself  for disappointment.  So we'll see what happens.  But I'm one of those people  who's looking forward actually to going  back to the iPhone. Mostly because of  the variety of apps that get released on  iPhone only. It's very frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The apps are still better. They still are.  Good stuff on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an absurdity right there.  That's geeks not looking at enough  market research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's assuming that any of these decisions are based on  some rational process. And that's not how we  buy a thing that we hold in our hand all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's totally emotional. Because from a technical point of  view there's not much difference between any of the platforms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. What I'm talking about, Neil, is  the number of IHS spaces all the time  in the news business where they'll write  an app. NYT now.  They still haven't written an Android version. That's absurd.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a huge audience out there.  What do we think their goals are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Instagram says we'll write hyperlaps  for Android as soon as the  hardware capability is there.  Or the API is there.  So that's a technical reason.  But I see apps every day.  I see apps that are iPhone only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the app gap is getting smaller.  It's still there. It is getting smaller.  If you're looking at small startups  putting out,  there's going to be a couple apps that come out  on iOS first. It happens less than it  used to.  I don't know.  There's certainly still this notion that  you've got to prove  yourself on iOS first and that's where the money  is.  That Android users don't spend as much money  on apps or in-app purchase.  I also think that that gap is narrowing.  If that still even remains true now.  I agree. I think it's really stupid for companies  to release iOS  only first and then just say,  oh yeah, sometime down the road  we'll release to Android. Just makes sense.  Market share wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to take a break. Come back with  more. Our show today brought to you by Personal Capital.  Personal Capital is an app  on almost every platform  including Android Wear. This is one of the  first companies to make an Android  Wear app. I'll tell you  why that's actually very useful. Personal  Capital allows you to put all your financial  accounts into  one clear, easy  to understand dashboard. Your checking, your savings,  your car, your boat,  your loans. Most importantly  your investments. Your planning for the  future for retirement. It gives you a sense  of how you stand, where you're  overpaying in fees, where  you're not underperforming, where you're not getting what  you should be getting in terms of your investments,  where you need to rebalance things  like that. It couldn't  be easier. You enter it all in and you see it all  on one nice screen. And then the  app is awesome on the  Android Wear because it means  you get relevant, timely updates in your finances.  You know, a stock to  worry about. Things like that.  Personal Capital is great  and it gives you tailored advice on optimizing  your investments. So it's the best way to plan  for the future.  Half a million people now are using  Personal Capital. What was that number above?  It was like a billion, a hundred billion dollars  in finances being managed  or being entered into  the Personal Capital  interface. Really  is amazing. We first  met them when Bill Harris,  the founder, started the company  a couple of years ago. And we've been very proud  to be associated with them. Hey, here's the  best part. I didn't even tell you the best part. It's free.  Personal Capital.com  slash twig to get  started. It'll just take you a couple of minutes.  Immediately you'll reap the benefits.  Personal Capital.com  slash twig.  People say, well, how do they monetize? A couple of ways.  Of course, they monetize by  just like, you know, you would imagine  by offering you better deals. But  also some of you, not all  of you, but some of you will get calls  if you're managing a lot of money from  Personal Capital's certified financial planners  who are not on commission  but will help you with  your finances and your investment.  It's really great advice too. I use them.  Personal Capital.com slash  twig.  So  if you've seen  random favorites inserted into your Twitter  timeline,  it's because  you don't either follow enough people or the people you follow  aren't really doing anything. So they've decided, Twitter's  decided to spiff things up  by sticking favorites in there.  Dick Costolo explains in a tweet,  you get favorites when you pull  a refresh twice and we have no new tweets  both times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The response to the tweet, the response  to that letter article is precious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then Ed Young responds, hilarious  if true, everyone, Twitter, why?  Twitter, cause monkey  press lever, monkey get no snack,  monkey sad.  You know, this is just, this called  reruns, friends, nothing good on  TV. Here's some of your favorite tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What a missed opportunity  from Twitter, right? So this is this thing where  all the sort of Twitter junkies are really mad.  Why are these tweets showing up? I didn't follow  this person. It's a, it's, if  I wanted them to retweet it, I would retweet it and you're just  showing me favorites of my friends. All this  confusion and dismay, right? And, and what they  could have easily done is  announced it, said, you know what we're done? We  experimented with when people want  more of Twitter and they tell us by refreshing  twice, we're going to give you a little magic  surprise of something that  your friend likes. And people will be like, that's delightful,  it's thoughtful, anticipated what I  want. And because they didn't communicate about it,  instead it went the exact opposite way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're a loser, you know nobody  interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you ruin the experience because now  I can't predict what's going to be in my stream.  So now Twitter broke its promise to me about  they're only going to show me stuff that I follow.  And so they got the worst of both  situations and it's one of those things where you're like,  you know, a one paragraph  blog post could have turned this around for them if they  got ahead of it. And it's a,  it's a weird thing. Like the companies that make social  platforms are usually the worst at talking about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really an object lesson in communications  and marketing. Google has the same  problem. And if you  just, if you just announce it in a  clever creative way, you can make people very  happy. You know who's good at this? Apple.  Yeah. Apple knows.  Apple is so good at it. And by  the way, a great article from Mark Gurman in  9to5Mac on Apple's  marketing machine and how it manipulates the media.  Really, long article.  Brilliant. This guy's 20 years  old. Smart kid.  When I was 20 years old, I was still wondering  why I didn't get any prizes in my  cereal. And he is  analyzing marketing strategy at Apple  like a pro. I mean, it's just not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I loved that article. There's an interesting  thing in it where he says, well, Apple manipulated  coverage with an outlet by doing this.  And he just talks about how it happens and who did it.  But he sort of elides which  outlet was manipulated or exactly  what story it was about. So he's sort of  letting the other outlets save face.  And it's a very thoughtful thing to do.  But the whole way through, I kept asking, well, who was being  manipulated? Who got snookered by  Apple on this? And he sort of,  that's the only place where he pulls the punches.  It's about talking about how sort of fellow reporters were.  Yeah, because he also

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  makes a spreadsheet of which  journalists receive  early copies of which Mac  products. And you can very  clearly, on your own, correlate  it to who gets the best Apple  coverage.  That's a brave thing to do.  That's pretty much guaranteeing you'll be on Apple's  list for some time  to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a great, I love that grid  because that was one of the things, I think I mentally had  as a geek, you know, you kind of know, oh, well, that was interesting  when Shenni got the iPad for boing-boing.  And I hadn't noticed that before. And I  definitely remember the route  getting the iPad because it was like, oh, the Apple  was pretty conscientiously  courting the African-American audience here. And they  hadn't done that before. So that was really  cool. But seeing it all laid out was this sort of like.  They're so good. They're thoughtful,  right? They have a plan. And I think  that is the contrast to why I get frustrated  with Samsung saying, let's just splatter  stuff up against the wall at 10 different  watches because it's like, well,  there's a lot to be said for being disciplined.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me show you the spreadsheet  because it's kind of, when  you look at it, this is deep within  this article.  It's kind of telling because you can immediately see  by the checkboxes. So the green  check marks are people who got  iOS device review access  prior to  the release. The reds  are when nobody got it. And Nantech  didn't get it until very, very  recently. And of course, interestingly, both  Brian Klug and Anand  Laushempi from Nantech have just  defected to Apple.  Andy and Ico.  The coverage must have been too good. Yeah. A lot of  red Xs for our friend Andy.  Boing Boing got two specific devices,  the iPad and the iPhone 4.  Never again. But then you see  people like David Pogue,  Ed Begg who get green checks everywhere.  Even more  than CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ed Begg is always interesting because he's a super talented guy,  great writer. He's not  a sort of tech household name like  Walt Mossberg is, but he's  always been this very reliable sort of Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  voice. Well, he also has  a bully pulpit. I mean, you  can merely say, well, look, Pogue wrote for  the New York Times, Begg wrote for USA  Today. Those people probably should.  Although here's Jason Snell, editor in chief  of Macworld magazine, who only  three times out  of the total dozen got  a device ahead of time. So. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Macworld is on the out with Apple, but the interesting thing about it  is, Ed is still at  USA Today, but, you know, both  Walt and  Pogue have left their sort of  big newspapers. But you see this  sort of legacy, and I think in the article  he says, you know, Jobs was one of those people that like  judged media outlets by what he got in  print as a kid. And they're  still sort of saying, well, this is how you do  reputable and respectable is what  was on Dead Trees a few years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because you look at Mashable, which is clearly  influential. Bunch of red  X's. Yeah. Yeah.  So.  Kudos to  Mark Gurman for really speaking  truth to power. That's a brave thing to do when  you have a media machine that is so effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also a confident thing. He  knows he's got enough meat to what he covers.  Yeah. That he doesn't need to rely  on the sort of the kindness of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seeing through illusion, understanding Apple's  mastery of the media.  And  we'll see a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that soon. It should be a business  school case study. Yeah. This is how you do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  media. Well, and it really stands out  because so many companies do it so poorly  as in this case of Twitter,  where they just turn a win into a  loss. That's ridiculous.  Snatching defeat from a jolly victory.  Yeah. Twitter is  now doing kind of  improving the intake process.  One of the issues Twitter's always  had is when you sign up as a new user  to Twitter, it's a little baffling. It's like, well, now  what?  So they've done the first redesign in three  years of the  signup process. You identify your interests,  fashion, photography,  entertainment, news, and then  they suggest users.  They've always had to suggest a users list.  But  it's  designed to get you interested in it from right  from the very beginning.  I haven't played with it because... How is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  possible they went three years without  engineering? Isn't that odd?  That doesn't even sound plausible, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, maybe it's wrong, but that's what it says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've got hundreds and hundreds of engineers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they had other things. It feels like they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  differentiating small tweaks from major overhauls.  And they were working on getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the Justin Bieber servers running.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, speaking of favorites, the activity  column in TweetDeck is  amazing. It's like every single thing  that your friends favorite, like  as it happens. And it's just like  a ticker tape. I mean, it just flies  down, but that column is  unbelievable. I mean, seeing your friends' favorites is actually  really, really cool.  The problem was that they, just like you said,  that they just didn't pre-announce it and didn't handle it right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The results are in.  Of course, the FCC asking for comments.  Pro and Con on net neutrality.  Over a million comments came in.  Fewer than 1%  were against net neutrality.  Well, there's a shocker.  I'm going to get it.  I don't know if that was one of your numbers.  I think that's, I think we pretty much covered everything.  I'm just looking. Any stories you guys wanted to bring up?  I don't know if this is just amusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stuart Baker says you can tell whether Google thinks you're famous.  Did you see that one?  How do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Well, there's, so,  the right to be forgotten stuff, like Google  has some sort of measure,  or they indicated in their statements about it,  that there's some sort of measure about whether or not you're a public  figure.  So, and this article, I read this article just really quickly.  So if you search for yourself,  or for someone who you want to know whether or not Google thinks  you're a public figure, at the bottom,  if Google thinks you're a public figure,  it'll say results may have been removed.  You want to think the opposite, though.  That's the weird thing, isn't it?  Okay, it's the other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're famous, they're not going to remove stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're a public figure, they're not going to remove stuff, right?  Because it's public interest.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now everybody's Googling themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't have it at the bottom of my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have it at the bottom of mine either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have it at the bottom of my mind.  So I'll put in somebody who's just not famous.  See if this works.  You have to do it under the UK search.  It has to be UK.  Oh, it's in UK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has to be UK because it has to be your personal.  Oh, yeah, yeah, of course, because it's not,  it's not, okay, so let me look for myself again in Google UK,  because maybe I won't be famous enough there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can contend myself that I'm not famous in England, right?  That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, nothing.  Nothing for me.  No, if you're famous, it doesn't say anything.  If you're Chad Johnson,  let's see if it says anything.  Yeah, that's kind of going to be an issue.  Apparently there's quite a few Chad Johnson's.  Ochosinko.  All right, well, let's pick somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So where will it say that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did it offer me Chad Ochosinko?  You don't know who Chad Ochosinko is?  Ochosinko.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is he related to Chad Johnson?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's related to Chad Johnson.  Sports, sports ball.  Yeah, that's why I don't like my real name.  He also...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, I can't hear you.  ...is not there.  So that's not there for me on UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're famous. I don't know if I buy this.  That can't be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, if you've got a Wikipedia page...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're famous.  Maybe that's how they do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that that's a signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anil, don't you have a Wikipedia page?  I do, but I'm saying you all do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we all have Wikipedia pages.  So you're all famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, that's one of the criteria for getting on the show.  Oh.  No, I'm just kidding.  Jeff just left.  That and having a working internet connection.  Google's Android Wear team says  we'll update early and often.  I'm still waiting for an update.  And by the way, Google, you better hurry  because I don't know if this watch is going to stay on my wrist much longer.  There seems to be some competition coming.  Well, the Moto 360,  the Apple iWatch,  and that ginormous watch from Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the 360 is Android Wear.  The ginormous watch is Tizen.  Yeah.  I don't think  Google's really worried about Tizen, are they?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  After seeing that watch,  they'd be crazy to be worried.  Go ahead, Chad.  While we're getting Jeff back, I'm going to tell you a little bit about  my friends at Smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't hear me.  I can hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Welcome back, Jeff.  It's marvelous.  Sorry to interrupt the commercial.  We have the technology.  Ocio Cinco.  That means 85.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're such an Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ocio Cinco.  Ocio Cinque.  How do you say smart things in Italian?  Smart things.  This, my friends,  this was the Kickstarter project that I kicked into  way back.  You did, actually, Gina, didn't you?  You were a Kickstarter supporter of Smart Things.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a friend of a friend who was involved with it.  And honestly, you don't look like any Kickstarter.  I watched the video and they got me.  I wanted it.  And I got to tell you, I love it.  I mean, the kit that I have, I'm sure is an early prototype compared to what they're selling now.  I've loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I loved it.  They solved the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you have,  if you're trying to have a smart phone,  the issue is, of course, nothing talks to anything.  And you could get a system  like the Smart Things system  that'll talk to everything in the system  but never talks to anything else.  So the Smart Things hub is the cornerstone to all this.  Yes, of course, Smart Thing has  three home security kits, four now,  four brand new solution kits  which are designed to solve specific problems.  But they also integrate  with your GE, LOX,  your Schlage, your Honeywell, Eon,  Nest, Thermostats, your Dropcam,  your Philips Hue lights,  your Wemo remote,  and your Sonos music system.  You can create an amazing  array of  things. You said, what are you doing?  Are you having it tie into your music?  What did you say, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have sensors.  I have sensors that tells you whether or not  something's been opened or closed. I had it hooked up to my mailbox.  So when my mail came, my physical  postal mail, I would get a push notification.  That's awesome. Mails in.  I like that.  And the present sensor I had on my daughter's  stroller. So when  she went out for a walk and came back,  I would get a push notification that she was home  or she just left.  There was some really cool, I had the  lights program to come on when,  the night light to come on at sunset.  Which was really nice. There were IFTT  recipes. It's a really open, it's a very  open platform. It's very, very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now they have a maker kit so you can  integrate your Arduino projects. So really,  the sky's the limit. I mean, this is wide open.  So every kit includes the  hub, which is the key, of course.  And then everything you need to turn your smart home  into a, your home into a smart  home in as little as 15 minutes.  New and improved Zigbee sensors.  Zigbee's one of many  languages these devices talk to.  You can get instant alerts to prevent  a leak from causing a flood. You can be notified  if there's unexpected entry or movement  in your home. Control and automate  your lights and small appliances.  You get the idea. Pretty much the sky's the limit.

SmartThings, they really are smart.com  slash  Twitter. Gina, I know you want to get going, so  let us get from you  your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, this is a new one  to me. It's a really tiny,  subtle Google Docs thing  that I was unaware of, but I'm often  dealing with multi-page documents  in Google Docs. And I didn't realize  this, but as you're scrolling through  a multi-page document, there's a  little tool tip on the scroll bar  that tells you what page you're on.  I had just never noticed it before,  but there it is. It works.  So, yeah, keep an eye on that if you're  reviewing long, long, boring  documents in Google Docs, like I  have been doing recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Almost done.  Page 37 of 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I don't want to know.  Righty.  I'm soon to come out with a  tome.  The white paper.  Now that the Internet has ruined everything, what next?  It's 180 pages  in Google Docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a killer. There you go. There that tool tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's forever to load.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's it about again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, smartass. Now that the Internet has ruined  news, what next?  It's my... everybody  says, okay Jarvis, what's your view?  So finally I had to write down everything that I think.  There it is. What's next?  What's next?  It's aimed at my geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you need to rebrand it though.  I don't think that white paper really sells it well.  I think you have to try to...  Can you make it a medium essay? Would it fit into the  text area?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to put it all up on medium for free.  For smashing paywalls, I can't do that.  And the title is  Geeks Burying Gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not What Would Jarvis Do?  That's good too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where you got to go.  What Would Jeffy Do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know exactly what that book is about.  What Would Jarvis Do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What Would Jarvis Do?  Uh oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, you're going to give us a number here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I just didn't know about this.  Do you know about ground truth countries  in Google Maps?  So there's now 50 of them.  And I said, what the heck is a ground truth  country?  Google determines  certain countries need better maps  and not that there aren't also other crowd-sourced  mapping solutions. So they make it an effort  and bring people in to try to help improve maps  and add  more richness to the maps.  And so they now have 50 countries  that they focus on  to radically improve the maps  there. So I just found that vaguely interesting.  Not terribly interesting, just vaguely.  That's pretty cool.  I was also desperate for a number, so when I  saw 50, I jumped at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well,  I mean, Open Street Maps  is a really cool idea.  I guess this puts it into the Google Maps,  which after all is what everybody uses.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, there it is.  Some weeks it's funny.  I'll have 20 numbers. You'll see the list.  Some weeks they're just not a number to be had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Neil, did you want to  share a little something with us here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a Twitter account that I thought everybody  should follow. It's really interesting. It's called  Valely Edits.  There's a whole series of Twitter  accounts. Parliament Wiki edits  out of the UK was the first  then led into Congress  edits, which also is a great follow. And Congress  edits says anonymous  members of  the staff of Congress are making  edits to Wikipedia. We should see what  articles they're editing. And Valely Edits  is that for the big tech companies. So if you look  at Twitter and Apple and Google and Facebook,  what are their employees while  on the clock at the job, at the office,  editing on Wikipedia?  These are silly and light.  Apple employees editing  a pressure cooker entry.  But it's something where we think about  Wikipedia is so much of the definitive record  of what culture is. Then let's  see if there's any  self-interest going on from these tech companies writing  about things that actually directly  impact them.  It's nice because it's not a ton of tweets.  It's not really, really noisy. But if you want to  look at the impact of like, well how are  these big tech companies trying  to actually shape the world and shape culture,  it can be really powerful.  There's also, I think,  you look at the topics  they're writing about and there can be a little bit of an  indication of, well, somebody over  at that company thinks this topic is interesting. I wonder  what the implications are for their products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Valely Edits  on Twitter, at Valely  Edits. One of the whole  set of these. Somebody should make a list of all of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, if you go to  Congress edits and look at  who it's following. It's following about 60 accounts  right now. And most of them are  government trackers. So, you know,  government in Germany, what are the  elected officials editing. But there's for  all different things. There's from certain universities,  from big tech companies. There's one for  pharmaceutical companies.  What are their employees editing on  Wikipedia? And this view  into sort of directly  who's editing the information. I  have found it's just a really, it makes me  wish I had it for everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding. I mean, you can  go into any Google article and see who has  edited it. But by IP address, you  then have to match it up to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple or Google or whatever. Yeah, I mean, it's always been  theoretically possible. But being able to really  go in and just kind of have it a click it delivered  to you. Between Congress edits and  Valely Edits, it's been very, very  eye opening for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are going to have Kevin  Marks on next week to talk about the Indie  Web. Something we're very intrigued  by and excited about.  I want to thank Anil Dash for being  here.
