Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Back to work. So I'm in New York because tonight I go and tape Neil deGrasse Tyson's podcast.  Oh!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Podcast timing you.  Excuse me.  Pardon me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you doing hanging out with us, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, slumming, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's always a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'll be great. He's a professor of journalism at CUNY. That's where his office is.  That's why he's got newspapers in the office.  Also with us, our good friend and co-host Stacy Higginbotham from the Stacy on IoT Show at iotpodcast.com.  And her blog where she writes all about IoT. Stacy on IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What does that mean? It's a signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's never open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the door is open. I didn't even think about that. It's only open. My daughter's not here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're here. It does kind of like poltergeist in that room behind you. It's so bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's because it's my hallway and it's a big window.  They're here.  Would you like to finish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I like it.  Inside the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're inside the house.  So as we speak, there's a massive malware epidemic spreading throughout Europe and elsewhere.  A new quasi-ransomware called Petia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know there's also something called NotPetia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, and SortaPetia. There's three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is too much for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get ready because this is the new world order.  I just want to say we're aware of it. We'll talk about it in a little bit.  But I think since Jeff's here and he hasn't been here and I haven't been here, I think we need to get a little rant going.  Uh-oh.  So we're going to start with the largest fine the EU has ever levied.  2.42 billion euros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  2.7 billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To Google because it pushed, according to the EU, search results towards frugal, its shopping engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or the thing formerly known as frugal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Frugal doesn't even exist anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it doesn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm not, as you know, I've criticized Google for getting into businesses that a search giant shouldn't get into, like YouTube, like content.  But I never felt like they preferred their shopping engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they do in the sense that those are ads and they sell those ads.  Those ads appear atop the page and that's the way the business works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Your article in Politico.eu, going right into the lion's den, has exactly the right headline.  2.4 billion euros for Google shopping? Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was them. That was a good headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then you point out that this really probably has less to do with shopping and more to do with European companies that compete with Google, like Axel Springer, in advertising.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, start here.  So I use every possible Google product there is, except for this Macintosh, which doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If Google would only make a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, one that Microsoft would respect and put Skype on, but this is a whole other story.  So I use every Google product there is, but I have no sense of ever using Google shopping.  I used to use Frugal. Frugal died. I don't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Frugal wasn't a shopping site. It was a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a search engine for shopping comparison, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there is Google shopping now, and I've never used it either.  If you type in shoes, on Google shopping or just in general, let's just do it in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In general, type in shoes, you will get ads atop the page that are Google-placed ads, like every possible other kind.  Oh, you don't even get that. Weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me log out. Let me do an incognito window, because, you know, when you're logged in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It knows you don't wear shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why would it not give you shoes? Stacey, does it give you a shoes bar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you type shoes into Google?  I just type shoes in the search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure it does. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't get it. Oh, yeah, I do. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Here's the ad.  It's not a bar, though. I get an ad.  I didn't get to stay either.  I get an ad for Zappos, which is Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, I didn't get that today. So what you normally get is a little...  Oh, maybe they took it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if I click the shopping tab?  Let me click the shopping. Here's the shopping tab.  But this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, if you type in phones.  Type in phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Phones? I'm telling you, my shoes worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, did? Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got a bar? Here's the bar you're talking about.  Yeah, so you got a bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, but if I type in phones, I don't get a bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's so sexist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dang.  So this says sponsored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It says sponsored.  It's ads. Yes, they point to that.  Yes.  And no, they don't point to competitors.  As much as the competitors wish.  And yes, Yelp complains.  But I don't see any problem with this.  And in any case, it's probably worth more than the shopping service is worth, the fine is.  But as I say in the piece, it's not really about that.  The publishers used all their political clout to go after, and this is Springer and News Corp and others,  and to go after regulators to go after Google.  And it's been a seven-year process, I think three or four aborted efforts to settle.  And Google was ready to settle, ready to change behavior, but then the politicians kept getting more pressure.  No, make them hurt, make them hurt more, don't settle.  And the politicians did.  And so now we have this huge fine to be levied against Google.  And no matter what it ends up being, it means that the regulators are going to be up Google's rear end for years.  And all over this shopping thing, which makes no sense.  Which is ironic.  By the way, in shopping, there is a lot of competition from a company called Amazon,  which Stacey will be getting to later.  And so I use Amazon to shop. I don't use Google to shop.  Google is not paramount in shopping.  But that's the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google says we're going to appeal, we disagree with the result, but where do they appeal?  They appeal to the courts in the EU, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which, same folks who gave us the right to be forgotten.  Yeah, there's been some bad decisions today. There's one in Canada, too, we'll get to later.  Eric Schmidt has always said when you represent, you're the biggest thing on this disruptive behemoth called the internet,  yeah, you're going to be the target. But boy, are they the target on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is a story that is continuous in technology.  And we've always known that the incumbents would fight tooth and nail against this intermediation by the internet.  In general, and internet companies specifically.  And so that's what you say this is, really.  But there is a legitimate point to be made, and I've made it about YouTube,  that when Google is in a business like content, that muddies the waters with their search.  I've always said Google should be above the fray.  I know they have the right as a business to pursue profit in any way they see fit.  But I feel like you should be like almost a priesthood if you're in charge of search  and completely agnostic and independent.  And having properties like content properties muddies the waters unnecessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, and I can agree with that. Let me make two points.  One, Google is not just a search company anymore.  There are a lot of advertising companies. Their revenue comes from all kinds of other places.  I know, and I guess it's foolish of me to say, but I wish they were just a search company.  But this is like the EU going after Microsoft. They're fighting yesterday's war.  What was my second point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is not a monopoly here in the US. People are pointing out there is competition in the US.  But in Germany, in Europe, they're about 80%, 90% market share.  They are effectively a monopoly in search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But again, and they're arguing this is a search thing, the truth is, if you're...  not to give them any ideas, but if I were an antitrust person and I wanted to go after Google,  the one area where they are vulnerable is advertising.  They have a huge, huge market share in advertising.  There's another thing, I'll give up a number right now, there's another thing on the rundown  that says that Google and Facebook together now have more ads than every newspaper and magazine combined in the world.  So it's a duopoly, and there's huge pressure there.  And I've long said that where Google is most vulnerable,  and this is perhaps what's coming back to bite them in a slightly indirect way,  where they're most vulnerable is that they have the power of God over businesses.  And if a link farm comes in and Google says you're a bad link farm and next to it is a good directory,  and Google gets rid of both of them because they look similar and one actually has editorial value and one doesn't,  Google makes that decision solely.  And I've argued for years that Google ought to appoint a jury of advertising peers to take some of the pressure off of them.  Well in a sense what happened here is Yelp has been yelping about Google for years  and other small shopping search engines that just don't compete with Google because it's not as good  and they don't have the reach and they're not going to rise up and they're not going to get the same money,  but they are complaining and Google has power over them and no cover to hide behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and by the way, as I said with content, I have the same problem because I'm a competitor with Google's YouTube  and if you search for tech news and you get a lot of YouTube links but you don't get Twit links,  that's also Google using its power to harm me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course their answer would be, unlike the shopping, their answer would be you can be on YouTube for free and we'll give you money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's not the answer I want. That means yeah, you live on our farm and give us your proceeds  and we'll give you a share of those. It's not the right answer there.  So, Stacey, what do you think?  I'm sympathetic to the EU. I feel like this is a case where they're just wrong.  What they're complaining about is the ad bar. Google sells ads.  So does every media company.  Yeah, and they favor the ads, favor the people who pay for the ads. That's the way it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you go to Axl Springer's built, the largest paper in Europe, and you search for shoes there,  you get the built shoe shop and you get built shoe advertisers. You don't get built competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The EU is not complaining that search results are modified. Tell me if this is the case.  They're not complaining that search results are modified. They're complaining about the ad bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, I think they are complaining that in various ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're complaining that it confuses people, correct?  Like if I search for shoes on Google, it is possible that I would not see the word sponsored  and I might not understand the relationship there. I think that's what the complaint's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there's more allegations. I read the stories. I didn't get to read the full complaint.  I think there's other allegations that they nefariously don't promote.  But it's a negative. You prove it a negative.  They don't promote the competitors as much as they otherwise should or would.  It's a real hard thing to prove, I think.  Stacey, what do you think? I'm monopolized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and on this, yes. I have no opinions. I mean, my opinions are the common questions.  I really don't. No, I really don't. This is that advertising.  I have opinions about monopoly power in other industries, but this is not an industry I know a lot about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we'd all agree. Antitrust laws are a good thing.  I think we're in this country. We're in favor of free markets.  We don't perhaps have the suspicion of big companies they have in Europe,  but we're in favor of free markets and private enterprise.  One of the places where free markets fail is when one company gains so much dominance  that they can use their dominance in one market to block competitors in other markets  and in effect expand their dominance.  It's always been held in this country that that is illegal, that is misusing.  It's not illegal to be a monopoly. It's illegal to misuse your monopoly power.  We've for a long time had antitrust regulations.  So I think we all agree on that.  The question is, is Google using its effective monopoly and search in Europe  to establish a foothold in another business?  This is what Margareta Vestager, the commissioner in charge of privacy,  this is her quote, in charge of competition policy, said,  Google has come up with many innovative products and services  that have made a difference to our lives. That's a good thing.  But Google's strategy for its comparison shopping service  wasn't just about attracting customers by making its product better than those of its rivals.  Instead, Google abused its market dominance as a search engine  by promoting its own comparison shopping service and its search results  and demoting those of competitors.  What Google's done is illegal under EU antitrust rules.  And this is where I can't disagree with this sentiment.  It denied other companies the chance to compete on the merits and to innovate.  And most importantly, it denied European consumers a genuine choice of services  and the full benefits of innovation.  That's what antitrust is about.  And if it's her opinion and the opinion of the EU that that's what Google did,  then I understand this decision.  I guess the debate now is whether Google did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So listening to that, it seems actually kind of interesting  because it's talking about some of the issues that we have.  It's the same issues people have with things like data aggregation  and how in today's world, the more both networks effects,  the greater your network effects, the greater the amount of data  you can bring in from your users, that's going to have a real competitive differentiator  and advantage over competitors over time.  And that gap is only going to get wider.  And that actually, we've talked about this before with kind of like  how do you think about antitrust in an era where everything is digital  and maybe a lot of things are free.  So, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's global markets.  So this Canadian decision is interesting because...  Well, but I'm just saying Google is a difficult challenge because...  It's a monopoly in Germany.  It's not a monopoly in the US.  And yet Google, by this Canadian decision,  will be required to change its search results globally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is horrendous to free speech. Horrendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, this is...  You know, I think that even Margaret Vestayer would say  this is very difficult, challenging to decide what to do.  But this is what we've decided to do, I'm sure, what she would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me make a couple of points about the EU decision.  One, we need to point out that antitrust law is different in the US than Europe.  Here, it's about protecting consumers.  There, it's more about...  I'll get complaints about saying this wrong.  But more about protecting companies, protecting the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of what her statement said. We want to make sure...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's bigger than the market's problem.  But I see no consumer harm here.  The problem becomes...  I don't know how to say this well.  It's a tautological problem.  She's basically saying that  they can't compete on their merits.  Well, you've got to prove the negative.  That if Google didn't have a shopping service,  what would they be? But of course, Google is going to have shopping ads.  So, what does the world look like without Google?  And is that what the definition of fair is?  But with Google, well,  Google has better services.  You know, this is the irony of the Microsoft case.  Microsoft is going to force its browser down everybody.  Well, no, somebody came along with a better browser.  And it didn't happen that way.  And if Google has a better shopping service  and better listings for shoes and better advertising  opportunities for those advertisers,  then it does deserve to win  in the market and with the consumer.  Wait, wait, okay. Stop.  And how do you prove that it's undue  influence on that?  That's the tautological problem. Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, this actually gets kind of  to some of the arguments we make about  network neutrality. And don't hate me for saying this,  but there you're also trying to prove  a negative in the sense that  if ISPs get involved, they're going to cause harm.  And I would say that  a focus on the consumer  isn't actually the right way to go, necessarily.  Because consumers in some cases  can win. Like if you think about,  well, I'm not even going to bring that up  because that's super controversial.  But you really should be  optimizing as a government  for competition.  Because the understanding is competition  is going to be inherently better.  But if you go that route, then you have to look  at the nature of competition  and how it changes based on technology,  based on user habits,  based on all of this stuff.  And I think  it is a tautological...  I can never say these words.  Tautological.  Tautological argument. Epidemiology!  Epistemology!  Ontology!  But I think that's just  a philosophical difference people are  going to have. And I think that's a fine argument  to be happening.  I think it's really necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that notion of  if it's just about you must have competition.  Well, no.  Again, monopolies aren't illegal.  If you have the best product and everybody loves it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not illegal.  At least not in the US.  Although I think we should...  It's a good point that the European rules are different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could have a competitive impact though.  That's what's really interesting today  because the more people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why the US standard I think is a better standard  because you have to look at harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But well, and...  I don't think anybody suggested  that Google should be  prosecuted in the US for this, right?  Nobody's investigating Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was an investigation.  The FTC docs were leaked.  But I think it was a proper decision  in the US not to do it.  Now this is where then people pull out,  look at how often Google  went into the White House during the Obama administration.  Aha, see?  But I think that pales given current Russian activities.  I'm not getting political.  I'm just comparing.  But yeah, this notion that competition for it...  Then Stacy, what it also leads to  is that this is what I get all the time from Europeans.  I got flustered with the BBC interview earlier today  because I just...  Well, is it a time that somebody just does something?  Show me the statute that defines too big.  And in essence what you get to here is you say,  if you get too big, that alone is a sin.  We're not going to tell you what too big is.  Well, that's your assertion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not what their law says.  That's what you think it means.  I mean, the EU would say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what they say about this.  Shouldn't somebody go after them because they're too big?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But really what the EU rules are is  monopolistic behavior...  I'm reading from Ben Thompson's very good article in Stritechary.  Monopolistic behavior is presumed to be illegal  if it restricts competitors,  which in the long run theoretically hurts consumers.  But as you point out, it's really about other businesses.  Dominant companies have a special responsibility in the EU  not to abuse their market position by restricting competition  either in the market in which they're dominant  that's different by the way from the US  or in separate markets.  Otherwise, there'd be a risk that a company  once dominant in one market,  even if this resulted from competing on the merits,  would be able to use this market power to further expand its dominance  or leverage it into separate markets.  Ben points out that part of the problem is  what is a monopoly in the digital era?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That's where I think this is actually good  because we're having a conversation about  what it means to be too big right now.  Yeah, because you could...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it a monopoly when you can just say  instead of typing google.com, bing.com?  Or duck.gov?  Or duck.gov?  Admittedly, most people don't,  but they're making an economic choice  and have the right to make that choice.  So in other words, Google is winning on its merits.  It's not like there's a barrier to entry, or is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think where this gets interesting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is one with Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Stacey.  I think this gets interesting when we start looking at companies like,  we'll say, I don't know if Jeff is going this way,  Amazon or Google with machine learning and improving their services.  So when you now go into Google...  But you want them to do that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  Yeah, I know. But I'm just saying you don't want to create  a chilling effect where they don't want to innovate  because they would come up against the shoals of anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, well, and that's true.  And that's why this is a good conversation  because we have to talk about that.  And we have to understand...  I think that's what...  The way that regulators do this is through laws and through the courts  and through these kind of conversations.  And we're going to see how badly this works out or what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you could say this is the first beginning of the conversation.  I think that's what this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think that's worth...  Stacey, let me stipulate, Your Honor,  that the conversation is a fine thing to have, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to call this show Judge Stacey from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yeah, I like that.  I'm like, Stacey gets yelled at by Jeff, good Lord.  No, she's not yelling at you.  I feel like a student in the classroom.  I'm like, I'm going to teach you.  No, it's Judge Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm stipulating I'm agreeing with you, right?  So let's say the conversation is good.  However, $2.7 billion for this Ficacta little shopping thing,  the political effort to try to do a huge boom on Google  for what is a minor part of Google where there is minor harm, if any,  that's not the way to have the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That I will agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a political act, not a regulatory act.  It's a political act.  And it was started by publishers who were acting politically,  who were using, in my mind, journalistic value, perhaps improperly,  to force government to regulate against,  to protect against their new competitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, I'm going to channel...  I'm going to channel Marguerite Vestager,  even though I can't pronounce her name.  I'm going to channel her.  This is what the European Commission's fact sheet says in this regard.  We mentioned, yeah, you may have been a monopoly,  but that's because consumers choose you.  They could easily, there's very little barrier to them using DuckDuckGo.  They say there are also high barriers to entries in these markets  in part because of network effects.  The more consumers use a search engine,  the more attractive it becomes to advertisers.  So they're kind of, I think, admitting, Jeff, what you are suggesting.  The profits generated can then be used to attract even more consumers.  Similarly, the data a search engine gathers about consumers  can in turn be used to improve results.  They're saying there's a virtuous circle here  that Google's taking advantage of  to make it even more strong and more powerful.  Indeed, it's virtuous for those consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those consumers get a very free, get a free,  a very good service that is free and it is relevant.  Well, it's virtuous for Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and it's not quite so virtuous if you're Alex Springer or Rupert Murdoch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, then change your damn business.  Don't keep on trying to persuade the rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think your point is that it's Murdoch and Alex Springer  that don't want to compete on the merits.  Google's winning on the merits.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's change this a little bit, though,  because this is about advertising, which strong feelings.  Publishers, strong feelings.  But the same virtuous cycles based on network effects  is going to happen in services based on artificial intelligence.  So the more data you have,  so like think about car companies and even your photo services on Google.  So when you start to look at it that way, then you're...  Oh, my gosh, guys, I'm on this new medication,  and it's making my brain stupid.  Oh, can I have some of that?  I'll have what she's having.  Okay, I'm going to have to come back to that.  But the idea here is that you're going to be better as a business  the more information you suck in.  Exactly.  And that's exactly why this clause is problematic in the internet era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because from the point of view of creating great companies,  and by the way, a great company like Google benefits consumers,  you want to encourage this virtuous circle.  And for the EU to say, well, we can't allow that to happen  because it becomes a flywheel that you can't stop.  We've got to stick a stick into it  so that other people get a chance to create their own virtuous cycle.  Well, not even they can create a cycle.  Oh, wait, wait, I remembered my point.  Hold on.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's stay...  Before we move on.  The drugs have kicked in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Yes, the drugs kicked in.  Think about something like facial recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're Facebook, right now you have the data to do amazing facial recognition,  amazing facial recognition,  amazing people recognition.  Now imagine that being used for something nefarious,  and everyone's still on Facebook.  There's no...  When those things start happening, consumers will want to move,  but they won't necessarily have that choice  because the network effects and benefits will have accrued  too much to those main companies.  We're seeing that now.  Yeah, you see it on Facebook.  That's the flip side of this argument when it's about the network.  This is the graph that the EU decided to include in their PDF of this decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, immediately discredited because it comes from StatCounter,  Jesus.  which shows what morons they are, but it does show almost 100%.  The red line at the top, here, let me tell us straight,  is this is Google, this is everybody else.  And it's not just Google, it's everybody else.  This is Google, this is everybody else at the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's really a symbol for...  Just change the label on this to advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they even admit that because it attracts advertisers,  profits generate, can attract more consumers.  They admit that that's part of the virtuous circle.  But what they're saying is Google is completely dominant based on StatCounter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But again, there's nothing wrong with that.  The question is, what did they do wrong?  Let me make two points, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Dominant companies says the EU have a special responsibility  not to abuse their market position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And prove the abuse. I don't see the abuse.  Two points.  One, you said earlier that they want to put the stick in the flywheel  to enable others to create.  That's not what's happening here.  They're putting the stick in the flywheel  to protect existing companies against Google's creation.  It's protection.  I don't think motivations...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know we can argue about if motivations matter,  but in general it's the results that matter in these things.  And so I will agree with you that their motivations may stink,  but the results are, is we're going to start having this conversation.  Also that fine hopefully will be whittled down.  I don't know. I'm like, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you worry that this is going to have a chilling effect on companies  because look, this is what a company is trying to create,  is this flywheel effect where there's benefit to the company  and the company grows bigger because of the benefit to the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That flywheel scares a lot of people.  I mean, if you think about how we're reacting...  It scares us. It's the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're saying Google's getting too big.  That's what we're saying is...  And Amazon, same thing.  They've got the data, which the data helps them do this, which...  But at the same time, don't we...  There is a market benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is. And it bothers me in two ways.  It bothers me for Europe, which is the one I make in the op-ed,  that this is no way to attract investment and innovation to Europe.  This is no way to say that we're going to work in Europe.  It's going to create a chill.  And they keep on saying, we want our own Google.  The only way you're going to get your own damn Google is if you invest and risk.  Second point, even outside of Google...  So I got an argument on Twitter, as often happens in these cases,  with a guy named Jason Kent, who is the head of the horribly named  Digital Content Next, which is a trade association for major publishers in the US.  And you're defending Jarvis, you're defending Google and Facebook.  And he's echoing the EU line.  The problem I have with that with publishers echoing the EU line,  and it's going to happen the same thing when we get to GDPR and privacy,  is, to my mind, the salvation of the mass media,  of the next generation of mass media publishing and journalism,  is relevance and value, is knowing people as individuals, is having data on them.  Uh-oh! Data on them.  So now data is being...  Knowledge about people to build relationships of relevance and value  is being demonized in this decision and across.  And if the publishers take too strong a stance that to have any data,  to know anybody as an individual is bad,  they're cutting off their nose and other appendages.  They're cutting off their future.  And they're, and they're doing themselves...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Much like the music industry in the face of Napster,  their goal is to preserve as incumbents the status quo.  And there's no bigger threat to the status quo than the internet and Google  and this new way of doing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But now you have regulators and corporations...  But you can't turn the clock back.  They can do everything they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they're going to... But they can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're trying to say, we're not going to allow this progress to happen.  And it is... I've said this on the show a million times.  It is too soon to define and limit and regulate the internet.  We don't know what it is yet.  We don't know how it operates yet.  And for the EU, the ultimate hubris here is for the EU to come in and decide,  we know how the internet should operate.  We're going to say, we don't know yet.  You're too old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, again, in this document, in this complaint from the EU,  as proof that Google is helping itself,  they show that Google's comparison shopping services has gained in traffic  while rival shopping services have decreased.  It's a success.  God!  How dare they?  That's the proof that they offer.  Well, look how successful Google is.  You want to chill success?  That's what this does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chills success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look how successful Google is.  We can't have that.  So now, let me just ask, is 2....  What is it? 2.42 billion euros.  Can Google just pay that and move on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's going to change their business and how they operate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not the money.  It's the consent decree that they're worried about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's why I say it's such a political decision.  This is political in every way.  So, Stacey, I would buy what you're saying about the need for the conversation  if it happened in a more sane structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, companies don't have...  No, because we don't have these conversations in sane structures  because we're all people.  We have these conversations only when there's self-interest at play.  So up until now, everyone's like, hey, we're going to be good.  We'll self-regulate.  We'll talk about these things.  And until someone establishes a line, though,  we don't know when someone's going over it.  And so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google tried to settle three or four times.  They were...  Well, yes.  Her prior successor, two ago, was ready to settle.  The decision was done.  And then the publishers cried bloody murder  and went after the politicians of the EU and stopped the settlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just thanking God that big business has no impact here in the United States  on what our legislators do because that clearly is a bad system.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, it's not over because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we'll talk about Canada, too.  But the EU also has already come to a similar conclusion  about Google's Android operating system and AdSense.  So the other reason Google doesn't want to settle is because this is the beginning.  This is not the end.  Watch out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android is going to be...  So part of what's going on here, too, is that they demonize relevance and data  and value and knowledge about people.  They're also going to demonize free.  That's what the publishers hate most.  That's what Murdoch and Springer hate most.  And they're smart people, especially at Springer.  And they believe in this notion of creating a product called content,  and you must pay us for it.  And free is what most threatens them.  And so Android in its core business model is going to be seen,  I guarantee you, it's going to be seen as a digital version of dumping.  Ooh, that's so controversial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to read about that.  Okay.  Jeff, I would like you to write the idea about digital dumping.  That's a fun concept.  It is fun, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is fun, actually, right now.  Because, Stacey, I don't need to take your meds to forget things.  I have something called age.  Pencil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm getting there.  In addition to the medicine, I just think I'm getting older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not the first time that's happened.  I mean, that's what Microsoft did to compete against Netscape, remember?  Netscape was charging for its browser.  And Microsoft moved in.  By the way, got in trouble with not only the EU but the Department of Justice  because they moved in and gave away their browser.  I remember when Internet Explorer 3.0 came out back in 1995 or six,  it was immediately saw that it's all over for Netscape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about things like zero rating, though, on data plans,  which I know can be controversial.  Look at Facebook and what happened in India.  I know those are net neutrality things, but they're also kind of digital dumping.  Oh, this is such a fun area.  Digital dumping.  Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On Judge Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to assign Jeff like, Jeff, that's your new book.  That's your new article.  Do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be a good book.  Sorry.  Digital dump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just like someone else should read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by.  Oh, I had such a nice meal last night.  I made a blue apron meal.  We just got our new blue apron box.  So we get three meals.  We get the blue apron for a couple.  So that means it's for two people, although we always split it three ways.  And there's plenty.  Blue apron delivers you all the ingredients, fresh, that you need to make an amazing meal,  plus the recipe, right to your door.  They're the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery service in the country.  Last night, we had a delicious steak.  I made, it had fingerling potatoes, which I roasted.  They came out perfectly.  We had a nice butter lettuce salad.  And I made a dressing.  Again, all of the ingredients I got from blue apron.  It had a little thing of creme fraiche, a little thing of blue cheese, crumb, blue cheese, crumbles.  It was such a good dressing.  It was this creamy blue cheese dressing.  A little thing I'd never used before called verjuice.  Have you ever used V-E-R-J-U-S?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we've talked about this before.  This is the wine sweet vinegar something.  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the pressed juice of unripened grapes.  It's not vinegar, but it's acidic.  It's delicious.  Anyway, so verjuice and creme fraiche and blue cheese crumbles.  It was the most amazing dressing.  But the nice thing is it only took me about half an hour to make an amazing dinner.  I told you a couple of nights before I made this cannelloni.  It's so great.  So let's take a look.  Let's go to the menu and see what's on the menu this week.  I should log into my account because we've been going crazy.  I think we've got all our blue aprons through August.  Now, the nice thing about blue apron is it's not a subscription in the sense that you have a weekly commitment.  You get it when you order it.  You don't get it if you don't.  So when we went on vacation, for instance, we didn't get any blue apron boxes.  You customize recipes.  You pick from the menus.  They don't repeat more than once a year, so you're always going to try new delicious meals.  I think we've already ordered for this week.  I'm trying to remember.  That's the family friendly fontina cheeseburgers or red and white.  Those are for a family of four with kid friendly ingredients.  I can't remember.  It's fun.  This is something we do every week or so.  Lisa and I will sit down and look at the menus and pick our meals.  Oh, I love this.  I hope we ordered it.  I can't remember.  Bulgogi beef and soba noodles stir fry with marinated vegetables.  My mouth is just watering.  I'm glad you're doing these earlier in the show now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  This is so mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is what you get in the box.  I'm going to get hungry the whole show now.  Even the meat is fresh.  Nothing's frozen.  So you get 10 ounces of thinly sliced beef.  You get one carrot because there's no waste.  You need one carrot.  You get one carrot, one cucumber, one scallion, one bunch of cilantro and mint, two tablespoons of rice vinegar.  They come in little bottles.  Two tablespoons of this new sauce that I love, the yakiniku sauce.  I bought some because I liked it so much as kind of a Japanese barbecue.  I don't know what gochujang is, but you get a tablespoon of that and then sesame oil.  So this is what is so cool.  You do this.  Those are fresh soba noodles.  You'll flip your lid.  The ingredients are the best as if you were going to the best grocery store, except it costs you less, less than $10 a meal because they don't have the overhead.  Seared chicken and creamy pasta salad with summer squash and sweet peppers.  Vegetarians will love blue apron too.  How about fresh basil fettuccine pasta with sweet corn and Cubanelle pepper?  I can just go on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Potato crusted catfish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, doesn't that sound catfish is so good.  Isn't that good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Red, white and blue pizza.  What's the blue?  You must be looking at the family plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me look here.  I'm looking at your screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, right there.  Right there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Olives, blueberries, peas.  Oh, no, the blue.  It's a purple potato.  Okay.  Purple potato.  Yeah, you don't mind?  So it comes with fresh pizza dough.  It comes with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, garlic, arugula, peach, peach, purple potatoes, basil, asiago cheese, a shallot.  By the way, Lisa and I both decided we're going to use shallots more often.  Shallots are so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they are nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're subtle.  They're delicious.  And I always forget to get shallots.  I have a tuna recipe with shallots in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're a friendly garlic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's delicious.  It's all about shallots.  They have wine choices now, too, by the way.  And wines are fun.  They're not quite full bottles.  They're not quite splits.  So they make a wine recommendation and you can order those.  So we've been ordering wine, too, to go with our meals.  Are you kidding?  No, it's so freaking awesome.  So all I got to say is blueapron.com slash twig.  Check out this week's menu.  Get your first three meals free with your first purchase plus free shipping.  Blueapron.com slash twig.  There is no doubt in my mind and Blueapron convinced me that you can have produce delivery.  That's perfect.  The produce I get in my box is better than anything I ever get at the grocery store.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The early days of all that stuff at Cunninghast, we were involved.  We had to get investments in some of those companies and the logistical problems were  just too great.  Yeah.  But, you know, was it grocery.com?  What was the one that wasted the huge amounts of money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember Peapod and Webvan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Peapod, Webvan, Cosmo.  They didn't do groceries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cosmo did like a six pack, a carton of cigarettes and ice cream.  It's real weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to order stuff on Webvan all the time because I lived in New York City and they  didn't have like basic stuff back then.  So I'd be like, what?  No New York store stocks Rotel?  What?  How am I going to make queso?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  Oh, I want your queso recipe.  Yeah.  Oh, I love queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  That queso recipe is a can of Rotel and a block of Elvita cheese.  It's not fancy.  No, no, no.  I'm just telling you, I have lots of great recipes, but the queso recipe is just like  straight up all Americana terrible for you.  Oh, but delicious.  Oh, it's very delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rotel is tomatoes and diced green chilies, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you can use it to anything.  I mean, you can add it to your chicken a la king or whatever and you can make like a delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if we can get Rotel out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if we can.  No, that sounds like a Texas treat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  So really you just add a can of Rotel to a block of Elvita and that's queso for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it used to be.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't need it anymore because it's because it's poison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not poison, but now I usually go out.  Now I don't I don't have parties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You live in Austin, the best queso in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That's what I go out and get my cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Miss Fancy Pants now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know the best thing.  So take all your cheese rinds and like old chunks of cheese, just as much as you have,  if you save it all.  And you throw it in with a bunch of garlic into like a little pot to melt it all down  with the garlic and some wine and then you get some crusty bread and you just dip it  in and people are like, oh my God, this is delicious.  You're like, I just cleaned out the fridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I always save Parmesan rinds because they use it in sauces and stuff.  In soup.  Just toss it in your veggie.  Yeah.  That's how you make a minestrone.  You have to have Parmesan rinds.  Well, now I'm really disappointed.  I thought you would have like some gourmet queso recipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's queso.  I have many gourmet recipes, but queso is not one.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think of you as like this great gourmet cook.  Oh, so funny.  But you know what?  I bet it's delicious.  We used to have a producer at Tech TV who had a Super Bowl dip.  It was basically a can of chili and a block of Velveeta and you put them in, or no, maybe  it was some cream cheese.  So you put it all in a crock pot and you heat it till it's melted and that's it.  Yep.  And it was the best thing ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  The queso is not bad.  It's just you're like, wow, what am I putting in my body?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not really cheese.  No.  It's like government cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is actually government cheese.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what is this Canadian decision?  Google must alter worldwide search results.  See, there was a Vancouver Tech company, small Canadian firm, which got an injunction against  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is even more dangerous.  This is a worse decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Equus Tech, they make network devices and they sued another company of illegally relabeling  their products and selling its own products under their brand name.  Another kind of selling knockoffs basically.  They left the province, the competitor Datalink, but they continue to do business and you can  Google them, find them and order products from them even though they're illegal, according  to Equus Tech.  So Equus Tech went to court and they got an injunction from the Supreme Court of Canada  that Google may not link to these Datalink, this competitor's web pages and not only must  do so in Canada, but now a court in British Columbia says they've got to do it everywhere  in the world and that since today the Supreme Court upheld that order.  It's the first global de-indexing order, according to a committee.  From Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We liked you, Canada.  You were the nice guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  7-2, the Canadian Supreme Court rejected the idea that this was a threat to free speech.  They say, hey, Google already does this to delist child pornography, hate speech, to  comply with DMCA copyright.  The judge, Rosalie Abella wrote, this is not an order to remove speech that on its face  engages freedom of expression values, it's an order to de-index websites that are in  violation of several court orders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not until it gets to Iran, China, Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute though, we've not to date, she says, accepted that freedom of expression  requires a facilitation of unlawful...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sets a precedent in the structure and the court decision in Iran could be this or pick  your country, I don't want to pick on Iran, but this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's say Erdogan's tame courts in Turkey decides that Erdogan, any cartoon about Erdogan  that is insulting should never be seen again on the internet.  Anywhere.  And forces Google says, by the way, this isn't just Turkey, this is everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or the Danish Mohammed cartoons.  Right.  Or picket, right?  And now there is a precedent in the structure that we will be at the lowest common denominator  of free speech on the internet if this happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a tweet from John Bergmeyer, he's an attorney for Senior Council of Public Knowledge.  He says, Canada joins a list of countries asserting global jurisdiction of the internet.  He says, copyright, maybe RTBF people might cheer this, but there does need to be some  limiting principle.  For instance, I don't want the UK's crappy libel laws to de facto apply worldwide.  Most countries don't have fair use, for instance.  We have fair use in the United States, but that wouldn't be a defense in another country.  So fair use would end in the United States, at least as far as Google's concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what is the enforcement structure here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, because that's really what this hinges on, because usually we just say, oh, that's  a stupid law.  And we ignore it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Probably $2.7 billion fines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, well, and that's, I mean, like, if you look at like the freak out over GDPR, that's  significant fines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they are quite significant and proportional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google gave in to, of course, the right to be forgotten, which is similar.  But the right to be forgotten is only in the EU, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, and indeed they were doing it country by country and that got them and the EU wasn't  crazy about it, but they didn't push back.  They pushed back a little bit where if you are, I think what happens is this, if you're  in, pick a country, France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The French right now want it to be worldwide.  In fact, it's in front of the French Supreme Court right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what I think happened though, I could be wrong here.  I'm sure my chat room will correct me.  I think what happened was at first Google said, we're going to do it only in a country.  That if you search Google in France, you search Google France in France, you won't find it.  But if you search Google UK, you'll find it.  Then I think the French got it.  So no, anybody in France can't find it.  That was the next step of this.  Now this is the further step that no one in the world can find.  And that's just you talk about a higher responsibility.  The judge in Canada should have seen the further implications of this.  And for her to say, oh, well, but speech is fine.  Doesn't matter because it sets a precedent.  The definition of free speech varies tremendously, judge across the world.  So sadly is not Canada.  Right.  I wish it were.  So what is Google's choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They either do that or they get out of Canada.  They can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can't appeal this because the Supreme Court, but they can appeal to the local court about certain strictures or certain things about it.  So there is there is some wiggle room in this.  You know, does Google go to the world?  You know, court in the Hague.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if that gets better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does it go to Vladimir Putin and ask him, is he's going to be our boss?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the upshot of all this?  Do we mean, does Google selectively pull out of countries?  Do they go?  They have to go along with it or they're out of Canada.  Right.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're asking two questions.  One is what they do about Canada and two is what they do about the next country that demands the same thing.  Right.  Right.  So look at what happened with the link tax in Spain.  Google said Spain.  No Google News for you.  No soup for you.  Pulled out.  Right.  When Germany went crazy over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, we know that that had a very negative impact on the amount of traffic driven to Spanish news sites.  Yes, it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cutting off your nose.  It's about your face.  And cost them a lot of money.  Also, when Google got into all the problems with Street View in Germany, they finally said F it and pulled that out.  Is there a minor effort they could they can do here?  No, this is search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's cheer up.  I got I have in my hands and Stacey has in her hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Echo Show.  You know what, though?  It takes forever to download the software.  So plug that puppy in and just get it going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is not mine.  But here's those tabs that you were talking about.  I love that.  Oh, see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the easy opening.  Easy opening package.  Actually, Amazon's always done this with their echoes.  They've been very easy to get into.  Very quick to start buying stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't want to get in the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is Megan Moroney's.  It will be associated with her account.  Just FIIs.  So you'll be calling.  Yeah, you'll be friends with Megan.  Not me.  Good news.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Megan.  You don't have to worry about Leo dropping in at all hours.  This is what it looks like.  So we've already seen reviews on un-gadgeted elsewhere.  It's essentially a kind of junky Amazon Fire tablet.  It's like 1024 by 980 or something.  Seven inch tablet attached to an Echo device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds good.  You'll hear it in a second actually when it pops up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody was saying it sounds better than the old Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  It's much more resonant.  If I had a resonant voice like...  Does it sound like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Baby.  I was like, I cannot do that voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, when a man and a woman decide...  Oh, here we go.  That it's time...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To spend $230 on a connected...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To let Jeff Bezos into the bedroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't return this when I canceled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You canceled it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I canceled it.  Because of...  I just said I'm not going to use it.  I'm not going to use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on, Jeff.  I ordered them all.  We order everything from Amazon because...  Well, it's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a good thing for the kitchen.  I'm trying to convince my mom that she wants one.  I put mine in the kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I ordered two and I'm sending my mom one.  I don't have to convince her.  I'm just sending it to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, see, my mom wouldn't put it anywhere.  Otherwise, it would just sit in a box on her.  It wouldn't even...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, my mom and I FaceTime all the time.  And I just thought, well, this will be easier for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so my mom and I Skype.  But Skyping with my mom is just a nightmare.  Because, you know, she's like, oh, I've got to...  Who am I on Skype?  What's my password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why I do FaceTime.  We started with...  I set her up with Skype and we ended up doing FaceTime.  All right, so let's...  Well, I tried to get her into a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, listen to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is it going to say something?  It goes, oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you show...  Oh, I love that sound.  I do too.  I'm alive sound.  In fact, sometimes...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes I turn off my Wi-Fi network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your Echo device is ready for setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, Echo device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, first I have to put it on our Wi-Fi.  I guess I'll put it on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and your Wi-Fi password is automatically shown.  Or it was in my case, so just know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me not show it.  Monkey...  One...  You know what we really should use, Monkey123, as our Wi-Fi password.  Nobody would ever think we'd actually do that.  Oh, it says, welcome, Jerry Wagle.  Oh, it's not Megan's.  I'm now Jerry Wagle.  Thank you, Jerry, for sacrificing this.  We're going to get another one, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can presume you can wipe it, can't you?  Yeah, it says, it's registered to Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If that's you, type yes, because it's got Jerry's current billing information.  Yes, yes, don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Type no to use a different account.  Yeah, no, that's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alexa, bye.  Bye.  We're in North America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't actually...  It doesn't confirm or ask for your password.  That was kind of what was stunning to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they've always done this.  They've set them up at the factory, right?  And now it's going to do the update, which takes forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you seal the box...  Someone stole my box, exactly.  Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good point.  They're ordering, man.  Yeah, yeah, I'm Jerry Wagle.  Yeah, that's me.  I think I'm going to order a Corvette.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How would they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good point.  It doesn't ask for your password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And maybe it does...  So let's see.  What should I buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's going to update.  So it has three buttons on the top.  It's got plus and minus for volume and then the mute button.  So these are effectively the same buttons that are on the top of the regular Echo cylinder.  On the back...  Yeah, you totally can buy stuff.  On the back, though, there's no connector for anything else.  It's just power.  So you can't connect this as you can with the Echo to anything else.  So it's going to update the device.  Let's install those device updates.  I'm sorry, the screen's so bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your device will restart twice.  It's going to restart twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Powering off.  All right, well, I'm just going to put this over here.  And we'll let it...  Thank you.  I really appreciate Anthony Nielsen came running in with a handheld camera so that...  We've got more.  Who's that for?  Here's Megan.  So if we want to open another one...  No, no, we'll save this so that you can get another unboxing later.  You can have them talk to each other.  Mine are coming, too.  All right.  So while it's updating, while it's updating, we'll do some other stuff.  And then what we want to do is do a call between you and me, right?  Well, that's what I would want to do.  So you can do things like Echo, call dad, show the front door camera, play top songs, show my calendar, set a timer for three minutes, show my phone.  I like to show...  So I have Nest cams.  Would it show the Nest cam on this?  I think it would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might if Nest integrates.  And I know it works with the Ring.  Yeah, Nest may not have integrated with them yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, because it's Google.  Yeah.  It does.  It works with Ring, Honeywell, Arlo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Logitech cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I can...  Oh, my August doorbell that I hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, but I can say go to the Ring doorbell.  So that's good.  So it'll go to my Ring.  Ring is the sponsor, I should mention.  I would like it to use those Nest cams.  I just bought some Nest cams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I started talking about this while you were setting up because I thought there was going to be like a long pause.  I should have known better.  But they were talking on the chat room about wiring Ring doorbells, sponsor alert, to old houses and old wiring.  Yeah.  We're just going to say this because I did this.  So don't do this.  I blew out my doorbell transformer because it was older.  So if you're going to wire these video doorbells, spring for the 24 volt transformer because the 16 volt is what most houses have.  I'm sure it says that somewhere in the manual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  But who reads the manual?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's my pro tip to you guys installing doorbells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, I owe an apology to Ring because I made a snarky comment a few weeks ago about them not being a sponsor anymore.  Oh, yeah.  I got a call from the founder of Ring and said, what are you talking about?  Of course.  And they bought a whole bunch more ads.  So I apologize.  Hey, Rick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Getting the call from Jamie.  Jamie called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Literally, I talked to Jamie.  Jamie said, first of all, you don't remember me, do you?  I said, no.  He said, I've been on Twitter because Jason Kailakandis, I didn't remember this, but years ago auctioned off a Twitter ad.  And Jamie won for his first product, which I don't even remember.  It was an app or something.  Doorbot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doorbot.  It was terrible.  But Jamie will admit that.  He learned a lot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then he went on Shark Tank.  Right.  But anyway, and then he founded Ring later.  So I said, oh, yeah, I kind of remember that.  So he said, I'm a huge fan.  Of course we love you.  You're...  Anyway, so I apologize.  I was snarky for no good reason.  Did you get in trouble with your wife?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Of course I did because she sells the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like Leo's probably in trouble with Lisa a lot.  Pretty much all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean...  No, Lisa's really, you know what?  Lisa's great.  I should be in trouble all the time.  And she's an extraordinarily patient person.  For instance, you know, when you marry somebody who's on the air every day, all day, it's probably, you know, you don't sign up for this, but inevitably I'm going to talk about her as I am right now.  And she's not crazy about that, but she tolerates it.  She's very kind.  She says, do you always have to use me as an example?  Well, she's your life.  She said, well, at least tell the truth.  I exaggerate for purposes of humor.  Anyway, you don't need to get an arm marital.  Geez.  So that's a queso dip.  You don't need to put your chip in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, so before we went to the Amazon break there, the Canada case, I added to the rundown.  There's now one in Arizona where a judge ordered articles taken down in the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At least it just blow me a kiss.  I love you, sweetheart.  So, yeah, so this is just this is a snowball.  We're going to see.  It is.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, Amazon is announcing a smart home camera control with this.  So I guess thank you, Scooter X, for developers.  You will be able to.  I don't know.  My machine just turned itself off for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  They launched this last week.  OK, this is what everybody is using.  Well, I don't they have Nest has to make the decision to integrate because they're Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, they want to work with Google Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you can use the Nest on the Echo.  That was a big deal when that happened last year.  OK, we're still updating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's five minute video after that.  It's going to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to watch a five minute video.  So let me ask you, are you going to turn on drop in?  Is there anyone you know well enough to allow them to turn in turn on your camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I if it's in the kitchen, I would let my parents do it.  You know, I would never have it drop in in my bedroom, though.  That's just crazy.  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess you don't use your kitchen the same way we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want I think I think we're heading to GMI.  GMI.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's a big kitchen.  There's a lot of room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now it's in my office right now.  And I would let like a colleague drop in on my office.  Drop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So for those who don't know is the weirdest feature.  In fact, I was talking about this the other day in our editorial meeting.  I said Amazon turns this stuff on just to see if somebody wants to use it.  They're taking the metrics.  It's all about data gathering.  They don't know if somebody's going to want this.  But the idea is that you can turn on the camera on this thing without warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, here, if you let's see if this works.  Oh, OK.  I just realized this.  I'm sorry. I just got too excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to have what she's having.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, hold on.  I'm going to see if I can drop in from my phone app onto the show that's here in my office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to obviously open it up and give permission.  And what I'm curious about is, is there any could you is there a warning to you?  To you as the drop in?  Can you say, yeah, can you say, oh, no, no, don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what you can do is, OK, here's what it looks like on my app.  You get this little bar in the conversation saying, oh, is my screen too bright?  Yeah, I was I was shooting video, so I needed a bright screen for that.  OK, see the drop in bar?  Yeah, drop in bar. OK, so let's drop in on somebody.  I get the choice of Dottie, which is the bedroom by Echo that's downstairs and my Echo show.  These two, how would you drop in on an audio only device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me tell you, because this is a cool feature they announced two days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is the intercom.  Intercom. Oh, so we were my husband and I were actually using this to be like.  What's up? Come down. It's dinner time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're definitely going to use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have we have echoes in every single room and the light turns green when you drop in on somebody and it chimes.  So if I drop in and no one's I can try to see what happens on the show.  I so I could say like, Alisa, dinner's ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on in. And it would go and oh, that'd be so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Here we go. Let's see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I was a kid, my mom got so tired of yelling upstairs, dinner's ready that she bought a bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, see here. See, you know, my show. Oh, there I am.  I consider myself the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I ended that for audio quality purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what it did is it it showed me a blurry version and then I would have had to touch it.  And if I touched it, then the camera turns on.  But it does see the blurry version.  OK, I could have also verbally said that's not so bad.  So you have to give permission.  There's no drawback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if someone else wants to drop in on me and let's see how I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what I don't know is how to add drop in had other people to drop in yet.  That's that's why I about not being at the device when you don't want to talk to somebody.  You just say I can't talk right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, remember those days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't talk right now.  Wow.  Or like, I mean, it's not like a jerk thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just like.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your daughter says that to you.  Are you going to accept that answer?  Well, it's my daughter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If like there's an echo in a room and she's got a boy up there, I'm going to be like, well, excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Coming on up.  This changes.  This changes the dynamic considerably.  Does your daughter have a boy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's going to because she wants ours and she has a Sonos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But since the echo, it's a much better UI for her because she doesn't even like having a smartphone.  This is really interesting.  She hates charging.  I haven't charging a phone.  Yeah.  So she just like hangs out and text people on her computer.  This is going to change when she moves around more.  But right now, she just echoes and does everything that way.  And I think it would be really cool if she could just go to the phone and just like, you know,  I don't know.  Did you ever see the Dick Van Dyke intercom episode?  Oh, no.  It's called All About Eavesdropping.  Let me see if I can get it to play here.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  Let me see if I can get it to play here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Somehow I will get rid of that other man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's apparently the neighbors intercom starts...  You know I hate to...  Oh, there it is.  The neighbors intercom starts playing back in the Van Dyke household.  And they start listening in.  Oh, I can't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Echo wants me.  Introducing...  Here it is.  You want to watch a short video?  It says brief.  It's five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd rather watch Van Dyke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Introducing Amazon Echo Show.  It's everything you love about a stellar.  But now she can show you things.  Play movies from Amazon Video, view your photos, or see what's on your calendar and to-do lists.  Is it too bright?  And now there's a new way to be together.  Make hands-free video calls to friends and family.  Like this.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I apologize for everybody at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can also message or call someone on their supported Echo device or the SLA app on their phone.  Ready for some music?  Echo should fill the room with bold stereo sound.  That looks like Mary-Tamora.  Show today's most popular songs.  Here are popular songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, see, there's a new word, show.  Now you can show because you've got a screen.  And with Amazon Music, you can follow the bones of your favorite songs.  Oh, this is great.  I'm now going to replace all my echoes and dots.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll live with it just for a little bit.  Yeah, all right.  It's also a lot more expensive, right?  It's like $230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you can buy two.  If you buy two, you get a hundred bucks off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did that because I bought one for my mom.  I think she'll like this.  And you know what?  You're right.  The speaker is much better.  Isn't it?  It's actually very good.  And it just shows you how much we're all in here.  Jerry bought one.  Megan bought one.  I bought a couple.  Here's the thing I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're not going to watch a movie on this.  You're going to watch a movie on your main screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  What it really is is what you saw with the, I think the songs and like weather reports  and stuff like that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, CNBC actually just did a skill where you can show the news.  Like again, think about those kitchen TVs people used to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or you have it in the bathroom or...  Used to?  Used to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  The kitchen TVs people apparently still have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, Jerry, do you want me to start a 30-day free trial of Echo on Music Unlimited?  Just remember to cancel it.  They're still...  Okay.  I'm loading it.  Please wait.  Now what is it doing?  So here's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do we get, how do we connect for...  Call Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there you go.  This is the interface that you see all the time.  Echo Show is ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody's already calling me.  It's Jerry.  Hey, Jerry.  How do I, what do I...  I'm very confused.  Oh, he's calling you from his app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have Jerry's device, but Jerry's calling Jerry's device.  I'm so confused.  I can't, I can't...  Hi, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jerry's calling from the Echo app, SLA app.  I'm great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the quality on this is fantastic.  It is.  And you see that this is my picture.  So it's kind of a wide angle picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can see Anthony and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Anthony's the camera guy taking it on the other way.  You know what?  That looks pretty good.  Yeah, it does.  Who's that?  Lisa, we're going to put this in the bedroom, in the kitchen, in the kitchen.  In the kitchen, in the closet, in the bathroom.  We're putting this in every...  Is this a drop in?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, this is a call.  This is not a drop in.  Or is it a drop in?  No, actually no, it's a drop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it a drop in or a call?  I think you just drop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jerry's saying it's a drop in.  So that's just like a call.  I don't have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now what happens...  No, you have to answer a call.  If you tell someone to call, you have to actually answer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is, this is...  So cool.  Cool.  All right.  Bye, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you have to touch the screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had to touch my screen.  So I don't think this is...  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says he did a drop in though.  Right.  So when you drop in, he gets a blurry vision.  Yeah, we saw the blurry of him too.  But when you call someone and you can actually call people in your own house, although I'm  not sure why you'd want to, you can actually...  How would I call you?  You would say call Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I were your friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't know.  Kevin and I, and I can't...  I was going to say, I don't remember how Kevin and I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The default screen just sits there and it shows the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The fingerprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's an ad.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is really interesting.  This is what I wanted you to see.  Is it news?  So there's notifications.  It's news.  You get these notifications and you can set it up in settings.  If you pull down from the top screen, you'll...  So yeah, pull down and see settings.  If you go to settings, you can change the home screen is what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I know how Ginger Rogers felt.  So I can tie this to Bluetooth.  That's nice.  And then I can see what my home screen can do.  Home card preferences.  Rotate continuously.  That's the default.  You can just rotate once.  And then I can have notifications from other services.  Is left...  Is right.  Is that on or off?  That's not communicative at all.  But I presume that's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Otherwise it'd be dark, I'll bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Boy, yeah, that's a big difference.  Upcoming events.  Yeah, drop-ins.  See who's available from your contacts list.  Is Stacey in your contact list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and I don't know how to add people to my contacts list.  This is what...  I didn't know I had an Amazon contacts list.  Oh, you go to your...  Okay, you go to your Echo app.  Go to your Echo app, Jerry.  To the little people sign.  And that's your contacts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it uses your phone's address book to find people you know who have an Echo device or  SLA app.  These are the people I can reach.  So I don't actually have anyone from Twitter in my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't have your phone number either for obvious reasons.  I think that was part of the court order.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  We shouldn't be doing this show at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not allowed to be within five feet of you.  We'll move the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Carsten should have it or I can send it to Carsten if Jerry wants to give me his contact  information or however...  Oh, Jerry did it.  Oh no, he sent me his Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So add Jerry.  So we want to call you.  I want to call you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, hold up.  This requires like dexterity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm looking at the newly redesigned Google News.  It's kind of strange that Google would redesign a product like Google News that I don't even  think like they even anybody knows they still do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's a real problem here for us.  A real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Search for Google.  OK, in this search bar, the search bar right there.  Search for Google.  Google.  OK.  All right.  And you'll see, oh, this is pretty.  It's Google stories eventually.  Yeah.  Now scroll down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  TechCrunch, Fortune, Scroll, Scroll, Scroll, CNN, CNBC.  Go all the way to the bottom.  All the bottom.  Yeah.  The selection and placement of stories on this page are determined automatically.  There's no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's it.  You get one screen load.

So can I call if I said.  And by the way, I don't know what we're going to do about this.  You have to rename it to something else.  Oh, I. So I apologize to everybody whose echoes are going off at this point.  Oh, yeah.  Call Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't find a contact matching Stacey Higginbotham to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the speaker's much better.  And it filled this room, didn't it?  Oh, oh, oh, and it's putting the lyrics on.  Oh, oh, we're going to resume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Jesus, karaoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we can play this without violating any rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's some civil rights that are being violated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seriously, will this do karaoke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it kind of is, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but you're saying a lot with the voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you mean, oh, yeah.  OK, hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Without the without the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got a lot.  Listen to Bohemian Rhapsody karaoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bohemian Rhapsody isn't included with Prime,  but is available with Amazon Music Unlimited.  Would you like to learn more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here, I want you blow.  It stopped on a very good lyric.  Come on.  Listen to the Star Spangled Banner karaoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Star Spangled Banner, United States  National Anthem by the United States Marine Band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's not playing the lyrics.  Well, here I'm sorry, Alexa, stop.  I used to work in radio whenever the Star Spangled Banner  started playing at an event, you couldn't interrupt it.  Are you serious?  So we would always try to get out of the event.  That's why the baseball games, you never hear the Star  Spangled Banner, because once it starts, we got to respect.  You got to keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So try show my audio books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just show my audio books.  Well, it would show mine, but I don't know if you have audio books, Cherry.  Oh, right, Cherry.  Just show my audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see a book title, but I don't know if you have audio.  Your book library is empty.  Buy audio books.  Is it audible dot com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Man, if European Union ever gets a hold of Amazon, they're dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. How's traffic?  The fastest route takes about 15 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not.  I'm not getting a map. That's what I was hoping for.  Oh, OK. But I just got.  A picture of people on the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got clip art. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you just ask the news, what it will show you, what we'll show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's Stacey's flash briefing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just a normal flash briefing.  Oh, but what do you get in it?  You might get more information on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just getting in here.  But CNBC just announced something today where they're going to put clips  and actual content. Yeah.  So stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's go.  Show me a photo of a hot dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I get the reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, but wait a minute.  There's. Oh, yes.  I can have prime photos in here.  So it says to set up prime photos, download the app.  That's interesting.  So you could use this as a as a picture frame  because I could if I had prime photos and I have photos in it,  I could ask for specific photos.  That's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was trying to figure out because there is an option to use  your personal photos, even if they're not stored on Amazon.  Poor doctor. I can't figure out how to get her Amazon Echo is going off

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  every time we say hit that microphone.  I don't. Yeah.  Just muted for the time being. And I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will show you your calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who can I call, Jerry?  Do you know anybody I can call?  But do they have their set up? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, Jerry, do you want to be like my friend  and tell me your phone ring your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll only ring your echo.  Echo doesn't have echo to phone calling.  Only has echo to echo calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I know.  But it's not recognizing him in my contacts as someone who has an echo device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, I wonder how. Oh, Jerry, did you send her the address  you use for your Amazon account? You did.  And so somehow Amazon has a way of recognizing whether you have an echo or not.  And apparently it's not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And maybe it just does it like once a day.  So maybe it's not continually running that call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. OK, but hey, we get the idea.  I was able to call Jerry. That worked.  That worked great. And it is a fairly wide angle camera.  I have to say, I was worried because I read the reviews that said  this is a terrible screen, but it's not a terrible screen.  And so it's actually for what for where it is and how it how it's positioned.  It's it looks great.  I am I'm I'm actually more stoked about this than I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it is through the phone number that you use for your echo account.  I'm reading the instructions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, he gave you the same phone number he uses for his echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He gave me his email. I didn't get a phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't get a phone number.  So that maybe she's going to send you he's going to send you his phone number,  I guess, because you have to add that she has to add your phone number  to her contacts list.  Yes. And there's a way.  Oh, look in your look at his email. It's in the signature.  Oh, he's one of those people who doesn't mind if people call him.  Wow. By the way, am I stealing a number if I say that  Facebook went to two billion mentally active users this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is one of your numbers. I'm sorry.  It's OK. I'm going to.  I'm not going to touch the other ones.  You're a smart man.  Isn't that amazing? Two billion.  And Harry McCracken in Fast Company did a very good article  about the growth team and how they have worked  to get to two billion.  What I didn't know is they stalled out at 70 million.  They thought for a while, that's all we're going to get.  Remember, Facebook started 13 years ago  and it's grown to two billion users in that 13 years,  but it wasn't a steady growth.  So, in fact, the growth team was created when they hit that plateau  of 70 million users.  And it was those guys who came up with all these interesting ways  of creating  growth, I guess.  Some smart people.  How Facebook used science and empathy to reach two billion users.  Really nice long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they'll get accused, of course, of of.  Manipulating people's brains.  Oh, yeah.  Wait till the EU gets a hold of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what I liked?  One of the head of the growth team today said, we don't consider big data.  You know, we don't think it's all that growth is all about big data.  He says growth is all about empathy and the data gives us more empathy,  more understanding of people.  And that's how we grow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's some other numbers in the next web story that 175  million people use the love reaction every day.  Eight hundred million people like something every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really wanted to use the pride flag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was there for Jerry and I are connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I heard a bing.  OK, so should should.  Oh, there's a message.  Oh, there was a message for Jerry from Stacey.  So I can now can I call you?  How do I call you? Just say drop in on Stacey.  This drop in on Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey Higginbottom, right? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you see what I see?  See, I see twig and you should see blurry me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see. I don't see any nudity at all.  I'm very disappointed.  Here's my.  And then, oh, it's cool how you come in.  That's cool.  It kind of doesn't just pop in, you slowly fade in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I guess that gives you time to stop picking your nose or to grab a shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, here we go. Here we go. Here we go.  I think this is a good camera.  I think it's a good view.  It's at least as good as it's not quite as good as a Skype view is.  But it's like, can you can you compare that?  Flip back and forth between our view via Skype and our view?  Not you, Stacey Carston.  So it's I think Skype's obviously a lot better, better camera.  But I think for a video call, this is usable.  Oh, it's roughly the same.  It's roughly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  World's fair quality. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  World's fair. Yeah, it is.  Isn't this 1964 World's New York World's Fair?  Here we are. AT&T demonstrated the camera phone.  Finally, here we are.  50 years later, we actually have a camera phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey looks more dubious on this than she does on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. I'm going to turn around.  So Stacey, so you can see me just so you can see what it looks like.  Now, I'm well lit. Remember, we're I'm in a lit studio.  So I have good quality.  And actually, when I turn it around, you look pretty good.  This is good.  Yeah, this is very good.  This would be a great.  And the nice thing is you're not holding something.  You just relax.  So anyway, Stacey, I got this pitch I'd like to give you for my new IOT business.  I think this is good.  I would. I'm all right.  I don't mean to do an ad for the Amazon show,  but I'm impressed.  What do you think, Stacey? Are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the video calling is good.  And here, can I hang up now or should we keep doing this?  You can hang up. OK.  So let's hang up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The quality is very good, too, I have to say.  And we'll have to see over a longer period of time.  Oh, gives you the time of the call.  Oh, it's got pretty pretty picture.  I think I would want this everywhere in my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the little notification there, Stacey or Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's probably a message from Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, you've got a lot of notifications now.  Stacey's home.  Well, I'm not. Why am I not getting that?  Oh, I think I turned that off. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said, yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and you can put do not disturb on.  Now it's not a physical shutter. Oh.  Are you calling me again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just called you by exit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  Hi, Stacey. Are you there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it turns the volume up at the beginning of the calls  because I had turned the volume all the way down.  Oh, so you can hear that I'm going, Stacey.  Yep. Yeah, that's here.  I am turning it back down again. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, this is cool. All right.  All right. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.  I didn't mean to call you again.  I don't really want to talk to you. So goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, you can turn the video off and you can end the call.  So two options there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just tap that video offer and call.  All right. This is cool.  This is cool. Now, the intercom.  How does the intercom work?  That's not the intercom. That's drop in.  Or is it drop in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here, let me let me say that's drop in.  That's the same technology.  But I could also if I drop in on an intercom, if I have to accept, though.  Jeff, do you want to be you've got an echo right with you, right?  No, no, he's not at home.  Oh, because you're at your office.  I can go and run and grab a dot and then plug it in and show you.  The green light goes around and it starts listening.  So I can drop in on my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jerry's going to go in the other office and intercom me, right?  OK, there you go. All right.  Try. He says I'm going to try.  You can do it. Can you do it from the Echo app?  He's got an echo in his office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't need that. No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't eat that. That's her echo.  Oh, my God. The dog just ate the echo.  I presume and we'll have to go deeper into this.  We're going to do a full review on the new screensavers,  but I presume there's a way to say  these are off hours.  Don't call me in two a.m.  Dr. Mom, please. I beg of you.  I think it's. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Drop in on Stacey.  Oh, somebody's calling me to see this is.  But is this intercom?  This is not good because I have to say yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's Jerry's home. So that's Jerry calling you. Right.  But let's put it. I have to press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got to say answer. You got to click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to say answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so it's not an intercom.  It's not.  Drop Echo.  I mean, hey,  that's got a lot.  Drop in on Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey Higgins, right? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make bacon. But this is the same thing we did before.  This is no different than calling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, if you call me, I have to answer it.  If you drop it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm hearing your audio, though, without you doing anything.  So this is the intercom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Well, this intercom and drop in are kind of the same thing.  The difference is you only let certain echoes into your drop in list

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and drop in without it.  So you don't have to accept to hear the audio.  You have to accept to hear it to see the video.  But we don't have to.  So so that's why it's an intercom.  I could just say drop in on Stacey and then you'll hear my voice and we can talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Except for after the show,  I'm going to not let Jerry have drop in privileges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I would. It looks like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK. Can you see my screen?  Yeah, yeah. So you can call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Jerry, that was your phone number. I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all right. Nobody saw it.  And if they did, Jerry, just say hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jerry, I'm sorry. OK.  There it looks like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Well, I'm just, you know, on first glance,  I think this is pretty compelling.  It's too bad it's so expensive because one of the reasons I do have echoes  in every room is because the dot was so inexpensive and I could put dots,  you know, I could get 40 bucks.  I could buy five dots or whatever. Not that many. Three dots.  Now all of our echoes are absolutely.  Say again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So can I mention this was on the topic of voice?  Can I mention some other voice stuff? Yeah, move on.  So yesterday, John Borthwick's Beta Works, you know, the Beta Works folks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Held a voice summit showing off  they had an incubator, a beta camp, as they call it, being Beta Works,  with eight voice companies just in this field.  And just a few of them to mention, which were really interesting.  One is called John Dunn.  Two folks left the company that does what was the AI company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Viv. Viv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whatever that Amy company is, right?  And so they did they did they did a demo where you give your  agent an instruction and it calls and uses voice with human beings.  So they demoed.  You want to find out whether this certain florist has peonies.  So ask the so and so florist whether it has peonies.  And it called off. We listened to it and it says, Hello, I am calling.  Peonies.  And they say, no, we don't.  Thank you very much. And then it reports back to you. No.  Then they said, find the peonies.  And so it could call 20 florists in New York.  Then it comes back with the answer. I found peonies at this address.  Really interesting.  So you have the sense that the two agents will start because, you know,  the company has its phone mail jail and you have your own agent.  And they're just going to negotiate with each other until they come to peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was Facebook M's initial idea.  Remember that? Yes. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is that actually happening is really to spark people to another company  I found really fascinating called Neurolex dot AI.  Brilliant guys. Jim Schwable, founder.  They have found this.  There's there's scientific research to this effect.  And they're and they're and they're commercializing this.  That voice samples are effective devices  to help the diagnosis of especially psychiatric conditions.  Wow. So imagine if they took this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you guys. They finally know what drug Stacey's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's all. Yes.  And it's all kind of signals.  How many words you use, what kinds of words you use,  how fast you talk and so on and so forth.  Just fascinating data in there.  So I've of course, subconsciously stuck up my hand and I asked the founder,  have you used voice samples from the president of the United States? Oh boy.  And he didn't want to answer.  So which means he has. Yes, of course he has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he doesn't want to share the result with you.  So you can imagine what the result must have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's another company called Earplay, which you can use today  where it's the old schtick of doing the story that that you then have a place  and it gives you choices. It's like the like the old.  What was the game we used to play where you were the wizard in the jungle with?  Oh, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, the simpler one. Oh,  it just came out open source.  And you play, you got all excited about it.  No, early.  So so.  Was it an adventure?  It gives you adventure.  It gives you a choice.  And how does this do stories or how does this do?  I think what journalistically is interesting.  How does it do?  Don't skip that. I know that.  Give me this instead. It gives you a choice.  Real quickly, a couple of spoken layer, which is a company  I like a lot of like for a long time.  They're a structure to add human voice to words.  So they've got there's just tons of stuff.  A third of the news on Google Home News, they do.  And so you can get the New Yorker human voice.  They have a structure to sell out and do that.  So there's some other companies there.  But I just wanted to mention that this whole  voice thing is fascinating.  Dennis Crowley from Foursquare was there, Foursquare,  which we talked about the story a few weeks ago,  has really become a tremendous data company.  So Dennis was there and he confessed.  I don't think it was Chatham House Rule, it was stream.  So I hope this is OK.  That is his young child.  First four words, the fourth word the child learned was a scullop.  Oh, boy. And then somebody else said, oh, yeah, I hear that all the time.  That's just quite common. No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That amazing. I don't know if that's good or bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought you'd say that. That cool. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, at the end of this year, we'll know from the Social Security  database research, I don't know if it comes out immediately.  We'll be able to track the popularity of that name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you wouldn't name your kid that.  In fact, I would think it would be the opposite.  The popularity would plummet to zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying.  But you'll be able to see that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just don't name your kid Echo or computer either,  because those are the alternative things.  I am I'm very excited now. You know what?  I'm sorry. I'm feeling kind of bad.  I think I might. I got two, one for my mom.  I think I might keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why? Just just give one.  Well, so this is the same thing the nucleus has.  I want one by my bedside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what this is what don't drop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got I know. Don't let anyone drop in on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no family can drop in on that when they can see anything.  They can only talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, even then, can they listen?  Do they not hear until you say, OK, no, they can listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can like if you wanted to hear my kitchen right now,  I would drop in on it and you can hear whatever's happening down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, you don't want that.  Mom and dad are fighting or or the alternative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I really feel like we are entering.  Maybe it's maybe I think I need Japanese Xanax because I'm getting  I feel like we're entering a very.  I'm worried about two things.  One, all those things you just described, Jeff, yeah, they sound really cool.  But I also feel like we're going to be in this very rapid period of innovation  where there's lots of stuff that we don't really know  how to incorporate into our human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, and I lost.  So the founder of of of schwebel from Neurolex  so was because I asked about the privacy implications here.  And he said, you know, when if I call you and leave a message on your phone,  you own the copyright to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't this Neurolex thing.  Let's ask about this, because this is a big deal.  When you have these sorts of things, how are they approaching FDA  approval if they need it or be even peer reviewed?  Because like a lot of these are saying you're nuts

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  without any.  Yes, here's here's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So here's the thing.  So, yes, they're going to go for FDA, he said.  And if I get anything wrong, please let me know and we'll correct it next week.  He said they're planning to go for FDA, but for the earliest stage product,  they'll just go for anxiety.  And and and I can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello, Leo. This is your echo.  You're sounding very nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could trigger your Fitbit to do the breathing exercise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it could. It could.  That would be so.  Ariana Huffington comes on and tells you to go to sleep.  But it could it could have an impact on your medication.  So it's on a consumer level. It tells you about you.  It probably will not ever diagnose you.  It will be a B2B to the doctor.  OK, the doctor gets the ability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not the only thing that's making me nervous.  No, I agree. It's take that.  And then what is apparently happening right now, which is massive cyber warfare  and the sudden rise of the amoral hacker,  whether it's a state or a sponsored organization or an individual.  And this is what we're seeing in the Ukraine.  And you have those two together.  Suddenly, I am a little worried.  I have all these devices that are listening and talking to me.  And then I have all these bad guys.  And there seem to be there seems to be no check on these guys.  And I feel like we live in of we're heading towards  a classic kind of dystopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they're going to know things about you.  This is where we've discussed this many times.  You know, I argue that you can't control knowledge.  You can't control the gathering of information,  but you have to control the use of it.  And so does it become illegal to do a psychiatric analysis of us on this show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the chat room's been doing that for years.  Yes. So this is nothing new to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dr. Bob has certified us long. My God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She. Wait, she has not certified me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it is me. No, no, no, no.  She loves you. It's me.  It's all about me and a little bit about Jeff.  I just I have issues.  I mean, of course, there's a solution to it.  It's to not buy these devices and it's to maybe move somewhere where there's no Internet.  But I'm just very I feel like we're.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, there's you're missing an obvious solution.  Hey, we set rules about how we can use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's what I'm saying. You use the days.  Dr. Bob says it's not illegal, just unethical.  And that's right. And and and and it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, ethics. You subdued.  Believe me, ethics have gone out the window.  That's why this this growing group of amoral hackers.  See, what's what's it turns out, the only thing that's really prevented  people from being completely malicious to one another is society and norms.  And there we've raised a generation, I think, of people who don't have anything  to hold them back anymore. No.  They feel so they're they they suffer from extreme anomie and misogyny.  They don't feel like a part of society and the whole generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but enough goes within it.  Yes. So, Leo, I recommend highly, highly.  We don't have time for this. I don't think we're going to full detail this week.  But I wrote a piece while while I was gone on media manipulation,  data and society, which is a think tank in New York run by data boy,  released a spectacular report going exactly where you're going.  The catalogs, the bad guys and who it is and how they're doing it  and why they're doing it.  So it's everything from gamer gators to the so-called men's right movement,  to the alt right, to terrorists, to trolls.  So I read that. Then I read and you should read this,  but you're going to get really paranoid.  I linked to it in my post.  The NATO handbook on Russian information warfare.  It is a script for what we're going through.  I'm not saying the Russians are doing it all,  but I'm saying that the techniques are they're learning from each other.  Then I read a Rand report on Russian information warfare.  And you're right, Leo, these these these nefarious actors are out there  and they will be able to exploit certain things.  You don't need the whole society.  You enormous society may indeed find it repugnant.  That doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  And then and then you get in the mode of, oh, my God,  something bad could happen. Kill the Alexis first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, read the cover story in the June.  Wired magazine.  How an entire nation became Russia's test bed for cyber war.  That was a great story. Andy Greenberg.  This is essentially the story of what's going on in Ukraine.  Yep. And Russia's the same techniques.  The Russian state hackers have cut the electricity.  In some cases, they have  faked election results.  They have sewed fake news.  They have perfected cyber war, a wide ranging variety of cyber warfare  techniques. And Ukraine is the test bed.  A, because they're already in a war with the Ukraine.  I'm sorry, Ukraine, not the Ukraine.  They're in a war with Ukraine.  But B, because they want to see it's an experiment  to see how well these things can work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we're the experiment, too.  So let me give you a couple. Well, this is in, for instance,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in Greenberg's article, he points out that they did something in the Ukraine  election, which they then duplicated in our election shortly thereafter.  Right. But we're also seeing this week the Petia Ransomware,  which comes out of, as far as we can tell, an accounting firm in Ukraine,  which was either hacked or which I think is the most likely case,  or themselves or bad guys.  We know that a lot of ransomware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was Rosneft a target of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what's interesting.  A lot of ransomware is coming out of the Ukraine to fund their cyber warfare  against Russia. In any event, this is a very this it's  it seems likely that Petia is not created by an individual,  but created by a state sponsored group.  But it's hard to say. And it's brought down some very big  like MERSC. Yes. Very Merck, Merck and MERSC  in hospitals. And this is and this is  want to cry times 10.  And I think this is going to be the year we look back and say,  oh, crap, this is when it all started to go downhill.  And by the way, this one also takes advantage of a number of NSA discovered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So should the NSA, what's your opinion and Steve's opinion?  Should the NSA just go ahead and reveal how all this stuff works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Immediately reveal all the exploits.  So should the FBI.  So should the CIA.  Because at this point, everybody has to have a chance to patch.  The problem is that people don't patch.  So, for instance, this Petra, if you patched in your all of your version,  all of your Windows machines, if you patched them in March,  you wouldn't be vulnerable to it.  But people don't update them.  All it takes is one computer that hasn't been updated in a hospital,  for instance, where they can't update all the computers to infect  the rest of the network.  And so there's a risk revealing these, because as soon as it's revealed,  it will be exploited.  The problem is much of it has been revealed.  This is a this is a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and this is it's one thing to tell people to patch.  It's another thing to talk about how how to implement patches.  And I was actually at an industrial IOT event for Honeywell  and their plants that refine oil and make drugs and all these other things.  And there was a conversation about patching because all of these people  realize it's a big deal, but they're all they're like,  if I patch something, a machine on my line  and I do it without the vendors say so, I void my warranty.  I can also break things further down the line by having other partners  stuff go down because it'll suddenly not work with other equipment  on the line or sensors.  And for them, it's not just  up until about now, their risk analysis has always been,  well, I can't patch because I can't afford the potential downtime  without support from my vendors, you know.  And now they're like, do I take the downtime?  Do I run the risk of having downtime because of Petra?  Or do I run the risk of downtime because of patches?  So it's it's not as simple in every situation as saying, patch your crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I know there are companies that are stockpiling Bitcoin  so that when they do get bid, they have something to pay the ransom with.  Now, I have to point out that Petra, at least the main variant of Petra,  in order to pay the ransom, you had to use an email address  to a German email company and then the hacker would then send you the thing.  The German email company closed that account.  So pay all you want.  You're never going to get unencrypted.  So I don't know, Stacey, you tell me out of business or patch your machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, like, but literally up until probably last year  for a lot of companies.  Their risk analysis was very different.  Yeah, Sony is famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sony's famous for that.  So Sony said, oh, yeah, it's too expensive.  We understand we're just going to absorb the.  And I have a feeling that they might change their tune after what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the next thing is not all of these places like hospitals.  I talked to hospital CISOs and most hospitals.  One HIPAA requires you have some sort of IT administrator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can't do it. No, I know they can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are IT administrators like a nurse.  Well, and they even small, even then, if they update, they have to recertify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so they can't just update all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's that.  And then there's also equipment is still being built  and specked out for like 15 years.  I know it's really scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, like, no, no, it's just there's no obvious answer to this.  That's why I'm feeling so dystopian today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we can do it.  OK, I know that I am super positive, but I it's Stacey the Riveter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Stacey, here's the obvious to the optimist.  Here's the problem.  You can solve the technical problems.  You can't solve the psychological.  So you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is what was exciting about the industrial thing.  And this is where I think it gets really interesting.  So their mindset is very different than the IT world.  I talked to this guy and he was like,  if your guys on the factory floor see a faulty ladder, they know what to do.  But do they know what to do in the case of, you know, in the case  it was a US empty USB drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have to train people. I agree. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but I'm talking about the psychology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I know that, you know, yes,  people are always going to be conned and people are always your weakest link.  But there are actually once you recognize that and start thinking  that you can train against it and that you can build kind of some sort of wall  around people. And I don't mean an actual wall or even a software wall. But  right now, we think about cybersecurity and IT vulnerabilities  almost entirely as technical.  And we need to be thinking of them as humans.  And you see Google doing this a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But and that's one narrow slice of it.  But remember that these attacks also attack the power grid.  They also distribute fake news. They also attack election results.  So it's more than just say, train the worker to understand what to do.  This is the problem is that these state actors are willing to act  in a scale unprecedented.  Here's an article from Bleeping Computer quoting a trend micro story.  This is a website  and there are a number of these.  They're underground fake news marketplaces.  This one's in Russian.  And at these websites, customers can purchase services ranging from  discrediting journalists to promoting street protests,  from stuffing online polls to manipulating a decisive course of action,  such as election for a mere four hundred thousand dollars,  which is nothing to a country, let alone, I mean, a billion,  like a billion. George Soros could do this.  You can completely undermine an election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So please allow me to read from the NATO, from a Russian paper  quoted in the NATO handbook, quote,  The main aim of information psychological conflict is regime change  by the means of influence on mass consciousness of the population,  directing people so that the population of the victim country is induced  to support the aggressor acting against its own interests.  So it sounds familiar.  You go. It says here to another paper says  information has become the same kind of weapon as a missile, a bomb and so on.  But it allows you to use a very small amount of energy or matter  to begin monitoring control processes whose matter and energy parameters  are many orders of magnitude larger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's kind of my point, which is, yes, it's it's attacking a hospital  with malware and ransomware, but it's also a lot of other activities.  And if you look at the Ukraine, read this article, I know you both did.  I'm saying to the audience, read this article in Cover Story of Wired  because it's kind of not this one, the cover story of Wired by Greenberg.  It's kind of. Well, it's chilling.  It's it's all about how this Russian stuff is chilling.  Yes. Yeah. Andy Greenberg.  And so you have a state actor and there's probably more than one,  but we can at least pinpoint Russia that has the will and the means  to destroy a country, in this case, Ukraine.  And and frankly, I don't even I think they're holding back.  I think they're pulling their punches because a lot of this is just a test tube  for something they don't want to they don't want to reveal all everything  they can do because what they're really interested in is making sure  all these weapons work.  And at some point, I suspect  they will apply these for real  en masse, and we are very we are completely unprepared for this.  Yeah. And the furthermore, we have an administration  that is terrified of  making its own election.  You know, suspect.  And so they don't want to they don't want to confront this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this whole this whole fake news house of mirrors.  One last quote at the highest level, I say in my post,  they attack truth, quote, multiple untruths, not necessarily consistent,  are in part designed to undermine trust in the existence  of objective truth, says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can I say we knew this was happening six months ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We know this was happening. Everybody knew this was happening.  The Obama administration knew it was happening,  and they were caught between a rock and a hard place because  they didn't want to look like they were influencing the election.  So they didn't really do anything.  Even though we knew it was happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So are the fundamental beliefs in truth, democracy,  the American way are being undermined.  And so, Stacey, that's my only point about psychology, that even if you  if you make everybody clean about how to deal with USB drives,  they go home and watch the news or the Twitter feed of leaders  or whatever, or bots influencing media.  The other thing about the data society showed is how something starts in HN  and bubbles up to info wars and bubbles up to Breitbart  and bubbles up to Fox News.  Then CNN says, oh, well, everybody's talking about.  So we have to cover this.  And the bad guys have won in setting the agenda.  The RAND report says the bad guys have a huge advantage  because it's a lot faster to make up stuff than it is to report stuff.  So they set the agenda.  They get out there faster, more volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That same fear that you have that you're talking about on the fake news front.  And I'm not saying that it's not.  It is a legitimate concern, but and it's faster now,  but I don't think it's different.  We've had that same.  I mean, in a sense, that's how we've gotten to great acceptance of,  like, gay marriage, for example, or even civil rights.  Although apparently a lot of people apparently aren't really big on that.  But. These sorts of things happen both for positive and for negative things.  And right now, we're very focused on this because it's been used  to detract a lot.  And I think the key isn't to say, holy cow, we're living in a dystopia.  It's to say, holy cow, this is happening.  We have made the world better before.  Let's change the conversation and do that again, because that's we basically  maybe we don't use the tool of fake news if we can.  But I guess that's that's what I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can I vote for you for Senate, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would like I've considered running for office.  I don't think I would win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, well, I but I don't know if I'd want to do it.  You might have public service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We might have to leave Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it would be more and more compelling to start the conversation in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly right. I agree.  And meanwhile, here's the good news.  Google's YouTube party app is available now without an invitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So everything's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pay no attention to those negative nannies on that twig show.  Have a party with Uptime, the YouTube social viewing app.  I feel like that's the show is schizophrenic in this regard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yes, we were like, oh, I know.  We're all going to die.  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's but you know what?  This is the world we're in.  And this and this network, not just this show, but this whole network kind of is  that's what this network has become about.  Somehow a tweet has become about technology.  At first it was. Isn't it great?  Look how it's changing the world for the better.  Then it was like, oh, crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, here's something actually that's cool for using technology for transparency  and changing the world, possibly for the better.  IOS 11, if you're playing with the beta versions, they're  it's showing you when apps are using your location.  Yeah, well, it's done that for a while.  No, no, it's. Oh, it does.  I don't have an iPhone, so I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, Apple's been really at least Apple pays lip service.  And I would say that probably sincere in it and very good about privacy.  And for a long time, when an application uses your location, it will periodically.  IOS will say, hey, just so you know, Facebook's using your location information.  Do you want to continue to do so?  Now, most people are going to say yes, because there's a benefit to that.  But it's but if we're an app, you know, that you didn't think needed that,  you know, Snapchat now will show you where your friends are at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that.  That was that was the famous Gawker, the Gawker Stalker map. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Or or Uber's God mode. God view. God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in that case, it was just Uber doing what wasn't your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was just Uber. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this says it's it's actively using your location is what the bar says.  Yeah. Not just when it's like, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to look at my iOS 11 device here, but they may now give you a list of apps  that are actively using it right now, but they've always warned you.  And there is a setting that you can retract permissions.  So I have to say, my my here's my it's pretty clear that Apple  would be a better choice if you're worried about security and privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is recommended for journalists.  Yeah. It'd be better to have an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I also think it's not immediately it's what we don't know is  it's not perfect either.  We know there are hacks and exploits.  We also know that Apple has a lot of the information that, you know,  Apple doesn't play this up, but they can see everything  if if they were required to submit it, for instance, by a government on your iCloud.  They can see the content of your messages. So.  I mean, I don't I think I think there's a major risk  in carrying a smartphone of any brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. But but again, then a risk of what happened to this  is where the harm discussion has to occur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm not worried about companies.  I'm not worried about Google or Facebook at this point.  I'm worried about governments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But even then, why are they going to target  Joe Schmo with a with a Android phone on the street?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's that's just a version, Jeff, of the if you're not doing anything wrong,  why would you care? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, I don't think no.  I think it's it's it's a no.  This is risk management.  If you if you are a politician, you have a high risk.  If you're a bus driver, what's your risk?  Not that the bus driver is an important person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So keep your head down and everything will be fine.  But whatever you do, don't appear on a podcast about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what people tell women.  They're like, just keep your head down and don't don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, I'm I'm I'm I'm digging myself a hole here,  which I don't think I should.  Sorry. I'm like, no, no, no, no.  I get what it sounds like, but I'm trying to say something different.  I think that we have to because here's the risk.  We could damn near shut down the whole internet  because all the bad things that could happen.  Companies and governments go through risk management.  So will individuals need to go through some level of risk management  as they make decisions about who to share, what with and why  and what could happen.  And the risks vary. It's all I'm trying to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, yes. And I think and that's true.  And I think people don't understand those tradeoffs as well as they should.  But I also think they're driven by.  They're they're they don't have the same information  that a government or a more sophisticated person.  Like, that's why I'm pro transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Agree, agree.  And I also agree with you very much, Stacey, that we need the conversation  and we should be talking about this in a positive way to see what can we do about it.  And we will figure it out.  There's going to be some damage between and some bad lessons between here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, Stacey, I think you're right.  I think there is, in fact, a new feature in iOS 11, this blue bar.  That's what you were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh huh. It says this is using your application or using your location right now.  OK. But I'm I'm always willing to be wrong on Apple stuff  because I do not use it day to day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So Apple has done all the things I mentioned,  but now they're going to put a blue status bar  when an app is using your location while running in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is kind of cool, because then you can be like, wait, why?  Why is this? Maybe you'll start deleting more apps.  I don't know. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's certainly be nice to know if, you know,  an app that doesn't for any obvious reason need to know where you are, does that.  Mm hmm. Here's an interesting use of Twitter.  Petya Payments, somebody set up a Twitter bot  that watches payments to the Bitcoin account tied to the Petya malware.  Geez. The depressing thing is  the depressing thing, it's only received 45 payments, totaling $10,000 so far.  So why is that depressing?  Because it's causing untold millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars in damage.  And the and the hackers who created it are making and they're not making any money.  But this happened last time, this happened with WannaCry as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you store your valuable data, not on your machines, but at AWS or at Google.  How much at risk?  You know, and you had and you had to rebuild everybody's PC.  But if you had if you had a discipline about storing the data off  those machines and elsewhere, how much at risk are you for an attack like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, your service providers could become  the risk factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's say, you know, you use Carbonite or I have a I have a Synology NAS  and I back up everything separately there.  And I mean, the problem is that Petya and others don't merely delete your data  or encrypt your data, they also bring your whole network to its need.  It can't you can't continue to use the computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's not the individual machines, it's the whole network, the whole network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's why Merseq, I mean, Merseq is the is it massive Danish  container shipping company?  Yeah.  They is they literally shut down their operations  all over the world because their terminals  were infected and they could not do anything.  Now, I'm sure they have I'm sure backups galore.  But they I mean, that this is a this has been three or four days now.  This is can you imagine, by the way, this echoes  not just to the company, Merseq, but all the companies who are waiting  for deliveries from Merseq containers and all the companies that use,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, Merseq for all those just in time supply chains are going to be.  Yeah.  This is why the Nintendo Switch is hard to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. Well, yeah.  So and yeah, and all of this for ten thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it is in a sense, that's I mean, if if they're doing it for profit,  this shows that it's a crappy profit maker.  Yeah. If you're doing it, though, to just piss people off  and show how stupid everyone is, which is kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm of the opinion now that most of the the want to cry and pet you were government  sponsor state hacking and that the goal is a lot easier.  The goal is disruption, not Bitcoin.  And the Bitcoin is just, you know, a MacGuffin.  However, I have no evidence for that.  But these are really these are very well written tools.  I mean, they're quite impressive in their in their scope.  They look a lot like the tools written by state sponsored hacking.  We think want to cry was North Korea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mm hmm. And we don't know.  I would guess this was Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it came out of the Ukraine, out of Ukraine, keep saying the Ukraine.  Hey, you were a VidCon, Jeff, we're going to wrap it up.  We've been going on for a long time, but I just wanted to.  It looked like another you last year, you came back all energized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I am again. It's such a good conference.  And and and the brothers, the Green brothers are just the best.  I have to spend a little time with them and they just put on a culture that  that matters. So there was a lot of discussion about politics.  The YouTube keynote, which is usually a big deal.  This time, Susan Wojcicki was interviewed on stage and there are a few things  reveal their  Facebook was much more of a presence than before.  Straight out sponsor and doing a lot of things and they care about video  and Fiji Simo was interviewed yet again on stage.  Jack Conti did some proper victory laps for how well  Patreon is doing.  Talked with Hank Green on stage.  So, yeah, it's good for Jack.  Jack's the greatest.  They're so glad I finally got to meet Natalie and tell her I'm a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, man, I love they've been we've had them play perform for us.  Yeah, studio, because they're they're from the area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're just they're just great people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Pamplemuss was there was the band.  But then Jack realized how hard it was to make money as a YouTube sensation.  He created Patreon to support and foster creators.  And it's been a huge success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The great thing about Jack's startup versus other kinds of startups  is he did it to solve a problem.  He did it to solve a creator's own problem and that of fellow creators.  So, yeah, the call was great.  And and hats off to them.  Another good program.  I think I think there was 28000 people this year or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you go to the Try Guys evolution of viral video show?  No, I didn't get to.  Well, you can watch it on YouTube.  It's actually pretty funny.  I'll just play a little bit.  But it's it's kind of all the biggest viral videos  over the last 20 years, starting already.  It's really fun starting with the the dancing baby.  But this is good.  Look at this. This is like a rock show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube stars will do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's you. Right.  I thought this was this is pretty fun.  I watched it. But listen to the crowd.  This is like a rock show.  It's their childhood, man.  And the other thing that's showing up is when you see the audience,  every single person in the audience  is videoing this on their camera phone as if I don't know what they're  going to create their own YouTube.  People watch this.  Peanut butter jelly time.  This is actually  pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll show this to my daughter so she can see what she missed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I think you'd have to be like this is probably for the late  20 somethings. I don't know.  I certainly recognize all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I will say my daughter knew about VidCon and she was very jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is the age group?  What is the age group at VidCon?  It feels like it's predominantly teenage girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is predominantly teenage girls.  My daughter is 20. She still enjoys it.  The problem was she they need a way to get like college age  people together.  But I'd say it goes from  listen, there were 10 year olds who want to be there.  I'd say it goes from teenage 13, 14 up through about 24.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this screaming audience, though, is screaming for videos  that were that were big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Broom goes the dynamite like 10, 15 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they've got to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I ran into one couple older than I am.  That's all they said.  Yeah, we started coming three years ago because we brought our kid.  But it doesn't come anymore. But we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  There's some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like turtles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, and then I look at what Apple did with Planet of the Apps,  which is the most I think critics agree.  And you must have to put on your TV critic hat once again, Jeff Darvish,  the most godawful television show ever created.  Unfortunately, there are nine more still to come.  And I look at Facebook, say we're going to spend hundreds of millions  of dollars on fiction and nonfiction, short form and long form.  I look at what the hundreds of millions YouTube has spent.  Yeah. And they all want to be Netflix.  They all want to be Amazon.  Apple has hired some Sony.  But that's not the power of well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I am, among others, urged the industry track to do one of those great panels  they used to do at Web 2.0 where they have a panel of teenagers  just talking about their media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so that's a great idea just to know what the young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, a great. Always, always a good panel.  Always fascinating.  And if you're willing to listen to them enough and shut up as adults.  What was interesting was they all YouTube, YouTube, YouTube, YouTube.  But not so much Snapchat, Netflix and Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't YouTube learn, though, that it was a mistake to put a lot  to like make PewDiePie be a Hollywood style celebrity  that these that these YouTube videos succeed because of their kind of  underground nature. I think so. Yes.  Yes. And now you see Apple and Facebook going down that same path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's I think they don't understand.  They're trying to recreate mass media.  And listen, if you get a hit in mass media, it's a great business thing.  But the risk is high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get a viral hit on YouTube. There's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's so great about walking around VidCon is you're walking around  the first floor, which is the fan for the expo and some, you know, geeky  15 year old comes walking along.  You have no idea who that is.  And suddenly that person is just mobbed by screaming people.  The way I try to explain to my daughter what it was like for me.  I go to a DLD conference in Munich every year when it's the same time  as the German Oscars.  That's in the same hotel.  And so I see all these people who are wildly famous in Germany.  And I have no idea who they are.  That's what it is for me at VidCon.  Right. And there's all these people who are stars,  complete stars to a to a small but rabid group of people.  And by the way, Leo, you've got a recognition I get on the floor of VidCon  because of this show and because of your network and the adoration to you  and the adoration to the network is is wonderful.  Oh, I should go next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could use some adoration.  You should go. Send me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll bring my daughter.  Yeah. So do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mom of the year. Your daughter would love to go, wouldn't she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God, yes. Yeah.  Why don't we do a panel next year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why don't we do a panel next year that says, God damn it,  podcasts were not invented yesterday.  And go to some of the.  Did you see the revenue growth in podcasts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see that stat? I think I tweeted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, I feel like old media when I go to places like that.  I don't get it at all.  I just feel old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, are you sure you don't just feel old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk about the revenue growth in podcasts.  This was podcast breakthrough year.  Whoa.  Podcast breakthrough year.  I don't know. Where did you find that stat?  I would like to see that stat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Revenue growth for podcasting.  Oh, here's the IAB study.  Maybe it was I.  I don't like the IAB, by the way, because they're trying to impose  this is the IAB revenue study.  old media rules on new media advertising.  We have to advertisers.  Many advertisers now come to us trying to get a IAB generated contract.  And we have to explain to them, no, that's not how we do business.  That's how the IAB thinks we should do business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, this is an IAB study.  Oh, and it was actually from June of last year.  So let's see if their predictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Roads forecast for this year, two hundred twenty million dollars.  This doesn't seem like much given the billions that are spent in mainstream media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this was purely like, hey, podcasts, you can make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know where they get their numbers.  I don't know.  You know, we finally realized, oh, we really need to become members.  Very expensive to become a member of the IAB.  No normal podcaster can become a member.  Right. What was it?  Fifty thousand dollars and ten thousand.  And a fraction of your did they did they want a percentage?  Yeah, yeah.  Did they want a percentage of our revenue as well?  That's if you get bigger.  But we did. But we decided at least to her credit, decided we.  But we need to be heard with these with this group.  So she participated in some feedback to them in this in this survey.  Oh, you participate in this advertising revenue study.  So this includes our numbers.  Well, no wonder those numbers are so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say, I started my show in 2016.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So clearly there you clearly are adding to this big pile of dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I need to go to my other podcast boyfriend in about five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have another podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has a better date. He has Neil DeGrasse Tyson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that guy.  Well, let's do our picks of the week after this word from Rocket Mortgage.  Rocket Mortgage is the future of mortgage lending.  They were, you know, the Rocket Mortgage realized Quicken Loans  realized that the mortgage experience wasn't keeping up with the times.  It was old fashioned.  So they created a product just for you and me, the modern Internet user.  You could do the whole thing online.  They created partnerships with financial institutions  so you don't even have to go get your paperwork.  You can submit it with a touch of a finger.  And because it's all computerized, they can, based on your income,  your assets, your credit, analyze all the home loan options for you in seconds  and find the one that's just right for you.  So literally the turnaround on a loan approval is minutes.  Minutes.  I compare that to what I do at least when we bought our house three years ago.  It took more than a month.  This is so much better.  Rocket Mortgage by Quicken Loans.  Apply simply, understand fully, mortgage confidently.  RocketMortgage.com slash twig.  Equal Housing Lender licensed in all 50 states and MLSConsumerAccess.org  number 3030 from Quicken Loans.  RocketMortgage.com slash twig.  We thank them for making this show possible.  Jeff Jarvis, give us a number, then I'll let you go to talk to that  Neil deGrasse Tyson guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  So my number is 180  at VidCon.  YouTube announced the support of a new format, VR 180, which is basically half of VR.  And they're going to have some new cameras coming out, which are more stereoscopic  in the old sense of two lenses.  And that's why I wondered whether when I saw all about Android, I wondered  about the two cameras on the back of the  the Note 5, not the Note 5, the whatever.  What's the new one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Pixel XL? No, no, the no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, the the the the the the one plus five.  One plus five. Thank you.  And but I've long said that 360 doesn't make as much sense as 180,  because 180 is like, you know, watching a stage or watching a show or watching tennis.  You know, you can look back and forth and put your attention in multiple places  without having to absolutely turn around and not face who you're talking to,  which is kind of ridiculous. Right.  And so I think the 180 for it's I think this whole notion of 360 VR  is starting to be brought down to reality first by AR, first by what Facebook did  at F8 and then Google followed saying, you know, everybody's got a camera.  We can add AR to that.  That's a lot easier than all this stuff on your face.  And same with 180.  Yeah, we can show you something and you can move around in it,  but you don't have to do this whole immersive thing and turn around  and get on a swivel chair in life.  So I found that that interesting that and one other number from  Susan Wojcicki's talk is that they now serve one point five billion  logged in viewers on YouTube every month.  I saw that number and the world thought they were fools to buy it.  On I guess it's hard to believe on average,  our viewers spend over an hour a day watching YouTube on mobile devices alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One hour a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's just average. That's incredible to me.  It's hard to imagine how that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did make when I was on my vacation, I had one of those gear,  360 cameras, and I made a bunch of 360 degree videos.  This is a tour of the Galapagos.  You're on the Zodiac boat with me.  And I watched this one. This is fun.  So I do think that there I mean, I agree with you that three six.  That's me.  360 has some unique challenges, but for experiential.  Yes. I mean, this is pretty amazing that you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, for a concert, a show, a 180s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plenty of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  180 is going to be plenty for seeing what you see,  which is giving you some more choice.  What is going to be pretty amazing?  Yeah. And so I think it's a very smart kind of down to earth way to look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So those are my numbers. Very good. Jeff, go speak to your buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to go see my new friend. All right. Hi, Jeff.  He's going to be back. I'm so glad I remember.  I miss you guys. We love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you going to be here next week? Yes. Yes. Yes. See you then.  See you then. Stacey, your pick of the week.  I think we should both pick the Amazon show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm picking the show because this is pretty impressive.  Yeah, well, it's fun.  I'm going to talk to me next week after I've used it.  And people have called me and I'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like look, first of all, I like the the screens on it.  Are really pretty. These images is like a, you know, I what was that chumby?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it is like chumby.  So wait, I want to do something because I pulled in a an image from WhatsApp  to this thing.  I pulled in an image that was taken on my camera phone.  And so it didn't go all the way across.  So I actually wanted to pull in a new image because I thought it was weird.  And if I wanted to use it as a camera, it was not going to work well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So interesting.  So you are able to take images from the Echo and put it on other things.  How do you how do you do a screenshot?  Is there there's you do it by voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did not find a screenshot.  I guess you try screen shooting.  I'm not trying to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chumby all tried this, but this is this is  qualitatively a different device.  I mean, this is kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's things you can do.  I mean, like being able to look at your security camera.  And I haven't done the August.  I haven't done the skill yet, but I could be able to show you from this right now  outside my door from my doorbell.  It's kind of right here.  So that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll review it in more detail on Saturday on the new screensavers  and probably next week, Stacey and I will both have things to say.  I just feel like this reason I want to keep the other one, maybe get more as I want to  have one in the kitchen for sure.  Oh, look, we're a little late.  Tech news today is 12 minutes late.  So and you know, who told me that my Amazon show aren't tattoos popular on Instagram?  No, I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, whenever I see things like popular on Instagram, I'm just like shut it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also think, though, I think this would be nice on my bedside table.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe not that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  scale up show kid videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Netflix has new interactive kid videos, by the way, where you could choose  how it ends out, what's next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so it's showing me these screens and on some of them, like the nut job,  which is on Amazon Prime, it's allowing me to play it.  Can you that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can't play shows on that.  I'm not sure I'd want to do that right now.  Let's just see. Yeah. What happens? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dun dun dun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, I don't know what's happening with Danny Sullivan,  but it sounds like he's retiring from search engine land.  He posted a video. Did you did you see this?  No, when did he post on Facebook a couple of days ago,  my new role as advisor for his company.  In other words, he's stepping back as he was in charge of content at third door  media now, he's just an advisor.  And I noticed a lot of people saying congratulations,  including Walt Mossberg, congratulations on retiring.  So, Danny, if you're retired, I know a podcast that I'd love to have you  stop by once in a while.
