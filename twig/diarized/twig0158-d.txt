Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't show those on cnn. Oh, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The world is not ready. You're not going to see my knees

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what what was that like you you were on cnn talking about nbc and you've been very outspoken in nbc's handling of the olympics  And yet as many have pointed out show  Yeah, as you know nbc not calling as many have pointed out the ratings and the revenue are great, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and the um the reviews by the users according to pew did a big survey this week, so, you know, uh,  If they're cruel, but I don't think it's not about everyone loving it. I think the question is that you have  Super fans of sports who are clearly ill served

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, there's a word I will use and we use it a lot on this show and it applies I think to this  stewardship  Yes, that there are some things that uh, you know that you do as a network that hey, it's my show  I could do whatever I want with  And then there are some things that are bigger than you twitter has stewardship for instance over this  Internet dial tone this information nervous system that it runs  It is more than just a private company at some point nbc and the olympics  This is stewardship. You are the sole channel of the olympics this whole legal channel of the olympics in the united states  You have a higher duty. Yes, then simply making money or getting ratings

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, but I also think that it's smart business it's it's in these days  It's bad business to screw your customers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh in the long run because and this is what's changed. They will have a choice  Yes, and they will talk about you  Without choice nbc has a monopoly and right now, you know  Most people don't know of any other way to get anything better  tunnel bear  What uh tunnel bear I think he said  spoon  Tunnel bear spoon  Uh, but you're right, but that's a small minority people who know that but what's what i'm saying is as time changes  Um, that's why the music industry finally had to bow was that people more and more people learned to pirate  Because of their stupid policies  And finally they had to say i've also been struggling to write a post

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't gotten it done yet because I just haven't been  I haven't been disciplined. I've been hanging around in t-shirts and shorts. It's summertime. Just relax  But about the responsibilities of a platform which we talked about in last week's show  Uh comes to the guy adams case of the of the user kicked off twitter it comes to  Uh, the notion of I think newspapers acting more like platforms the responsibilities that come part of this discussion, too  Is advertising support is the question that some ask and say well, it's impossible  So this is why app.net as you pointed us to an email leo is trying to start a  user supported twitter  Seth godin wrote a post this week arguing for just that if you know the the old  Not very economic argument that if n people paid n dollars, we'd be rich  um  That's fine, but i'm not i've not given up on advertising support  Because I think that that it's necessary for media  It's a better model without it will have more will have less content and more content behind pay walls and that's bad for all of us  the reason  You have to make it work you do every day is you have the trust of your audience in your hand and if you  Violate it by selling out to bad advertisers or by hawking advertisers outside of that they'll they'll  Savage you and leave you but you maintain your trust and the same thing is possible for media and the same thing is possible  for twitter, I think  And mbc as well that mbc doesn't have to  Just do the things that they used to do the years ago  They can super serve their viewers and still win I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They pay a lot for the olympics. It's very expensive  They do matt meredith have to have their hairdressers their car drivers their bodyguards. This is not easy  This is not pay ryan seacrest ryan seacrest alone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I believe I still believe in the problems. There's no way to test this, you know  one way or the other you're proving a negative I  I  Would bet that if they showed the hot events live that it would cause more social chatter about them among those who saw them  And that would cause more viewership to catch up on it at prime time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and I guess what i'm saying is they will never  ever find that out unless forced to  Yes, and what will force them to is widespread?  Internet malfeasance as people pirating it doing it without their permission

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It can be very widespread. I mean, I seriously tunnel bear for those who don't know what it's a very very easy way to vpn  into uk server  And uh, it's free and you can watch the bbc ad free

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can watch the ipad everything the player is magnificent. Yeah, just just amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can watch bbc live then too in in the uk channels. It's very easy  I think it's 4 499 a month for unlimited  So yeah, you they've made it an incredibly easy app really pretty and you just slip on and off and on and off  That's it. Um still it's going to be a tiny number just as the number the argument is the number on twitter fetching  Like me is also very small

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, this tunnel bear is cool  I didn't know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's free to have done should mbc have allowed for people to pay to watch  So if you had a cable login, you could have watched most of the events live. Well, i'm not sure so I have a cable login

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm paying for xfinity. I have all the nbc channels and xfinity  Has a special on demand olympics on demand that is ad free and they say everything is there  I really wanted to see ennis who won the heptathlon. I saw her final amazing 800 meter run where she led  You know beginning to end didn't need to she'd already practically won  um  And I wanted to see the other events javelin shot  But I thought this is really the olympics this heptathlon seven events. You have to be an all-around athlete  I was so impressed by her and I cannot find it anywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, so they're not actually streaming. Well, maybe it's me, but it's not easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stream live not all of its tape to lay down. No, no, not all of its uh,  Rerun on the web so you can you can watch it live, but then you gotta know it exists  Which is really hard to do  But I think there's a silver lining for the networks in here as i've been arguing that there's no need for channels channels are a false  Curation, you know, why do we need to put together channel?  Well, the truth is the viewers do want the channel  They want to be able to sit on the couch and watch the best of the live as it occurs  That's that's good news for old-fashioned channels which still higher revenue. So the odd thing here is to me  NBC is  Devaluing its channel. I still salute NBC for what they do by putting all this stuff up online  We need a better kind of tv guide to it, but that's a ui problem. We'll figure that out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we also the fact that they're owned by comcast. Yeah  Kind of the mixing there of different conflicting points of view  Um bugs me a little bit  I I mean comcast is never going to get the because comcast doesn't want to be an internet service provider  They want to be a premium content provider  Yeah, so they their business model does not allow for this  So I don't think nbc ever is going to get the idea because they their owners won't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The bigger the bigger idea here is whether content is still a business model  The idea that you can and we talked about this in the show, too  I hope so because that's what I do. I keep every time we do it. I argue back that you're not  Your relationships you're a community. You're you want a community gather. You're the maypole. We all dance around, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm the maypole  Not a very tall one, all right, well grab your ribbons kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We got some google news there's some google news

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where do you want to start i'll let you pick gena since you were gone last week you get the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something just broke today. Uh, google hosted a search breakfast for press and they announced a couple of things  One of the things that they announced is that they they're launching a field trial  That you can a lot that you can opt into and this just interests me because it's a product thing  You can opt into seeing  Your gmail messages in google search results. I love that  Yeah, I do too  So you so you opt in and then you search for something on google and there's a little module on the top right  That shows gmail messages in your account that you're signed into which also contain that keyword and when I thought was so  I thought this is like this is this is great google desktop used to do this  It's not you know, it doesn't it makes sense. It goes along what search plus your world. The creepy police are out  So many people who I really respect and and who are you know smart and good. Um, we're saying this is a terrible idea  Why would you mix public information with private information? This is going to freak people out. No one wants this  And I was really surprised I was surprised because and I tweeted this, you know  I think what we need to you know, if forget user experience just from the purely from the perspective of user education  We want to encourage google to expose all the contextually relevant personal data it has about you  Um in it search results, which is this most most used interface  Just so that users get used to the idea google has this information about me and it's showing it back to me  Uh, you know in in these different interfaces. I mean, this is what the privacy policy was  Consolidation was all about right? So now you have search and gmail kind of tied together  And I don't know. I think it's a good thing. I opted into the field trial  Um, and uh that they enabled it for my account kind of right away. I've been using doctor go for for a while now  So they got you back  Uh  So I but I yeah, so I went back to google and gave it a try and  Yeah, I like it. I like it a lot. It it makes a lot of sense  It goes along with search plus your world  It does not the field trial trial at least does not support google apps account  So it has to be a vanilla google account  And that the the trial page says that they might not be able to let everyone in and you have to kind of apply  And then they send you a message letting you know whether or not you're in but I think this is a good direction  And I was surprised that so many people thought that it was such a terrible idea  I mean like I said google desktop, which has since been discontinued. This is what it did  For you, but you had to install it on your desktop. Obviously. It's it's it's it's jeena. It's such a knee-jerk reflects now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my god, my email's there. Yeah, it's on your page. It's on the same exact browser. The dream is in any way  It's only for you  It if you're looking for this restaurant, you might find there's an old reference to it. Well hallelujah  But now this knee-jerk, oh my god change is bad not just change is bad  But but anything having to do with me is bad and that's that that holds back so much potential progress

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny. I'm usually i'm usually the privacy one kind of here and i'm never kind of totally with jeff on this  But with on this one jeff i'm completely with you. It's like why wouldn't you show this information? You have it  It's they're they're doing it over ssl. So it's encrypted. Of course people are saying what if someone's looking over your shoulder?  You do this on a shared computer  But if you're signed into google it makes sense for google to show you  Relevant results from from all the bits all the context, you know data it has for you  And why wouldn't it do it in the search results?  I mean, that's that's the most popular and most used google interface that they have and it's just good for I think for users  To have an awareness like yes, google has this private. This is private information  This is public information on the web and I don't think mixing them is such a big such a big deal  It's not in line. I mean, it's off to the it's off to the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't have to turn this on I I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You opt in you you you join you you join on so so I don't know if this is going to become default

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's a use case you could imagine it being handy for because that's part of what google has to do in these cases is sell  It doesn't say folks. This is why we're doing it because it's going to give you benefit in your life  What's what's what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I I constantly I mean for me it's just kind of a unified search box  I i'm constantly searching my gmail for for messages for links for words  Um, so for me, it's like oh hey if this works really well  I'll go to one search box and get everything  You know in one shot if i'm looking for a link that anil emailed me if I search in google  I can get either his message or you know the link itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me show you one that a couple of problems. I have with it. I mean, I love it and i'm I turn it on  Um, first of all, the google results page is now vastly overloaded. So I searched for australia. So uh,  On the right i'm getting the knowledge  A graph of uh gold medals australia's one i'm getting schedules and now down here's gmail results  And I only get three if I do the same search  What do you get out back state councilor leo? Yeah, if I do the same search for australia on gmail. I get it far more  Results, so it's not the same results that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one problem, right? Yeah, the field trial is definitely  Uh  Understated it's a small module. That's not mine was was collapsed by default by default. It is I opened it up. Yep  Yeah  Yeah  And it does seem it doesn't does seem to be quite all the search results you would get if you went into your gmail and searched  It looks like maybe it's the first three or something. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, no, it's not  It seems kind of random

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually searching. Yeah, let's see  Yeah, I search for life hacker and I have one two three four five. I have five results including  Yeah, this is this is kind of random. It's just like a sample random collection

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's some of the email messages saying life hacker that you might have  And I do think that that this is going to be a problem that google and and remember this was marissa meyers fight to keep the google  Search page simple. I guess the results page has been getting more and more broke  All the time, but now it's like whoa. There's a i'm seeing the google bar  I'm seeing g  Google plus notifications. I'm i'm seeing knowledge graph. I mean this it's just huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was one more thing  Yeah, and I hate to bring this up one more time as I said before but the hyper personal news stream was mr  Marissa meyers vision that you bring together all these flows of information and google adds value to them because of what it  Can get to know about you. Well, this is that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, it's got my location in here so uh, you know  I get you know, and I like the knowledge graph the fact that I could see  If i'm searching for australia and the olympics are going on  It seems likely I might want to see what australia's metal county is when their next events would be that's cool  I guess that's useful. You just have to look around on the page. The results are way down on the lower right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well in the in this event that was held with search is that they say that the future of search  And i've always said this too. They want to intuit your intent. It's it's  Not about you having to manually search. It's about feeding you information right because it knows more about you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I you know, I don't mind have I mean I is it a surprise to people that  Google has all the contents of your emails. I don't we know that already isn't that wasn't that common knowledge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should and if it's not common knowledge, it's only going to become common knowledge  You know if you see it in your search results, is that what people are concerned about?  I it's it's it seemed like the reaction was that it's a bad user experience to mix private  Information with public information that if you're searching the web, it's like going to the library versus maybe it reminds them of buzz  maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not leaking any information. No, that's the thing. It's not mixing it in there. It's just presenting it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, a friend of mine the first response was oh what could go wrong  I think it's this idea that there that there's a possibility that it would somehow leak or release private information

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can it's it's html

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right now i'm doing something gmail australia somebody suggests and that what you get then is the gmail results at the top

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh interesting. So gmail is like  Oh, that's like a keyword that says this i'm looking in my gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but then i'm getting some gmail results in my australia. You got gmail results in my australia search

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got australia in my gmail search. Oh, see it's it's still over the right for me  Oh is it so they're obviously still, you know tweaking and experimenting on us

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and you'd imagine too that it can give you your calendar. It can give you things from books. You've read it can give you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What else could it give you? I think as long as it's an on-off switch that you can disable. Why wouldn't why would you mind?  I understand some people think oh personal results should not show up in in internet search. I do get that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I think that's the objection  I mean do we all have sort of this an idea that kind of google has sort of pushed this idea of like this like  purity of search results, you know that they should be objective that they should be public that they should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Correct. Hey, you know what? I mean, that's in the rearview mirror. That's well that is for ages. Yeah  Yeah, and and I was you know what? You're you're right. I was one of those people was going no keep it pure  I maybe i've given up now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just data search  Yeah, social search is here to stay kind of yeah the personal personal news stream like like jeff is saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting or yahoo  So that's one new google feature  Uh other google news. There's a lot of google news. You're right  other google news  They say now they're going to put uh voice-based answers  In google search on the ipad and the iphone. I hope they do this in android, but it's kind of google now  Creeping into the ios devices  And there some have said this is where this is where google clobbers siri  I don't think so because siri's still like  The you know, you don't have to go anywhere to do siri. Just press the button

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are they saying it's kind of the quality of it? Yes, because siri doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know is searching wolfram alpha and stuff and google's going to give you much better results. It's a google now style  contextual search

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. It doesn't have the cards interface that google now has but it does look like it's it's kind of a competitor to siri  But you're right, you know siri has that that native, you know, you double press the home button and it's got the commercials and zoe dischanel  But google probably  I don't know probably would just return better results. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never get any cards worth a darn. I get the weather in my appointment says it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It oh you got to do a few searches for your favorite sports teams and then you'll get I kind of like that  I'm getting sports scores now first. It was doing the minnesota twins. I got to stop searching for twins online  but then  I'm joking. I'm joking. I don't know why it thinks I wanted to know the minnesota twins  but so what I did is I just did a couple of  prophylactic searches for the giants  And uh and that fixed it. So  I don't know why it thinks I might want to go to the nike factories. Oh, I know why  Oh my god. Okay. That's a little creepy  Okay, I just bought a fuel band this morning  ah, and there must be in my gmail and a uh, yeah an email from nike because the top card  is how  Far it is to the nike factory store

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's clay johnson  My former co-worker said that bus time that he was at a bus stop and bus times loaded  Yeah, just just kind of when you're near the stop and the directions magically appear when you need them  I haven't had that experience. I mean, I think if you have the nexus 7, you know without data  You know if you're just on wi-fi, you're less likely to have that happen  But I expect that with google glass and with the galaxy nexus  Which i've activated and i'm going to carry around with me a lot more of that  That it's it's way more google now is way more useful when you have a data plan and you're not wi-fi only and you're moving around

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The world of course it is and I love and I have to say i'm loving google now. I can't wait to get a jelly bean phone  Um, so here's the giant score and then there's recaps and highlights and box scores so I could click those here's weather  Here's my next calendar appointment. You don't get that jeff  I get the calendar. That's it. That's all I get just the calendar and I could show more cards  And it shows nearby businesses including ours from google places and these are it's kind of a nice interface. I love this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a really nice interface

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this you're right. I can't wait to now are you using it on your nexus phone?  Do you do you see more stuff because of that? Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just excuse me. I just activated the galaxy nexus  So I haven't I haven't taken it out about just yet, but i'm hoping to to see more of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then there's settings so on the on the commute or whatever  That is I can say card appears before commute from home before commute to home before other commutes after searching google airport hotel of traveling  Other places of traveling these are settings  So I can I can check these boxes  Where do you get that? This isn't so so you promise you got to get a card first  But once you get a car by the way, there's my searches for australia and tunnel bear once you get a card  There's there's the dot dot dot now. I by the way i'm starting to understand the jelly bean menu  Uh metaphor because now not just up here, but I can have a dot dot dot on a card  Which tells me oh you've got a menu on the a card specific menu. Are we?  Yeah, i'm starting to get it. I'm starting to get it same thing with sports. I can customize my  Sports results before game during game after game edit teams so I could have just done that  Uh game details low priority. So so this and you could turn it off or on  So jeff go into your go into your google now and play with it a little bit because you can get a lot more

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, like that's all I get is okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but you have to launch the app right to see these things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the way you get it is you tap the search bar  So on the nexus 7 this is another thing by the way  I complained about with ice cream sandwich is the wasted real estate with this  Forced google search widget. Well now makes a little more sense you tap it. It's it's not notifications  It's right below notifications and now that then you get the card the google now cards. Oh, that's cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't have that talk. You can launch it from the lock screen as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, I use a  Password lock in oh right you have so I don't get I don't get any of that  See, that's too bad because if you want a secure device  You lose all of the cool lock screen features unless you use a third party app, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it has it gives your your age

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a minute you searched for me. Yeah, leo laporte

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my age has your birth date and age there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh now it's getting from wikipedia. Yeah, I mean that's knowledge graph. Okay. All right  Apparently it just took too much of that. Let me do that again now.

Gina. Trepan is here. Jeff. Jarvis is going to play with his google  Now for a little while  I hear by the way, the galaxy s3 samsung has announced we are ready to ship jelly bean  Sweet  So I have I probably will get one of the first ones because I haven't unlocked. I don't have a carrier  So i'll probably get pushed out pretty quick  They say they're waiting approval from google and they've got the code and they're gonna push it out. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right on. Yay  Everybody needs to get on the bean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is better. In fact, I was talking to uh, jason howell who's the host of our android show all about android  Uh, he had just reviewed the asus prime transformer infinity  Which is the you know, the latest version of their docking android tablet  With uh keyboard and it's still shipping on ics and he had moved from his nexus 7 with jelly bean  He says there's a big difference jelly bean really does make things a lot faster. It's hard to go back

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm loving mine. I you know, I honest to god i'm gonna get in trouble  Oh, I will later in the show. I got in trouble with apple fanboys. I'm gonna do it again  As soon as I get my nexus 7, I honestly have not picked up my  iPad once I know  I haven't either. I know I haven't done it. It's just the right size. I'm shocking myself. Hey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, he by the way loved the infinity the transformer, uh asus transform really  Loved it and I do too. It is what a beautiful display  You get to keep I mean it I this is there are some great android products now  I think apple's gonna have a little trouble come september when the iphone new iphone comes out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think jelly bean was really they turned a corner. It was a minor release  But it was they turned a corner. It was like this is what android always could be  This is what we always wanted it to be. Yes. Um, it really felt like oh, okay  I feel good about recommending people like oh, you know get I mean the devices that it's available on are very limited  Uh, but I feel just really good about android now. I feel like it really reached a solid place

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember that when the new iphone comes out late september  I would guess that all the new by then all the new android phones will be coming with jelly bean for instance the galaxy  Note 2 actually there's some concern that's going to be launched  Samsung has said the galaxy note 2 providing the courts allow us will be launched on august 29th  However, uh, there's apparently some rumor that despite the fact that it's got a quad core exynos processor  4g lte improved cameras it might be ice cream  Sandwich that can't be possibly true  Anyway, that one that one's gonna have a new screen according to the rumors  That is a special kind of it's virtually a flexible machine a screen  Really and which means it's very thin so you can get more battery in there  The benchmarks were inadvertently leaked  And very, uh impressive  So and it's big it's much bigger than the original galaxy note  It's like five and a half inches now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's almost getting to be  Seven-size so let's just let's just let's call it even six. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very intrigued. I think that's going to be my next phone  But that now i'm going to now i'm putting really in a tough position and I think a lot of people will be  iphone 5 which  We'll see is it are there any major improvements and advances? We've seen ios 6 so we know what some of what's in there  Or but a new connector. So i've got to go out and get all new stuff or maybe  I'm going to get an unbreakable  Galaxy note that is five and a half inches

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That may be my phone for are you going to drop your nexus 7 when that when you have that on jellybean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an interesting question, isn't it? That's the real question to me. I loved my note  I love the s3 even more  I'm such a whore

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Never count on apple though. Never count on apple. All right, you're right  There's gonna be something awesome with the iphone. You know, there will be you know, you know, i'm gonna buy both so it doesn't really

I gotta I gotta read this exactly right  Completely more than tech crunch. Yeah. Well, yeah, but the google blog has the official blog has it  um  Basically, they said 300 000 miles whenever the computer was in charge no accident  Which implies to me see there hasn't been a single accident under computer control early on and it was a human

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There was a human

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just I mean, I know it's it's parsing the but little there hasn't been a single accident under computer control emphasis mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and now they have one on mars

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. It's not autonomous. Is it?  Sort of autonomous because it's 14 minutes communication lag. You can't exactly steer it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you sit in the driver's seat when you're in one of these cars hover your hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Over you hover. No, you don't you don't do you no you sit back you smoke a pipe you read playboy and it takes you to work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's sort of like an airplane pilot you you watch you watch you're there, you know necessarily  So what do you think is more audacious google glass or the self-driving car self-driving car self-driving car transforms the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it does it does  It changes the view of how we spend our time  It changes the view of you know, gee the car can come pick you up and take you somewhere  Uh the information that's about that  Uh our relations with people while we're in the car. Oh, yeah changes so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the thing that's interesting safety safety is huge and I think that's who's going to promote this, you know  It's so interesting to watch people's attitude change because if you asked this three years ago people universally. Oh, i'm not gonna let a car drive. That's scary  But now we're you know planes fly themselves. I hate to tell you but  Yep  Frequently the plane is landing itself the pilot's sitting there. Maybe he's sitting there like this, but he's  He's not doing anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right unless you're landing a plane in the hudson, which happens. Yeah, you need a human for that 100 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, so we're not getting rid of drivers. We're not getting rid of pilots  But from routine and and I think one of the things that held back autonomous vehicles the earliest in the way  We envisioned it with special roads. Yes, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you don't need that was so google to rethink it entirely. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because it uses lidar it images at the road around you  It's on any road and I think what's going to drive this is as the deaths go up from texting while driving  Yeah, yep, there's going to be a hue and cry. I think people are going to finally say, you know what really good point  This is not something on the radio the other day

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know, it's one of those things that's just too glib to be to be good  But at least it illustrates the problem  Someone arguing that young people were saying that they're not distracted driving  That driving distracts them from communicating  Oh, that's a great recontextualization

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, I should be texting. I'm texting here. Yeah, don't ask me to shift  Right steer i'm texting. I got a I got some  I'm the the ads and they're very moving and I think they're running on the olympics of where the  The oh god, the horrible one. Those are a killer where the sister holds up the word. Yeah  And says this their heartbreaker this was the text I sent my sister  That she was reading when she you know drove off the cliff and died  And whether that of course we have no idea if that she was reading that text by the way  I just want to point out. It's a logical fallacy  It's true, isn't it unless there was a witness  Right, but it's a good it's a good ad  Yeah, it is and it and I do think that you're that that's going to be one of the logical  Factors that are pushing this and I wouldn't be surprised. This is going to happen faster than we think I've talked to autonomous car specialists  One of the visions that I hadn't really thought about he said, you know, you don't have to own a car anymore  And so zip cars moving in this direction too, right the car if they're autonomous  You don't have to own an rv. You don't have to own a car. What you do is you say, um  I want to go to the grand canyon pick me up at three car shows up you get in it drives you the grand canyon  Oh, by the way, I need an rv  When you get there the rvs there drives you wherever you want to be when you're done  The rv goes back to the little fleet the car goes back to the fleet. You didn't own it  And and by the way, you get so many more options

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wrote about this in what we'll do inspired by a guy named roshan tamuk awala  Who said if you stop being a manufacturing company manufacturing cars and and you become a we get you there nicely company  Um, you know, so you're going out for a nice date with your wife tonight. Well, we'll send you the mercedes  Oh, I just need to hold my kid to college. We'll send you this. I just want to save some energy  We'll send you the smart. I'm going 10 miles. I'm going 100 miles  You know, you can have all this choice that you're not you're stuck now and it's hideously wasteful  We all own vehicles

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That are not being used 90 percent of the time  That's true the amount of consumables that's that's wasted  Is horrendous  Yes  So so the the world is moving in this direction. I have no doubt about this  Things and i bet that when google did take the the car to detroit remember we did that story what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  four months ago or something  You've got to imagine that the the the argument isn't just oh, it's another feature for the car  The the argument's got to be have you seen what happened to the music industry?  Have you seen what happened to the newspaper and book industries?  You guys are in their path here and you've got to change your essential model and can you do that?  Have we been trying to get sebastian thrown on on the show at chat on this show? Well our triangulation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's the guy in charge of this project. He's also i met him. I met him in munich at the dld conference

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I met him. I met him in munich at the dld conference. We share a car. I get in the car and I say hi  How are you? Hi, how are you? I'm sebastian. I'm jeff. What are you doing? I'm a google. What do you do there? I created the  operating system for the for the car  And then he has a private audience. Yeah, and I just taught this course and quit stanford because I got 160 000 people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna do that now. Yeah, he's doing is it udacity? Which one's he doing? Yes  Yeah, this guy, uh is perhaps one of the most interesting people in the world. I really want to uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's these people who are hit in google like that. I put something up on the on the uh on the list today about  Two it was a wired feature  About oh if xerox parker invented the pc google's inventing the net  And a tribute to two other geeks in google. You just go to these companies. They're these these well peter norvig

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Peter norvig is like einstein  The guy doing google speech is thinking his name is mike cohen  These you're right. It's full of people like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, one story up here too is is that when you talk to your android you're talking to a neural network  Yeah, that's just beyond anything that we would have thought of only a few years ago, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The future's happening. Uh, it's just maybe hidden inside google  So the problem is google owes the future. Yeah, well, maybe we'll just have to get over that  um  I you know, I do notice I talk to ford all the time because they're sponsored. I have been for a few years  I love my mustang drive it all the time and I uh  I when I first started talking to the ceo of ford  And asked because I always ask about autonomous vehicles every single time  He was like no. No people like to drive. We're we're not thinking about that  Two years three years later  Yeah, yeah, we're thinking about that  Yeah, yeah, we got what they're doing is if you think about the new ford vehicles as many uh manufacturers have  Automatic lane detection they have I mean there's all sorts of uh, uh automatic stuff automatic parking  I mean they're slowly incrementally putting this stuff in the cars

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And people who like to drive will be people like people who like to ride horses they can do so  Yeah, you know if they want someone in the chat room said that oh great  You know this means that a 19 year old in bangladesh could kill people  You know these these cars will be hackable and but that's that's not a reason not to do something  That's like saying, you know, we shouldn't build houses because the ceiling could fall in like of course  This is going to present new problems problems that we're not anticipating  But it seems pretty obvious that the benefit will outweigh the risks. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you for saying that because I think that that is true that we do I mean if you read demon, uh,  Or you read this new book about which is about predator drones kill decision  It's scary the idea of them being hacked is scary  But and we know hacking happens we're going to talk about  but um  That's not the reason to stop the future

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely, and you know and this you know when you compare this to glass like the safety angle  You know how many this will save this many lives per year, right with class?  It's like why people will say why do I want this? Why do I need this?  You know the the automated the self-driving car. It's a lot more. I don't think glass is going to save any lives

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just a guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but but you know just one of the other stories in the rundown is how uh,  Because of the huge proliferation of android devices  That has now led google to be able to have live traffic data in under 30 cities in america, right?  Because just tracking oh we we know that device is on i78 and we know it just stopped along with 10 others  So we know the traffic's jammed there, right?  That kind of emergent data that comes from  Us all being connected and doing things has a benefit that we kind of can't yet guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep google kills google listen, I got an email from rob walsh at libson. He said hallelujah  Finally  Because there are good third-party podcast apps. Listen was always a little funky a little wonky

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What what what do you what do you what client do you guys like the best? I get this question all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love downcast. Uh, that's one of there's there's several  I actually asked this question on twitter and um downcast I think was one  Let me see dogcatcher dogcatcher. I mean now down downcast is for ios dogcatcher is the one I like. Yep  Instacast instacast. Yes, those are the two  The nice thing about dogcatcher, uh is it does audio and video?  Yeah, um, and it does it very well. Uh, it's you know, it's just I think it's just really sweet  I have feeds that I subscribe to automatically updates  It's got all the features you'd want I think speed speed variation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Still waiting for the kindle of podcatcher apps, you know the one that  You know saves where you've paused what you've listened to what you haven't listened to across devices. That's still you know, not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pocket casts. That's another one people like  um, I think uh  i'm not see  I have an opinion about podcasts in general  Okay, um, they're fine. They're good  Nothing wrong with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think podcasts are okay. I mean, they're okay  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Beyond pod  But but I also noticed that we and I would imagine a lot of companies are going to end up doing our own apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mm. Did you catch the line on the newsroom last week in the previous?  You're one screw up away from having your own podcast. That was great. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I loved it  I'm starting to like newsroom a little better. I don't know the 911 episode must have moved both of you guys quite a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no  It got I thought it was got me. No, I thought it was just overdone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's typical. It was a little sentimental. It was overdone, but I got me it got me a lot  So I hated that it got me  It's the the new the conceit of newsroom, which is there in circon show on hbo  Which we have talked about before is that it's covering old news events  So you can kind of see what happened behind the scenes and of course none of it has any relation to what actually happens in newsrooms  anywhere  That's part of the reason jeff hates it because he's actually been in a newsroom  But this one was the someone bin laden killing and I thought they'd milked the hell out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did all the scene on the plane. It was so overwrought, but i'll admit that I was it got me though. I couldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Couldn't resist when the key that guy stands up in the control room and puts on his nyfd hat  Fdny fdny I cried it was schmaltzy  But that but it worked it cried  I was boohooing by the end of it and I hate that I was but I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't mean to derail the conversation about podcast app. Sorry. It was a good that was a good line

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but sorcan always does this by the way sorcan always sneaks in technology references that are basically snarky always yeah, I have a blog  Lollipop lollipop and surrender dorothy  You know that it's all it's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you think every podcast network or podcaster will have their own no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but but and so this is an interesting argument because we talk about open web versus apps all the time, right?  But is there an open web role for podcasts?  Uh, I don't think so itunes dominates 99

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, yeah, and uh, i've williams tried odio years ago, right and gave up when apple did itunes. Yep. Yep  So you just have all these disconnected feeds with these big files hosted across web servers  But i'm I still want that kindle experience of like it is rss

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean the good news is it's all standards based there  The formats are standards based the rss for the feeds is standards based so it is really uh open web  Yeah, and I hate the idea of an app but  For instance what how does live fit into that and live is a very much a part of what we do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, right. No, that's a good point. Right. Is that fit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so we do so we do apps because we want to have live and chat in addition to download

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then you want show notes and yeah, I mean you want to enhance the enhanced, uh experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I don't know. I feel guilty doing an app, but at the same time it really does  It also and I have to admit this and this is why companies that can afford it will do it  It builds in audience because you have space on the desktop as opposed to being buried inside dogcatcher

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right  It's it's harder for you to get discovery with it, but it's a better relationship if you have been discovered

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and with our audience, they're they're smart and they can find it and download it and then it's then it's a button  And we have you know, we don't even do our own apps  We're starting to look at that  But we have great people doing great really good apps and the fact that see I don't think of our shows as podcasts  I think i'm as on demand versions of the show, right?  so  That's that's kind of a conceit, but I but I think that we're a live network, right?  Yep, and I think that this kind of a device i'm looking at a nexus 7 with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With tape delay, you're on NBC. This is recursive going on. Yeah. Well, wait a little it actually shows the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, now we're got a problem  So this kind of app though makes us very appealing and that was instant. I didn't have to download anything  It's just it's like turning on tv. This is too much fun. Oh my god. I gotta screen cap this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the audio old-fashioned podcast we're seeing leo watch leo watch leo. Yeah for those of you still listening on audio

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um  So but we're looking at nexus 7. I mean this that's why one of the exciting things about nexus 7  It's a great media device, right as will be a 7 inch ipad  And perhaps a five and a half inch galaxy note

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The one thing I wish it had was a back-facing camera because I I shoot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ports all the time. I agree. It seems an odd thing to leave out  This boy if they put a great camera in here like a really good camera in here  This would be really price. Yeah, you really miss the back-facing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been watching people in the audience in the olympics holding up their big  Your big ipads like recording stuff and it just looks crazy  And I don't know. I always kind of feel like why you know, why wouldn't you use your phone or a small camera?  It just looked crazy  Uh, greg greg lucaina's had this like crazy ed hardy ipad cover was holding it up. I was like, what is that?  It's like oh, that's his ipad now i'm gonna cover on it i'm gonna pry this open. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've never done this before  Oh, oh, but i'm gonna oh dear. Oh, yeah, that's can't this can't go well. Oh, yes  You didn't know that did you but uh, robert balacer?  The priest told me that you can do that on this and watch what happens when you open it up  Leo's snapping open his oh, look at how beautiful see what that is. That's a hole for a camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  oh  So we can pretty much then by the way, this is a 3g antenna that's not used  So we three four g so we pretty much know that the next generation will have a camera in the back and a 4g radio

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think what's brilliant here. It's it's it's they they they sold the low end version first to get people used to it  And then they'll pump up. Yeah, but i'd pay 350 for a camera  Oh, yeah, oh i'm addicted. So i'll buy the upgrade of this thing. Sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a this but this is so much more than a hit this is a trojan horse  This is google and just as you were saying gina everybody's starting to say oh jelly beans. Not so bad  Oh, this is a pretty good form factor. I would be anything you miss from your ipad or iphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One thing one thing i miss is I can't get hbo and show time to go on the nexus 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and airplay and stuff like that, but mostly I miss the ecosystem and I think that's really where apple has the lock in  Is this kind of all-in-one apple tv itunes?  ecosystem  Um, but I think in in so many ways jelly bean is way ahead of ios

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I uh, I mean I never had an apple tv  So I never and I stopped buying stuff from itunes a long time ago  So I don't I don't miss that so much there are a couple of apps  I miss I miss like note c which is a great dropbox enabled notes app that I use on the ipad a couple couple apps here  And there but for the most part I really haven't missed it that's getting rarer and rarer, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once flipboard was on the uh, android  That was a big one instagram insta paper instagram  By the way, doesn't marco say he makes more money on insta paper for android. He's like 600 up 600 percent

Transcript:  Don't and don't get me started on the academic journal scam. Yep  That's a really obscene scam perpetrated by some of the same fine publishers  Um here it is insta paper for android. Thank you chat room sees a 600 jump in downloads on release of nexus 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's not quite what I was saying. It's probably so the android sales jumped 600% when the nexus 7 got released  Okay, that makes complete sense. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks chat room active device installs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh  But these are for android anyway  Nexus 7 it's showing what it's showing is not what I was uh submitting which  It's not better than ios, but it is showing that nexus 7 has kind of transformed the market  Google invests in digital signature company docu sign

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another kick to the kidneys of the u.s. Postal Service. Oh dear. Why do you have to mail things? Right?  If you have electronic signatures  Yeah, and and so now if you can do that, uh, you can do legal documents a lot faster  Um, you can store them you can transfer them. You can do all kinds of things, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we should expect to see this in google docs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, oh how interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, uh google docs becomes real ready for prime time and for businesses then doesn't it? This is a this is a key

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh really key kind of functionality that's been missing  I mean people are still faxing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Real estate documents because of the signature. You're right. Actually the first thing that I hope this kills is the damn fax machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  God, yes, seriously save the postal service, but kill the fax machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know the service but we're going to change all the drivers to self-driving cars and then we'll save a fortune there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, I look forward to seeing this google and oracle  Have been ordered to disclose  Which bloggers and journalists they paid to influence coverage

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a second. They're paying bloggers to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where's someone where's my money?  This is a court order from judge william alsop who demanded both companies reveal which bloggers and journalists they have compensated  He's concerned that evidence presented over the course of the case may have included commentary from paid  bloggers or journalists most notably among this group  Florian mueller of  Foss patents we quote him all the time  He is paid by both oracle and microsoft  But we knew this by the way and this gets down to that thing of just as long as you disclose  Is it okay to talk about? I mean, you know  Google says we will comply  Oracle says it's all google's fault  Oracle has always disclosed all of its financial relationships in this matter. It's time for google to do the same  We read this order to also include indirect payments to entities who in turn made comments on behalf of google  This is going to be interesting. I'd be a little more nervous if I were getting money from google oracle  Unfortunately, none of this I you guys i'm sure you're all right, too  No, I do not but what I bought this t-shirt with my own money. Yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what if google had purchased ads on twitter would that count as being paid by them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. Well, that's uh, I don't know what the judge thinks  In fact google did buy ads on twitter three or four years ago. They bought some ads for the summer of code  You know their internship program, which is a great program and I was very glad to do an ad is a disclosure  Yeah, right. So is this only undisclosed form of the ad is itself a form of it's obviously paid  We make sure that when you hear an ad, you know that it's a paid commercial

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I was once uh, so I think it was the journal  The wall street journal was doing a story and quoted me something about google and then their fact checker called me to  To vet me and said, you know has google ever paid you and I was like, well  I gotta check for ten cents from adsense seven years ago. That's not even paying. Wait a minute. I do we get google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Adsense

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I sell an app in the play store  So I do get money from google every month but that's some sales through there  You know and we did summer of code for think up which means like I got a stipend for mentoring the coders who are working  You know, but that's not that's not considered employment and they questioned me about it quite a bit  They didn't quite understand and like that's so it's you know, it's it's a it's a blurry line

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think if you sold something other than coverage  To google that's legitimate. You know, i'm selling you a product

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right and since we're all disclosing I got paid for expenses for a trip that they want me to do  And so that was all just expenses

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh  Free admission to google io plus a bunch of crap. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you're right. Absolutely. Oh crap  Can you edit this whole thing out? Jen just edit that whole but how much money did we give them for the glass?  Oh, yeah, I gave him 1500 bucks for google glass. So we kind of broke even  I never got any crap from I just want to point out  Kevin marx got all my crap  He got the google queue he got the chrome book he got the chrome box he got the you know  The you know, really seriously if you wanted to be um  You know sticklers about this all that counts as influence so this should be very interesting  Um, let's talk about uh, matt honan we'll talk about security and I will get schooled  In google's two-factor authentication, which I think is crap  But perhaps i'm wrong and i'm open i'm open-minded to all of that. I did not get a google tv. I did not get anything  Kevin marx got all my crap. I gotta say I bought my google tv  I bought my nexus 7. This is a purchased nexus 7. You know why you could tell because it's got a dark back  Yeah, not the special google googley back  Yeah, I uh, but but see i've been doing this a long time  I try I buy every everything I can we occasionally would get stuff for review for before you buy our review show  But I buy stuff I even i'm i'm going to review on the giz whiz  I have a new segment on the giz was called stuff crap. I found on sky mall  And uh, and and the first thing i'm going to review is something called orbital skates  And i've actually I actually paid 159 to break my ass. So I think i'm okay  I didn't get them free from the orbital skate company or sky mall. Otherwise, could I say crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give you a break there after that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I pay for my own there it is  I'm going to get those and i'm going to ride them  And i'm going to break my  Oh, I even get the first six inches, you know what i'm uh, now i'm investigating actually  It's not the cost of the skates that wears me it's the cost of the padding that I have to buy before I even  Try those skates. I want to get one of those, you know, they have the fake sumo wrestler inflatable  Suits that's what i'm gonna get because then you fall it doesn't matter. You look like a little roly poly doll

Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This show brought to you by ting  Ting you know about ting ting is so cool twig and ting like this  They go hand in hand go to ting.com slash twig t-i-n-g. It is it is the uh, uh new  Cell phone service brought to you from two cows the same people that do hover.com with the same idea. They wanted to reinvent  Cell phone service. They know these other companies are terrible  So what they decided to do is let's let's how would you do it if you're going to do it, right?  Let's redesign it. So first of all, they're built on the sprint network  So if sprint works for you wherever you are, this will work exactly the same  many of the same phones  But the way ting works  Is you pay only for what you use?  You never pay a penalty for using more than you said you were going to use  Uh  And they will refund if you say i'm going to use more and you don't they will give you a refund  Of the stuff that you don't use every month. You can get a check from ting  So let's uh, let's go to the plans here. These are kind of you don't really have to choose a plan actually  Uh, because you know, you could say zero zero zero and then you just pay at this rate  What you use but you could also if you wanted to budget you could say well i'm going to use uh, 2 000 minutes  By the way, can you use this across as many phones as you want?  So if you have 20 phones you could still and so great for a family or small business  I'm going to do let's say a thousand text messages. That's a lot for a month and i'll use three gigabytes  Okay, that would cost you 106 bucks a month. You want to oh you need more phones. Let's add some phones  Let's make it five phones 130 bucks a month  For all of that and if you use less they refund the difference if you use more they just charge you at the same rate  That includes by the way absolutely free voicemail picture and video messaging three-way calling caller id and most importantly  free tethering  free hotspot  They're not trying to screw you that's kind of a novel way to do business as a cell phone company  They actually respect their customers. Take a look at the phones. They've got great phones  And by the way, if you go to ting.com slash twig and use their online savings calculator, you'll save 50 bucks on the phone  So they're even a better deal  Galaxy s3 just came in. Yay  Yay, white or black  Not white. Yeah. Yeah, I love the s3. This is my favorite phone. They have the 32 gigabyte  And again, if you go to ting.com slash twig, you just subtract 50 bucks right off the top  They even have you know inexpensive feature phones and and I like this mobile hotspots too at the same great pricing  So I want you to try a ting.com slash twig  Those folks at two cows have really uh, kind of staked a claim for themselves  They want to be the company that that helps geeks that takes businesses that just don't make sense like domain registration or cell phone  Service and and do it right  What an what a novel idea  We should all support him ting.com  Slash twig no surprises. No surprises. I'll tell you who was surprised matt honan on friday night  Yeah  Matt wrote for gizmodo. I've known him for years. He's currently writes for the gadget lab at wired.com  He's a really nice guy with an 18 month old baby  very sweet  Uh, he was playing with his baby  On friday night when his iphone went and reset  That's not  He said well, i'll just recover it. I'll restore it then his ipad did the same thing then his macbook air  Erased itself and then that's when he knew something was wrong his gmail account had been hacked turned out the hackers  Uh had one simple aim he has at mat on twitter and they liked that  And they said we want to get we want to own his twitter account all of this was done to own his twitter account  We now know that the technique was very interesting did not involve  hacking  Cracking brute forcing it was all social engineering  They start off going on the net to find they were looking for matt's mailing address and email address  Is  They found that with a who is search for his personal website  He wasn't using who is privacy and so they got that then they call up amazon now this hole has been since plugged by amazon  Because of the attention that matt got  They called up amazon said I want to add an email address to my existing account amazon says fine. What's your mailing address?  It's what's your email address?  Okay, here's the new address  They got uh, they got their own email address attached to the amazon account more importantly  They got the last four days. Oh, I think they said they I can't remember the deal that they want to add a credit card  They got the last credit card a credit card  They got the last four digits of the old credit card and that's the key because it turns out if you then call apple  And you say hey, I forgot my iCloud password. Can I reset it? They say oh, yeah, sure. What here's the security  Oh, I don't remember the security questions either  Okay, what's your uh, what's your address associated with the account your mailing address your email and the last four digits of the credit card associated with the account  They have that from amazon they gave it to him apple let him reset the iCloud account they get into the iCloud account  Turns out he's got his gmail  Account password change email is his iCloud account. So they go to gmail. They say  Hey, I want to change your password password gets sent to the iCloud account, which they've  Uh got into  Now they got his gmail  They got his they got his iCloud and they used that to get twitter as well and started posting homophobic and racist tweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this is basically that the nightmare this is the night the cloud nightmare was pwned big time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, by the way, I talked to matt last night the good news and I think it's okay to say this  Uh, the good news is that uh apple took the laptop did some forensics  They had not the wipe had not completed. They didn't get to the overwrite because there was an overwrite stage  So apple was brute forced the pin and was able to give it back to him unlocked  He is gonna I set him up with drive savers and he's gonna take it up there  And I think he's gonna get all his pictures back because he didn't have it back up. That's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was the real tragedy forget the homophobia on twitter. Well, like he had lost the pictures of his daughter from her first year of of life

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't heard from him yet, but I think that he's gonna be able to get it back  Glad to hear that. Yes  So and lesson learned back up  Uh, I think we make it clear that you shouldn't have kind of this interlocking emails, you know, you should have  He says and and this is the thing that's interesting if I had turned on two-factor authentication on my google account  This wouldn't have happened true  Apple has suspended temporarily at least it's over the phone apple id password resets  They won't admit why but it's obvious why and amazon has closed that security hole as well  But I talked to these hackers last night, by the way  Uh and uh had a little chat just not in person just on twitter  Um, they approached me and I and I verified it that was them  And uh, I said, well, uh, you know, these holes have been closed and uh, they said we got lots more  We got lots more  Um, but they said I think this is interesting  We decided not to we feel bad about what happened to matt so we decided not to not to hurt anybody  We're just going to exploit stuff and make some money  And then I said well, you know, you're you're gonna get busted you gotta be really, you know, dudes stop you're gonna get arrested  And they said oh no, we're not gonna get arrested because we're not hacking anymore. We're just exploiting holes  so  Huh? Huh?  I also asked if you were gonna hack me, uh, where would you start?  And they said first thing we do is we go out on the internet. We look uh, look for information about you  Yep from who is or publicly posted email addresses that kind of thing  And then once we get some information about you we can then mostly what they're doing is social engineering  I thought it was very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you basically you make a list of common security questions, right?  And then you for for public personalities like you leo and like us you go and try and find you know  So the sarah palin email hack was like, where did you meet your spouse?  Wasilla high like right on her wiki p.p. obvious

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So um  What's the uh, what's the solution here? Is it?  How do you fix this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, so let's talk about two factor off

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I i've turned it on twice now in my life  Turn it back off a month or a day or a week later  Um for two reasons one. It's a big pain in the ass now not for everybody  Uh, in fact, I was tweeting back and forth with matt cutts and he said well, you know it  So here's how it works if you're on once you turn it on  Uh when you go to log into your google account you use your normal password and then google authenticator on a smartphone iphone or android phone  And will google authenticator will give you a five digit password which you then add so that's two factor authentication something  You know your password and something you have this phone which you have previously associated with the account  Uh, the presumption being well to hack your account now somebody's got to own your phone as well as know your password  And that's a lot harder  And it works fine if that's all you want to do the problem is that there are a lot of apps that use google calendar voicemail  voice  Contacts that don't understand second factor authentication. So in order to get into those now, you can't use your regular password anymore  Google will generate for you application specific passwords  These are 16 lowercase letters. So they're not very strong passwords  And here's my problem first of all the inconvenience involved because I use a lot of devices and a lot of google on these devices  Uh, and I in a lot of apps and I have to go into all of those and use this these special application specific passwords  It behooves you to make sure you use a different one for each app and to record which app  So that you can revoke them, but it is not required and i've found out since and correct me if i'm wrong  That any of those passwords can be used again and again  Anytime

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right because these these are apps which need to off with google on a regular basis and don't support two factor off  So your your mail your email client expects a username and a password for pop or imap  Right. So if you give it that application specific password, it uses that password over and over again and saves it. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if somebody so it's it's in effect  Replaced my secure password  On google with what I consider a fairly insecure 16 letter alpha numera alpha not even numeric  Password that can be used if somebody ever gets it for anything  Except my google account  I still need I so anything that supports two factor. I'm okay  So the the then then what matt would say I believe what matt would say is well see for that reason  It's more secure because even if they have that password all they can do is delete your email or wreck your calendar  They can't take over your account

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about the problem that all of us have in having an apps account and a regular gmail account and the browser already gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Confused between the two well and that's how second factor two factor authentication was in fact cracked in the cloud flare attack  Was the guy had google apps and a regular account and they were able to use it somehow than the way  I don't understand to get around it by the way  I believe it was it was if not the same hackers it was hackers in the same group that did the cloud flare hack

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so, I mean yeah  Two factor auth is a pain the way that google has it implemented right now  I don't think that two factor auth is bad  I think the user experience needs to be improved and it's much more painful if you have  Multiple accounts which we do but remember most people don't and if you have lots of devices which we do but again  Most people don't and leo I hear you the application specific passwords the authenticator app you can have  Pins texted to you. You can print out a thing that you put in your wallet like it's  Two factor auth is confusing and in fact there was a lot about it that I didn't totally understand until this all happened  And I did more reading  Um, it's it's complex. It's a pain every 30 days, you know  Even every 30 days when you have multiple accounts and multiple, um devices. I do not want to do this every 30 days  I mean it feels a lot more often. Yeah, you know if you've got five devices, you're always doing it once a week  You have to enter the stupid pin. It's a crappy crappy user experience. It needs to get better  but  Two factor auth is definitely better than having a single password that you're entering everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean and I would turn it on and in fact, I use two factor in a lot of other I use it on my bank account  I use it on my blizzard  you know account so that people can't steal my  My fab characters on diablo  I use it at facebook by the way has this capability you can't log into another to facebook from another device  Unless you get it to send you an authentication in every case  I use those because i'm not using apps that don't understand second party second factor  But the problem is so many google apps do not  So many third party apps do not and so you end up party apps, right that interface with google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Particularly email clients right every single email client that interfaces with gmail would have to add support for two factor auth, which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obviously insane and i'm also concerned because now I have some insecure passwords floating around that will work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The application specific password. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I have to revoke them but until I revoke them. They're good  Right until you revoke them. They're good. It's true. And okay. Sure. They can't take over my account, but they could delete all my email

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right  Right. I mean, you know the reality is the security right?  It's there's always trade off of security versus convenience and there's never a completely secure  You know, it's only like so much security, right?  There's never a guarantee that something is going to be perfect  I lock on my door someone can can bust through no matter how many locks I put on my door  There's always a way inside the house. It depends on how hard the person is going to try  right, so  Like I totally get your point about having application specific passwords sort of putting you in a position that you were in to begin with  But you know most people  You're not entering that password a million multiple times. You know, it would be good wireless

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I understand you can do this. I think it's sufficient  To have a good strong google password  And and very important and matt should have had this turned on and did not and everybody who has a google account should do this immediately  turn on  uh  Account verification through a cell phone  Because then if somebody owns your account you can get a new password sent to your cell phone and take it right back  Right, they'd have to have your cell phone to truly own you. I think you get 90 of the value

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of second factor on but his cell phone was already

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or it oh, maybe that's it. No, he didn't have two factor off on he didn't have account

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You factor off, but I don't know if he had a attached mobile phone verification, but it's sent via sms  So it doesn't require a smartphone. It just requires a phone that can

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh support sms and you can you can you know the video google's explainer video which we can add in the show notes  They suggest even putting a phone number like your spouse's phone number or a trusted friend doesn't have to be your phone, right?  Which is interesting. I hadn't really thought about that. Of course you have to you know, if your spouse loses her phone  You've got to make sure that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think I think and then if you're worried change your password every month  Um  Which is less of a pain than the two factor authentication, but it has all of the benefit

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody remembers to do that though  At least with the two factor auth it prompts you and says hey verify this device for another 30 days  It's a pain, but it makes me feel good  About he's like, okay. I feel secure. I know no one else is getting into my stuff. It's tough. I hear you leo  But if you're worried, are you using two factor?  I am I have it for both my apps account and my gmail account and you know because a lot of my  Personal information is out on the web. I I try to answer all my security questions with completely unguessable answers, you know  Uh, where did you meet your spouse pluto, right? You know just completely crazy same thing. Yeah. Yeah crazy answers  I put that all on last pass i'm using two factor auth on last pass as well  Because that's that's an account. I don't want anyone to break into that's a really important account

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But see here's the funny thing is that this wasn't about password security or last pass or any of that  and  In fact, it was a it was a social engineering and in fact it turns out  Because people forget their security questions all the time. They're really useless  Because in many cases you just call up say, I don't remember them. What else can I give you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw an argument by somebody and I can't remember was arguing against  Remembering passwords and his argument is you because you can get your passport passwords back every time put in a nonsense password  And when you know the app, uh, just suddenly forgets you  You just do an email drag to get a new password and use that one until the next time it happens

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but your email account has to then be secure  But yeah, you could do that. You could just get a new get a new login every single time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good article in the atlantic yesterday  security questions  The biggest joke in online identity verification  Um, and and it makes this point that if companies are going to ignore security questions, then it's no point in even having  security questions

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They call this social engineering to me social engineering is like these hackers called apple care and like, you know  Uh charm them into giving them this was a broken apple policy  That when you call a representative and and apple made issued this statement that their policies weren't fully followed  Which was complete bs because wired was able to reproduce reproduce the situation multiple times kind of the next day  Um, this was like this was broken apple policy  They they were like they want to get you know customers off the phone kevin made this point earlier in the week  You know you want to reduce the amount of time that anyone is on the phone with an agent  So you make it as easy as possible to kind of bypass all the checks that you get online  So I mean that apple had to change, you know had to change your policy and require more information, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other the hackers do it for some cause no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they did it for the lulls work

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was all for the lulls  Um and and the short twitter name the mat at mat which is why they which is why they targeted matt

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and so they didn't know who he was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lucky for us matt has an enormous platform and was able to get this fixed and he had friends at twitter who could restore his account  And he you know, he was able to make enough noise and has a big enough platform and has a trusted voice in tech journalism  To get this fixed within a couple of days and imagine if this had been  Just a regular person, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just this afternoon this has happened to you long before it did me but I just suddenly got the twitter verify thing  And so i'm now verified congratulations  One of us I didn't know that what they wanted was the secret handshake. Um, I I know what they wanted  You're not was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the air like up there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Followers that I do jean I don't worry  Way more  Um, I missed you. How did you get how did you get verified? Can you recall did they just email you or?  I came in as a uh as a dm and  And all I want is my phone number. It's like it's okay. We already know you we already know it's you you  About malice after yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how I never was contacted by twitter in any way. They just happened one day

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But usually was is what they have now is my phone number if they're if they  Well, and I like this that if the if the account is is attacked god forbid i'm a nice guy, please don't  um  Uh, they have a phone number now where they can call me and verify

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought the point of getting verified was that  Personalities who have you know accounts accounts that mock like fake twitter accounts kind of made i've never had that  Problem and now that i've mentioned it i'm sure that I will and then I will go to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the thing I think the best thing to just keep your head down  And pretend you are no one and just hide because you don't want to attract the attention of uh, this guy  Phobia and his friends and phobia. Love you, man. You're a great guy. We had a very civilized conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Phobia did a good service. I mean  It was the wiping the remote wipes was pretty malicious and I think he he says he regrets it  Yeah, he said and i'm assuming it's he said that he uh regret regretted that part  Um, but he really did do a service. I mean he closed up two major security holes at amazon and apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, this week and in fact, that's his point of view. He says exploiting methods for the better cause  Seems unlikely to get in trouble. If anything, it's beneficial and should be rewarded

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what i'm saying. There is a touch of a cause to it besides lulz. Well, no that was not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think his original intent. I think right now  retroactively  He's decided that he wants to uh, I think I think you know what probably happens like he's a kid  And I think probably what happens is there's there's a disconnection between what you're doing and what its impact is on a human  And when he actually talked to matt  Uh and realized what happened he felt bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't have to delete a new dad's pictures of his daughter  I mean you really don't have to do that, but he wasn't thinking about that  He was just like oh look find my iphone is on let's remote wipe. Oh look  He has access to the gizmodo account. Let's you know, let's attack that. That's just gravy  Yeah, how far can this go exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and uh, I think that that you know  I think that that's the real issue is that and these and these guys are handing this stuff around  So once a technique is discovered, it's immediately circulated  I asked him how he started. He said he started hacking when he was 16  Hacking gamer tags. He wanted a better gamer tag for his xbox  Uh, and I wanted a cool gamer tag  So he hit up some people that I was friends with before they knew how to take accounts friends with before they knew how to take accounts  He doesn't use punctuation.

This is actually you're doing a huge even if it's just back up your data

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, even if it's just back up. You're doing a huge thing and uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  matt cuts, uh wrote a life hacker article in which he uh,  He says turn on two step, please, you know, uh and explains how two step works  Um, don't listen to leo leo's full of it turn on  It's the right it's the right thing to do. Um, and he has you know myth and reality and all of that and um

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I agree and I and by the way facebook has to I didn't know this and I don't know if they even publicize it  I don't know when they turn it on but facebook also has a two-factor authentication. So turn that on  I had no idea going into  Uh, everybody should twitter twitter really should now they at least use oauth, but they really should  Because twitter's and again, this is that stewardship article twitter's becoming more than just some social network  so if you go into your uh, your um settings  on your facebook  Account settings and then click the security tab. It's not clear  But you'll see login approvals. That's that's their two-factor authentication  Approval is required when logging in from an unrecognized device  And if you go to edit that don't show this because it's got all my phone numbers  Require me to enter a security code each time an unrecognized computer or device tries to access my account  And there's a couple of ways you can have text or if you have the facebook app  On your device the facebook app it turns out has an authenticator built into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it turns out that's not really the the vulnerability. Yeah, there's easier ways

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but it would have it would have mitigated the damage, right? Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is my favorite story and then we're going to get to our tip number and the tool of the week because we've got  triangulation coming up in a few minutes  the ustream feed  For the curiosity landing  Beat prime time cnn  Yeah  Yeah, I  Love it. There were watching  3.2 million people in total  That many peaked at half a million people watching at the same time  That's higher than cnn sunday prime time or nms nbc  fox gets 803  But you know cnn did a kind of they were the only as far as I could tell channel even covering it  Live everybody else was doing a little fix and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, and I did that too and I've noticed a lot of geeks did I had cnn on the television  I had nasa tv I had our thing and I was chatting and tweeting  And the chat room there were a thousand people in there and it really was inspiring  How excited the geek community was?  stunning to see  How?  Uninvolved the non-geek community. Yes, they didn't even know it was happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which says a lot about our future of science and technology stem education  I joked because there were a lot of you know time to lay jokes around this  But I joked that that nasa really should have changed the the timing of this so it happened in prime time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tweeted that nbc would be showing it tomorrow in prime time edited with commentary from ryan c christ  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

He said no, I don't know anything about it  They had not talked about it in school  And that made me so sad  The opportunity to get a bunch of fourth graders excited about the fact that we land a volkswagen-sized science lab on mars  Using a sky crane and nylon wires. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and and the visualizations that nasa did were so brilliant  NASA

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can we give props to nasa for their savvy their internet savvy their media savvy  I guess they had to be in this in this day and age

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was also a cultural thing was that right?  They saw the PR but they they understood the through openness and the true trying to share everything and through bringing us in  Yes, uh that was going to get the assignment going and it was true and just just the great geekness  Probably the best thing nasa could have had they didn't plan on at all was mohawk guy and superannuated hippie

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly two of them  Let me see. There's mohawk. They're superannuated hippie mohawk guy and pompadour guy. Here they are all three of them together  In their blue shirts and they became we I still don't know their names  I I guess it's probably here somewhere they became the the stars everybody was this just shows you  the what the opportunity is the  Certain groups of people likes like geeks and smart people and the people watch this network  Were this was the one of the most important days one of the most important events we lived through  glued to it glued to it and I can promise you that we're going to that twitter is going to  Fill the the gap here because there's just a horrible gap in science technology  And math you ever done a show for kids  No, in fact, we're already planning it now  You are in fact, i'm well, I won't go into the detail, but we're we're starting to look at  We want to create another channel  of  educational content  Yeah  Oh cool, including stuff for kids including stuff for grown-ups including projects including electronics including science technology engineering and math

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of people I I am i'm starting to put this together wouldn't be till next year  But it is something that this really calvinized that in my mind that that we really need to  Um is since there's another schools don't seem to be interested or at least most some schools and uh since obviously  Television has completely talked about stewardship completely dropped the ball

We're setting them in the wrong ways the things that we don't need and they're not going to be good for them  We're boring them  Um, yeah, I think you can do more than just push science technology and education  I think you can start to change education leo. Uh, I think we want to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although there's people ahead of us like salman khan and sebastian thrun  Uh, but I think it's part of a movement. There's something there's lots of opportunity

It's kind of neat to see this at the same time as you see the olympics  Where you see, uh human achievement in two different spheres  Just it's mind-boggling. Uh, it gives me it gives me hope  Both through science and both through well, I don't yes, I guess you're right  I think olympic performance very much influenced by some some more than others.

Here you go. This is from conan  O'brien.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  More than one a year one a day rather  That's impressive. Have I talked about mighty text? Did I do mighty text yet?  I don't think so. It's a chrome plugin. So I love this if you're using an android phone. It does not work on ios  Mighty text is a chrome plugin that lets you mighty text dot net slash app  You know what don't show it because now i'm so paranoid about my numbers and my emails and other people's numbers  I almost don't want to uh show this stuff online. But um, what it does is it allows you to  Go to the desktop start typing text messages. It uses your android phone  It's tied into that account and continuous threads back and forth  So you see the text on the phone you see the text on your chrome. It is really great. It will also notify you  If you get text on the desktop or if your phone rings on the desktop and it's free mighty text  Dot oh, what did I say dot net or dot com dot com?  Um  No, I think it's dot net mighty text dot  net  It is a google plugin and I think you're gonna really uh, really like it. I find it except it's not compatible with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Easter egg or error message it does it needs it needs an android phone and I asked him if it would work with ios  And they say no the restrictions on ios prevent it from working with ios, but it does it does work  It's more than google voice. Uh, by the way pictures will go through  Yeah, so no it's more than google voice  It's uh google voice does let you text from the desktop, but it's only text and there's and it's using your google voice number  Anyway, just try it and you'll see what I mean. I really like it  Uh, it's kind of like iMessage for android is I guess the probably the closest thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I i'm i've started to get notifications in google voice if someone has sent me an mms  And then I get the email I get it via email. Oh, well that works  Which is a little better than not getting any notification at all. Yeah used to be they'd send you a picture

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You didn't even know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you had no idea. Yeah, right  So but do you just say mms, you know, it says it sends you a text message saying mms received  And then I went to my email and I saw the picture so google voice is getting a little better  But that is definitely one of the most frustrating things about it
