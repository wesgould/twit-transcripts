It's time for Twig this week in Google.  The show we cover the latest news from the Googleverse.  Oh boy.  This is a depressing day in the Googleverse.  But fortunately, I have two of my favorite people to cheer me up.  Both Stacey and Jeff are on assignment, as they say.  Usually when they say on assignment in local news, it means they're throwing up in the back.  But in this case, I think they actually are on assignment.  Stacey's in Scandinavia, Jeff's in like England or somewhere.  I'm so glad Aunt Pruitt's here though.  We love the aunt.  Aunt Pruitt from Tech Republic.  A regular on all of our shows.  And as you might gather if you're watching the video, a Clemson Tiger fan.  You know it.  Just a little bit.  Aunt is a true Jeff fan.  She's a fan of the show.  She's a fan of the show.  She's a fan of the show.  Aunt is a true gentleman.  So it's always fun to have you on.  I appreciate it.  From, I want to say Atlanta? Where are you?  No, I'm right outside of Charlotte.  Charlotte, that's right.  And in honor of Aunt, also Mike Elgin is here.  From Elgin.com.  He is our gastronomad.  You just had your Mexico...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mexico City experience.  We ate, tacos, drank, mezcal.  And had a wonderful time.  Just ended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Aunt always has a little something from Scotland during the show.  And in your honor,  so what are you drinking today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a Glendulin 12 year single malt.  Yum yum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh and look he's drinking it in exactly the right glass.  Yeah, the camera said I'll take that.  Yeah, yeah.  That's good.  We're doing a little, you know, I was looking because I have some  I got some, a bunda or something that Richard Campbell from .net rocks had suggested.  But I guess I took it home.  But fortunately, and I didn't even know I had this,  but it was holding up my puppet.  My Leo puppet.  Really?  It was stuck up his butt.  And it's been there for years. I had no idea.  There's only a few fingers left of a McCallan cask strength.  Sherry aged.  So Mike and I are having a couple of fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The bottle was full when we sat down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's a reason.  This is an old fashioned Irish wake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you say you had bunahabin prior to that?  No, a bunda I think it's called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  A-B-U-N-D-A-H I think.  It's an abalur.  Abalur, a bunda.  There it is.  Abalaur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for those of you at home, Irish wake is not a tax scheme used by the government.  Oh, it won't let me look at this until I say I'm an abalaur.  I'm an abalaur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm an abalaur.  I'm only drinking cask strength now.  Because you get drunk faster.  You've transitioned from the life to the cask strength.  But this was a recommendation from Richard Campbell.  And so that's what I'm drinking.  But this McCallan is actually, I would say, as good if not better.  It's really good.  It's certainly the best website I've ever seen out of a whiskey purveyor.  Yeah. Pretty nice.  Beautiful.  You need to see the McCallan website.  It's pretty nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty nice.  It's pretty nice.  You need to see the McCallan site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You like the McCallan's? I like the McCallan's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love McCallan. I love it.  15 and 18.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say I've never had this before, but the evidence is completely to the contrary.  I don't remember.  I just don't remember.  It's been stuck up a puppet's butt for the last 10 years.  I don't know when we got this.  That bottle could talk.  It's aged in the puppet.  And it's delicious.  Anyway, we're drinking cask strength.  Anyway, we're having a little bit of a wake.  Because yesterday was the end of the line for about 20 different Google products.  It is so sad.  Inbox.  But the big one, and really I think from Mike Elgin's point of view,  probably the one that most mourned, is Google+.  Early in the day yesterday, we went there and said we're shutting down, but it was still around.  Later in the day, Google+, which is a great company,  is the only company that's still around.  And it's a great company.  And it's a great company.  And it's a great company.  And it's a great company.  And it's a great company.  Later in the day, Google+, is no longer available.  Later in the day, Google+, is no longer available.  This is the page you get.  And it's sad.  I did download all my stuff.  Hoping there would be something of use in there.  I doubt there is.  But at least I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a lot.  It was almost 4.5 GB of stuff.  Well, you used this in place of your blog for a while.  In place of everything.  So back in the day, 2011, I gave up,  I think I counted them,  I gave up 15 services, including my blog,  various social sites, a bunch of stuff.  And I said, I'm just going to use Google+, forever.  And then it was awesome for about three years or so.  And then after a while, Google+, kind of fell apart  And then after a while, Google+, kind of fell apart  And then after a while, Google+, kind of fell apart  And it wasn't what it used to be.  And I started using other services.  But there was three years where I used exactly one service.  But there was three years where I used exactly one service.  Were you Google+, or two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I loved Google+.  Because as a photographer, and Trey Ratcliffe used to say this too,  There's nowhere better to share your photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody remembers this,  but back in 2011, 2014, 2015,  But back in 2011, 2014, 2015,  Facebook photos were just disastrously horrible.  Facebook photos were just disastrously horrible.  They squeezed them.  And that's why photographers loved it.  Because Instagram, the pictures were all square then,  and low quality, small, couldn't share them.  And then Google+, had these,  they looked like full quality photos.  And so, eventually and grudgingly,  And so, eventually and grudgingly,  Facebook improved their photos.  But it took something like Google+, to make them do it.  But it took something like Google+, to make them do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it photo sharing for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was photos and it was the community.  I mean, so many awesome people  I mean, so many awesome people  over Google+, that I'd never heard of,  just regular Joes like myself.  And I'm still in touch with them today.  Now, granted, 90% of them  Now, granted, 90% of them  have no use for the world of Twitter,  or Facebook, or anything like that.  And then they pop in to Twitter to say hello  and just keep up with each other.  I really enjoyed the community over there  I really enjoyed the community over there  and I enjoyed the whole photo aspect of it  and I enjoyed the whole photo aspect of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  until they started screwing it up.  And photo editing on Google+, used to be better  than the current editing is on Google Photos.  And the other thing is that  and most active users will confirm this  and most active users will confirm this  but it was the only social network  that most of us ever used, where you would make real friends  and get together with those friends in real life.  So for example, the last hurl, I did a blog post about this,  my last hurl, hang out in real life  was a week and a half ago in Mexico.  was a week and a half ago in Mexico.  Dude that I'd been interacting with here and there  on Google+, for years and years  invited me to his house in Cuernavaca.  Wow.  We hung out with his family for like the weekend.  We took a road trip, we drank polkay  and by the side of the road we ate  crickets and armadillo together.  crickets and armadillo together.  Seriously.  That was the last hurl for me  because that's the kind of thing that Google+,  enable you to do is meet people all over the world  with whom you share various interests  and become friends and it really worked for that aspect.  and become friends and it really worked for that aspect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of hangouts, I remember  Barrett Tunde Thurston  during his book tour, if you will.  And he was doing a little hang out on the air  and decided, you know what,  I'm just going to let people join in.  And somehow he  had me pop into his hangout  and it was one of the best experiences for me.  I can't say that for him  but just being able to chat with him  and tell him who I was,  what I was doing, my endeavors  and all of that good stuff. It was great.  And to this day, I'm still in  touch with Mr. Thurston.  We became friends.  You bonded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did a hangout once  that lasted 12 or 13 hours I think.  And I was actually, I drove  from Silicon Valley to  Santa Barbara, California.  And kept it going the whole way.  And the way that I did that was  I started it with a  the camera was on an Apple in my house  in Silicon Valley.  And then I joined it with a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's no way I could show you Google Plus  except that there is still a YouTube channel  of Google Plus. And so for people who  don't remember how great this was.  Go ahead, keep going Mike. I didn't mean to interrupt you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. So I had a camera pointed at an Apple  a physical Apple. And then I joined  separately on the same account.  And a bunch of people were coming and going.  And the thing lasted for many, many hours.  And what's great is every time the Apple talked  it would go full screen. Exactly.  Yes. But unfortunately that Apple  wanted 33% of all the proceeds.  So I shut it down after a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We used Google Plus for shows.  We used it for sharing. We had Google Plus pages.  If you're looking at the layout on our video  right now, and again thank goodness  that's the old logo. Yeah, I think Google  will probably take all these videos down.  But let's see. Let me show you some more  Google Plus videos. Because they still  have a Google Plus page with a lot  of how-to videos on it.  It is kind of  nostalgic to look at this. What did they  do wrong? Because you know, honestly  I thought Google Plus was exactly what  a social network should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So my theory  They talked and didn't want to walk.  Well my theory is that what they get wrong  in all of these shutdowns  is they don't value  their most passionate users higher  than their average users.  And so I was listening to all about  Android, I think it was, and they were talking  and I think it was Flow  was saying that  you know, what they're doing  really benefits the  general users. It just  bothers those of us who are early adopters,  etc. My view  and it's a good point, but my view is that  they really should value their passionate  users more than their average users. Every other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  media business, and I would submit  that in this case it's kind of like a media business  treats its  they call them P1 listeners  treats its most avid  listeners as more important because  they're the bellwethers. They're the ones who  influence others. They're the ones  who make something grow.  And those are the bad people. Yeah, they're the  ones who care. And so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  those are the ones you want to push. They're the ones  who own and control podcast networks.  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  when you say they didn't  walk the walk ant, what do you mean by that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was part of  a couple different communities and one of them  was a Google hosted community  and they always talked  about having this improvement and that improvement  You're talking about the create plus or whatever  it was called?  Create something. Create something.  That sounds right. And  I get all of these emails and messages  about this and that and none of it ever happened.  Especially when it came to  controlling spam.  I'm not a big account if you will.  I didn't have millions of followers  and things like that. And it was  a challenge for me to just manage  going through the spam notifications  and turning this off and turning that off.  And it just got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it did get worse and worse.  It wasn't a big problem early on  but as Google Plus became  abandoned, it became overrun with spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The quality went way down.  The junk went way up.  Isn't that kind of inevitable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  though for social networks that they're fun  when it's just you and your friends  and then as soon as everybody else arrives?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't say that because  me being the big introvert  that I am, I don't really meet  a lot of people so I don't have a ton of  friends if you will.  But Google Plus connected me to  thousands of people  and it's sort of crazy that I can say  I would recognize  a couple hundred different names  because I saw them so regularly in my feed  as engaging every single day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing is that we  live in an age where one of our biggest problems  politically and socially is that we're all  in our own little worlds.  We're getting to the point where we can't relate to people  in other countries or other political perspectives.  And Google Plus was the only  social network where you're constantly  meeting people from all over the world.  How many Pakistani people have you met  on Facebook that have become your friends?  It doesn't happen.  Facebook keeps you fenced in  to your own existing world  whereas Google Plus was all based on  interests and so what Ant was saying  you'd be having conversations with  30 people and like  none of whom you knew.  Five of them were from the US and most of whom  became familiar to you because they were constantly  engaging in conversations with you  and stuff like that. That was just really a unique

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  social network.  Maybe this is just me but I think it's beautiful.  I think it's a good design.  It didn't play as  well on mobile. Is that part of the problem?  It came to us  five years ago when mobile was  just beginning to rise.  This is really best on  desktop I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I started having performance issues  about two years ago on mobile  and on the desktop service.  It was just not  refreshing and not loading.  I'd see things that were two days old  or several hours old.  I was always behind.  When I mentioned this to the support  people as far as leave feedback  or whatever, it went nowhere.  It just continued.  Then when my images started looking like  8-bit images, I was done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think they abandoned it early on?  The history of  Google Plus is that Vic Gondotra  who at the time was  vice president of Google  really lobbied hard.  We've read stories from people  that this was Vic's baby.  He got everybody  enrolled. In fact, at one point  your bonus at Google  no matter what division you were in  was based on your social  about how well you'd integrated social  into your product. It started in 2011.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was Larry Page's first edict  when he became the CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vic was Larry's fair-haired boy.  Larry bought into it.  Google Plus was the  number one initiative  from Google for about a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a theory about what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My theory is that Vic Gondotra  was not culturally  a good fit for Google. Why?  Because he understood people.  This was just like  he was more of an  Apple kind of person.  Even though his background was actually at Microsoft.  He was a very warm  people person who really worked hard.  He was very engaging,  very charismatic.  Google, they don't have time for that.  I think there was a war  between Vic Gondotra  and Sundar Pichai that probably raged  the whole time that Vic was there  doing his Google.  And Sundar won.  As soon as Sundar won,  they were like, okay, we're deprioritizing this.  It was political.  All the things that Ant mentioned.  They were using human and  compute resources off of Google Plus  and using them for other things.  And then Sundar Pichai himself,  his last Google Plus post  I think was 2016.  And he was using Twitter.  How are you  the CEO of a company that  owns a social network and you  use the competitor social network?  It would be like Mark Zuckerberg ignoring  Facebook instead doing everything on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were also issues, much like  Microsoft's infighting issues  with different teams. I remember there was a long  Twitter thread a few months ago by somebody  who was on one of the teams  who said that the Gmail people  refused to integrate  the features from Google Plus in  because they had something similar  and this was something that almost  killed Microsoft.  If it doesn't, Windows team and  Office team fighting  any other team.  Silo's.  Google Plus wasn't perfect.  Circles might have been a bad idea.  But on the other hand  the thing that really is frustrating is  things like Picasa which Google bought  then turned into Google Photos. Eventually  all the best features were migrated  to Google Plus because Google's thinking  this is our future.  And then they've disappeared now because  it wasn't the future, it was a dead end road  and they just sent them off into the  bit bucket. Hangouts  which at the time was  the chat interface for Google Plus  has really struggled since.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  President Obama did Hangouts.  Remember that? Trey Radcliffe

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we had a show that was Trey doing  Hangouts. It was easy for him  to do. He was in New Zealand already but it was  on our network because he could do it from New  Zealand. Other people could join him. He'd have the six people.  When Hangouts first started I  had a number of different panels  via Hangouts. I used to love watching  that show. Trey's show? Yeah.  So I think  I think that was that you Mike  or just somebody who looks like you?  No, just somebody who looks like me actually.  A middle-aged guy with  gray hair and glasses.  It could be both of us. It's generic.  I think they're using that this person does  not exist. GAN generation to  generate these people.  Some of the things persist. Those little thumb  icons. Those are still around  in Hangouts. But most of this  stuff just went down the tubes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just can't imagine. The only explanation  for killing it is politics,  revenge, something internal.  Something Microsoftian. Remember back in the  old days of Microsoft, every Microsoft division  was at war with every other division.  It really harmed them during the  bomber years. I think they've gotten better  to a certain extent because they've  overcome that to a certain extent.  Because there's no reason  not to keep Google Plus going.  It thrilled the most passion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a really interesting point. Why kill it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much could that have cost them to keep it going?  Exactly. It could be the laboratory for all kinds of new ideas.  This thing that Ant Pruitt  mentioned a minute ago, the Create Plus  community or whatever it was called,  was the worst idea you could imagine.  I thought that as a policy  that whole program was all about  harming Google Plus. Because what they did was  they personally reached out  to people like Ant Pruitt and said,  you're a content creator.  You create all this great content for Google Plus.  We're going to create a closed  community just for people like you.  They took the most creative, productive  people and they gave them a place to  post things where nobody could see it.  Why would you do that?  You want those people posting in public  and evangelizing the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I was doing. I was just double posting.  I would just go in there occasionally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and complaining about it and then leaving.  Here's another example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was Google Plus events  which you would post  which you would publicize an event  with invitations.  This was awesome.  Then everybody who was at the event  could turn on party mode and the pictures  from the event would all be shared into a  Google Plus event thread.  I loved that.  This would kill today. If somebody announced that today

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it would kill.  There are young people watching the show right now  that didn't ever see that feature and are now saying  wow, really? That's amazing. I want that.  It's like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I started my smartphone photographers community  on Google Plus.  Having features like that was just  great for content.  It was so easy.  It was all the click of a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I'm just getting angry.  Now I'm just mad.  I need a drink.  This is why we broke out the whiskey.  Doesn't this hurt Google that they keep  doing this to stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly,  not when all you're worried about is AdWorks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Major League Baseball,  it's almost 20 years ago now,  had a strike. The season was canceled  and they lost part of another season.  For me, baseball  never was as good again.  I was a huge fan.  I went to 40 or 50 games a year  the year before the strike.  Maybe one game a season since  the strike and I don't watch it on TV.  This reminds me of that.  This isn't what all  Google does, but this broke my heart.  Honestly,  I have to think this hurts Google.  I understand Ruth Porat, their CFO,  is looking at divisions saying,  it doesn't make money, cut it, cut it, cut it.  That's good business.  But you also have to recognize  the social role, especially  a company like Google plays,  and acknowledge that.  The damage this does to the company  I think is significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did this on small projects  for many, many years.  There's a really good one  that came out recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were showing it a couple weeks ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the Google Graveyard.  When they killed Reader,  that's when you first really started hearing people.  Reader was another one.  That was the first big one that people were really passionate about.  These are live hangouts like we were talking about.  Then it was one thing after another.  Now it's like a blood bath this week  of all kinds of things that are being killed.  April 2nd was like...  The night of the strike.  The night of long knives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the night of long knives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a challenge they had  was trying to answer the question  that I got every single time I mentioned Google+.  Well, who's over there that I know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's true of all social networks.  I'm on a number of  attempts to replace  proprietary social networks  with open, federated networks.  So, Mastodon instead of Twitter.  Pixel Fed instead of Instagram.  Which I really like.  But there's no one there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As journalists,  we kind of have to be on Twitter.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I cannot do it.  I can't bring myself to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For me, I'm on Twitter.  I compulsively have to just  blurt something out sometimes.  So I do it on Twitter.  It's great for that.  It's like you say.  I'm on Twitter every week.  Saying, are you going to go on WeMe?  Are you going to go on Pluspora?  Are you going to try LinkedIn?  I can't be on all of them.  And if I'm on any one of them,  it's like a tiny community.  So I'm just doing what you're doing, Leo.  I'm mostly focusing on the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We really lost something.  I'm sad to say.  And it's not just Google+.  Inbox.  I've never used that.  I've kind of got off Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never used it.  But I am glad to see some of the features  slide on over into Gmail.  Because I'm not an inbox zero kind of guy.  So inbox just never really worked for me.  But it's nice seeing stuff like that snooze feature  and other things like that popping up  inside of Gmail to make my life easier.  And they're going to be adding a feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pretty soon.  Where you can schedule a lot of things.  So when you launch a new email,  you can say send this out next month  at Tuesday at 3 o'clock.  That's going to be pretty cool.  I went back and forth between the two.  And I am an inbox zero kind of guy.  And the second they mention they're going to kill inbox,  I'm like okay, I'm not going to invest that much time.  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm telling you that hurts Google.  Because Lisa, who is not as obsessive  about this stuff as we are,  I can't remember what it was some new thing.  I can't remember what it was.  She said, well I'm not going to do that.  It's Google.  And I think honestly,  that's got to be a very common point of view.  This is one of many sites,  but this is the one we were talking about.  Killedbygoogle.com.  And it's 155  apps  and services.  I totally forgot about the URL shortener.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google.gl is gone.  Inbox by Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google.com is gone.  Inbox by Gmail.  What are some of the other ones?  YouTube annotations.  Chromecast Audio, three months ago.  This was a great product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone in the chat room pointed out  that Feedburner still exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is weird, because I thought they'd kill it  the minute they bought it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I just think they can't find the password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When we started Twitter,  Feedburner was the way you created feeds.  We used Feedburner. Google bought it.  It's fun. It's over now.  12 years later, it's still alive.  It's ignored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like that guy  after World War II on the Japanese islands.  Defending the islands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody told them the war's over.  Project Tango.  Saved to Google Chrome extension.  Google Goggles.  Glass OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spaces.  And I'll point out that a third of these products  were going to be the future of all of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the one where it was the modular smartphone.  I didn't think highly of it,  but a lot of people thought,  this is what you want,  because you add features to your phone as you need them.  It was a Motorola project. Google bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't they announce they were going to distribute that  from Puerto Rican taco trucks or something like that?  Was that RF?  It was made in Puerto Rico, I think.  Gone.  I was like looking for flights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Now. Remember Google Now?  At the time, I thought that was going to be the...  That was it.  It was over. That was the next big thing.  We still have remnants of that right now, though, right?  Yeah, sort of. If you go to the Google app,  it's a little bit of Google News.  It's a little bit of Google Now.  It's not anything.  And that's really the problem.  It's not anything. It's just a thing.  And again, nobody's going to invest in any of this  if you can't count on Google to keep it around.  I think the only thing that could save Google's reputation  at this point is if they had a new policy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and Google, if you're listening, and I hope you are,  every time you launch a new service,  you should essentially promise that you won't kill it  for at least a certain amount of time.  So for example, you launch a new service  and you should say, okay, we're not going to kill this  until 2030.  And if they change their mind later  and want to kill it even later than that,  they should update that.  But everything should have a new policy.  And if you're going to launch a new service,  they should update that.  Everything should have a, we promise we won't kill it  by this date.  And then people could look at that and go, okay,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to use it.  I still wouldn't, because I know they're going to kill it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in five years.  So it's like, I'm not going to put any energy into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man.  This list is...  I need a drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To a certain extent, the new Yahoo.  Because I remember for years,  you'd learn about Yahoo products  when they canceled it.  And you're like, wow, that sounds incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard it.  Oh, Yahoo's doing that? No, they're not.  No, they just...  They bought it, they ignored it, now they're killing it.  So what lessons,  what have we learned?  Here's a piece from Adweek.  I don't exactly think Adweek knows  what we learned from the shutdown of Google Plus.  But the aim, according to Vic Gundotra,  was to transform Google into a social destination  at a level and scale  never previously attempted.  Now remember, the climate of the time was  Facebook is eating our lunch.  That web search has no future.  The social graph  that Facebook's using  for search is going to eat us alive.  We've got to do something.  Now the irony is  Facebook's social graph search  died shortly after they launched it.  Facebook's as bad as Google  in that regard.  Mark Zuckerberg reportedly considered  Google Plus to be an existential threat.  He declared an internal lockdown.  No one can leave  until we can come up with a way  to effectively counter it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I remember those heady days, basically  Eric Schmidt, 2010 I think it was,  said that  articulated Google's social strategy  to counter the Facebook threat.  And he basically said,  we're going to build social into everything.  If you recall a Google reader before they killed it,  you could suddenly share.  You could get algorithmic sorting of your feed  and all this horrible stuff that doesn't belong  on a RSS reader.  And this policy of  everybody's bonuses are tied to social  actually was implemented  when that was the policy.  When you're going to have an inside out social network  with social built into everything.  Vic Indotra apparently won the day,  won the argument and said,  no, we need an actual destination.  Instead of everything having social,  everything is going to be built into  or supported by our social network.  So they forcibly  shoehorned in YouTube and all these other things.  And that became the new policy.  And I think that was the right policy actually.  I think they were too aggressive.  From a revenue point of view it was.  Well, from just like a  give your most passionate users a place to go  and evangelize your products  other than Facebook.  Give your passionate users a playground  where they can do all this amazing  Google-y stuff and play with AI.  Interact with each other and  post amazing pictures.  Post amazing pictures from the phones  that you guys are selling.  There's a lot of promotional benefit  to having a place.  Every time there's a Google announcement,  they used to announce them on Google Plus  and everybody would go to Google Plus  and comment on Google's announcements.  Well that was the best thing about Google Plus.  If you wanted to talk to somebody at Google,  they were there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact that was kind of the wrap  on Google Plus was  the only people there really are the Googleers themselves.  But that's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There were two kinds of complaints  about Google Plus.  And this is one of the problems with the network  structurally.  And Pruitt said, I couldn't keep up.  It was a fire hose of activity.  And then other people would be like, nothing's happening.  There is no activity.  So it was one or the other.  Nobody had the right amount of activity on their feed.  And circles didn't really do the right thing.  Circles were too confusing.  I think Google overestimated the patience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You had to spend a lot of energy to  cultivate and create your circles.  And then the other thing Google did wrong  and they did it with Google Buzz first and then they did it  with Circles which was, your contact list now  is populated by all these circles.  I still have birthdates of people that I followed  in Google Plus Circles.  I'm trying to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like, why do I have this person's phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because of Circles!  Actually, I think Marion Riedel  in Adweek has one  that kind of got it right.  He says, in many ways,  Google Plus was a start-up.  It lacked the heart of a founder.  The ultimate product owner.  The caretaker who seriously invested in the product  and fights endlessly on its behalf.  That's what Vic did in the early days.  But once he left...  A political battle.  It's like Game of Thrones in there.  He's like Robert Baratheon, the crazy king.  He got kicked out. He got his head chopped off.  And now, somebody else...  While Google may be breathing a collective sigh of relief  with the Google Plus shutdown,  Google's biggest loss,  and this is Marion Riedel writing,  she is the CEO and founder of Pashpost.  I think she's really right on, actually,  now that I've read this.  Google's biggest loss is one the company may never have internalized  was theirs to lose.  The hard-won, heartfelt trust  of millions of community members  who used Google Plus.  That loss, more than anything,  speaks directly to how the Google Plus debacle came about  and why it's displaced community members.  Maybe I don't agree with this.  We'll ultimately be better off on new platforms  that pay a high premium,  place a high premium on what it means to value  and serve that trust.  I don't know who that is. It's not Twitter. It's not Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no place.  That's a similar point to one that I've made as well,  which is that  if you keep  destroying  the platforms that you have gotten  your most passionate users to embrace,  they will find somebody else's platform to love.  In the world of social,  I don't know what that is.  Facebook is unlovable.  But like in other things,  in email, for example,  people who are super invested in inbox,  they're going to say, screw Gmail.  In fact, later in the show, I'll be talking about  screwing Gmail.  I'm talking about  a company that's basically saying  there's an opportunity to steal  Google users off of Gmail.  Good!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ronam Audio, Ars Technica,  Google's constant brand  or I'm sorry,  product showdowns are damaging its brand.  Please, just stop closing things,  he writes. Google's product support  has become a joke and the company should be  very concerned.  He also mentions Google Fiber.  Yeah.  Allo.  I mean, this has been a  bloodbath this year.  So,  he says Google's products  require trust and investment.  And that's exactly what you're not getting right now.  You're getting a kind of a ruthless  picture of Google that, you know,  it survives or it dies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it does that quickly.  This to me is likely to be a classic problem  of overly focusing  on the measurable. So they can see how much  it costs to run Google Plus and Inbox.  They're very data driven, aren't they?  Right. But the unmeasurables  are how millions of people feel  about Google. How much trust  is out there. You can't measure that.  I mean, you can do a survey or whatever, but you can't really  measure what's going on in the minds of developers  who are trying to figure out the  way to get the best out of the universities  and thinking, well, which platform should I  embrace?  Should it be Google's or some competitor?  And you can't measure  some student who's going to  grow up and like  write the alternative to Google Search  and just crush Google,  which that person could have been a Google evangelist,  but you can't measure any of that stuff.  And so, I think that's why you need a visionary founder.  I mean, for example, Google Plus  was the stuff of visionary founders.  The reason there were the hangouts allowed you  to talk to 10 people simultaneously  is because the individual person  of Larry Page says, I want 10.  And they're like, yes, sir. Okay, yes.  And that's why Apple used to be great.  Because Steve Jobs didn't like the color blue on their Mac  and they said,  yes, we'll change it by tomorrow, whatever it was.  And you need that kind of  visionary founder who has a gut  feel for the zeitgeist  of the community and  gives them what they want. Right now, it seems like  Google management is run by  bean counters and  you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say this is an existential threat to Google  because with people like Elizabeth Warren  and now I think there's a drum beat  saying, break up Google.  There aren't fans to say no.  There's nobody who says,  oh no, we've got to save this.  Ron makes the point that a lot of people  had made that this is a structural problem  with the way Google works.  He says Google's strategy of having multiple teams  throw things against the wall to see what  sticks leads to lots  and lots of products and services  launching all the time.  All with varying levels of quality, integration  with other Google products and varying lifetimes.  It also leads to lots and lots of  product cancellations.  Google's in love with creating  new stuff. They're not in love with maintaining  existing stuff. That's always been  the wrap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Question for you guys.  What if Google was just strictly search?  Nothing to do with  Android phones or anything like that.  What if they were just strictly search?  Would they still be the healthy  strong company that they are today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  To a certain extent, and this is  not exactly to your question,  but that's what Google Plus was actually.  I've made the case that  it was a search engine  for YouTube.  It was a search engine for all social  content. It was a search engine for news.  It was a search engine for everything.  Everything was based on search.  If I followed Ant Pruitt  on Google Plus,  that was just a search for his name.  It was a saved search.  Because everything was integrated  into Google Plus, they basically took the whole  world and put it into a  search engine. They themselves  said  all the top brass involved with Google Plus  said, this is not the future  of social. This is the future of Google.  They implied that in the future  there would just be Google Plus  and that would be your everything.  It would basically be a search engine  where you can post directly to the search engine.  That doesn't answer your question.  To answer your question, I think they would be  successful as a search company, but  they wouldn't have the power that they do.  Which is kind of the point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for people like Elizabeth Warren.  Search plus ad sales.  Search plus ads. But they go together.  The reason they created Android is because  they wanted people to be using Google  in many, many ways.  They wanted a billion phones in a billion pockets.  So it just expanded  their reach for ads and search.  But I don't think they should own  YouTube. I don't think they should be  doing social stuff. I think they should be making  they would be just as dominant  if all they did was search, wouldn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'd still be the number one search engine.  I think they'd be just as dominant in search.  But YouTube gives them enormous  reach and power.  And troubles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, later on we'll see  the kinds of troubles.  And they're not handling them well.  And I don't like it.  And the EU doesn't like it.  Because Google, whether you believe it or not,  is tempted to  raise the search results  of its own products.  The EU dinged them for shopping.  YouTube's not far behind.  If you search for anything, there's a YouTube video  at the top of the page for it.  Now maybe Google says that's what users want.  But I don't think it's  seemly.  And in fact, Larry Page, when he wrote the first  paper and delivered the first paper about Google  was very clear. He said we shouldn't have  any advertising because whether you  mean to or not, the selling of advertising  will taint the search results.  And acquiring all these other  side products has  absolutely done that.  So I think, and honestly,  I'm not sure I'd say  you should break up Google. I don't know if that's the right  answer. But if Google were  just a search plus advertising company,  their revenue would be cut a little bit.  Although the vast majority of their  revenue is from search.  But more importantly, I think they'd be a better search  engine. A more  trustworthy search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's the thing.  You look at some people are  really good at doing one thing.  And it sort of diminishes  their credibility when they  start dabbling into other things  and multitasking.  I guess it sort of depends on the case and depends  on the person. But I just thought  about that. What if they only  worried about search and the actual  ad space that they  sell in search? Because  everybody uses Google to look  up stuff. Sorry, Bing.  Not everybody uses you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interestingly now with Google Stadia,  which they've announced but not launched,  that's the thing now that I remember  that Lisa said, well I'm not going to spend  any energy on Google Stadia because it's just  going to be killed in six months or whatever.  And I bet you that's a very  Yeah.  That's got to be kind of  and really the people that Stadia  has to win over first  are developers, game developers.  Do you think game developers are thinking,  oh yeah this is going to be a great opportunity.  Google's going all in on streaming  gaming. No, they're going to go to a Sony.  They're going to go to Microsoft. They're going to go  to people who game and don't kill every  product they invent. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And people think that gaming is frivolous.  Yeah, people think gaming is frivolous.  But if you're a developer, it's everything.  It's a lifetime commitment to become  a developer for a specific  platform because it takes years, especially  with more sophisticated gaming  and VR coming online. It's  a major, I mean I can switch email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to make a weird prediction. We'll see if I'm right.  I bet Stadia never launches.  Wow.  Yeah. Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it's a non-starter.  Actually there were previous game initiatives  that they never launched. They said they were going to launch one around  Google+. They announced it at Google I.O.  and they're like, oh we're going to have this whole thing.  And it's going to be the Play Store and Google Plus is where  everything's going to happen. And you're going to watch  the games. And they even mentioned that  gaming has become a spectator sport.  So everybody wants to watch it and blah, blah, blah.  Everybody's excited. Everybody forgot about it and then it never launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All Google did with the Stadia announcement is  provide a nice fat target  for Microsoft, Sony, and Amazon  to aim at at E3.  And you're going to see all three of them respond  with more games, more exclusives,  better thought out plans,  and I bet you Stadia never launches.  And just eat Google's lunch?  It's just not going to launch. No developer's going to write a game for it.  And Apple, let's not forget,  Apple Arcade.  A billion phones. A billion.  You're in a billion pockets, y'all, as Oprah said.  How many pockets is Google Stadia in?  You have an Android TV device, right?  No!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm the only person that does.  I have a shield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Guess what? You know what's on the shield?  GeForce Now!  It does the same thing now!  Stadia,  it does just come to me now,  the Stadia. I was all excited watching the Stadia.  You know, I get this, we all do this  and I'm like, I'm going to have a bloody distortion feel  that these keynotes will go, this looks great, this is all...  Stadia will never launch.  And if it does, it'll be killed almost instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wasn't excited because I think about bandwidth.  Right!  I'm here in the South,  where there's a lot of rural areas,  I can't even say that word, I'm so country.  Say rural juror.  By country, he means drunk because he's been drinking.  And people's internet is just  not going to be fast enough, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were talking about, oh, we're going to have  10 great servers, 10 teraflops, blah, blah, blah.  They didn't mention that frayed line going from  their fancy, shiny servers to my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In those multiplayer games that they were demoing,  latency is the only thing.  I mean, it's everything.  You can't have a tenth of a second delay.  It's fatal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Write this down, I predict it will never launch.  That's my prediction for the week.  I'm terrible at predictions, I'm always wrong.  In fact, I'm guaranteeing it'll launch by saying that.  Ant Pruitt is here, he's the host.  He's the host.  Ant Pruitt is here.  He is always welcome on this show.  Bring your whiskey, bring your ants.  Ant Pruitt from Tech Republic and many other places.  Love having you on the show.  Thank you for being here.  Mike Elgin, who spends more money on airplane tickets  than he does on anything else.  He's back in town after a hugely successful  gastronomad tour of Mexico City.  What's next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was fantastic.  We're doing two week experience in Morocco.  In Fez?  We're going to Fez, Marrakesh, we're going to go into the  Sahara, we're going to Esowiro, which is a beach town.  We're going to the Chef Chawan,  Blue Village of Chef Chawan.  I actually love Morocco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were in Tangier a couple of months ago.  Lisa and I both fell in love with it.  It's a beautiful country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tangier is of course a very unique city,  but there are elements of it that are very  universally Moroccan.  It's such a cool country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just such a beautiful country.  And the food, the architecture.  The beauty of Morocco is fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really is.  Not Arab originally, Berber.  Berber, right.  There are lots and lots of Berber tribes.  The Berber people in general in Morocco that I've met  are just like the most wonderful people  you'll ever meet.  Moroccans in general are very friendly.  Berbers are very cool people.  We're going to be doing that shortly.  We're leaving Sunday to go back to Morocco  to finish the preparation of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only reason you ever come on this show  is because you have a grandchild in the South Bay.  I know the truth.  I know the real truth.  He has to come see his granddaughter,  which is our blessing.  Glad to have you.  Elgin.com and of course, is there room?  Nope, sold out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Morocco sold out, the next Prosecco sold out,  but after that Prosecco-Provance,  another Mexico City experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just thrilled to see sold out.  To me, I'm happy for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's getting to the point where people  are starting to get to know each other.  I'm guessing that in a couple of years,  100% of the people who do these experiences

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  will be repeats.  That's what happened with Geek Cruises.  I used to do those Geek Cruises.  Over about five or ten years,  it pretty much was the same people  every single time because it's so much fun.  Once you do it once, you go,  that's my vacation next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the community.  I also want to give you this quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Mexico's best coffee.  The coffee comes in a box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the bag.  This shows the Macuca Cafe.  This is one of the cafes owned by our friend,  Ricardo, but it's actually  we got it at Barola Cafe.  If you're ever in Mexico City, go to Barola Cafe.  It's the best coffee over.  This coffee grows in a specific  mountainside in southern Mexico.  If you try to grow it anywhere else,  it does not taste anything like  this coffee.  This is such great coffee.  It's an espresso roast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know that's what I do.  I can't wait.  I just got a new Breville coffee maker.  An updated coffee maker.  With a burr grinder and everything.  Thank you, Mike.  Taste of Mexico.  All you got was a couple of fingers of Macallan.  That's how it works here at Twig.  Our show today brought to you by  LastPass.  It is literally, I'm getting a new computer  I mention tomorrow, first thing I'll install.  LastPass.  First thing I saw on any new phone.  LastPass.  LastPass is my password manager.  The reason I used LastPass, started using it  ten years ago, is it was clear  that I had to remember too many passwords.  The temptation, and I think when I started  using LastPass, I was falling prey to this,  was to use  the same password or a slight  variation of that everywhere.  We now know that is a horrific  security practice because if one site gets  breached, the bad guys now have your password  and they just try it on every other site.  You can't reuse passwords.  You shouldn't have passwords. You can remember.  Because if it's easy to remember, it's easy to break.  It's easy to guess.  So what LastPass does is it generates long,  strong, completely impossible to  memorize passwords.  You get to provide all the, you know,  parameters.  It's got punctuation.  They even have a couple of nice things like,  they don't put ambiguous characters in if you say,  so I can't have an O and a zero.  Which is great. Makes it much easier for me to read them.  But the best part is,  I don't ever have to really type them  or read them, because LastPass  also fills in those  passwords everywhere I go.  And not just websites, but on iOS and Android,  on apps too.  So that's why it's the first thing I install.  I install that, and then as I install apps,  boom, boom, boom, because the passwords get filled in by LastPass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no idea what any of my passwords are.  You shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honestly, if you do, that's a bad sign.  Well, there's one you need to know, which is your LastPass password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But make that...  I know maybe two passwords.  And after that, I have no idea.  And it's all good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is doubly true in business.  Now, I'm a LastPass premium user for years.  Actually, when I got married,  we got LastPass family.  Made it easy for me to share passwords with Lisa.  But also, she's my designated  LastPass survivor.  And that's important,  because people often  become disabled or pass on  without passing on their passwords.  So if anything should happen to me,  Lisa will get access to my passwords.  They send you an email.  You say, if I don't respond to that email in a period of time,  then you can give Lisa the passwords.  And that's really a great feature  of LastPass families.  There's also LastPass for Teams, if you have a small business,  we use LastPass Enterprise.  And in fact, we're not alone.  43,000 businesses use LastPass.  It's literally the number one most preferred  password manager.  The reason businesses use it, well, because everything  bad that you could do with passwords,  your employees are doing  and more. Things you never even thought of.  Putting your passwords on Post-it notes  right there on the screen.  We know that more than half of all employees share passwords.  And not just with other employees, with other people in the world.  With LastPass Enterprise,  for instance,  our business department doesn't even have the passwords  to get into our bank account.  They can get in, but they never see that password.  That means they can't share it. They can't copy it down.  I can change it anytime. They still can get in,  but they can't get the password.  We have folders, so all the people in the dev team,  the ops team,  the business team have shared passwords.  So they all have access to it.  There are over a hundred policies in LastPass Enterprise.  Things like how strong  the master password is.  We require second-factor authentication as well.  And boy, they support everything.  I use a YubiKey for my LastPass word.  I feel really safe with that.  They support Duo Security,  but also Google Authenticator.  In fact, LastPass has its own authenticator.  I really like that because you don't have to type any letters.  It just says approve or deny.  So that's easy for employees.  It's free to use.  LastPass is really the solution  that you need for your business.  You don't want to be on that headline  big breach, effects, twit.  No, I don't want that headline.  So protect yourself with LastPass.  LastPass.com slash twit.  13.5 million people use LastPass.  I've used it for more than a decade.  Since they first started.  Steve Gibson, a few years ago,  I said Steve, meet Joe Segrist,  the creator of LastPass.  Talk to him, look at his source code, see how he does it.  Steve was very impressed.  He uses LastPass. That's a good sign.  Our security guy uses LastPass.  LastPass for the whole enterprise.  LastPass.com slash twit.  Encrypted everywhere.  Only decrypted on your device.  So LastPass can't even see your passwords.  No one can see them except you.  I can go on and on and on, but really  this bottom line is you need LastPass.  You need it for yourself. You need it for your business.  LastPass.com slash twit.  Go there, find out how they can help you.  And please use that URL.  Because as much as we appreciate LastPass support,  it's nice if they know you heard it here.  LastPass.com slash twit.  Thank you, LastPass, for doing such a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, enough.  Jason Howell got me on LastPass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did he? Good.  It's easy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  It's for people who hate passwords,  not for people who love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's for people who never want to deal with it again.  And I use, one of the things LastPass also does  with the enterprise version is you can have it  so that when you log into the enterprise version,  you can have it in your personal version.  So one login and all my passwords are there.  And when I save a password, it saves it to the personal,  but it's available no matter where I am.  So that's it.  And still keeps them separate.  Oh yeah, it's completely separate.  But it's simple because I only have one password to remember.  All right.  I think I'm out of whiskey, so the wake is over.  It's time to live again.  And Google Fi continues, thank goodness.  That's Google's MVNO, which I really like.  I use it on a Pixel 3.  Can't use it on, really sensibly,  can't use it on anything else.  You wrote an article, which I haven't read yet,  I'm very interested to hear you say,  why you should use Google Fi, but not mobile data.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this actually began with a conversation  I had with Jason.  I think he was hosting something.  You were out of the country and Jason was hosting  the show, actually.  Probably was, yeah.  And I think it was before the show,  I mentioned to him that when I'm in the US,  I just turn off data, and I end up having phone calls  and texts, plus the ability to use WiFi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And nowadays you're always near WiFi, right?  But what about when you're out in the car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you do?  So this is the thing, so we have multiple problems.  One is we all are cheapskates and want to hang on  to as much of our money as possible.  That's a sensible thing.  So I'm going to use Google Fi,  it costs $20 a month for my phone bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just phone, because it's voice and text for $20.  Voice and text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $10 a gigabyte for data.  Exactly, but if I don't use data,  you don't pay any of that, and it's a very inexpensive way.  And in fact, if you never turn on,  the point I make in this column is if you never turn on  data on a Google Fi phone, you save about as much money  as you need to buy a new Pixel phone every year.  So it's a free phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The average smartphone user you write  touches her phone $2,600 a month.  So you're going 2,617 times a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is the other problem it solves.  We all have this problem of overuse and phone addiction,  social media addiction.  And if you don't have a connection to social  or to the internet when you're out and about  socializing with people.  Oh, you pay attention.  You pay attention, but you can still get calls and texts.  So if there's an emergency, you can still get it.  You're not disconnected. You just can't tweet.  So you can be an addicted...  How am I supposed to play Pokemon Go?  Exactly, Leo.  You can't play Pokemon Go these addictive ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right. You know, I think that all the time,  especially when I catch myself driving  and playing Pokemon Go.  That's when I think, this is going to kill me.  This game is actually going to kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  The Grim Reaper is going to catch you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you say go into your settings  on whatever phone you use and turn off mobile data.  Yes, turn off mobile data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then if you really need mobile data  for some reason,  you really want to play Pokemon Go,  turn it on.  But the point is that make it more difficult  to be constantly glued to your screen.  I've been observing this phenomenon  for years and also looking at the numbers  about how much...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See that button? I'm going to press it.  Mobile data is gone. I just turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're still on Wi-Fi here in the Twister.  So I have data now.  But as soon as I get in the car...  When you're in the restaurant or when you're in the car  or whatever, you won't be connected to the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's heresy. But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a sane, simple, trivially simple way  for us to hold the line against smartphone addiction.  And the problem gets worse every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You really got to look at yourself in the mirror.  I looked at myself in the mirror  probably about two years ago  and noticed that I was just totally addicted.  Because I love technology,  so I was always reading my phone,  reading articles about technology  and this and that and answering notifications  and just totally stressing myself out  for no reason at all.  And now it is...  You do this too?  Oh, I was bad about it.  But now I still have all of my data and stuff connected.  But there are a lot of times where my phone  is in another room somewhere and I have no idea.  And I get a lot of angry voicemails  and texts and stuff from the missus.  Like, why aren't you answering my phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People expect you to be always available, don't they?  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is the thing. You can always be available  by phone or text, which are non-addictive  communications media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm doing it on my other phone.  I'm so bad I have multiple phones I have to turn off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cellular data.  It's okay, you don't have a problem, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a professional.  I'm a trained professional.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do not try this at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. I also have to find my Pokemon Go ball  and turn that off.  Oh man.  I'm going to be shaking in a minute.  No, this is really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a simple thing.  It's so simple. And again, if you have a Google Fi phone,  then a Google Fi phone is a pretty small mobile bill.  They're practically giving it away.  It's a free phone every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to be paying $90 a month for T-Mobile  no matter what.  For Verizon, $90 a month no matter what.  But my Google Fi phone is just $20.  So, something to be said about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you could turn it on for Maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the other part of it that I wanted to highlight  in this article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're having something that nobody has really  mentioned or commented upon,  which is a mobile phone.  And we're going to be talking about a Google Fi phone  that we haven't commented upon,  which is an offline revolution.  So, Google just recently announced  offline voice dictation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. Gboard will dictate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  even if you don't online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Offline Maps for Google works  exactly as good as online Maps.  And in fact, if you haven't looked lately,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Maps will automatically download your neighborhood.  It probably already has it.  I use offline Maps all over the world.  It's fantastic.  And it's a great way to get information.  So, I recommend an app called Maps.me.  Maps.me.  Which has way better walking directions than Google.  And it's totally offline.  There are all kinds of things that are offline.  So, you can take pictures.  You can make and receive phone calls and texts.  You can do Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just can't post pictures to Instagram until you get home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can do it when you get home.  This is a healthier thing to wait for that process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm going to do it. I'm going to Hawaii.  I'm going to do it on vacation.  Just to see if I can survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you're in Hawaii, you're in paradise.  I should enjoy Hawaii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pokemon Go looks the same  in Hawaii as it does here.  It doesn't have a little shirt, like a Hawaiian shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should be characters.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like this.  And it's basically a free phone every year.  I like that.  Google, buy your phone.  I'd have to get a new plan on T-Mobile and Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know someone that's on Google Fi  and they seem to complain about their monthly bill  as far as it being fluctuating all the time.  And they couldn't quite figure out the math on it.  Well, when I was just leaving data on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would blow past the six gigabytes.  After six gigabytes they pay for it  and at 15 gigs they throttle it.  And I was at 15 gigs like five days in to the month.  And so, nowadays I really slow it down.  There's some cases when I'm on the phone  and I'm like, I'm going to go to the gym.  I'm going to go to the gym.  I'm going to go to the gym.  There's some cases when I do turn on data.  But I try to keep my bill under $40 a month if I can.  This is actually brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not, I mean, saving money is one thing.  But really saving your life is the real reason.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pay attention to the world when you're out and about.  Mental health.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay, I'm going to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can do this, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a strong hunch that you'll be just fine in Hawaii  without your phone, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  As Jerome Lanier likes to say, reality is so high definition.  It is, it's almost perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's amazing.  Low lateness.  You can actually see the rust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love it.  You are really challenging.  Meanwhile, if you're in China,  you don't have to worry because Google's going to block  any...  advertisements for sites that help bypass censorship.  This is the slippery slope that Apple's gone down  and now Google's going down.  With authoritarian regimes,  if you want to do business and China's a big country,  you're going to end up...  I didn't realize Google did any business in China,  but I guess the advertisements it makes money on, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one way that I look at this story is  it's part of the things that people complain about  but don't do anything about it.  So the reason Google can help authoritarian regimes crack down  and essentially violate their human right  to access to information,  which is Article 19,  I believe, of the Human Rights Convention,  is because nobody cares.  People in the US and Europe and elsewhere,  they're helping China become  this Orwellian high-tech dictatorship.  People are like, yeah, whatever.  At least I get...  Good search.  And so I think that's one perspective on this.  The other one is wrapped up in their project,  their controversial project.  What is it called, Leo, that they were going to do a search?  The Chinese search engine?  Right.  When Google was in China, they did censor search.  You remember you do a search for Tiananmen Square in China  and it showed all these tourist photos  of people taking snapshots.  And then in the West, Tiananmen Square was like...  See people standing in front of tanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they were very principled.  And when China went one step too far,  they said, all right, that's it, we're out.  That's right.  Now they want to go back with this dragonfly,  which is a search engine for China.  Now Google has said again and again,  that's dead, we're not doing it.  The Intercept keeps saying no.  They're still working on it.  In fact, the latest from the Intercept,  Google's conducting a secret performance review  of its censored China project.  A small group of top managers at Google are conducting,  are still working on project dragonfly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's hard to gauge how seriously to take this report.  Yeah, I don't know if I trust the Intercept in this.  My guess is that giant companies  that are multi-billion dollar companies,  hundred billion dollar companies and above,  who have their fingers in a lot of honey pots, so to speak,  have to have lots of stuff in the wings ready to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're always working on stuff, doesn't mean anything.  We know that, we just talked about it for an hour.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google says, okay, we have no plans to do this,  but that doesn't mean they don't have a group  of people looking at it.  They're probably looking at all kinds of things.  It's hard to say how much to invest  in these Intercept reports.  It's still good to know that this stuff is going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've been to Cuba,  and I remember you telling me when you were in Cuba  that there is this kind of sneaker net internet,  a underground of USB keys with internet content on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right, and they spread like wildfire,  and you subscribe to these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's actually a business, you subscribe.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll get every week, you'll get a new USB key.  I don't remember the frequency, but it's every week,  every couple of weeks, every month, something like that.  What's on there, like Facebook?  It's a bunch of Netflix movies,  it's content from all the social networks,  a mishmash of popular things that are happening  on the public internet.  Because when I was there a year and a half ago,  or whenever it was,  you could only access the internet from a sidewalk.  You'd have to go up to this.  Nobody had it in their house?  No, nobody had it in their house.  Then they rolled it out, if you were a communist party  like person in good standing,  then you could get it in your house,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and they're slowly expanding it.  Is that an infrastructure issue they just don't have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a government.  It's a sidewalk down.  Yeah, when you would go to one of these sidewalk locations,  of which they had, I don't know, 50 in the whole country,  you'd have to get in line,  and there would be a little trailer,  and you pay, and they take your passport, copy it,  they know exactly who is looking at exactly what.  I remember, I went in 2008 into Cuba,  and they had these cyber cafes that were really expensive,  and they literally had a uniformed police officer  looking at your screen while you were using the internet  in 2008.  What's interesting about them, the most interesting,  and I think that's why it's relevant to this show,  is that Google is the company in best standing  with the Cuban government.  I've been to, Google has this showcase room  at an art gallery, just in Havana, outside of Havana,  it's near Havana, and you go there,  and they have Google Cardboard,  and they have Chromebooks, and they have all this stuff.  In a country with no internet,  Google doesn't have much of a future.  They have one cable that goes to Venezuela, of all places,  so that's not a good place to connect your country.  But this was the fastest internet in the country, easily,  and there was a long line of people who just wanted  to sit down and use a Chromebook at high speed.  Can you imagine?  Yeah, and so what's happening now,  so a couple of things with these stories  that we're talking about here,  is Google is in such good standing with the Cuban government  that the Trump administration is not.  Google has become kind of an ambassador to the Cuban government  and go between, between the government of the US and Cuba,  and also they're trying to work with Cuba  to do another undersea cable,  because there's probably 20 cable,  I'm making this number up,  but there's a bunch of cables that just go around Cuba,  because they're crisscrossing the oceans in every direction,  and Cuba's not getting any,  and Google would like to connect them with a really fat pipe  from like Miami or something,  and so that Cubans have, if they want,  fastest internet as they want to.  And so this is something that is a possibility,  it's in the works, but again, as we mentioned before,  it's kind of a political threat for the Cuban people  to have free access and fast access  and low cost access to information.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the submarine cable map from telegeography,  and if I zoom in on the Caribbean,  you see Cuba, and you see all the cables going,  this is Cuba right here,  you see all the cables going around.  It looks like a wind tunnel where the air goes around.  And they've got one little janky line to Jamaica,  and then as you said, another one to Venezuela,  and I don't know where this green one goes,  but even the Dominican Republic and Haiti  are better connected, Puerto Rico of course.  In fact, the Bahamas are trying really hard  to become a data haven.  They want a high speed internet to the Bahamas  because they'd like NASA.  In the early days, the Bahamas were a pirate haven.  Now they want to be a data haven.  I remember when we were in the Bahamas  talking to their minister of information,  he said, yeah, yeah, we want to make NASA  be the place you go for things like BitTorrent.  And so, but Cuba, big island, not a lot of connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, and so it's a real sore subject  because of course, the Cuban people  know what's happening in the world.  They're not ignorant of this, they want this.  We were having dinner with some friends in Cuba  that we had just met, and they said,  oh, how are those fires in Santa Barbara?  So I was from Santa Barbara.  They knew about it.  They knew about it because there's another business  where somebody will come into an apartment building,  illegally set up satellite dishes,  and they literally run wires down the halls  and into the front doors of people to get satellite TV,  and it's a cat and mouse game.  So what I was told was it cost them about $900  to install the satellite dish,  and if they can keep it running for three months,  they recoup the $900 and then it's profit after that.  But they're sometimes shut down sooner than three months.  Sometimes it takes them four months or five months,  but they always get shut down at some point.  And so I just thought that was fascinating.  And what they get is Univision.  So they get the Spanish language channel from the US,  and they can watch the news on Univision.  Saburo Gigantico.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Prima Impacto.  Oh, I used to watch that.  Did you?  You know Spanish?  Heck no, but I used to like watching Jackie Garrido,  Weather Girl.  Oh, you watched, wow.  I'm such a pig.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  I think Saburo Gigantico goes over, right?  He retired.  No idea.  Yeah.  Anyway, it was fun.  Yep, while it lasted.  While it lasted.  NASA and Google are also partnering,  but not for Cuban undersea cables,  but for Mars exploration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, there's a part of the Antarctica  that is very Mars-like,  and so Google's doing a big mapping project with NASA.  Neat.  And so now you have Street View for what they call the,  I think Earth's Mars or something like that.  It's basically a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Devon Island.  You need to do this on Chrome in Google Earth,  but you can do this travel through the,  I guess it's not happening here.  Google Earth is so amazing.  Probably because I'm running something  that's blocking it.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about they fix it to where I don't  almost miss my appointment today  because it took me to a back street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that why you were late?  Is that what happened?  Play the drums.  Do you know where that is?  Yes.  Did Karsten leave you the keys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Karsten is on vacation.  He's in Montana,  but I think he left Kevin the keys to the changelog.  It's like a changelog lever.  There's a red cover over it.  He has to throw the cover open  and then flip the switch.  Two guys have to turn keys.  Yeah, two guys have to turn keys  at opposite ends of the console.  Google podcasts in episode search is coming  for podcasters like us.  This is fantastic.  Shows are being fully transcribed.  That means you'll be able to search for stuff  like you could say,  what was that whiskey that Aunt Prue was drinking?  You can search for Aunt Prue at whiskey  and go right to that part of the episode.  There might be a lot of content on that.  You might find many results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really love the future of podcasting in this regard.  I don't like the invasion by all the public radio people  who don't get podcasting,  but I love the idea of really good.  But I love the metrics.  I listen to so many podcasts, Leo, that are just ...  There's great stuff.  Well, there's great stuff.  But I also get so mad that I just,  three minutes in and I'm done.  I go to the next one.  Oh, I do that all the time.  And I want them to know it  because it's like they don't understand.  They do things that really bug me  and I want to protest by stopping listening  and I want them to know that I stopped listening  at that point so they know what's bothering people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People who stop listening to my shows  invariably send me a big email saying,  why I'm not listening to this week at Google anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're on a different level.  You want to get used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get those every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's like, can I mention other podcast networks?  Is that okay?  Please, of course.  So Slate, they have some good podcasts,  but they're like, they do stuff like,  they do this bait and switch where you subscribe  to the Culture Gap Fest  and they'll just play the spoiler special.  I was like, I didn't sign up for that.  And then now every fourth Trumpcast  you have to pay for it.  So it's like they tease it and they're like,  well, if you sign up for Slate Plus, then blah, blah, blah.  I'm like, you guys don't get podcasting.  That's not what it's all about.  If you can't make it on advertising, go back to radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But isn't that how radio survives off this advertising?  Oh yeah. Yes.  Well, we survive on advertising.  Why wouldn't they be able to translate it  over to the podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On radio, they don't say,  well, you can't listen to this radio program  because you didn't pay.  Every fourth program.  You have to pay for the ad.  And then everybody gets it for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know who else is peeved?  You're not gonna be able to hear transcripts  of BBC podcasts on your Google Podcasts  because they're pulling out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a trend toward everything going to apps?  Because that's terrible.  I agree, it's not what podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not gonna listen to the BBC app.  BBC wants you to use the BBC Sounds app.  Not gonna happen.  Frankly, with Spotify buying Gimlet and Anchor,  I have a feeling that Spotify's plan  is to do something similar.  They have a free tier.  But you'd still have to use the Spotify app.  And I'll tell you what's driving a lot of that is  advertisers who say we need metrics.  When we buy a banner ad,  we know who sees it and who clicks on it.  Why don't we know that with a podcast?  It's digital, isn't it?  Of course, you buy a Super Bowl ad,  you don't know if anybody saw it.  They could all have been going to the bathroom  during your ad, but you don't complain about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To me, the whole point of podcasting  is that I can go on a long hike  and I can just say go.  And it just plays one after the other.  I'm not gonna be like,  I'm gonna be a BBC podcast consumer now.  I'm gonna switch over to this other app.  It's never gonna happen.  I'm never even gonna download that app.  I just hate this trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, how about buying stuff from Walmart  on your Google Assistant?  So this is something I do all the time  on Amazon's Echo with Amazon.  And it says, when I run out of batteries,  I say, Echo, buy some type C batteries.  And she'll say, well, the last time you bought batteries,  you bought these.  You wanna order these again?  And I say, yes.  What's your special code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I enter the, I say.  You make it sound dirty.  Hi, what's your four digit code?  One, two, three, four.  Oh, I love it when you say that.  You've just bought batteries.  Talk nerdy to me.  Talk nerdy to me, Leo.  So I actually love that feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you considered Google Home then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is where Google was a little bit behind Amazon.  So doing a deal with Walmart.  This is Walmart kind of is afraid of Amazon.  So naturally, they're gonna do a deal.  You could say, Google, talk to Walmart.  I don't like it that I have to say that first.  They are gonna use prior purchases,  same way that Amazon does.  So they've been in partnership for a couple of years,  but this is now gonna be active on your Google Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I really support this, Leo,  because my book is also available on Walmart.  But seriously, this is kind of a weak, half-assed,  and there's no other response to Amazon's  just total dominance of online commerce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But even Amazon says not that many people  use Voice to buy stuff.  It's not a huge market.  I guess it's a coming market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's, yeah, it's the big picture with Amazon  is just that they're a much more massive company  that's much more involved in people's lives  than the public even realizes.  And so the Amazon Echo really made the smart speaker market  what it is today.  And Google Home is catching up fast.  It's growing faster than Amazon Echo, I believe, still.  But the idea that, okay, I'm a Prime member.  Once you're a Prime member, you're like, okay,  well, I should also shop at Whole Foods then,  and I should get an Amazon Echo instead of a Google Home,  and I should do this, that, and the other thing.  And so there's this kind of sense of,  Amazon doesn't feel like a all-encompassing platform,  but it kind of is, and it's problematic,  regardless of whether today purchases are made.  And I think in the future,  there's gonna be a lot more purchasing,  because we're just gonna be chit-chatting with our agents,  whatever they are, all day, all the time,  and buying stuff is just gonna be another use case  for that technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, two things.  I disagree.  I'm an Amazon Prime person,  but I don't see myself falling into the Amazon ecosystem  and just wanting to get a lot of,  whatever the little device is called,  or whatever their smart devices are.  I don't care anything about that.  All I care about is how much is my Prime subscription  each year, and how soon are my packages gonna get here,  because I order stuff so frequently.  And it's not necessarily ordering Amazon-branded stuff,  either, you know, it's just whatever I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, in fact, half your purchases are not from Amazon,  even on Amazon. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I can care less about the brand of Amazon  or the ecosystem of them.  And number two, I give Walmart credit for saying,  you know what, we gotta at least make an effort at it,  because at one time, Walmart was like Amazon,  far as just being where everybody went,  regardless of how much money we made.  Remember how much people hated Walmart

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and all the talk about Walmart  not paying its employees well enough,  and nobody worried about that anymore.  We're rooting for them to beat Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Finally, a good old-fashioned brick and mortar store.  Mom and pop and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wouldn't it be nice to have John Legend respond  when you try to buy stuff from Walmart?  Now you can.  All you have to do is tell your Google Assistant,  talk like a legend.  Here, let's watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You ready to rock and roll?  I'm your Google Assistant.  I can help you find answers and have fun.  The forecast is 72 and sunny.  Can I just say something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why John Legend?  He doesn't have that distinctive a voice.  If he had Gilbert Gottfried,  then you'd know that it was...  He is me, Gilbert.  He's shouting at you.  But honestly, I mean, I like John Legend.  He's a great singer, but is his voice that distinctive  that you'd go, oh, John Legend?  I don't think I'd know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it sounds like a voice  that's coming through some tiny speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want Aunt Pruitt on my Google Home.  Hey, talk like an aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, here's one of my favorite songs.  Happy birthday.  Now that's cool.  Whose birthday it is.  That's cool.  Whoa.  Yeah.  I'm feeling this new voice.  You can find me on all kinds of devices,  phones, Google Homes,  and if I'm lucky, in your heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Assistant now featuring the voice  to say, hey, talk like a legend.  They talked about that at Google I.O. almost a year ago.  Yeah, last year, I thought.  Oh, wait a minute.  So one of your devices is responding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Voice handles the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's have some fun.  That's John Legend.  It says, hi, John Legend.  Let me, what?  I just, it worked.  Yep.  Or good.  Talk like a legend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's sleeping right now.  He's taking a nap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It said, hi, John Legend.  Here, I let my voice to your Google Assistant  because you're.  Hey, Google, tell me a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John Legend is apparently very quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He doesn't know any jokes.  He's a singer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you know what happened?  I turned data off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, Leo.  That didn't last long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want my data back.  No Wi-Fi at the studio.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's, it's bound.  The little balls were bouncing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me Gilbert Gottfried.  Wouldn't that be funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then, you want to buy those batteries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be.  I would pay for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me tell you about batteries and a cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did have Tom Tom used to do celebrity voices in their GPS.  Remember that?  Elvis.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you don't want to go there.  Turn left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I had, I had, oh, who was it?  It was, oh, it was so funny.  Well, first of all, Glad-Oz from Portal.  But she would lie to you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  which sounded very dangerous.  I was on the GPS saying turn left, but there's no,  so that was a bad one.  Right.  And then I had, who was the guy in Easy Rider?  Not Jack.  70 Sam?  No, that would be funny.  No, the guy in Easy Rider,  not Jack Nicholson, the other guy.  Right, Peter Fonda?  Not Peter Fonda, the other guy.  Oh, no idea.  I can't remember his name.  Isn't that funny?  Anyway, he had this stoner voice.  Dennis Hopper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would anybody ever want to get here?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He went down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, him, him, that guy.  Oh, man, that's a long way to go.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It gets bad after a while, you change it right back.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm totally fine with the default voice on these assistants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems like a good idea.  You can get Burt Reynolds for 12.95.  Mr. T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As you still can?  Yeah.  On a tom-tom?  Yeah, yeah.  Celebrity.  Ways, on ways you can get celebrity voices.  In fact, I recorded my voice,  because anybody can do it.  And then I recorded, you sit down and says,  okay, say, turn left, turn right, say all the things.  And then you can bundle it up, and I put it somewhere.  I forgot where I put it.  It's somewhere, if you search around for it,  you can have me on your ways.  I should sell that.  Google I.O. dates have been announced,  and there will be sessions on Stadia,  if they don't cancel it before then.  Dark Mode, Linux on Chrome OS, and more.  Dark Mode.  What is it with Dark Mode?  I don't get it.  It's a color scheme.  It's a color scheme.  Why is that a feature of any OS?  It's like Dark Mode.  It's not so good on us.  Eh, I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't mind the feature, I just don't get the enthusiasm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google has posted the initial schedule,  so if you'd like to start planning your I.O.,  we are gonna send Jason Howell, Jeff Jarvis.  We will be covering the Google I.O. keynotes.  Google I.O. is coming to town May 7th.  Actually, it's gonna be a busy week,  because the day before,  Microsoft's Build Developers Conference,  they've overlapped once again.  So Paul and Mary Jo will be at Build on Monday.  We'll do the keynote on Monday.  Then Tuesday, it'll be Google I.O.  It's gonna be crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I stopped going to Google I.O.  when they stopped giving me free laptops.  Just kidding.  That was a nice feature.  I remember there was one Google I.O.  where they gave you a...  Ton of stuff.  It was a Pixelbook, whatever they called it before that.  Yeah, the C48.  So they gave you a laptop.  They gave you a phone, an Android phone,  and they gave you two watches.  Remember that?  They gave you one of the Android...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you're good, you turned them down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I turned them all down, yeah.  I really admire that.  Well, I actually gave it back and then bought one.  That's how it should be.  That's how journalists should work.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Developers is fine, but journalists should not accept that.  Absolutely, right.  What they won't give you, or maybe they will,  the new Nest Hub Max, a 10-inch smart display with a camera,  kind of like the Google Home Hub,  but this isn't officially announced.  It's just the Google Store accidentally posted it.  Right.  And of course, everybody jumped on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the 10-inch will be a much better option  than the current option.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the Home Hub.  I am a fan.  First of all, it doesn't have a camera in it,  so Lisa doesn't mind that it's sitting next to our bed.  It's a great digital frame.  So I just set it to family and friends.  It's tiny, but it's right there next to the bed.  And every once in a while, Lisa says,  "'Oh, I remember that,' or, "'Where was that?''  And that's really fun.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I thought it was supposed to be  like a kitchen device, though.  Or you could put it in the kitchen.  It's just a slideshow and you could talk to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bathroom.  But it's a very good kind of clock,  bedside clock, because when the lights go out,  it dims very dark, because I don't like any lights,  and it makes it very dim.  When the lights come on, you can ask it,  what's the weather?  You could say, good morning.  It'll give you a whole morning rundown.  You could set it to long.  I often will roll over, say, wake me up when it's,  I say, hey, you know who, wake me up when it's 8.30,  and it'll wake me up.  It nudges me gently.  I just remember seeing it in person

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and thinking my Pixel XL is bigger than this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, it's really small.  But it's cheap.  It's not expensive.  So remember the Stadia announcement?  Sundar Pichai first of all said, I don't play games.  Good way to start a game announcement.  Then he said,  Why are we here, Sundar?  Then he did say,  we have the most played game of all time,  which is the dinosaur game.  Google has a new one.  It's got an offline Easter egg game  that's like Flappy Bird, but instead of a bird,  it's a cloud that you're trying to avoid getting punctured  by sharp billed birds.  It's like the Dino game, but it's only on mobile.  Don't go open up Chrome in your desktop browser.  You've gotta search for something that doesn't exist.  Actually, I can do it.  I turned off data.  Nothing exists.  I now have a game I can play, yay!  Turn off data on your phone, do a search,  and you'll get this new little floating cloudy game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go to a site that doesn't exist like Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, no, it exists unfortunately.  They have a page that says it doesn't exist.  a doesn't exist page, 404.  It's a futures thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a cloud, a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else is going on?  Beta, Android Q beta 2 came out today.  Yesterday, the March, or is it the April?  I guess the April update for Android.  You probably won't get it until later,  unless you're on a Pixel.  Anything else for a change log?  You can now, for a long time I've used a YubiKey  to log into my Google stuff.  But, I have a-  This is CNET, and here are the stories  that matter right now.  Oh shut up CNET, I hate.  I have auto place stopped on this,  and it's still place.  I don't know, they figured out a way around it.  So this is a YubiKey.  So when I log into my Google account,  I can put in the YubiKey,  and it will give me the second factor  after I give it the password.  But it only worked on Chrome for a long time,  which is really annoying,  because I don't use Chrome.  And it would be-  Now, you can use Firefox and Microsoft's Edge  with your secure login.  So that's good.  That's good news.  No, nothing more to say, but that's just good news.  I wish it would work in Safari,  because that's mostly the problem,  is that on Apple I don't use Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One thing that I think is worth talking about is,  there's a consensus that YouTube radicalizes people.  So if you are interested in, let's say-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Save this for when we end the changelog.  We're still in the changelog.  Oh, gotcha.  But save it, because right after,  there's only one more thing in the changelog.  Google Duplex, which is that weird voice  that calls restaurants and makes reservations,  is now available, or going to be available,  on non-Pixel phones and iOS devices.  They're slowly rolling out,  so don't expect it right away, but it will be.  And also, it only works in certain areas,  although apparently now it's up to 43 states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the same technology is used  for the call screening in the Pixel 3.  I love that feature.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The call screening is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so if you see a call coming in from a robocaller,  which is 90% of my calls-  And you too are an introvert

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  who doesn't like to talk to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you just press the button that says screen it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and you don't have to answer it.  And then you can interact and say,  well, you can tell the assistants  to ask the person to tell me more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's when the Duplex comes in,  because you're giving them additional stuff  that they don't already know.  You can kind of guide the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  And listen to it.  There's another tip that if you hit the,  what is it, you hit the volume button,  you can listen to the whole conversation,  both sides of it, if you want to.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Yeah, you can read it, but you can also listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't the person on the other end know  that you're feeding Google questions to ask?  Say, okay, but who was Mike's best friend in fourth grade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've gotten calls from a lot of people  who clearly never heard of Google Duplex.  And they just assume it's some kind of high tech voicemail  they never heard of.  Oh, you have a fancy assistant.  Oh, and the other great thing about it  is it sends you a transcript.  So somebody contacted me,  they had this whole conversation,  they want to have a conversation.  They gave me the email and then I forgot it.  And then I went into the app  and retrieved the email from the transcript,  which is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One thing it won't tell you though is,  this has been a sponsored ad.  This is trouble for Google.  It's an illegal thing, but apparently,  and this is according to a story in Reuters,  some of the search results you get  from your Google Assistant are paid results,  which Assistant does not tell you.  The FTC requires either a disclaimer saying  it's a sponsored announcement or an ad  or something like that.  We're very careful, as you might know,  to always, anytime something's sponsored,  to say this is paid for.  But the Google Assistant will recommend  home service providers without disclosing  that the results come from a database  mainly composed of companies  that joined a Google marketing program,  maybe because it's not entirely from a paid program.  Reuters asked a number of attorneys,  they all said if there's a financial commitment,  you must disclose it.  I guess Google's getting around it saying,  well, it's not like there's a direct relationship.  These are people that joined a marketing plan  and it just happens that they're getting recommended.  FTC does say, for instance, if you,  and this, by the way, is widely flouted.  If you're on Instagram and you post a picture of you  and you're McAllen's Casque Strength Whiskey  and McAllen gave you a bottle  or gave you a buck to do that,  you're supposed to say ad or sponsored.  So few people on Instagram do that now.  Yep, it's a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it raises the question,  search is very lucrative because of ads  and we're moving to a situation  where we're gonna be using assistants  who just give us an answer.  It's a problem.  So where do you monetize?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  If it's gonna say, there's ways to say,  and now here's a sponsored result.  There's ways to do it, but they're not doing it.  The FTC apparently, according to Reuters,  has never, Reuters did a freedom of information request  and got information that said the FTC  has not received any complaints about this.  Because you would, who's gonna complain?  You don't even know that that plumber was in this.  You don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just put it in a much smaller font size sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could put it on the screen if you had a screen,  but a lot of assistants don't have a screen.  So you have to say it.  Yeah, right.  And that's the Google Change Log.  Man, he gave you both keys, huh?  Nice.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, Mike Yelgin, you wanted to talk a little bit  about Google's, or YouTube's recommendations.  Yeah, so.  This is a big problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  So people believe, it's a kind of a consensus  in the public sphere that YouTube algorithms radicalize you.  So let's say you're interested in Legos.  I'm trying to pick a fairly non-controversial.  But imagine something horrible, but start with Legos.  And you see a nice Lego video,  and the idea is that the recommendations  take you deeper and deeper into a rabbit hole  of content in that sphere, no matter what it is.  So if it's politics, and let's say you're left leaning  a little bit, okay?  The videos will take you lefter and lefter and lefter,  and next thing you know, you're Trotsky.  Right.  Watching videos about radical revolution  and all this kind of stuff.  Or if it's about violence, or if it's about sex,  or if it's about any sort of political topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a year ago that Zainab Tafeksi wrote about this  in the New York Times.  Her op-ed piece was YouTube, the Great Radicalizer,  and she gave a lot of examples that she did herself.  She experimented with it.  That you would watch one video,  and then the next recommendation, and by the way,  there's of course a number of ways YouTube recommends.  One is with a list of videos,  but there's always a play next one.  Right.  And she was saying, the play next one  often gets more and more radical.  So if you start looking for keto diet recipes,  then you get vegetarian recipes,  then you get vegan recipes, that's kind of how it works.  She had a lot of examples in her piece.  Well, The Verge has apparently blown the lid off of this,  because when employees reported it or complained about it,  or mentioned toxic videos, this is from,  actually, I'm sorry, it's not The Verge,  let me give credit to where credit's due, it's Bloomberg.  And then those employees,  those YouTube employees warned executives,  the executives said, meh, okay.  Oh, sheeps. Nevermind.  This is a big problem, that YouTube's known about it,  and hasn't done anything about it is a huge problem.  Stop listening, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Your phone is going, but worse than that,  a YouTube executive has denied that the,  The recommendations.  The rabbit hole effect even exists.  Yeah.  They deny the whole thing.  I'm trying to bring up the story,  but I think I have also turned off data.  Was it Wajiski that denied this?  No, no, it was another executive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, well, I have stories galore along this,  YouTube has decided to leave neo-Nazi propaganda online.  They've marked it, but they haven't taken it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I saw a conversation talking about how,  there's white supremacy, and then there's white nationalism,  and so it's a matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook has finally decided that white nationalism  equals white supremacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, which the white nationalists are not happy about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, we're not better, we're just white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the problem.  When you have Mark Zuckerberg making this decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here it is, New York Magazine.  By the way, they've been doing a great job.  These intelligence columns in the New York Magazine  are really good.  YouTube exec denies the existence of rabbit hole effect  that definitely exists.  Yeah.  This was in the New York Times.  It's Neil Mullen, who's the chief product officer at YouTube.  They said, the company does not have a business interest  in pushing users towards extreme content.  Quote, it's not the case that extreme content drives  a higher version of engagement or watch time  than the content of other types.  It's just that, gosh, the gosh was added by intelligence.  Or gosh, YouTube is just so vast,  and it's so tough to balance user safety  and information integrity with concerns  about freedom of speech.  We just can't help it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's worth noting that the reporting on this  has cited a lot of facts and evidence,  and Mohan has not produced any data or facts  to support his claim.  It's just a claim.  It might be true, it's possible,  but so far, the weight of evidence is in favor of the rabbit hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a Buzzfeed story from January.  They wanna know, how many clicks through YouTube's  Up Next recommendations does it take to go  from watching an anodyne PBS clip about the US Congress  to an anti-immigrant video  from a designated hate organization?  Nine degrees of separation.  So they started by watching a day in the life  of an Arizona rancher.  How a bill becomes a law.  Wow.  Oh, actually, that was the end result.  It's top comment, illegals are our enemies,  flush them out or we are doomed.  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've heard about this kind of stuff,  but I've yet to experience it with my YouTube habits.  But you wouldn't let your kids, you wouldn't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so this is the real problem.  People often sit their kids down in front of a YouTube video.  And then if auto plays turned on,  it just keeps playing the next video,  and the next video, and the next video,  and the next video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I need to check with my hard heads  because the one in particular, my youngest one,  he watches YouTube almost as much as I do.  I mean, that is our television.  Yeah.  And I have a good idea of the creators that he's watching.  I don't know their names, but I know their faces  and I can hear their, okay guys, okay guys.  So I know he's watching the same crap over and over again,  but I wonder if he's getting fed this little algorithm  that everybody else is getting.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's one example from Buzzfeed.  So first they searched for government shutdown 2019  explained.  They got a clip called partial US government shutdown  expected to continue into 2019 from Euronews,  a channel with 700,000 subscribers.  So they hit that.  Then the recommendation algorithm suggested  a live President Trump press conference video  from another news aggregation channel.  From there, videos about the Mexican border,  Trump's proposed border wall.  Then up next recommended a video  from an immigration news aggregator  featuring a compilation of news clips  titled border patrol arrests, deportations, border wall,  and Mexico's sewage.  From there, algorithm took an abrupt turn  recommending a video about Miami international airport.  Then a series of episodes from a national geographic TV show  called ultimate airport, Dubai, snakes, firefighters,  customs officials, crystal meth and faulty planes.  So in a way this confirms what the YouTube guy was saying,  which is, well, we're not intentionally getting more extreme.  Really the problem is their search recommendation  the algorithm sucks.  You gotta train it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just isn't good.  You gotta hire some AI trainers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you search for impeach the mother or impeach the mother,  I don't know how you would impeach the mother.  Oh, nevermind.  You know what, enough, you get the idea.  I don't even wanna go down this rabbit hole anymore.  So it's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To me the problem, yeah, so a lot of this speech  that's being banned on social networks and YouTube  is constitutionally protected speech.  So the government couldn't ban it, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But any private business can do whatever it wants.  Twitter can ban anybody it wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're the arbiters.  And I just think it's problematic because of the  the rabbit hole effect is essentially  an algorithmic thing run amok.  You can't really understand what algorithms are gonna do  at this scale, I don't think.  And as Zuckerberg said when he was being grilled by Congress,  oh, don't worry, within a few years we're gonna have AI  that's just gonna make all these decisions behind the scenes.  You'll never have to worry about this again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Silicon Valley's punt.  If that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you've been drinking the same stuff we have because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Silicon Valley has a couple of default positions  they punt to, that's one.  The AI will solve it.  The other one, which is becoming more popular is,  oh, don't worry, universal basic income will solve it.  We'll just give everybody a few thousand dollars a month  and job done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  AI will do all the work.  People are basically worthless  and just wanna sit at home spending money or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we'll pay them 3000 bucks a month to do that.  Where that money's coming from, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You forgot the, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah, that's right.  That's it.  The MP, I'm sorry.  Yeah, we're sorry.  We didn't mean to do that.  It was a bug.  So easy to apologize.  Silicon Valley actually has more excuses  than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, it was only a few of you affected,  not everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've become incredibly adept.  You know what they're like?  They're like those preachers who say  the world's gonna end next month  and then it doesn't end.  Those preachers become really good  at coming up with excuses for why the world didn't end,  but it's gonna end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you wanna see this firsthand, search YouTube.  Harold Camping, he's in the Bay Area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's been saying the world's gonna end for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you realize at the end that he actually believed it  because he gave actual date.  He's like, here it comes, it's gonna be Tuesday.  And of course, Tuesday, nothing happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does he, does he wake up on Wednesday and say,  oh crap, the world didn't end.  And then what does he?  Yeah, bummer, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's funny, but in YouTube's defense,  I think the vast majority of people  who are listening to this,  it's probably the greatest resource.  If you wanted to encapsulate humanity  and all of its knowledge,  YouTube wouldn't be a bad resource.  I mean, if you wanna learn how to fix  your garbage disposal.  No, YouTube is a huge. YouTube is fantastic.  Valuable resource.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't wanna get rid of it.  We just wanna kind of maybe some oversight.  Maybe do it right.  But maybe this is an impossible task, I don't know.  YouTube seems to think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think, one last point on this.  The companies like Google and Facebook and others  will say, oh, it's just the algorithms.  They're just doing their thing.  We have such scale, et cetera, et cetera.  Why do we need these algorithms?  Why do we need so much automation?  The reason they love algorithms  is because they're measuring what people are looking at,  how long they're watching, what they're clicking on,  where they're going, and this is,  they believe is monetizable.  It works for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They learn about who you are.  It makes a very sticky product.  And they can sell products to you.  Plus, humans are expensive,  and there aren't frankly enough humans in the world  for all the crap that's being posted on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's an old-fashioned concept.  But I would actually love it  if YouTube didn't have any algorithms.  Just search. Yeah, maybe that's the solution.  Just search algorithms.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me search. That's the solution.  What's the recommendation?  That's attempt to monetize better.  Don't do the, just turn it off.  There's a, you know what, that's an easy solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an unspoken assumption  that we have to let these companies invade our privacy,  get to know us so they can make trillions  and billions of dollars.  Why do we support that?  Why are we so invested in the Googles and the Facebooks  becoming even larger and more powerful?  Turn off the algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they're not working.  Turn them off.  And of course, technologists' responses,  no, no, no, no, we're just going to make them better.  We're going to make them work.  But they have yet to do it.  I think that's interesting.  Would YouTube be any worse  if the next video didn't autoplay,  if it didn't recommend a whole bunch of,  no, you just search for the next one you want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And put an ad there on the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'd make just as much money.  Or maybe almost as much.  I mean, they wouldn't be as sticky,  except I think they would,  because you're there for the value you get from it.  And there's genuine value there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never seen a relevant ad ever coming from Google.  The only site that does that well is Instagram to me.  Oh, they do it really well.  Everything they advertise, I want it.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've gotten a lot better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what, that's why actually,  I talk about a lot of other reasons,  but the main reason I left Instagram  is I was buying too much.  I worked too hard.  Oh my God.  I'm wearing my Instagram underwear today.  It's bamboo, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't get a sliver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all I'm saying.  Okay, now we're at the bottom of the barrel.  So there's a bunch of very just weird stories about,  well, like that woman who entered Mar-a-Lago  bearing four smartphones, two passports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never thought China would be a country that would spy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She has two Chinese passports  and a USB device containing malware.  She said, I'm going to a pool party  to the Secret Service.  She said, I'm a member.  I want to use the pool.  Showed the passports.  Agent said, well, she's not on the membership list,  but a club manager said,  I think she's the daughter of a member.  So they let her in.  It turns out she had no baby.  Agents say when they asked Zhang  if the member was her father,  she did not answer definitively,  but they thought it might be a language barrier.  So they said, oh, screw it, let her in.  The Secret Freakin' Service.  By the way, the president was there at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing with the Secret Service,  and this is one of the problems  with so much stuff happening at Mar-a-Lago,  is that they're not,  they have no right to block anyone  from coming into Mar-a-Lago.  It's a public place.  Right.  They can keep you out of the White House.  It's privately owned by the president.  So they're in this weird position  where they're supposed to let people in,  but they're also supposed to protect the president.  So anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you could say I'm a member  and it has nothing to do with anything.  So once she got in, she told the front desk reception  she was there to attend the United Nations  Chinese American Association event  scheduled for that evening.  There was no event.  So that's when they called the agents.  The agents told her,  no, I'm sorry, ma'am, you have to use the spy entrance.  And so she go around back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And get in line.  Get in line.  And get along with the other spies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If she was a halfway competent spy,  she would have just gotten in and installed the malware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She had four cell phones, a laptop,  an external hard drive,  and a thumb drive containing malware  plus two passwords and no swimsuit.  See, if you're going to say you're going to a pool party,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at least bring a swimsuit.  How hard is that to buy a swimsuit in Florida?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no indication she was ever near the president.  So don't, you know, it's okay.  That's one, that's weird story number one.  Weird story number two.  The Department of Justice has threatened the Oscars.  Finally.  It's about time we got the DOJ involved.  The Department of Justice told the Academy of Motion  Pictures Arts and Sciences,  Steven Spielberg has been saying,  we can't give Oscars to streaming movies.  They have to open in the theater  and that's the current rule.  The chief of the DOJ's Antitrust Division,  taking on the really big ones,  McCann Delrahim wrote to Ampes on March 21st  to express concerns that new rules would be written  in a way that tends to suppress competition.  Yes, that big monopoly, the Academy Awards.  I don't even know what to say.  I don't even know what to say.  I agree the DOJ's right,  they shouldn't ban streaming movies,  but I don't know, is it a federal,  they're kind of making a federal case out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not, yeah, we don't need government intervention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Academy Awards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an academy, they can give awards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, you know what, if I wanted to give an award  to podcasters, but it can only be podcasters  who are five foot 10 or higher or above,  I could.  I'd be okay with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the tall awards.  It's not illegal.  And I think you actually have the right to do that.  And the other thing-  I think I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you do. I wouldn't want to, but I could.  How tall are you, Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Six two. See?  He's a supporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surrounded by tall people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should actually have awards and give it to podcasters,  but only if they're on the Twitter network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, you're all winners.  I'm in.  Arizona beverages, they make the tea  in the really tall cans.  Yeah, you get a whole can.  You get a whole can of tea knocked offline by Ransomware.  They're one of the largest beverage suppliers in the US.  They're still rebuilding their network two weeks  after Ransomware hit, wiping hundreds of Windows computers  and servers, effectively shutting down sales operations  for days.  More than 200 servers and network computers displayed  the message, your network was hacked and encrypted.  The company's name was in the Ransom notes,  so this was a targeted attack.  They put up the notices, we've seen them everywhere now,  the little hand printed signs you put in the window saying,  please don't power on, copy files or connect to the network.  Your laptop may be compromised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They never would have tried this against Red Bull.  Because it got energy.  Too much caffeine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never have got it.  Here's the best news, a day after the attack hit,  the staff found the backup system wasn't configured  properly and were unable to retrieve data for days  until the company signed an expensive contract  to bring in Cisco incident responders.  They had to rebuild the entire network from scratch.  Since the outbreak, the company has spent hundreds  of thousands of dollars on new hardware, software  and recovery costs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a general war between hackers and malware  distributors and the legitimate world,  and I think the legit world is losing because  there's so many stories about this kind of thing.  MySpace, which I learned still exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh my God, they lost all the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Asus, you buy a brand new Asus computer and you have  malware digitally signed.  Malware.  There's a lot of that going on.  I'm working on a piece right now about malware on  legitimate authorized products, software and hardware.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems likely that, we don't know, but it seems likely  that Asus had been hacked probably by a nation state.  They said it was an advanced persistent threat.  In other words, the hackers were sitting in the network  for some period of time.  What was interesting about the malware, it affected  many, many computers, but only 600 actually had a payload.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They had a list of MAC addresses.  All laptops.  And so it sounds to me like something China would do.  They're going after dissidents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can think of a lot of scenarios.  Let's say you're Saudi Arabia, not that they would  ever hack anything.  They wouldn't do that.  But let's say you're Saudi Arabia and what you did is  you put a little sniffer outside the Israeli embassy  in Washington DC and copied all the MAC addresses  of Asus laptops going into the building.  You now have a list of MAC addresses and you implant  malware in Asus and it affects only those computers.  Fish in a barrel.  Here, have some more, McAllen.  Finally, this is one that's got me all head up.  Andreas Galle was on a business trip to Sweden.  He is an Apple employee.  He was carrying a MacBook and an iPhone XS.  Both on the screen, the iPhone XS flashed on the lock screen  confidential and proprietary.  The MacBook Pro bore a sticker that said  Property of Apple, proprietary.  He was stopped by Customs and Border Protections  at San Francisco International Airport.  They ordered him to unlock the phone and hand it over.  Galle told him, I can't do that.  I don't own it.  It's Apple's.  I have to consult the lawyer or the employer  because I have an NDA with Apple that specifically  explicitly says I can't do that.  He wrote in his Medium Post, this request seemed to  aggravate the customs officers.  They informed me I had no right to speak to an attorney  at the border despite being a US citizen  and threatened me that failure to immediately comply  with their demand is a violation of federal criminal code.  They questioned him for about an hour, let him go,  but they stripped him of his global entry card.  They also gave him a handwritten note with the supervisor's  name and phone number and said,  have your boss at Apple call it.  Wow, ACLU has filed a civil rights complaint over this.  We've been hearing about this stuff all along.  It doesn't happen all that often,  but Galle's between a rock and a hard place.  You don't want to mess with Apple.  And at the same time, you probably don't want to mess  with armed border guards.  So I don't know what the right answer is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's problematic.  One of the benefits of having a Pixelbook,  which if you're an Apple employee, you just do not have.  You just power wash it, right?  Power wash it before you travel and then just log back in  when you get to wherever you're going.  But he might have been transporting data on that system  that was Apple Secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple Secrets, he's the former CTO of Mozilla.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And is a US citizen actually a naturalized citizen?  He said, when I became a citizen,  I swore to defend the constitution.  That's why I'm filing a civil rights complaint  with the help of the ACLU for unlawful detaining  and violation of my constitutional rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good, because we can get this into the courts  and we can figure out what the rules are, maybe.  And we're going to see a lot more of this.  I mean, this is in the US, you know, customs,  every country has its customs agents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Frankly, hard to get into Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Detained leaving Morocco last time  because we had 16 bottles of wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would have stopped you too.  And they're like, oh, that's way too much.  I hope you handed one over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they were like, oh, they had to call the supervisor  and I was like, well, it seems like-  Are you allowed?  Apparently so, because eventually they let us,  we're like, we're leaving, we're not Muslim, it's fine.  And they were like, oh, that's a lot of wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a lot of wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, our wine isn't that good.  What are you taking 16 bottles for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, dude, when I left France, I had 27 bottles,  one of which was a magnum.  Bring more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you like to take more, please?  All right.  We're going to wrap this up with your picks of the week.  Ant Pruitt from Tech Republic and a great friend.  Get some plugs ready too, Ant.  Cue up some good plugs.  Cause I want to, you come on and you do this and you're so-  I got plugs, but I don't have any picks.  Okay, well, do plugs, no picks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I do have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got a minute, cause I got to do an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to give you my pick.  Mike Elgin, also here from elgin.com and gastronomad.net.  My pick is really awesome.  And it's right here on this iPad.  When you come to Twitter, we, for a long time,  and if you've been here, you know this had a,  like how many pages was that thing?  A long four page disclaimer and tiny print  that you were supposed to read and sign, you know,  a waiver that we won't sue us and you might fall over stuff  and it's a dangerous environment.  We're going to take your pictures.  And it was a long process.  And I've seen people standing on our desk with Moses  who guards us for a long time.  Now we got Envoy.  This is awesome.  When you, and by the way, so many companies  in Silicon Valley are using Envoy.  It's an iPad kiosk that is a great way to sign  in visitors to protect the security of your environment.  So when visitors arrive, they sign in on this iPad,  they enter their details, they sign any legal documents,  NDAs, in our case waivers, right on the iPad.  Envoy then notifies their host,  the person who they're visiting,  automatically alerts them when your guest arrives.  So that's easy and they come down and get them.  Your employee knows who's coming and when,  no more like, oh, I didn't expect you dad, hi,  kind of awkward meetings.  Plus, this is smart security, but it doesn't intimidate.  There's no more paper log book that really, honestly,  what are you gonna do, right?  When James Rockford comes, you have to show him.  I don't know, it's not, that's like 80s.  You could sign in unlimited visitors.  Yes, you can connect it up to a printer  to print customized badges.  You can have VIP names automatically.  So like if the president arrives,  you could send alerts out, he's here.  And if there are unattended guests,  it will notify security, administrators,  whoever you designate.  It works perfectly with your existing security system.  So it can give Wi-Fi access, it ID checks,  emergency notifications, you get enhanced security.  And best of all, you have a database  of people who are visiting your office.  You know who's coming, you know when they're on site,  you know who they're meeting,  you know where they are and why.  It already works with everything you've got,  including Slack, Google Suite, Box, Salesforce, Chatter.  This is a really great affordable simple product  and you can get it at Envoy.com slash twit.  Nike uses this, Pinterest, Spotify.  30 million visitors have been welcomed.  We've added a handful ourselves using Envoy.  Protect your people, your property, your ideas,  but do it in a way that's nice, it's welcoming.  You don't wanna look intimidating.  Envoy's great, 10,000 companies worldwide choose Envoy  to make a great first impression.  We're so thrilled to have Envoy at our front desk.  Envoy, and we do it on an iPad mini, you notice.  Envoy, Envoy.com slash twit.  You can try it for free.  It will work on your existing hardware, so that's awesome.  Envoy.com slash twit.  We thank Envoy for setting this up, our modern front desk.  It's great, Mo thanks him too, he loves it.  Envoy.com slash twit.  Use that URL, let him know you heard it here.  Thank you, Envoy.  Okay, you can give this back to Mo.  Fortunately, nobody arrived when I was.  There's a line of people just waiting for that.  They're waiting for the iPad to show up.  We got the nice gold one, look at that.  Yes, it's legally binding, yes, you sign it with your.  Yeah, so, Ant Pruitt, I gave you a minute or two  to think about your pick.  It could be whiskey, it could be rock and roll music,  it could be the Clemson Tigers, who do you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, beyond the Clemson Tigers  and the great things that they do for those kids down there  and Clemson life and whatnot, I still wanted to continue  to plug my friend's community,  who I met through Google+, many years ago.  And again, I think I've mentioned him on here before,  but my man Charlie Hoover on geekquestioner.com.  He started a community on Google+,  around just geek questions of the day.  And it's not just Star Trek,  it's not just Battlestar Galactica or Matt,  it's everything, everything.  Oh, this is nice, I like this.  And half of the stuff, I have no idea  what they're talking about,  but it's been fascinating to go through  and look at those questions and look at  what the responses are from the people in the community.  And they put the questions out every single day  and you just go in there and comment  to leave your response and people have discussions on there  and they'll do a podcast every week.  This is a great idea.  And it's so fascinating because there's been  a whole lot of things on there  that I knew absolutely nothing about.  I didn't know what a Hufflepuff was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do, you're not a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No idea, but there's so many things like that,  and I'm like, what are they talking about?  Sends me down a rabbit hole to go look up  what a Hufflepuff is.  And this is every single day.  And he also shares what they call geek scapes.  And they're just-  These are beautiful.  Who does these?  They're gorgeous.  From different artists around the globe.  And they're beautiful.  Yeah, they really are.  And it's just something I look at,  I look at this every single day.  I don't answer the questions every day,  but I look at them every single day.  And it's just part of my routine  and just takes me away from real life for a minute.  Neat.  But all of that started on Google+, many years ago,  and he built a community with it.  They left Google+, and they're doing it this way  strictly through the website.  Good for him.  And it's doing really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Question of the day, what geeky nicknames  have you given some of the tech gadgets in your life and why?  Brilliant question.  Do you name your gadgets?  I do.  Jerry Pornell started that for me in Byte Magazine.  All his computers had names.  I nicknamed, I have to,  you have to name your Wi-Fi access points.  So I give them all names.  And I had been using Dead Rockstars.  So I had Morrison, Joplin, Winehouse.  I really like Winehouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My dryer, my dryer has a name.  What's your dryer's name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fred.  Fred Dryer.  Okay.  Whatever I've spent the most money on recently,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I either call precious, Lord of the Rings.  My precious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my Samsung Galaxy S10 is my precious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or Excalibur from Wayne's World.  Yes.  But I use the same names over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that's my pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it.  Geekquestioner.com, join the community.  Yeah, it's there.  Showing his guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's- Guns?  No, man, these are cannons.  Cannons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this picture of Ant.  Oh my God.  You just, it's down at the bottom here.  Let me, what are you?  Grrr.  You look like the rock for crying out loud.  Look at this guy.  Do you want to meet him in a dark alley?  No.  Grrr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the least geeky picture of a geek I've ever seen.  I know.  Well, it just shows you, you can be ripped and a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can be.  Wow.  Grrr.  Thank you, Ant.  He's mad about Google inbox.  You know, it cracks me up  because he's about the sweetest guy ever met  in the whole wide world.  But he looks scary in that picture.  Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Grrr.  Just a pose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  Big guys, I've discovered, big guys are always sweet  because they got nothing to prove, right?  They can squash you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing, I tell people,  I don't have anything to prove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the little guys you got to watch out for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  You can tell a lot from that picture.  Notice the survival bracelet.  So he's expecting the zombie apocalypse.  Is that what that is?  Yeah, that's a paracord, braided paracord  so that he can like, you know.  Oh, you are a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody, I can't remember who gave me that.  Right now I wear a breast cancer awareness bracelet  that I've been wearing for about two years now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for the Mrs.  Strong men can wear pink.  How's the Mrs. doing, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She is slowly but surely turning into an internet star.  Because our podcast people love her.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ant and the Mrs. plug that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the podcast, everyday people doing everyday shh.  You have to fix that out.  That's the name of our podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everyday people doing everyday shh-tuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's correct.  And it's, you can find it on all of the different  pod catchers, including Google,  which at one time it wasn't showing up on Google.  I don't know why.  But yeah, it's out there.  And we just talk about everyday random stuff  that we would talk about if the mic's went on.  Good.  And it's doing well.  Yeah, been having some fun with that.  And like I said, people are starting to know more about her.  Dan Patterson, he's been listening to it.  Oh, nice.  And he says, man, I swear, I feel like I really know  everybody in your house now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really the secret and strength of podcasting.  It's intimate and you become friends.  You're right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll sit back here on a Thursday night  or something like that.  I try to have it done by Friday  and we'll just sit back over there in the corner  and just chat.  That's all it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AntPruitt.com slash podcast.  That's it.  Everyday people, everyday stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a podcast everyday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everyday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it ain't everyday, no.  It should be every week, people.  Every week, but we're doing everyday shh.  Ha ha ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike Elgin.  Okay, so I was going to use as my pick of the week  Spark Mail for Android because it scratches.  Wasn't that at Google?  Oh no.  They purchased it and killed it.  No, no, no.  It sounds familiar.  This is a popular email.  It's a company that has lots of,  mostly Mac based, iOS based products.  Oh yeah, I've used Spark on iOS.  They're now on Android recently  and they timed it to coincide with the demise of Inbox  because it does a lot of the stuff Inbox does.  Sparrow that Google you're thinking of.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So this has existed on Apple OS's for 12 years.  It does stuff like smart notifications,  email pinning, reminders, smart reminders,  stuff like that.  Smartmailapp.com.  But I'm not gonna recommend it  because that dirty rotten bastard Ron Richards.  Recommended it on All About Android.  I was listening to it on the way to the show  and I'm like, Richards.  Richards!  So I'm not gonna mention it.  All right, so instead,  I'm going to recommend something similar  but more frivolous which is a Google Plus,  I'm sorry, it's a Google,  last time I will ever say Google Plus.  No, no.  It's a Chrome extension called Inbox theme for Gmail.  So it makes Gmail look like  but have none of the functionality of Inbox.  So if you like the color scheme and the stuff like that,  you can now have that in Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you have the answer,  the question answers and all that stuff?  Like the smart replies is what I'm trying to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't have smart replies.  That was the thing I liked the best.  But it does prioritize your inbox  and surface the most important things  and it has smart notifications that will,  again, we're talking about Spark, not the...  Oh, you're talking about Spark.  Spark, the thing I'm not recommending  because Ron Richards already did it on All About Android,  has like, it'll only give you a notification  if you have an incoming inbox that's both important  and from an important person.  So you can sort of not be spammed with notifications  but also get notified when you have a truly important email.  So it's very intelligent.  It has that sort of intelligent,  kind of helping you behind the scenes feel of Inbox  and it'll support all kinds of different platforms.  So email from Microsoft, Google,  and a bunch of other companies.  And you can put all the email addresses,  multiple email addresses into a single inbox.  So it's a really intelligent, powerful thing  that is just newly arrived on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a free tier but there's also a premium tier  and they have enterprise.  But I think for the individual, the free is fine, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly, because the paid tier is really for workers.  Teams, yeah.  Right, it's a lot of sharing functionality and stuff.  But the free version is full function for an individual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what'd be interesting  is to set up an email address for the family  and then use the team features of Spark  because you can discuss something.  So you can have almost a side chat during.  So if you had a family email address,  all the stuff that, you have all the stuff for the family,  go there and then you could discuss it.  Treat your family like a team.  Right.  And that way if you don't like somebody,  you can just fire them.  That's right.  Junior, you're fired.  You're fired.  Spark is at sparkmailapp.com.  It was desktop, now available on Android.  And the Chrome extension is at the Chrome Web Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The inbox theme for Gmail,  just search for it on the Chrome Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least this takes some of the sting out.  Makes Gmail look better.  It looks a lot better than Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like chewing gum when you've quit smoking.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the Nicorette of Inbox.  Inbox Nicorette.  All right, ladies and gentlemen,  time to wrap this up.  Aunt Pruitt, great to have you.  Always a pleasure.  Come back anytime.  You can see him on Tech Republic.  Thank you for having me.  Auntpruitt.com, A-N-T-P-R-U-I-T-T.com.  And if you're in the Charlotte area,  get him. Don't look him up.  Get him for IT support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be no.  No.  Don't ask him how that works.  Why can't I print, Aunt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A printer's not working.  IT, IT.  I know.  I'm so tired of IT.  Oh, I know.  That's a hard job.  That's all the respect in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I do get to look at old school 4GL code,  so that's fine, but still,  about had enough of IT.  Thank you, Aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great to have you.  Cheers.  Cheers also to Mike Elgin.  You didn't even show us this thing  you've been doing this whole time.  We should talk about this.  So I've got a Pixel 3 going on here.  One of these great Joby tripods.  By the way, that's the fancy one,  which I really like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I use this also for my DSLR.  The whole show, I've been using the photo booth feature  of the photo thing in the Pixel 3.  Oh, okay.  Pixel 3.  So whenever we smile and our eyes are open,  it has taken a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so it's choosing the best pictures.  And it says, if you're smiling and your eyes are open,  that's a good picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's using AI to see if everybody is smiling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is kind of like the Google clip, basically.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's smarter.  Yes, and I've been using this in Mexico,  like during our experience,  and we're having a good time making tacos  and learning to cook and stuff.  And I just have it taking pictures.  And all the pictures are great,  because it's like everybody's smiling.  Are you putting them in Mike's nice book?  A few of them might be.  We also have a link to the Mexico City experience,  but a disproportionate number of my photos  were taken using this feature.  So I've been doing it today.  So you don't actually have to take pictures.  Right.  So this is the Mexico City experience pictures.  But these are not done that way?  Many of them are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  And how do you,  can people get on Mike Elgin's nice book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, how do you do that?  You go to my blog or my Twitter feed.  Elgin.com  Or my Facebook feed,  and I occasionally promote the nice book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
