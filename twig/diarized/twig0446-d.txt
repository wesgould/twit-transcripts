Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's like the president going off script. That's what this show is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe you just compared yourself to the president. Whoa, what just happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis No, no, no, we're not going to talk about that. Although,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  are you burned out yet, Jeff? Jeff Jarvis Oh, in some ways, yeah, but in other ways,  Jeff Jarvis I was talking about you had a great conversation on Triangulation on Friday with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a guy I'm sure you hate. He loves you, Andrew Keene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis Oh, Andrew's, I'll censor myself. No, I've said to Andrew's face he's my favorite a-hole.  Jeff Jarvis He's, but he's, but he's,  Jeff Jarvis Because he plays that and he tries to be, he's a provocateur. He tries so hard.  Jeff Jarvis No, I like Andrew. No, he's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis He's literate, he's smart, he's funny. He wrote The Cult of the Amateur about 10 years  ago now, which said the internet, you're making a mistake by being so democratic. And to some degree,  I have to feel like he could take a victory lap now because while you and I and everybody else  was saying you're so wrong. Yeah, this is the new one, How to Fix the Future. You're so wrong,  Andrew. You know, the gatekeepers have fallen, democracy will rule on the internet. It's going  to be great. He was kind of right. But now he's got a very optimistic upbeat book, I think. Have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you read it yet? Andrew Keene  Well, no, I haven't. I've gone through bits of it. But yeah, he'd gone through all the pessimism  he had. So he had to switch. Jeff Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he said, and I think this is actually very true, that, you know, he likened it to the  Industrial Revolution. He said, when you have these big technological revolutions, there's kind of,  there are three camps. There's the camp, the, you know, the Luddite camp that says, no, never  destroy the looms, you know, we're going to stick with candles and kerosene. Then there's the  technologist camp, which I think I have, for a time to time fallen into, which says, yeah,  there's going to be disruption. But in the end, it's, it's going to all be better for everybody  because technology will solve all these problems. And then he says, you can't fall into either one  of those traps, you've got to be in the maybe not the yes or the no, but the maybe camp,  where you acknowledge, and I think this is actually always the reasonable middle, you  acknowledge, technology has brought us amazing things. It's also brought problems and you  address the problems in as as difficult as intractable as challenging as they are. Yes,  you work on them and you solve them. And I think that's, that's your point of view, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, absolutely. It is there. There are problems. There are things we've got to do. It's just,  I'm not ready to give up on technology and say, Oh, let's throw it all out.  Because that's where I fear we're heading. You know, people want to regulate it, they're,  they're afraid of it. And I don't think we're presenting an accurate vision of it. It's the  same problem we talked about last week. You look at your Twitter feed and your Facebook feed, and  it's not filled with Nazis. But if you listen to media, you would think the entire internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is nothing but Nazis. The problem is one Nazi can just ruin your whole day. Well, but that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  media way to look at it. That's like you say, a Nazi got into the New York Times, as opposed to  saying, Oh, there's one nutty Nazi on Times Square, Times Square. Right. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey's pretty bullish too, right? The problem with us as technologists is we have to enjoy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we are very aware of the changes. Well, not only that, I think we benefit,  we put the effort in to benefit from that and celebrate. And it's, I feel like my parents,  and I have lots of friends who are totally normal. And they helped me, like, they helped me guide my  enthusiasms to maybe the more mainstream place. So I'm still bullish. And I don't think, I mean,  Jeff, we are having a backlash right now, but it's not like technology is going to go away.  It's not like we're all going to suddenly give up Facebook or our phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, we are. We're all moving to Vero, the new social platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, indeed. Before everybody takes it out. So before we get there, just a second. So Stacey,  I just read a book called, I think it's The End of Liberalism. And he basically is trying to get us  back and all be Amish. There is that push. Yeah. And I'm sure that like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one or two people might go for that. But it's not going to worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't matter. It's not going to happen. I agree. There's no way it can happen. It's like,  you can argue, let's go back to kerosene lanterns and leeches and bloodletting,  but it's not going to happen. So you have to deal with it. I mean, technology is a kind of  inexorable force. Unless you go, I mean, I guess you could create, you could, you could do what  they do in some Sharia countries. You could, you could turn your back on progressive,  progressivism and technology, but that's all. I think it's always temporary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not. So I just, another new book I just got. You like to read.  Well, I've been doing a lot of research. What you want to, if you can see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw you showed us, you showed us the pile. Yeah. The pile of books.  I guess that's what makes you a professor. That's one of four piles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CNN on in the background too. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. Nicole Wallace, MSNBC.  Oh, that's right. You told me to watch Nicole. Yeah.  Daniel Bell, the coming of post-industrial society in the seventies. Right. And so we've been, we've  been, we've been scratching our heads about this for quite a while before the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh God, forever. This is the human tradition. And I think we'll actually have some interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  things happening as China kind of rises in power in not in the U S versus China,  but collectivism versus individualism. So I think that'll be, that'll be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it trouble you though, that just this week they announced that they were going to eliminate  term limits for president Xi and they're going to go, that looks like a slide back into authoritarianism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My wife was having to fit them. She didn't see any coverage of it, especially at first,  there's a little bit more, but it was very little coverage of it. It's like, oh yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of course they're doing that. It's mal. I mean, collectivism, actually Andrew talks a lot about  this in his book. I think it's becoming more and more clear that China has the will to do what we  seem in the Western democracies to be losing the will to do, which is really invest heavily in  things like artificial intelligence technologies. They're, you know, they're, they're way out  investing the United States in that. And because they're authoritarian, somewhat, I think they're  authoritarian. I'm going to say authoritarian because they're authoritarian. You know, there's  no, there's no debate over whether self-driving cars will ever gain mass approval or not there.  If president Xi decides, yeah, no, I think that's a good thing. Tomorrow, they'll have self-driving  cars. So there's certainly, and it's always been the case that authoritarianism has certain  advantages over the, the roiling of politics into the Western democracies. But as democracies start  to fight in between amongst themselves, I wonder if we're going to lose even more momentum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that, that was the argument of this end of liberalism book is that liberalism is caused to  limit that it encouraged freedom so well that it's broken itself. I don't agree. Of course, at all.  That's not, I could. So let me read John Dewey. John Dewey quotes Carlisle. Carlisle was known  by our democracy, but in a lucid moment, he said, invent the premium press and democracy is  inevitable. Dewey says, add to this, invent the railways, the telephone, mass manufacturing and  concentration of population, urban centers, and some form of democratic government is  humanly speaking, inevitable. I kind of agree. So I can't invent the internet and the,  the globally connected world. What's inevitable? I also, one of the reasons I'm not a fan of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sanctions. I know sanctions are one of the few ways nations can punish other nations.  But I look at North Korea, is isolating North Korea the best way to encourage democracy in  North Korea? I would, I would argue exactly the opposite. Invite a North, you know,  I think the people who are sending USB drives, USB keys into North Korea with a Western programming  are probably doing more to bring down Kim Jong-il, Kim Jong-un than, than our sanctions are,  frankly. And sanctions just publish, I don't know how we got into this sanctions just punished  the people they don't publish, but they don't publish Kim, punish Kim, because he's gonna,  he has access to all the resources of the country. He doesn't have to worry about it.  They punished the normal people. So I don't know, that's a, that's a, that's another topic for,  what about Vero though, really? What about Vero? Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm like, I'm like, how did we get into this? And I am woefully under,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  unprepared for, you have brains, you can, you can talk about this. So Vero is all the rage,  all of a sudden, what happened? It just hit critical mass, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was I in Germany when this happened? I feel like it happened yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. And then on the rundown today, there's a movement to get everybody to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  uninstall Vero already. Yeah, I didn't even install it. And they're already telling me  not to install it. So it's a new social network created by an Israeli, I believe, who some people  say has a checkered past, not, not in a criminal way, but just, you know, having a failed startup  and not paying the employees or something like that. It's also evidently very hard to kill your  account. Yeah, I'm sure there's other complaints. Yeah. Due to it's and one of the reasons that it's  coming to the news is because all of a sudden, this is really interesting. It's that hockey stick.  It's been putting along for six months or so. And then suddenly something happened and it turned  the hockey stick and exponential growth bring bringing their servers down. And that, you know,  they apologize, we're experiencing higher than normal load, we're working to reserve normal  service. I kind of I so I downloaded it reading about it. And I kind of like it. It's very media  focused, right? So when you press the add button, and by the way, it's only iOS,  and Android, it is no desktop version. When you press the add button, you can create a post,  but it focuses on content. So camera, link, music, movie, TV, book, or place. There's nowhere to just  say type of text message. And when you when you pick book, it actually goes through the top books  on iBooks. But you can also do a search. So what was the name of your book, Jeff, so I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's not gonna be in there. Oh, I mean, let's let's do it. Okay, how to fix the future,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  how to fix the I'll just start the search there. See if it pops up with Andrew's  how to fix a broken heart. Actually, that might be more useful. How to fix the future. Let's try that.  Yeah, there it is. Andrew Keene. So you press that it puts a big  picture of the book on there. You have choices of buttons reading want to read recommend,  don't recommend. So let me do recommend. Now you can put some text in.  Just talked to Andrew on twig, I guess I'll say. Oh, no, it was triangulation.  triangulation. This is twig triangulation. And I'll just leave it at that. You can't as far as I  tell, edit it. Now this is also interesting. You when you follow people or you people follow you,  you can categorize them. So you can you can let's do it again, you can choose pretty complicated.  Well, no, once you do it, maybe maybe we need complication to get quality. Once you do it,  it's pretty quick. So you choose close friends or you can extend it to close friends and friends,  close friends, friends and acquaintances public. Oh, that's that's a clear UI. Yeah,  very straightforward. Facebook shows you below who that will be. So I'm going to share it with  everybody who follows me is public, right? You can also this is interesting. There's a Facebook  and Twitter button. So if you want to add your Facebook and Twitter but post links, then it would  be a central place for you to post to all three networks. And then you post it. And so as a result  of that focus on content, I'm sorry about the glare. I got to keep it not just so stupid. Sorry.  You get a lot of the stuff that's in here is a lot of photographers, a lot of book and TV show  recommendations. I think it's kind of courageous, something different. Yeah. I don't know, I kind of  like this. Now, there may be larger issues that aren't apparent from just looking at.  I mean, the first issue, of course, is the issue any new social network suffers from, which is  none of your friends are on it. So but then the but then the on the other side, nobody's no Nazis.  So that's good. Yet. And then there's a way by the way, you can have comments. So it's got a little  Google+. It's got threaded comments as well. Let me find one with a lot of comments so I can show you.  So this is a little bit Google+, right? A comment section.  The only thing I don't know about is the guy, the company, the policy, the service policy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all of that stuff. Well, it sounds like it's at the Daily Beast did some reporting on the guy,  the CEO, not. Yeah, not great. Let me pull it up. See, this is the problem. I mean, you're that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the the yeah, according to a 2016 report from Reuters details of how migrant construction workers  were abandoned in desert camps without paying basic resources. It's like a company called Saudi  Ogre. In a statement, he said he wasn't involved in the company after 2013. All right. So who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think his motto pointed out that hold on, let me just double check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also if you read the terms, people are saying, oh, they're overreaching terms,  but I don't think there's so much different than the terms of Instagram and they say that you own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  your stuff. You can't directly delete an account, you have to request deletion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's Gizmodo's. We regret to inform you that Vero is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So their their update is that the Daily Beast, the CEO said the Vero folks said that the Daily  Beast was inaccurate. However, the only source to say that the CEO had left that Saudi over firm  in December 2013 was the CEO's own Wikipedia page, which had been edited anonymously to include this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  information as of yesterday. It was his family's construction company. He was the deputy chief  executive officer and vice chairman. Yes, Saudi Ogre was the source of most of his family. It's  a terrible name. I'd be Ogre. I'd be I don't know, probably mean something different. If Jeff Ogre,  Ogre. Yeah, it's hard to 31,000 complaints of nonpayment for wages filed against the company.  Saudi government stepped in to provide food and basic living supplies. I have to point out that  this happens all the time in Dubai as well. I mean, this is kind of a. So I don't know, does it? No,  well, that's an interesting question. Should you not use a social network because the guy who started

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it has a bad track record? It depends on how bad it is. Is it abandoning people immigrants in the  middle of the desert to starve to death bad? Is it Broadcom CEO sex dungeon bad? Right. Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's OK. I mean, Jeff won't even buy a basketball from Dick's Sporting Goods or he wouldn't until

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now. So, you know, I mean, it's our society lets you make these calls yourself. You can say, huh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, I'd prefer not to do business with. What if this? OK, this is interesting. So what

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if the software is really good? Right. There is a company in town that makes amazing frozen  foods, frozen Italian foods, and they had a history of fines with OSHA and their workers  losing limbs in their manufacturing plants. But that's the same. Yeah, don't buy from that company

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because that's what you don't want. But this was the food was delicious. Yeah, but I don't want to  buy food from a company that limbs are being lost in. So that's but this is that was this guy's  company before. Nobody's asserting that Vero doesn't pay its employees or is leaving people  to starve in the desert. And maybe and there is some question, Mark, whether this what Harari

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Harari had to do with it. I don't know. I the CEO of this company, should he start another food  company, I would not support it. OK, that makes sense. Because I think I think a district, a casual

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  disregard for human life is, you know. OK, well, the problem is, it's everybody has. So Ali Velshi  today had a really good discussion with Scott Galloway and Stephanie Rule, author of the book.  Yes, about the Dix move and Dix, we should say for those who are not paying attention,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dix Sporting Goods, which through a subsidiary or a resident store called Field and Stream  was selling Carrabba's too, I think, assault rifles, Cabela's Cabela's Cabela's Cabela's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carrabba's is a restaurant. Yes, you get pasta there. You get bullets at the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. So Dix, which continues to sell firearms because it's a sporting goods store,  has decided not to sell AR 15s or assault weapons of any kind. And as a result,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  raise the age of 21 on any gun sales to sell no high volume magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is actually part of a really kind of to me surprising national move against the NRA.  I'm finding this very interesting because. Did you watch the presidential meeting that was on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  an hour ago? No, I'm busy. I'm working. Oh, it was. So it was phenomenal. It was it was one of those  things where he did the public thing with members of Congress from both parties. Yeah. It has a chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And so what you see is somebody in Hope Hicks or somebody has decided this is this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the best way to showcase the president. Well, she's gone now, so that'll change. She's gone.  So, yeah, she just she just got to watch more TV because she admitted she was she lied yesterday.  White lies, white lies, white lies, gray lies, white lies, purple lies, blue lies, lies. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway, let's just do Dick's Sporting Goods because we don't need to. This stack goes all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the way down. Turtles all the way down. Turtles in this show. Turtles, turtles and more turtles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is this move afoot, which is very interesting given how we've went through  so many horrific mass murders that all of a sudden this is the one. And maybe it's the kids  at Parkland. It probably is. Right. But people just said we're going to we're you know, we've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  had enough because it's. Go ahead. I was going to say it's the largest. And then also there was a  really interesting graphic showing how when Columbine happened, Columbine happened, the age  of people who were affected by that are now of an age where so they call it the Columbine generation.  So if you Google that. I mean, you know, there's also a huge political I think there's both an  effort to find things we can agree on and 83, I think, percent of the US supports some basic  forms of, you know, banning assault rifles, raising limits like there. There are some basic rules  about gun control that most Americans support. So and then you've got these charismatic kids who,  my God, the media is listening to them. They're putting them everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's got to be it. Right. It is. Let us let us let us say again,  this is the generation supposedly ruined by the Internet, apathetic, unable to put a sentence  together. And instead, they lived in media and they know how to be on media. And they're being  just absolutely brilliant. I think that's a very good point, Jeff. Oh, the Internet made them who  they are, you know, and in some to some extent, their parents did to their schools did to but it  didn't ruin them. And and it taught them how to be able to talk this way. In some measure, they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  been using social media just brilliantly. I didn't realize this, but Dix had removed  assault style rifles from their Dix sporting stores after the Sandy Hook massacre. But now  they've also removed them from the sale at the 35 Field and Stream stores. This is from Dix  statement. OK, I get it. I was a little confused because I was trying to remember  the last time I've been in a Dix and did I see. Well, we have a big one here and it's the it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the sporting goods store in town. It's funny because Jeff tweeted this came up because Jeff  tweeted I would like to buy a basketball from Dix, but I don't need one. And then Megan,  I don't play basketball. But Megan Maroney immediately did. She went and bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She said, I do. And then just to give the full credit here. So then someone named  Brooks Grigson said, why don't you buy the basketball since you're such a klutz and you  don't play basketball on your own, buy it and give it to a school that needs it. I said,  brilliant idea. So I tweeted, boy, I wish Donors Choose will let you do that. And sure enough,  Donors Choose comes back. And if you search on on this and you can look at my Twitter feed and it's  in there, you can. There are schools that ask for things to be bought at at Dix. And by the way,  Dix doesn't want one match. Oh, that's nice. So I went to schools, I bought, you know,  who wanted basketballs and stuff. And I donated some and and Dix probably make a profit on this,  but it supports what they did and supports the schools at the same time. So thank you, Brooks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Grigson. Megan was telling me that boycotts, according to Freakonomics, don't succeed nearly  as well as the opposite what you're doing, which is supporting a company by patronizing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's look at what's Dix sports. Dix sport. Oh, yes, they are. Oh, yeah.  Do they actually own Cabela's? I thought I saw that, but I could be wrong. It was something  was going passed by my real quickly. So they're up 22 cents. So it did. This did not. That's not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  huge knock them down at all. Yeah. Well, there will be a backlash, right? They'll also be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is actually an interesting. Well, this is where you get the Georgia and Delta,  right? Where Delta having pulled and all these companies did was pull their group discount  plan from NRA members is not a big deal, but symbolic and the parkland teens got it to happen.  And so when Delta has background did that, the lieutenant governor of Georgia pushed through,  and I think the Senate indeed didn't pass a fuel tax benefit that was going to benefit Delta  in Georgia. So they got politically punished for not siding with the NRA. This is from the side of  the house that should be in favor of leaving business alone. But to bring this back to tech,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well, but no, but I think there's very much a tech angle on this. I think you said one thing,  which is that these kids in Parkland grew up as a generation of, you know, a digital native  generation and they were able to take advantage of these technologies, including mainstream media  to get the word out that things like donors choose, make it possible for you and others to  participate in this. And frankly, I think companies like Dix and all the other companies  may have been less quick to act if it didn't, if it weren't for Twitter and social media, right?  Yes.  To get that A, to feel the pressure, but B, to get the word out that they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The point you just made. Yeah. To get the credit, I think. Yeah. So earlier I was saying that  Ali Velshi was on his show with Scott Galloway. That's what led us back to this. And, you know,  he said, he said to his wife, so Amazon or what was it? The Amazon is still on Breitbart and Amazon  this and Amazon that. He said, well, what if you, and Amazon, I guess, still has its deal with the  NRA. So stop Amazon. What are you going to do? Said his wife. Well, I'm going to Walmart. And  the wife said, well, Walmart sells guns. So, you know, you, no one is pure. And running the world  on single issues isn't going to work very well. We've got to be smarter than that, but you do have  a power and these, and these teenagers from Parkland prove the power that you have. It's not,  we don't give up on democracy. Dammit. The internet's enabling it. Dammit. And it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  full of Nazis. Dammit. Right on. Right on. Meanwhile, you could go out and spend $249

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on a crappy camera from Google. What is it getting smashed? So it's getting smashed in the reviews,  but I, okay, here's, here's what I think. It's not totally ready for mainstream, but I actually,  surprisingly thought Farhad Manjoo had a good point about adding intelligence to cameras  and letting cameras start making these judgments. What struck me about-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what the clips does. It's the, it's a camera that you put somewhere and you let it take  pictures. You then put those pictures on your phone and it's, it's choosing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It chooses it. I mean, there is a button where you can press it. But it chooses it. It, it basically  is like, Hey, this looks like a good moment to photograph and then takes a picture. What I think  is art is always defined by technology. It starts out defined by our technology, right? So we had  these wonderful portraits of people sitting very still and formal, you know, because that's, you  had to sit still for a long time to take a picture. And looking at some of the pictures people have  posted, especially of their kids, I'm like, yeah, this is not a traditional photograph that I would  ever compose, but some of the moments are worth keeping. And I think we should keep that in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Farhad took it to Disneyland and didn't take any photos for over two days, but had the clips do  the work. And he says, here's a clip of my son driving a car. He wouldn't have taken, but clips  did. Now I have to point out the quality is potato quality. It's terrible. But, yes. And so that's  disappointing because you might get great pictures or great, it looks like these are like little  animated GIFs. But if the quality is terrible, which it is, it's kind of disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of them, but like, look at this kid's dancing. I mean, the quality, like the framing and  composition, Google can fix that. That's a software update. They can put a better camera in here too,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  obviously. I mean, they make a really excellent camera for their pixels. So there's no reason  they couldn't have a better camera in here. But it's kind of like redefining memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's like a gift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're really right. It's also perspective, Stacey. Remember the very first  Google Glass came out and people had, they were swinging their kids around and you could see the  face as if you were doing it. It changed perspective. You weren't having to hold the camera.  Yeah. I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't know. I mean, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not ready for purchase though.  Yeah. I wouldn't spend...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google or Google. Leo, you bought one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was going to, and then after reading all these negative reviews, I thought,  I don't, first of all, the reviews are done. I think that I don't need to, I don't need to add  onto that. If there were a better camera in it, I would come back. I think it's a first attempt.  It's something that will be interesting. But at this point, I don't want to spend money on that  because it doesn't look like something anybody needs any more information about. Do you feel  like you'd like to know what I think about this? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no. I would like to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about it wasting money.  I think we know enough. I wasted $1,000 this morning buying a Windows on ARM,  the first Windows on ARM device from HP that is going to be a question. It's certainly a  questionable price, the HP Envy 2. But I think that that's an example of something where we  really have to, we have to take a look at it because this is a genre of computing that is new.  This is a LTE enabled Qualcomm 835 based portable from HP, which at $600 would be  very interesting, but unfortunately they're charging $1,000 for it. But they say 22 hours  on a battery charge, which would be quite interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, it's been so long since we've been... I feel like we've been talking about this since 2008.  I know.  So I'm like, wow, finally. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it may not be finally, just like the clips. Had I bought the clips when... I tried to buy it.  When I first got the invite, I tried to buy it and then they said, oh no, you can't get it yet.  And thank God, because I would have one right now if I had been able to.  You could just give it to me. As a parent, I'm kind of interested in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a parent, I always thought I'd be interested in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Farhad also mentioned one of our sponsors, Lighthouse, in his article.  And that's, I think, and you're the one who told me about Lighthouse. And I think that's a similar  idea, a camera that only takes pictures when something of interest happens and then sends  you a notification. In this case, it's a home security device. But I think that's also very  interesting. I like the idea of AI in these cameras as long as you can trust your privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's the privacy. So this is what Farhad was getting at is there's the privacy  aspect with the vendors, but there's also the privacy aspect now that these cameras  have the ability to alert a human. The cameras have the ability to make human judgments and  then alert people. And beforehand, people just didn't have the scale of, you know,  computers can scale out crazily. So it's a little disturbing, I'll be honest. I'm like,  you could have, if you had a jerk boss, you know, and let's say I work, you know, in a building,  not in my house, you know, tell me every time Stacey comes in late, or tell me every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey comes in past 8.02. I am that jerk boss because we had cameras in our old studio that  had microphones on them. They were drop camps. Well, remember that was a problem. John's saying,  no, we didn't. But initially, when we first set them up, we were recording audio until we got some  strong advice from employees. That is illegal in California, I believe.  Yeah. Because there was one thing to pick up what's going on in the public space, our studio,  but another thing entirely to pick up conversations. Yeah, that's creepy. Did you see,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the information just published this story. And so I put it on the rundown because I thought it was  interesting that Google's in talks with construction companies to build apartments for its staff in  Mountain View. Would you live in Google dorm? I'm like, let's talk about surveillance and  employees or employers crossing the line. Let's talk about this. Well, these would be on campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Nearly 10,000 apartments. Well, this is just a natural evolution. I mean, really,  these companies, Microsoft started this with their campus in Redmond. They would hire guys,  kids at a college, and they would make it look like a college campus and give you all sorts  of incentive never to leave, including dry cleaning, food, babysitting, whatever you needed.  And now this is just the logical next step and might as well put some buildings,  apartments in there. So you really don't have to ever go home. For somebody who commutes basically  an hour 45 each way minimum, I'd take it. Yeah. I'd love it. Foxcon does this. If you work at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Foxcon, it's a city. Yeah. Yeah, but that's part of China and they're there to authoritarians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, here's an interesting side note. Katera, the company that Google's talking to  about doing this, has a significant investment from Foxcon. It's prefab housing. That makes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sense if you're in the fabrication business. I can see if you're young, you don't have a family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This would be fantastic. But it is like you have a starting job. It's prohibitive. You can't live

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anywhere near there. Remember the Tennessee Ernie Ford song, right?  Because if you were coal miner, you lived in housing subsidized by the company. You had to buy,  you didn't get paid. You got chits that were only good at the company store. They would lend you.  So he owed his soul because they would give you food. But now I have to continue to work here  forever because I have to pay them back. That is similar in the sense of what happens if you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  living in this Google apartment space and then you decide you want to leave Google or you're fired.  Right now you have 30 days. I lost my job and my apartment.  Yeah. See, that would be terrible. I don't know what's happening at my house, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody your age, nobody that age thinks, oh, I'm going to lose my job. They don't think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God. I think they all think that. They're one of the most economically insecure generations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they don't have any illusions of businesses being loyal to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. No, you're absolutely right.  Right. So in a way, this is the company store back again. Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just was like, oh, look, hello, Dystopia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon buys our sponsor, the Ring Video for $1 billion. At least that's the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might be more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More? We don't know because nobody's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. How much is the owner of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. They raised $210 million over the last six years.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I love-  There's got to be.  People posted immediately on Twitter the video of Jamie, the founder, pitching,  was it Zawinski, pitching his video doorbell to the shark tank people who turned him down.  Turn him down, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They turned him down with reason. That doorbell, the door-bot doorbell was a piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but they could have had a chunk of ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one takes the shark tank deals. My friends who are on Shark Tank are like,  don't do it. It's terrible terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a terrible deal. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, but I know-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I show it to my students how to pitch.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon's second biggest acquisition ever according to recode between $1.2 and $1.8 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because Zappos was $1.2. So, if that's true, and it could be, and IHS was saying-  And Whole Foods was what?  Whole Foods is $13.7 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was the biggest by far. So, this would be number two only,  second only to the Whole Foods acquisition. So, it's funny because Amazon actually,  in fact, we talked about this story. They talked to August. I think you like the August, right?  You weren't here that week when we talked about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  August doorbell? I don't like the doorbell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, not doorbell, locks.  The locks are fine.  Yeah, they talked to August and then walked away from that deal and created Amazon Key,  which was the thing that nobody should ever do, which allows the Amazon delivery person to walk  into your house, put the package in your house and leave. And there's a camera and then there's a  lock associated. So, they developed that. And that wasn't so long ago. That was a few months ago.  And now they bought Ring. But Ring doesn't make door locks, but they do make cameras.  They make doorbells. They make security lights with cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And one day, if they get over their ADT lawsuit, they may sell a security system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. They had a home security system that ADT stopped, stymied with a lawsuit.  Interesting. Clearly, this has to do with. Well, I don't know what this has to do with.  Clearly, I don't know what I'm talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you want me to explain it to you? I can even tie it back to Google if you'd like.  Please, please.  Okay. I wrote about this actually last night. Normally, I do not cover news, but this was big  enough. And I was like, I know what this is about. So, what's happening is security,  home security has been like the killer app for the Internet of Things. We all thought it was  going to be home automation, but it's not. It's definitely home security. And smart doorbells  is one of those, right? Yeah. Smart doorbells, smart cameras, all of that are the big winners.  So, what's happened is the market, it's basically for the last year or so, it's been a blood bath.  You're either going to win big or you're going to die or you're going to get acquired. So,  everybody's trying to get acquired. Ring was out raising money. Amazon saw what they could do  after having Alexa and all the success in the smart home. They're like, well, shoot,  this space is probably pretty good for us. We should get in on that. And so, the blink buy  gets them the technology, the video processing technology at low powers that's really important  for them. Ring is going to get the market share. IHS says there are about 1.2 million ring doorbells  out there. It's by far the largest video doorbell company with 45% of the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd like to take full responsibility for that. Yes, you should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should. Yes. I should also note Ring is actually a sponsor of my show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go. So, we both can take responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, well, no, I'm just noting because I'm talking about it.  All those ethics, I won't take responsibility for it, but you should,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo. Your audience is much bigger. I think we pushed a lot of doorbells out the door.  There you go. They've been on for two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ages. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. So, Ring basically now has the technology for a credible  video system and it has the market power and reach. And Ring for a long time was not,  it's doorbells. They don't make a lot of money on them if they make anything. So,  that's the other thing. I think getting a new video processor like the Blink video processor  in there and having Amazon's cloud kind of capabilities should help it cut down on its  materials. That would make a lot of sense, actually.  There's a synergy there that Amazon could bring to the table. That would be very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And after all, Echo and Ring are both a great company. I think they're both great companies.  Echo and Ring have been worked together for some time. So, yeah. Okay. That all makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They are saying that Ring and ADT settled. Apparently, one person, one source says for

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  25 million, which is twice what Ring offered. This is some of the Bezos money, I would guess.  Because after all, if you're going to acquire a company, you don't want them  hobbled by lawsuits. So, yeah. Ring is apparently settled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At CES, I heard they were very close to settling. But again, and I heard that from multiple sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, ADT accomplished what it wanted to, which was keeping Ring out of the market over the  Christmas, yeah, over the holiday buying season. So, yeah.  Jason Calacanis says the biggest loser in Amazon Ring deal is alarm company ADT. So, there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the biggest loser is going to be all of the... It's actually probably going to be us or  anybody who buys into... Who wanted multiple ecosystems. Because what we're seeing is a  Google ecosystem. Amazon. Yep. Amazon ecosystem. Maybe an Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes me very sad. Well, Apple pioneered the whole idea. An Apple...  No, they didn't. Of ecosystem plays?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it was like smart homeset? No. Not of smart homes. No, but of ecosystem plays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple, more than any company, one of the reasons Apple is so valuable is because they were able to  create an ecosystem and they've been really nasty about keeping others out of that ecosystem.  They want to own it 100%. And in fact, iTunes for Windows is about the only chink in that armor out  there. And so, you got to look at that and say, well, that worked pretty well. And I'm sure that  that's exactly what Amazon and Google are looking at. It's bad for consumers. Consumers like you,  Stacey, want a heterogeneous system. Standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think it'll be better for the industry if there's heterogeneous systems, just because...  Well, there could be innovation. Yeah, more companies will develop for it,  et cetera, et cetera. But also, look at now what happens if you're Skybell or if you're  another Canary or are your Nest cameras going to continue to work on your Amazon or whatever?  Your Ring stuff continue to work on the upcoming Google screen efforts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, what's unknown, I mean, Amazon bought Audible as well and has not changed anything  about Audible as far as I can tell. So what's unknown is how much Amazon will change Ring's  business. They say right now...  How do you use advantages? Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the sources in the industry say that Ring is going to run it like Zappos or Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Zappos is a really good example. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I would say Audible... Zappos is quite independent. I think that Audible got a lot  of marketing advantages, obviously, from Amazon. Right? Marketing and billing. It's so seamless now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that I'm doing both. Audible is not a hardware maker, so that's easy.  So if you sell shoes, that's different. If you make doorbells, that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yes. Zappos can even do its crazy... What is it? The heli-o-tochrissy? What is that?  What do they call that? Their management style?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever that is. Not at all like Amazon.  What's it called? Chatroom?  I'll just Google it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Heli-o-tochrissy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd think Googling it would work. Chatroom has no comment.  They're Googling it too. No one knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're just faster Googlers than we are. That's all.  That's what... That's the human Google.  I've seen that word once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holacracy. Holacracy or holacracy?  H-O-L-A-crissy. Yeah, holacracy. That sounds right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Katie Couric is no longer at Yahoo! And now we know why. She says,  they hired all these famous big names and they treated us like we were in the witness protection  program. What? Katie's funny.  This was a joint interview with Kara Swisher, Ricota, and Katie Couric's own podcast.  She said, during her tenure at Yahoo!, Couric sought to do the high quality journalism  rather than the low rent stories Yahoo! was best known for at the time, which she likened to,  the boy who lived on ramen noodles for 13 years.  You won't believe what happened next. She said, Marissa Meyer was open to these aspirations but  didn't follow through. I don't think she ever understood the commitment that would take Couric,  said. I think she had a lot of other things on her plate, in fairness. I wouldn't say it was an  unhappy marriage, but it certainly was not fulfilling for me. I had all this great content.  I was getting big interviews and it was sort of like a tree falling in a forest. They didn't  put it on the front page or they didn't know how to even now. They don't have very good  distribution. They really don't know how to market things properly. They didn't know how to take

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  quality and make it scalable. I had coffee with Katie before she went there and she really was  going to try to rethink video news and was open to all that. She had a very smart staff and  nothing really much came of it. She is a wordsmith. Listen to this quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's good. She's really good. These tech companies are not media companies. They do not care about  stories, about content, about true connection. I think they care about widgets and gadgets and  delivery systems, but they aren't super interested in the vegetable soup that's running through the  pipes. I think the secret sauce is people who are technologically savvy, but also respect and care  about storytelling. The company that combines those two things is going to win the day. I  haven't really found it yet. Katie, I've got a thousand dollar check in my pocket that says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you belong at Twit. Should we try to get Katie on the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know her. I'll ask her. She has her own podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's somebody else I was going to ask and I forgot to tell you what I was asking. I forgot

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to tell them, so I'll do that too. By the way, she hates the name Oath. She told Tim Armstrong  the company should be called RISE. R-I-Z-E has both an optimistic brand and a play on the word  Verizon. The new name was already locked in. Katie says, I think they paid a lot of money to come  up with Oath. Whatever. Let's take a break. Go for it.  I now know what you look like. You look like, Stacey, like you're in the show, The Leftovers.  Did you ever see that? Yes, that's it. That's it. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, because I'm wearing my big shirt, my big white shirt apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your white caftan. Actually, you look great. It's very flattering. I mean,  normally you don't wear white on TV, but you look like an angel, I'll be honest with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a glow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I look like the devil. I'm wearing my L.L. Bean bush jacket.  I like it.  Well, if I... Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looks like you're headed to Dix to buy some guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. I almost wore my pith helmet to work today.  Jeff Jarvis is also here from the City University of New York.  It's always a pleasure, you guys. This is really, to me, it's great to have Kevin Tofel on. He was  wonderful last week. And the others who took two people to fill in for Stacey last week,  but really it's the best. This is my favorite configuration of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and see, I didn't realize this until just now. Jeff is the dark half and I'm the light half.  I know. Look at this. I'm glad I wore green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're neutral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm in neutral.  If I tried to wear that, my face would just disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The camera would be so confused. It wouldn't know what to do. Or maybe that would work.  Maybe I should do that. Maybe then the camera would know what to do.  I have makeup on, Jeff. It helps.  Nothing will help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, a little rouge, maybe some lip gloss.  I'd be pinker.  Oh, I forgot. I got my LED eyelashes. I forgot to bring them in.  No. Oh, Leo.  Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, send someone to your house right now. Oh, no, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a Kickstarter I bought a year ago. A thousand competitors beat them to the market  by months for a lot less money. They finally came. And because I think you were the one  who told me about them, right, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so. Well, I didn't tell you to buy them. I just was like, hey, these exist. They're awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was the best. Let's get Leo to waste money day we've ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a good day. Now we want to see. So next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, you're not here next week.  I'll wear them to South By.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we want to see them on camera. You can't deprive your audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. I'll wear them next week.  Thank you, Stacey.  By the way, I will not. You'll be here next week because you're not traveling anywhere.  You live in Austin, but I will have to leave early next week because we have to fly to Austin.  We are going to be at South By Southwest. Very excited. Stacey is going to be hosting a panel.  I'll be on the panel along with other security experts at Antone's at the Capitol One house at  Antone's. It's an early morning session on Friday, the 9th, March 9th with breakfast tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There better be breakfast. I was promised breakfast tacos from taco deli. I know I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  taking this very seriously. Even if I have to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's costing you a fortunately. Now you're buying tacos for a multitude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't say for everybody, just for Stacey and you.  Oh, just Stacey. Okay. That's good. All right. That's good.  So that'll be fun. That's 8 30 a.m. Antone's on March 9th, Friday. There is a meetup if you'd  like to come the night before an open, open, non-hosted meat house, open bar, meat house.  It's called a meetup. M-E-A-T.  A meetup at the meat house at Friedman's meat house. So that's a big barbecue place in a new  one in Austin. And we're, I think we're starting five 30 to seven 30, something like that. But.  I'll be there. Are you going to come? Oh, great.  I am. I will. I will buy you dinner. And I think Wendy said she's going to come. She's from Austin.  She's on our panel. So we're going to get as many people as we can. And of course you're welcome.  Leo is not buying everybody dinner. No, it's open. What do you, it's open bar.  No host. Open bar means you can drink on my tab. It's not that.  Yeah. You don't know. It's not that. It's no host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The host. Leo is not the host.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paying for anything. If you show up, you get to talk to Leo while he's eating stuff he bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll have sauce all over myself. It'll be great. It'll be great. I'm, I can't, I love going to  Austin. I miss South by some really excited about getting to go to that. So Friedman's meat house.  No, I don't think they call themselves that, but it's a barbecue. And then the next day at Anton's,  next morning at Anton's don't reverse that. And then I, so I think Jason Hall will be on the show  next week hosting and then I'll be back in two weeks with LED eyelashes. Yes. How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you know that there's a German magazine, very popular, very well done magazine.  It's all about beef, beef.de. Not surprised.  I don't think it's about pig.  Meat house and taking in beef. You're going to be, you're going to be cholesterol.  Wow. Beef.  Men cooking and other stuff.  Ah, Haxensstadt Schnitzel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steak Messer, Kork Messer and Einer Perfumule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the exclamation point after the beef. It's not enough to have a whole magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But beef's not a German. What's the German word for beef?  Fleisch.  Fleisch. That would not be a good word. That would be a really gross name for a magazine.  Yeah. And right in the front, United Steaks.  Says the United Steaks of America. So beef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the meat house, the meat magazine, it's meat time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, look, they have a fold out. Every, every month there's a fold out. This month,  the perfect burger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Burger.  Oh Leo, I saw something for you to buy.  It's a gatefold.  They have the beef dry ager.  Oh, I might need that.  Scroll down that page. There's a big, this is major, this is serious. Beef ager. Keep going.  Keep going.  Die besten Steaks der Welt.  This keeps the health by Enid Sennhausen. You too could have this at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  People, that's some serial killer stuff. Imagine that next to your wine fridge  and people are walking in and they're like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that hanging there?  Oh my God. We went over to Leo's and he had something hanging. Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  What? There's something else. If you go down further, there's the beef, beefer,  800 degrees for the perfect steak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, I have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keep going down.  I have that.  More, more, more, more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a, I have a grill called the Solair that cooks at a thousand degrees.  Yeah, it's like that.  Yeah, it's like that.  You have that?  Well, not that. I have mine's a grill.  Something like that.  Yeah, something like that.  Thousand degrees.  That's beautiful.  Yeah, actually that is that go right next to the beef hanging in the window.  I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.  I want to turn my house into one of those Brazilian barbecues with the swords.  Or churrascaria.  Whatever.  The one in Austin has meat hanging in the window.  Yeah, it does.  Yeah, there's a bunch in Austin.

Transcript:  I went in there during the South by Southwest one year.  I went in with a colleague who was a Hindu and he just said from the smell of the place, he said,  Oh, I just can't go in.  I can't do it.  I can't go here.  No, I don't blame him.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like you're eating God.  Yeah.  Can't do it.  No.  We actually are talking, believe it or not.  Oh, we have two new sponsors.  I saw the other one.

We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  I love the register.co.uk.  They really, they're really kind of knocking it out of the park.  The latest story from the register, a US watchdog just gave up trying to get Google to explain  YouTube's huge financial figures.  Don't you worry your pretty little heads about it?  Says Web Giant.  Kieran McCarthy who's great writing in San Francisco.  In a series of alternately baffling, amusing and darn right ridiculous letters, Google  Parent Alphabet has told America's financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission,  to mind its own business when it comes to income.  On Monday, the SEC published six months worth of correspondence between its staff and the  online giant in which the regulator repeatedly asked Google to explain,  why don't you break your revenue out into business segments?  The nerds at the chocolate factory told the anti-fraud officials it was probably too  complicated for their little heads to figure out.  They're not the only ones.  Microsoft, Apple, none of these companies break out their financials.  Apparently, they're not required to.  Although, maybe the SEC disagrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon had to finally start reporting its cloud revenue once it became material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's based on a new rule, new as of last summer, that says investors in a public company,  this is by the way, the whole rationale for this, should see the same top level financial  information the CEO sees.  If you're investing in a company, you have a right to see the company's financials.  You don't, it's not right for you to hide stuff from people who are putting their money  into your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which leads to the next story about what do Larry and Sergey and Sundar and company each  do differently.  This was interesting too.  Larry sets Sundar's pay, but nobody below Sundar, for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sundar sets everybody else's pay.  Who sets Larry's pay?  The board.  The board, yeah.  Who sets the board's pay?  Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The HR person who's in charge of the compensation committee.  And who sets her pay?  Doesn't one of them just take a dollar though?  Her pay is set by the CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  That's actually a problem in America in general, which is the boards do whatever the CEO wants  because there's a scratch, you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours thing.  And this is why we have CEO compensation.  Well, take a look at Evan Spiegel, the creator of Snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CEO compensation inflation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Snap, is Snap profitable?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Snap, well, here's the good news.  Snap lost $100 million less this year than they did last year.  They only, last year they lost 200 million, they only lost 110 million this year.  But CEO Evan Spiegel got paid, how much would you guess?  $638 million.  That's the biggest CEO pay award since Tim Cook took over for Steve Jobs and got a big jumbo  piece of the pie.  Well, and the problem is the board, which does, I'm pretty sure in most cases  determine CEO compensation, they have no interest in, you know, I don't know, maybe they should.  The salary was 77% of Snap's revenue for the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I would not, what's weird is people are still investing in this, which is crazy to me  because like, why would you invest in that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, Snap's really struggling, aren't they?  I mean, their stock price did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we did the story last week, Snap had a good quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they didn't lose as much money, they had a good quarter.  They only lost $110 million, that's a good quarter, I guess, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, didn't they have issues with Kylie Jenner?  Did that happen this week?  So when Kylie Jenner tweeted, yeah, did we do this last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think we did.  We did this, we did part of it last week.  Did we?  We did the controversy about Snap last week, we didn't know Kylie Jenner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So February 22nd, so that was the day after we did Twig last week, Kylie Jenner tweets,  so does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore or is it just me?  Ugh, this is so sad.  Snapchat as a result loses $1.3 billion in stock market value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a sick society and economy we're in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, let's be really fair and honest, it also the same day,  an analyst downgraded them from hold to sell and the market is in general kind of looking,  and it has to do a little bit too, I imagine, with Evan Spiegel's amazing compensation.  And concern mostly that Facebook and Instagram are starting to eat them alive.  It's also because there's been a revolt.  1.3 million people signed the Snap, this is what we talked about last week,  the Snap, the petition to say, at change.org to say, please change back to the old UI.  So it all adds up to a big stock loss, but Kylie Jenner didn't help, let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And she sells headlines and you can put her face on your story and it's easy to find and nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo will repeat it because he's looking for any reason to do a Kylie Jenner voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, that is not a Kylie Jenner voice.  I don't know how she sounds. That's the beauty of it.  That's just a jerk guy doing a teenage girl voice. I mean, that's kind of what that voice was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did she just call you a jerk?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a stereotypical jerk guy way of talking about a teenage girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She called you a jerk and a stereotype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't believe Kylie's a teenager anymore.  That's her point.  I'm sorry, now I have to listen to some Kylie Jenner video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sick of people being mean to teenage girls. They have it real tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Jenner's?  She's 20 now. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And she has a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh well, I can't find any Kylie Jenner audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's on a TV show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The internet, it's broken.  Yeah, she's everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all on Snapchat and she pulled it. It disappeared after 24 hours.  I don't even honestly, I don't even know who she is.  Is that Kylie Jenner?  She's on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, she's one of the Kardashian people. She's related to...  Is it Kylie Kardashian Jenner?  No, no. Kylie and her sister...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're yelling at me for doing a valley girl voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I am. I just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, when I do valley boys, I don't go like this, man.  I mean, I make fun of them both, equally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you find her?  I think so. We'll see if she talks.  No, she's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the problem. Kylie never speaks.  Is that her scream?  So I apologize for offending you.  To our daughter. Here she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, here we go. Here we go. Here's Kylie Jenner exclusive interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got it? Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I play it? Let me play it from here. Is this the To Our Daughter video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know if she speaks there or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we're waiting for you, Kylie. Right there.  She's pointing.  It's gonna be okay.  Oh, she's cute.  Apparently she's having a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, she sounds... Oh, no, that wasn't her.  That's her.  All right, she sounds normal.  I apologize, Kylie.  You sound normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever your name is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that kind of sounded...  Is that how I found out about you?  Is that her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. Maybe.  That's somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's somebody else. That's a friend.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I've been living our lives having fun.  She met your father.  Oh, yeah, that's her friend.  And they just hit it off.  Kimmy Stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't think what I did sounds a little bit like that?  That's not...  Kimmy Stream.  Right enough.  Kylie.  Okay, her friend.  I was doing her friend reading Kylie's tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, fine.  Fine, fine.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just...  Somebody said the show is being cardassassinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, speaking of the SEC, which we worked on 10 minutes ago,  they've launched a cryptocurrency probe.  That sounds painful.  Yep.  On whom?  They subpoenaed a personal...  Can they unlock my Bitcoin wallet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that would be...  That's a probe worth taking.  Google Beta Tests Flutter Toolkit for Better Cross-Platform Apps.  We were talking about this on Windows Weekly.  I didn't understand it then either.  The idea is, I guess, that  you build an app for both iOS and Android with one open source toolkit.  They're native apps.  And here's a little bonus for Google.  They also work with Google's new OS, Fuchsia.  This was announced at Mobile World Congress.  Flutter is officially in beta.  Let's watch the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mobile users expect their apps to have beautiful designs,  smooth animations, and great performance.  To deliver on this, developers need to create new features faster than ever  without compromising on quality or performance.  That's why we built Flutter.  Flutter is Google's mobile UI framework that provides a fast and expressive way...  How would Tom Brokaw say Flutter?  Flutter.  ...to build native apps on both iOS and Android.  This is because apps and interfaces made with Flutter are built from single code...  Google has this now, something called Flutter.  ...compiled directly to native ARM code.  Use the GPU and can access platform APIs and services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not informative.  This is just some silly video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd rather watch the Waymo video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is there a Waymo video?  You watched the Waymo video?  Yes.  It's very cool.  It's also trying to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is, you will like the future in our hands.  It will be okay.  You will be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a 360 experience.  While we're doing this, I will...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pan.  Pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I clicked the button.  A G-L-I-O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We started working on self-driving cars.  Today, we're called Waymo.  And our fully self-driving cars are on the road.  They use a range of technology we've built from the ground up...  Ooh, look.  ...to understand the world around them and get you where you need to go.  Cease things.  You're about to see how it all works.  Okay.  ...and what it feels like to ride on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the Waymo-beel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As it drives, Waymo uses LiDAR, which sends out millions of laser beams per second,  to build up a detailed picture of the world all 360 degrees around it.  That's neat.  It also uses radar to detect how far away objects are and their speed.  And high-resolution cameras detect visual information,  like whether a traffic signal is red or green.  It then combines all that data to understand the world around it.  For example, in this fraction of a second, it knows exactly where it is on the road.  It's going, there's a cop!  ...everything around it in full 360 degrees.  And then predict what those things might do next.  That's the thing that's interesting, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would those things do next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it doesn't just do that for the objects you and I can see.  This is cool.  It can do that for things up to three football fields away.  How does it do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, LiDAR is how the range of light is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What makes LiDAR it's how the range of light is possible is experience.  Waymo has already self-driven millions of miles on complicated city streets,  and it's constantly learning from every single mile it drives.  There's the Waymo-beel.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  With all that knowledge, it can plan a safe path ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In this instance, giving that cyclist enough room to cycle past us,  and also looking out for that pedestrian on the sidewalk.  That's better than I can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd hit one or the other.  And when it comes to making decisions, this is a good example of how Waymo doesn't just take into account your safety.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See the small child?  It also makes sure that both you and the people around you feel secure and at ease.  By the way, that's really important.  That's a psychological thing, not a tactical driving thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it errs in the side of reassuring you, right?  So now that you know how Waymo works, it's time to take your first ride in one of our cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ooh.  So this is again 360.  I don't want to do too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're in the back seats of a car.  Yeah, because I don't want to make you queasy.  Some things might immediately stand out.  The fact that there's no one in the driver's seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to do that.  Well, why am I sitting in the back seat if there's no driver?  Shouldn't there just be one seat?  I like it that we have displays about what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tesla, as you know, Stacey, because you have one, does that.  And that's very helpful when your autopilot's engaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, when you're like, does it see this?  I don't know if it sees this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, I think that's a good example of how Waymo works.  I think that's very helpful when your autopilot's engaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, when you're like, does it see this?  I don't know if it sees this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All this technology, which allows Waymo to see, identify, predict, and plan,  should make an extraordinary ride feel completely ordinary  and create a very normal journey that simply gets you from A to B safe and sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting that they still have cars with front seats and back seats  and a driver's seat and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they just got cleared to test without a driver.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In California.  Really?  Yeah.  Would you get in one of those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because I'm crazy.  You know, wouldn't you?  You buy neon eyelashes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's no worse than teaching your teenager to drive.  Yeah.  Right?  It's probably much less worse.  That's really a nightmare.  And in fact, I was thinking about it the other day.  The only way I got through it is by just assuming that I was going to die.  It's like, well, probably I'm going to die now,  but I've had a good life and I'm just going to go with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My family just took me to the driver's ed place, so they would have all the pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's what we're going to do with Michael.  He's 15.  He'll be getting his learner's permit in a few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does he want to?  I'm wondering if Anna will ever get her learner's permit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's 11.  You know, my biological son, Michael's my stepson, Henry, who's now 23,  he deferred it until he was 18.  In California, you can get a permit when you're 15 and a half and drive when you're 16.  He didn't get it until he was 18.  My daughter, the minute she could go in the DMV to get the permit she did the day,  she was waiting at the door.  So it's just different people.  I know Michael wants to learn because his father's a car buff.  He's already decided which car he's going to take to the driver's test,  which car he's going to learn in.  He's got the whole plan in his head already, so I'm not looking forward to that.  But I don't think I'll have to sit next to him.  I do remember sitting next to Abby and literally thinking,  I guess kind of fatalistic about it, like, well, what are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Otherwise, you're screaming the whole time.  That's not that's unseemly and makes it more likely that she's going to run into something, right?  I like that.  That's unseemly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pressing your imaginary brake or you reach for the wheel, which is very dangerous, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should not do that, dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alphabets.  I'm going to hope I don't have to deal with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not fun, but it's, you know, it's part of parenthood.  Having a teenager is not fun enough for many, many, many reasons.  Alphabets are for them is is also so we saw Amazon joining with Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan to do health.  Apple has announced it's going to do health care for its employees, AC health care,  and now Verily is plotting a move into the health insurance industry.  That's Google's or I should say Alphabets life extension, right?  Verily is the life extension company or health care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The contact for diabetes and other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're in 2016, Muld jointly putting in a proposal with Alphabets backed Oscar Health to manage health care for thousands of low income Rhode Island residents on Medicaid.  Oscar should mention was a sponsor and is run by Jared Kushner's brother.  Little side note.  The it's a it's a it's an interesting startup.  The idea is to use technology to do a more effective health care solution, but it's only available in a few states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they're going to work together to do what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to reduce the cost and take part of that benefit.  And what's interesting to me, the way the story put it was that it's all about that they're all interested in going into areas of risk.  They can reduce risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In other words, serve people really need it most.  The riskiest part of the population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that it?  Or they're trying to reduce the overall risk and thus economically benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, here's the low income Rhode Island residents.  These are high risk insure and they're hard to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they can reduce the risk for them, they can do it for anyone.  I think it's kind of OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Taking on health risk is a different order of magnitude of complexity than what we see in the other industries.  Right. To make a dent in health spending, experts say companies need to have the right blend of talent resources or risk losing money if it costs escalate.  Yeah, I mean, it's look, if you're a low risk, it's easy to get health insurance.  Right. Right.  And it's less expensive.  But that's not who needs health insurance.  And that's the whole idea of, you know, this whole idea of having forced insurance and all that is to get a larger pool of both healthy people.  Let's see.  Google.  Is this my typo or yours, Karsten?  It's an article about Google Word Coach.  But it's written here.  That's me.  Google Word Couch.  I guess I need it.  Google Word Couch.  Sorry.  A fun game in the search results.  I haven't seen this.  Well, because I think we speak English.  Oh.  This is to learn English.  Oh, neat.  So when you do a search that triggers a dictionary or translate box, Google may show you this word coach that helps you expand English language vocabulary in a fun and engaging way.  So that's cool.  Which word is similar to strength?  Oh, I want this for Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I do, too.  These Google.  Are you listening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google currently is only available in non-English speaking countries and in India, which is an English speaking country.  But it's where it's available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So another Google story, if I may.  Yes, please.  A rare win for Google in Germany's courts.  Germany's highest court rules that Google is not obligated to ensure websites are free from defamatory content before displaying links.  So somebody who had a right to be forgotten claim said, not only do we want you to take that down, we want you to never let anything bad like that come up again.  Right.  And the court said, no, that's not the job.  And the court also stood up for search engines and the value of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because here in the United States, the House of Representatives yesterday voted the exact opposite.  This is no.  Yeah, FOSTA, the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, allows for private lawsuits and criminal prosecutions against Internet platforms and websites based on the actions of their users.  It overturned Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.  Which is our first.  Yeah, it's safe harbor.  The bill passed, get this, 388 to 25.  It overturns all of 230.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Oh, no, that's deadly to conversation online.  That means basically that any site is going to play safe by the interaction.  And they're responsible, so they're not going to allow any interaction.  So that really sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I had a comment section on Twitter and somebody put something libelous or nasty or defamatory or whatever on there, I could get sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even if they're not more of an I did not see this.  Why is there not more of an up?  Why are we not in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But today, yeah, but we've been warned about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've been talking about it for a week.  I know.  I've seen any coverage.  No, the Senate.  The Senate has to vote.  But now is the time.  Absolutely.  To write or call your member of Congress, particularly Senator, and say, please, you have to vote against FOSTA.  Do not be fooled into thinking this somehow has anything to do with sex trafficking.  It doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw it on Jezebel, I think, yesterday.  Ours had a story today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm talking about the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN and places where it makes a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And look at the fact that this is what's really important because there hasn't been a public who and cry on this.  The House, which should know better, passed it 388 to 25.  Oh, God.  So that just shows that there isn't a general understanding in Congress about why this is a bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is why I have a fit about the moral panic, because now anything you do against technology is going to go swimming through the political realm because technology is bad for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  EFF writes, the tragedy is that FOSTA isn't needed to protect or sue sex traffickers.  As we've said before, Section 230 simply isn't broken.  Right now, there's nothing preventing federal prosecution of an Internet company that knowingly aids in sex trafficking.  That includes anyone hosting advertisements for sex trafficking.  That's explicitly a federal crime.  The website that produced the most discussion around this issue, Backpage.com, is reportedly under federal investigation.  The array of online services protected by Section 230 and thus hurt by FOSTA is vast.  Review sites, online marketplaces, discussion boards, Internet service providers, any news publication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even news publications with comment sections. This affects us all in media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if this passes, comments are gone.  I'm not going to have comments on my blog, that's for sure.  It puts Reddit out of business, I would guess, literally out of business and anything like Reddit.  This is disastrous.  And you're right, Jeff, where's the mainstream coverage of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my problem. Stacey, you're right, it's in the tech world.  But unless this passes over into the Pippa, Sopa, Peepa, Creepa, whatever the hell those were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is like SESTA, which we were able to bring down. It's terrible.  I think Teen Vogue had something.  Teen Vogue, right on Teen Vogue.  Yay, yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's too depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did stop SESTA, but now there's FOSTA.  Honestly, the best thing you can do at this point is call your senator.  If it passed by that vast margin across all party lines in the House, it's almost certain to pass the Senate, right?  Yeah, I would guess.  Fortunately, the president will never sign this in that law.  That's a joke. That's facetious, he will.  Logan Paul's back, didn't last long.  Oh, but he's on 90-day probation. Super secret double probation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Still not eligible for YouTube's preferred ad program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, preferred. We're just going to make sure he's good for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this ties into the Little Things story, as far as I'm concerned.  The death of Little Things.  Little Things is not the least bit offensive, but it was a child, it is now a dead child, of the business model of going after volume and going after attention that leads to all this.  Little Things was a really fluffy little publisher that did little restaurant things, recipe things and other stuff, and it built on top of Facebook.  And so Facebook changes the algorithm to get rid of dumb, shareable stuff, and there goes Little Things and their closing.  And some people on Twitter said, when I noted this, they said, well, you should be, this is people lost their jobs, which I feel bad for.  Other people said, well, live by the platform, die by the platform.  Okay, but my argument here is that it's bigger than that.  The business model behind Facebook said, let's reward shareable content.  So companies were created and media companies were made to, let's make lots of shareable content.  And then that makes for a really rotten experience.  And then Facebook finally says, oh, that was crappy.  Let's get rid of all that shareable, yunky content.  And then boom, down go those companies.  What's wrong here is the business model behind all of this that goes for volume for volume's sake and that rewards track.  So the real question is, what's quality?  How do we get to quality?  How do we reward that?  How do we re-figure that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you look at this, the site is, it's almost, it's not demand media, but it really is clearly.  It's very close.  It's very close.  I'm not crying here.  Calculated to generate, yeah, to generate traffic because their subject matter is food, parenting, pets, and DIY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now mind you, I was a TV critic.  I'm not exactly sitting on a high horse here.  I started an entertainment weekly.  I'm not exactly sitting on a high horse.  I'm okay with fluff.  I get it.  I get lifestyle.  I get service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But this is just.  And look at how they do this.  I mean, here's the article.  I put a wacky doggy leotard on my dog to see if it would help with their anxiety and dander.  And of course, a big button, share on Facebook, right?  And that's what this is all about.  It's actually, this is actually an ad.  I take it back.  This is, this is thinly veiled as editorial.  It's actually.  Oh, it is.  Oh, so let's, by the way, it doesn't say ad when I clicked the link.  Oh, yeah.  How about this 18 month old?  Is that an advertisement?  Maybe they're not ads.  Then maybe this just, what does this mean?  I don't think so.  I don't know.  Oh, maybe I'm miss.  Oh, maybe that's maybe there's my ad blockers blocking the ad.  That's what.  Let's turn off the ad blocker.  There we go.  Now we can see the ad.  There is the ad.  And by the way, the ad does feature a number of fine dog sweaters and leotards.  All right.  Yeah.  I mean, I can't warn this, but this is a whole category of content that, I mean, I  know Mashable's struggling.  Mashable just got sold.  There's a lot of a lot of sites that are going to disappear.  Even Vox laid off last week.  Yeah, Fox laid what?  50 people off.  I thought Vox, if anybody Vox, did they say why they laid those people off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think they also said they're going to be strong and fun.  I think they will be.  They just some of the things that were getting rewarded aren't rewarded now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is just what's happening across the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Atlantic's hiring more.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.  Racked, Curbed, SB Nation.  Those are the three Vox properties that are going to be hardest hit by the layoffs.  So yeah, those are probably sites that generate, that got a lot of traffic from  Facebook.  Buzzfeed, Mashable, Refinery 29 each have made layoffs.  Vox, you know, has some big partners.  I'm sure they're fine.  I mean, they'll be around for a long time, but OK, so it's, you know, just one more.  But as you said, live by the sword, die by the sword, live by the Facebook, die by the  Facebook.  Oh, you like the doggy leotard story, too, did you?  Yeah, that's why I like to.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Great minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When it comes to drivel, Jeff and I are in complete agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, my dog has anxiety.  And if I thought a leotard would help, I would totally click on that story.  Oh, it does, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like the Thunder shirt?  Yeah, the Thunder shirt.  OK.  You have a Thunder shirt?  I do.  Yeah, so do I for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Self up real tight.  Have you?  Has anybody?  But I'm not sure.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  Self up real tight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you?  Has anybody bought one of those extra heavy blankets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the weighted blankets?  Oh, I met someone who just bought one.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It was an executive in some IoT company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is this is, by the way, why Instagram and Facebook ads work, because we all know  about heavy blankets from that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there's a futurist, I think it is.  The futurist made their own.  They had their own branded blanket.  Really?  And they sold five million dollars worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How heavy does a weighted blanket have to be?  Twenty five pounds, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's check the chart.  Futurism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For kids, 10 percent of body weight plus one or two pounds.  For adults, 10 percent of ideal body weight, not actual body weight.  Yeah, by the way.  Wait a minute.  There's some of the charts missing.  It's missing a couple.  What?  So I should.  Yeah, see, twenty twenty five pounds is too heavy.  I should probably be I should have like a fifteen pound blanket.  Who knew?  The things you learn on this show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anything else here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What else?  Twitter bookmarks?  Do we want to talk about net neutrality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's official as of Friday.  There is no net neutrality.  AT&T didn't waste any time immediately started launching fast lanes for its own content.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  For DirecTV, U-verse.  Took no time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, to be clear, for the longest time, and it's been a while since I have dug into AT&T's network,  but for a while they had their U-verse and their own content under.  It was a managed service, so it was already going.  It was already prioritized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this is basically zero rating.  They're saying, right, this is zero rating.  You won't pay against a data fees against any of our services, but it's exactly the same issue.  I know it's harder to explain to consumers why not paying for something is bad,  but it is bad because it means it advantages their services over competitors services that do like YouTube or Twitter that do use bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like subsidizing corn.  Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do that and pretty soon all our cars will be running on ethanol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was thinking more obesity epidemic and sugary sodas being so cheap, but yes.  That too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One argument that they make that I find a little bit sympathetic, so argue with the is as well.  But if you're if you're running a medical application in an operating room, you're you're working on a self-driving car.  Shouldn't that have priority?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's talk about that because this is actually something I report on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that was your cue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was you.  You're so good to me, Jeff.  Thank you.  This is.  I'm an idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you're a jerk.  I'm a jerk.  It was a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Jeff, you're so good.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, OK, backing up net neutrality.  So companies already have an option.  They can actually used cellular spectrum or license spectrum for these particular use cases, and they can pay to do that.  They don't have to use the public Internet or my basic home connection.  And that's how today a lot of these things are run.  Your medical medical equipment is cellular.  In most cases, it's not usually Wi-Fi yet because people don't want to make it hackable and all these other things.  So there are avenues for dedicated connections for connected devices like cars and whatever.  Very expensive, though, right?  They are expensive.  And who owns those connections?  Well, it's AT&T.  And we can make some arguments about the economics associated with the amount of data that these guys carry.  And that's it's frankly not a competitive space.  So, yes, it's expensive, but you're paying for that.  That dedication, that guarantee of quality.  And then there's also enterprise connections with quality of service guarantees.  And you can pay that as a business if you want.  What's likely to happen is for cars, you're going to have a dedicated car connection.  You're not going to rely on just generic Internet for prescribed medical devices.  I think that's one area where it gets really interesting.  And I don't actually know where that's going to happen or like how that's going to play out.  I don't like the idea of giving that paid priority because they don't actually think it's necessary.  I think there are technological and business things that could happen first that may not happen because we don't live in a competitive market, however.  So that's that.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Leo left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It must be because we called him a jerk.  We took over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We took over.  Finally, the revolution has come.  The revolution has come.  We are Leo's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm curious because like the states are now doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, here comes the jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought you two should have a little moment together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what would have been awesome is if you kind of just burst out of the just like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, now they have to reset all the cameras because I moved your avatars around.  I'm sorry.  Oh, engineers now have to fix what Leo broke.  We should mention that now that net neutrality is officially dead, the lawsuits can begin.  It will remain dead until such time as a judge says, no, we need it.  And there is also a billing in Congress, I think, to restore it.  And of course, yes, many districts and states, Washington, D.C.  I mentioned districts.  Washington, D.C. has created a very strong net neutrality law for itself.  So we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Texas will never get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The eyes of Texas are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The AT&T not going to happen.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Do you want to do you want to kill the show?  Are we done or do we want to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there anything else to talk about?  We could do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We talked about right to be forgotten.  We talk about that quite a lot.  And I don't know if Jeff, you saw that Google's researchers looked at the requests that had been made for them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  This is more like a Jeff thing.  I'm not like, you know, but it plays.  Well, other than what I thought was most interesting is most of the requests were coming from a few people and the requests in certain countries were focused on news articles and in others were focused on search results.  So I just I thought the breakdown was kind of interesting, but I didn't have much to say beyond that.  I'll be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So 11 percent comes from government and.  Corporate 89 percent from individuals.  What information is requested for delisting professional information a quarter, self crime, 8 percent, professional wrongdoing, 7 percent.  Sensitive personal information, 2 percent.  That's pretty small.  So it's people and their reputations.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I thought it was interesting what a large percentage Google fought and successfully fought.  It's almost half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I think it was slightly more than half.  Was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's but I said that also they've found Google's not fighting it.  Google's just saying we choose not to do this.  This is the irony.  You tech companies are too powerful.  Now let's give you some more power.  Right.  So that's exactly what they've done with with both right to be forgotten and the next day in Germany where they're getting Facebook especially to take down hate speech and stuff.  And they're making Facebook decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you don't really want to do.  Meanwhile, there was a process for the right to be forgotten.  Extra Google process.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Judicial process or something.  There's kind of a review committee that standards and stuff.  But no, that's that's the thing is they put the.  And Google and Facebook hate this.  They you know, if you tell me it's against the law and tell me I have to take it down.  That's different.  Officials.  I'll take it down.  But I don't want to tell me this is the cider.  They're the judge and jury and executioner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, Google's only removed about 43 percent of the requests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think Google's trying to do it responsibly is what that tells me.  Meanwhile, Google is also fighting a businessman in the UK who's trying to get a right to be forgotten.  Referred only as NT one for legal reasons that articles had caused distress and upset.  But Google saying no, this is this is reporting on you.  Let me submit that this then is showing that this has worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that's rather strong verdict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but I mean, I mean, we thought it was going to be the end of the world.  But in fact, it seems to be working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's working.  Google's removed as 43 percent of them, but has not removed.  That means 57.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know that the 43 percent they removed should have been removed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I know.  What is the penalty?  I mean, there must be some somebody looking at what they're doing and saying no, not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's that's you sue Google, which is what's happening in the UK.  It's the first. It's the first such case in the UK.  And Google's fighting back and saying, no, this involves.  Deceptive and misleading criminal practices.  Yeah. And so we're not taking this stuff down and the guys fighting them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and how much of this is because in the UK, their libel laws, for example, are really different.  And I wonder how much of this is kind of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what Google says its criterion is, quote, that they review each request on a case by case basis,  determining whether content is in the public interest is complex and may mean considering many diverse factors,  including but not limited to whether the content relates to the requesters professional life, a past crime,  political office position in public life, whether the content is self authored content,  consists of government documents or is journalistic in nature.  Now, actually, they don't say what the criteria are.  They just say this is what they consider. What's weird.  I mean, they much Google must do they make them wear wigs.  They must have a whole board of basically judges, extra legal judges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, in the case of the Nets de Gay and Germany and Facebook, they've hired thousands of people to go over stuff.  I'm told they get like 30 seconds to make a judgment.  And that's why, as I think I said last week, my joke is that satire is dead in Germany, right?  As if it was over alive. That's a joke, by the way.  That's the joke. But yeah, if you have the slightest doubt now, out it goes.  And you have very little time to decide something that has some nuance to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if they. Oh, wait a minute. Yes.  The European regulators did publish way back when the criteria.  The interest of the public overrides the right of the data subject delisting will not be appropriate.  So, yeah, there are some criteria.  Again, I might I mean, I'm playing a little bit of devil's advocate here,  but I might say that this is not turned out to be the disaster that we were worried about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that fair? There's other stuff coming.  I think Google has handled it as well as they could.  That's what I'd be fair to say. Given this lump of coal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know, putting out some research on it is helpful so you can see what's been done.  I'm kind of I was actually distressed about the miners who it's a relatively small percentage of overall.  But I'm like, God, I hope all of their stuff was kind of expunged unless I guess they're well, no, even your criminal records can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But see, that's the point is I think there is some public interest in having some stuff be eliminated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would as a journalist, I would disagree. Yeah.  Well, what's happened has happened. Rewriting history is always a dangerous thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're but we're at an unprecedented level, unprecedented level of being able to find the most minute,  insignificant details about someone and then blow those up out of proportion.  I mean, that's that's kind of part of that's a different part of society.  No, but having if I put something stupid when I was 18 years old on a website and it's still searchable.  Normally, that sort of that sort of action takes place in an isolation and you don't have to live with that for the rest of your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good segue, Leo. Actually, that give Carson credit for that.  He's a good work in Norton's response to being fired at the New York Times for her past.  She says it was her doppelganger. New York Times fired my doppelganger.  It's actually a great read. It's in the. It is. Yeah.  Yeah. And I have even more respect. We should try to get Quinn on this show.  She's great. Can you have a connection with her?  I don't. Kevin Marks sounded like he knew her. Let's see if we could figure out. I'm sure he does.  Yeah. Let's figure out a way to get her on because I that's this is a great piece and it really points up some of the problems.  And what the New York Times did was very strange given the time, the time, the speed with which they did it.  Mere hours after hiring her, they fired her, having looked at some old tweets, apparently.  So does she have the right for those tweets to be forgotten? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's she's an adult. So I was specifically talking about minors. I agree. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that there are there's I don't know. I what I I do think you can make a case in some cases where this is a good thing.  Minors is the best case. Something you did as a kid, which has no bearing on anything in the present, but is still smirching your record.  I think, you know, we expunge criminal records for minors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This would be. Remember, none of this takes down the content. Well, that's the thing.  All this is the wrong source. You can't make it's the wrong source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obviously, you're punishing the search engine instead of the source of the content.  So that's clearly broken. I don't understand why they did that.  But on balance, maybe this is a good compromise.  Speaking of minors, John Oliver's lawsuit is as big as yes.  You remember the the Murray Energies CEO Robert Murray sued the host of last week tonight after HBO ran a segment criticizing him in the coal industry.  A judge quite rightly, I think, threw that out.  Murray Energy says will appeal it to the West Virginia Supreme Court.  The judge wrote he thought lawyers for HBO and Oliver put forth well founded and appropriate arguments to dismiss the case.  The thing about like the First Amendment, something like that.  Yeah, I guess the First Amendment doesn't protect against defamation.  Right.  Do do do. All right, I'm going to call it.  You're going to call it.  144 into the show. That's it.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show was anything else in other.  I don't think so.  No, I think you got it.  I think you did.  You see, that's the thing, Leo.  I think sometimes you leave stuff out and look through and know by God, you're going to show either the my watch is stopped or the show is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not very energetic and none of the news.  It's a agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we? We can only cover what happens.  What happens? We got it.  We cannot make it up.  Stacy, do you have an item, a thing you would like to talk about or should I go to Jeff first?  I don't have a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am in search of a thing and I am dismayed because I cannot find it.  So the thing person, you're the you're the you're the Zarina of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  And you're the Internet of things.  There are no new things.  There are no new things.  Not only is the show shut down, but the Internet and the entire world of IOT has just shut down because Stacy has run out of things.  She has no things.  There are no more things.  People, this is a crisis of things.  We are a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This show has been Kardashian aided, Kardashian aided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  OK, that's Jeff.  Your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got three or four.  Good.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll make up for my lack.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So I got one that's all do as a number.  So Zuckerberg and company just settled for thirty five million dollars a suit over their IPO in which Facebook was not open enough about the risk they had of growth, which amuses the hell out of me, of course, because if you held on to your stock back then, folks, it was fine.  It was just fine.  That's my number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, actually, if you if you bought Facebook stock on day one, you've you've made a lot of money.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then I wanted to I was I was amused.  I found someone worse than the worst nightmare of the closet at Twit.  Benj Edwards is moving.  I saw this.  I want to sell it.  I'm trying to get rid of his collection of computers since 1993.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He kept everything this I've been through all these computers, but I didn't keep any of them.  He kept them.  So if you go down and that's a pro and an Osborne and there's inventory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I recognize all of these and we've had many of them in the basement of the brick house.  This kind of looks like the basement did after a while.  Yeah, people.  The part of that was because people like Benj brought their old stuff.  He's moving, I guess.  Look at that.  Think. Wait a minute.  Let's go back to that ThinkPad cabinet.  That's wild.  There's something about ThinkPad.  They just they just can't get rid of them.  That's amazing.  That's somebody else.  That's another.  That's a touch of good in Chi Chi.  Touch of Chi Chi.  Wow.  ThinkPad cabinet.  I wish I had a ThinkPad cabinet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like my nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've got all this stuff.  I've been getting rid of everything.  I was going to make Vero my pick of the week, but now I guess not.  Now, I guess I don't.  I won't.  You convinced me.  I'm going to.  But I like it.  Well, you can still use it.  No, I feel guilty now.  It's I'm supporting.  Well, are we sure or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like it looks like he's perhaps not the most he's definitely it looks like he's  lying about that because they brought up press releases where he was still currently listed  as employed there in 2016 or some anonymous Wikipedia poster.  Well, the anonymous Wikipedia poster was trying to help them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So I don't know if he said anything at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These little port replied to my comment on Facebook.  Yes.  Oh, Wink starting off with a small test, but I plan to entice them to more shows.  That says we're not in.  Hmm.  I think next next week I'm going to have my wine glass here just to entice them in.  I ordered wine.
