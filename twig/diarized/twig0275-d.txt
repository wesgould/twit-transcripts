Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.  Good to be here.  I wasn't sure actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I knew you were a mother and a daughter.  I wasn't sure about the sister part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, three times over.  Three times a sister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice to see you.  A little under the weather earlier.  I'm sorry, but I hope you're feeling okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little bit, a little bit.  First cold of the winter, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's one of them.  I'm a little stuffed up myself.  Also here from the City University of New York from CUNY.  And he just flew in from where?  Prague.  Oh, I love Prague.  Did you see any of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I walked some hours.  That's about it.  But it's an amazing place.  I was speaking at the European Broadcasters Union news event.  Oh, neat.  Oh, that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's only, what about nine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I woke up at 1.30 Prague time.  I couldn't get back to sleep this morning.  I got a couple hours on the plane.  So I'm groggy.  I'm proggy, yeah.  Proggy.  Well, if you need to bow out, you can, because we weren't sure if you'd make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we brought in a ringer, ladies and gentlemen, from GigaOM, their mobile editor, Kevin Toefel.  Hi, Kevin.  Hey there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How are you, Leo?  Great to see you.  Let's be honest, though.  You know, Jason said the only reason you want me on the show is because I got one of these  Nexus phones.  Yeah!  Oh, yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at that.  You just, you enjoy showing it.  You enjoy showing that, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do.  It's nice.  It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll talk about it.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does.  I'm pretty small, too, but that's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This has been a banner year for Android devices, for phones in general, but particularly for  Android devices.  The ecosystem is clearly mature.  The variety and choice available to consumers is unparalleled.  And it's hard to pick one because there's so many good choices.  It started with the HTC One, which is still a gorgeous, beautiful phone.  We had the Galaxy S5, which I wasn't as crazy about, although I love the Note 4.  Really great phone.  Motorola, of course, not to be left out, did a number of phones.  They updated the G, which is a low-priced phone, but still for many, exactly the right  price, size and feature set.  Then the Moto X 2014 edition.  Then the Droid Turbo, which frankly is just a Moto X on steroids.  Don't forget the OnePlus One.  The OnePlus One, which we still think maybe it was the winner, the dark horse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll see how the Nexus 6 looks in comparison.  Kevin, have you played with both?  I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have.  And the OnePlus One is very nice.  It's hard to get, obviously, because of the whole invite system and whatnot, but you're  getting a lot of phone for $300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the key, right?  $300 or $350 for the 64 gig.  And the other thing about it, I found no other phone that had its battery life.  None.  20 hours in normal use for me is remarkable.  Yeah.  So, I was kind of bitching about this last week.  You take the Droid Turbo, you take a phone, you add a massive battery, and then you say,  well, what else can we do now that we have all this battery life?  Well, let's put a 2.7 gigahertz quad core processor in it and a quad HD screen.  And then the battery life goes right back down to normal.  It would have been incredible.  So, you kind of have a similar situation with the Nexus 6.  It's a QHD screen.  A lot of pixels to push there.  What's the life like on the Nexus 6?  What's the battery life like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think most people will get through a full day on it.  I mean, if you're a heavy duty power user, I don't think 20 hours is going to fly.  It's a 3,220 milliamp hour battery.  Comes with that turbocharger, just like the Droid Turbo.  It recharges the whole phone in less than two hours.  It's very, very quick.  But, you know, I think most people are good for a day on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good.  That's the real question, because in every other respect, it's a beast.  It is.  The camera, Motorola has not historically done great cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google says it's the best Nexus camera yet, which that's not a high bar that they've set there.  But, yes, it's actually quite good.  It's surprisingly good.  There's still some bugs with Android 5.0.  Even the camera app itself crashed on me at least six times in the last 10 days.  So, you know, there's some things they need to work out.  But the actual quality is pretty good.  Low light is still a challenge, I think.  That's definitely going to be a problem.  There's still some better camera phones out there.  The Lumia is the iPhone 6, for example.  Just do better in low light, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, you know, the truth is it's going to be about as hard to get for some time as a OnePlus One, maybe even harder.  I managed to order one at Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you?  God bless.  I got two Twig fans who came in to Twitter and said, order now.  And I went in and the first one, it said, you know, the thing you just ordered isn't in stock anymore.  In my cart.  So I refreshed the order and killed one of them.  And it's supposedly on its way on November 18th.  Nice. Which one did you get?  The black 64.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's yes. I had to settle for, I think, a black 32 or midnight blue 32.  I wanted the silver 64.  But you know what? This is I think this really rounds out the year.  What a year it has been for smartphones. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Any size, any shape, lots of power.  Any price.  Any price. Yeah.  I mean, that's the only negative, I guess, in the Nexus 6 at 650 bucks starting point.  It's really priced like the other high end phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't mean to look at it, of course, in the mouth, because you're right.  It has been a great year for the variety.  But I think it took the phones arrived and then the variety spread out.  And the question is, is there now a next development of amazing things phones will do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I got to say, I think we're now in a very mature space.  I think we are. Yeah.  It's hard to imagine.  I guess you could make the camera better.  There's no quad HD is already beyond anything anybody cares about.  The Droid Turbo is more than 500 dots per inch.  Done.  There's no point in going, in fact, overdone already.  Battery life would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, screens that don't break totally waterproof front facing cameras  that match back facing cameras in terms of, you know,  I mean, I think there's still some some catching up that we can do.  I still think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think he said anything.  No, I didn't say a word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't put words in my mouth.  I was trying to be good.  I still go for a vision that I'm going to have on my person, my computer.  And the phone is another accessory device to it.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I think this is your computer.  No, I think where it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think that in essence, this becomes your computer.  Your computer is something that is you and is on you like you wear it.  And and and this becomes a display unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying the phone is a display unit for the watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not the watch.  I mean, you have you have you have something on you, your key fob or your or your something that's that's that's your computer, that's your identity, that's your you.  And it can speak through your phone, your tablet, your your laptop, your watch, your glasses, your whatever.  I think that's where we eventually go here, is that you kind of have one computer and many accessories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you need a computer in the fifth dimension that is as big as a house.  But it has a little viewport on you in your dimensions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it can land on com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, by the way.  Wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Did you all get up in the morning?  It was 11 a.m. for you, 8 a.m. for us.  Yeah.  But I had to watch it.  Even CNN covered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So much.  I was on the plane.  What was there to watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seven hours of waiting.  Well, at 8 a.m. it landed.  But we didn't get a picture for 30 minutes.  Right.  I remember watching the folks at Mission Control and the European Space Agency when they got the news that it had touched down and seemed to have survived.  Remember, they launched this 10 years ago.  Yeah, it's phenomenal.  So they've been waiting for today for 10 years, not knowing if it might miss or crash or all sorts of things.  I haven't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are there new good pictures up?  Lots of pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's sending out pictures.  There was some issue.  There was some issue.  I think that they have several ways of fixing it to the comet.  One, the harpoons did not deploy, but they have screws on the feet which did work, which screwed in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the thrust that was supposed to push it down didn't deploy.  Right.  So there's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure.  Okay, I might be wrong.  Anyway, it's there.  I think they need to secure it a little bit.  But other than that, there's a picture of the comet.  Yeah, that's going in.  Yes, this is during descent about three kilometers from the surface.  There's the little guy.  That one I saw.  Yeah.  That's a rendering, I believe.  Photo illustration, as they say.  No, that's accurate.  This is exactly what it looks like.  You can see the Arctotreum from there.  That's the comet.  It's a pretty big little thing.  Here's an image of the surface.  That was from the fly around.  Yeah, because they still have a...  So they have a satellite going around and they had deployed the lander from the satellite.  So I'm looking, maybe there'll be some more pictures.  There are none.  This is it.  This is the set.  So this is...  But they're going to be, right?  They were supposed to be.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They haven't come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They haven't come yet.  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They keep losing communication with it.  They've got a lot of data, no pictures yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The ice screws had been shot by the craft's harpoons and were securing it to the surface.  The lander is in great shape.  It says that the harpoons did not fire.  I'm sorry.  And the agency is looking at trying again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you were right.  I was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After analyzing telemetry, the ESA says it seems the craft's harpoons didn't fire as first thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm curious which carrier they're using.  They're losing signal and they've got 39 delays there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It ain't Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Today I'll be complaining about AT&T later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just really amazing.  Just amazing.  And you can follow it on Twitter.  And just really cool.  Just really cool.  And it's making sounds.  The sounds are at a frequency higher than the capability of human hearing, 40 to 50 mHz.  But if you make it audible and increase it by a factor of a thousand, this is what it's...  Can you hear my audio?  This is the comet singing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sounds like Dolphin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It totally does.  What if they're trying to signal the Dolphins?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That must be it.  They're in cahoots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sounds like a Star Trek movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels like a little Douglas Adams.  Douglas Adams.  We actually unknowingly are doing the work of the Dolphins to get this thing there.  The Dolphins sent us a message 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're doing the work of the Dolphins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now by playing this, I am now alerting the Dolphins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I knew they were smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm afraid to play this any longer.  No, no, it's good.  I don't know.  I'm afraid about what might happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're doing the work of the Dolphins.  This is good.  In Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, where one of the volumes, the Dolphins leave, and  it turns out they were in fact the smartest species on Earth.  And they leave a little note saying, so long and thanks for all the fish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that line.  It's so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could kind of listen to this forever.  I love it.  I'm blown away by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've got to do more of this.  It's so ambient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Jeff wants a computer in the fifth dimension.  All right.  But Jeff and I have ordered.  Now, you're not, Gina, you're happy with your OnePlus.  You're going to stick with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to stick with it.  I've been through a few too many phones this year.  So as long as I don't destroy this one, I'm going to hold on to it.  What is the update situation there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you're running Cyanogen.  Yeah, running Cyanogen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you're running Cyanogen.  So I think they said 90 days from the AOSP drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a new mod that's supposed to be out now for our OnePlus One.  Oh, R39 or something.  Well, no, I'm thinking the bigger number.  I think it's 45 or something.  And this might fix the problem I'm having with my phone, but I still don't know.  It's now a week and a half and I haven't had a working phone.  What?  Wait, whoa, whoa.  AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've worked fine for years with AT&T.  I think it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the deal as quick as I can make it.  And I've got a video up on the rundown.  I'm going to pull that up for you.  Every single time that I call, you'll see this.  And it just happened time after time after time after time after time again.  Then I dealt with a very nice person on Twitter and a very nice person elsewhere.  And then it got escalated.  Here's what happens.  So I just tried to call.  Notice I'm trying to call the AT&T retail store.  And it will ring.  And the call ends.  It just ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It drops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think you have a defective.  And then people start singing.  And then people sing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Paris last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's lost the signal again.  Oh, he's lost the signal again that Jeff Jarvis has.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hallelujah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hallelujah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, call hallelujah.  No, it's not a good phone because I put the SIM in my Nexus five and same problem.  So I go round and round and round and say, well, we're doing some upgrades.  Oh, so in your next five, you drop calls with the same.  I dropped every single almost every call.  99% of the calls.  And I go to the store to get a new SIM.  Finally, they tell me that's not going to do any good.  I get a new SIM.  They come and get a SIM.  I get a SIM.  They're doing good.  I finally go to the device repair center, wherever they call it.  And they say, oh, yeah, no issue.  Nexus five, two weeks.  LTE can't.  The only fix we have is to is to downgrade to three G.  What a hell of a fix AT&T.  That's great.  So I'm doing all kinds of troubleshooting.  It gets elevated thanks to another twig fan, a marketing executive.  And I get to the person at corporate and where they were saying, oh, your upgrade.  Well, clearly what happened here was that there's been no new software for the Nexus five with one plus one.  So you guys change something in your system that made it not work.  And then they came back and said, well, no, we haven't changed anything.  And they were telling me they were been upgrading the whole time.  So they speak with fork and tongue.  And so their big responsibility was buy an AT&T phone.  Oh, that's not a good answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And yet I know I've used both the one plus and the Nexus five on AT&T.  So it seems to be regionally here.  It must be a regional issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I went to my my good buddy, my good twig friend fan buddy, Alex Hugo, who works in a store, has been very nice and helped me time and time again.  And and I've praised him to the to the Hilt to the AT&T executives, because this is a guy who cares about AT&T working for its customers.  And Alex, thank you for all your help.  And and he there's there's the woman at corporate denied it.  But his theory was just just trying to guess there've been issues with voiceover LTE.  I don't even know what to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's that would make sense. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's been an issue.  That makes sense.  So it's what I you know, and I'm in the one hand, I'm ready to throw up my hands and have psycho feds.  The other hand, I'll wait for my Nexus six and I presume it'll work because if it doesn't, there'll be lots of just go to T-Mobile, which you should have done ages ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I probably won't. Yeah.  But yeah, how's T-Mobile in Manhattan?  Is it OK?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I love T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I have I said here's the thing.  I have my grandfathered unlimited data plan with AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  They haven't taken that away from you yet.  Maybe.  You know, they want to.  How can we get Jarvis off of that unlimited data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just turn his 4G off.  Yeah, that's one way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So just to wrap it up on the Nexus six, you want to give us a quick pros and cons, Kevin?  You've used it for 10 days.  This is really the most thorough test I've heard about.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I got a little dog and pony show in New York City with Google about 10 days ago.  Walked home with the Nexus six.  You know, it's definitely a big phone right off the bat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Show us the screen a little bit so we can get a sense.  Sure.  Yeah, it looks big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's big.  I don't have an iPhone six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does your hand go around it without stretching too much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, and that's because it's got the nice rounded back like the other Moto phones and all.  It's about as big as the iPhone six plus.  It fills the hand, doesn't it?  Oh, definitely fills the hand.  You know, I mean, and you know, next to my head, it's pretty big.  Oh, we've gotten over that years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fine.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do have a Moto X from this year to compare it to.  There you go.  That's a good comparison.  Yeah.  So I think that's a fair comparison.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not so much bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's bigger.  This is my OnePlus one and my fingers are like all dangly on it, right?  You got room.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So right off the bat, it's big.  And see, that's kind of I said in my review, the Nexus six is in a very strange place because  let's think about it.  This is the first time that all the carriers are selling the Nexus phone.  It's really a very close copy of an existing phone in the Motorola Moto X and the Droid  Turbo and so on.  And it's bigger than any phone pretty much out there right now.  A few exceptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The 1520 and the OnePlus was only five and a half inches.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So this is a six inch.  The Note 4 is bigger, right?  Note 4 is bigger physically, but a smaller screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's five, seven.  Correct.  They really did pack in that.  It's actually a five point nine, six inch display.  I call it six here, but it's a beautiful display.  And Leo, as you said, it's the quad HD.  I mean, it's just it's just gorgeous.  You know, you can't see pixels and such.  But, you know, so part of me says that this is all great.  But really, internally, it's got the same guts as, say, the Droid Turbo.  It's got the nice big battery.  And those are smaller.  They're a little easier to handle.  So I think a lot of people, you know, if you need a big phone, OK, this is a great one.  And it's got lollipop.  The other ones are all getting lollipop like now.  And they're a little more easier to manage.  So it's a nice phone.  It's probably the first Nexus that really hasn't cut any corners.  There's always something missing, you know, be it a bad display quality or a bad camera  or whatever.  This is really the first no corner cut Nexus device that I can think of.  And it's nice, but it's a handful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that's what I'm kind of saying is I think we're at a maturity point on this stuff.  The processors are more than fast enough.  The Turbo has a 2.7 gigahertz same chip or same chip as that 805 high end GPUs in these  things.  I don't think you need much faster.  Lollipop is pretty darn mature.  I mean, I think this is a all the all the hard edges have been sanded down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's next?  Feels like we should close up shop.  We've we've we've hit alpha state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's possible that this phone you buy this last few months of the year will  be the last phone you buy for a couple of years.  Wow.  Not you, of course.  Not me.  No, I can't go.  I can't go there.  But but I frankly don't think there'll be much of an improvement going forward.  I think this is about as good as you're going to get.  Maybe better cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  You know, there's one thought, though, and this really surprised me that this is all  meant to showcase Android 5.0, which it does.  Android 5.0 is is Google's 64 bit operating system and only the Nexus 9 right now has  a 64 bit chip.  I'm not saying people are going to notice a difference between 32 bit, 64 bit and so  on.  But to your point about this may be the last phone you buy for a while, I would have liked  it if it had, you know, the Snapdragon 810, which is not yet available, but is 64 bit,  for example, then your future proof.  You know, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I'm not sure what you get with 64 bit except access access to more than four  gigs of RAM.  But none of these devices, the Nexus 9 only has two gigs of RAM.  So none of these devices use anything really significant with 64 bits.  And they're all plenty fast enough.  I think 64 bits is like quad HD, a number that's kind of detached from any real value.  It's just well, it's got to be better.  It's twice as many bits.  Well, I don't know about that.  So yeah, what are your predictions about Project Aero?  Oh, that's a joke.  We had, remember the visor?  Remember that?  Yeah, the visor had, okay.  So this was a Palm device that had modules you could slot in.  Oh, wow.  Terrible idea.  The things fall out.  They're janky.  They never fits quite as nicely and as beautiful as it would if it were built in.  People don't, I don't think consumers say, yes, it's bad enough that there's 12 phones  To go in and say, well, okay, now what modules you want installed is way too much.  People know what they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It'll be a hobbyist thing.  It's a hobbyist phone.  And I think it always has been.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think it'll be a successful hobbyist thing though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but to Kevin's point, you could conceivably modularize the whole damn motherboard, but  the chip and change the chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You change the chip, it'll cost as much as buying a new phone.  Exactly.  That's the problem.  Let's get a new phone.  Here's the visor.  We actually have one here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's better than the picture I was searching for.  Yeah, no, this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you recognize kind of the palm form factor, but instead of, you could put a modem in there  and other stuff.  So that's Project Era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Back to the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know people are so excited about Project Era, and I guess it's the maker movement and  the hobbyists and stuff we want to, but it's not even going to be that interesting.  You're going to have eight modules or whatever.  You can snap them together.  I don't.  So that's not what's next.  I think we've got one there.  Is there anything you feel like you don't have?  By the way, PCs hit this maturity point years ago.  You said it yourself, Jeff.  I'm not going to buy another PC, you said.  You don't need to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  Well, the funny is I have this reflex where I actually, I mean, my Chromebook is absolutely  fine.  It's the best one on the market.  I still want to get a new one.  Yeah, because there's this consumer urge.  Oh, yeah.  Great ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're still using the Pixel, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You bet.  I'm going.  He loves his Pixel.  Are you on it right now?  Yeah, I am.  Yeah.  I've come around on Chromebook.  I really see its value for certain users.  I actually recommend it a lot on the radio show for people who just need, if I say, are  you just browsing an email?  Yeah.  Then all you need is a Chromebook.  And you don't have to worry about security or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's good advice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  If you go to Google right now, I think, I might have turned it off.  You will be encouraged to donate to fight Ebola and Google will match your donation  two for one.  That's pretty cool.  Google has pledged how many millions of dollars?  Seven and a half million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook was 25.  Well, it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For every dollar you give, Google will give $2.  They now have 5.7 million pledged on their way to the seven and a half million dollar  goal.  Google will give up to $25 million to fight the Ebola crisis and people are very much  responding.  I think that's wonderful.  That's great.  I just threw five bucks their way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It made me feel good.  Tweeted it out.  It's wallet, so it's really easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanted to do something about it.  I read an article and I posted it, I think, on my Facebook page saying, if you're worried  about Ebola, don't elect a Republican.  Just give some money to fight Ebola in Africa because the key is to keep the number of people  who have it down to treat the ones who have it.  That's how you keep it from spreading.  At that time, it was a great article on Medium.  I'll see if I can find it.  At that time, I gave money to partners in health.  They're working in Liberia and Sierra Leone.  And then I've started a sustaining donation to Doctors Without Borders because they do  great stuff all around.  They're very involved in fighting Ebola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great people are meeting on Ebola.  It's an example of a networked society, what's really happening here, and that our vulnerability  isn't here on our shores.  It is over there and we've got to fight it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Ebola, the real reason everyone should panic.  It's by, I don't know how you pronounce her name.  Zeynep Tufiski.  Zeynep Tufiski.  You know her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, she's great.  She's brilliant.  Sociologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She is just brilliant.  Really, the global institutions are broken.  The problem is not here in the United States or Europe.  The problem is in Africa.  Let's go there and fix it.  It's not even that expensive if we just do it.  She says at the end, so you want to do something about it, donate.  So act move me.  I said good.  I gave money to partners in health, which she recommended, and Doctors Without Borders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And is doing some fundraising at the end of the year, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are.  We're going to do a, not this, I don't want to be self-serving, we're going to do a fun  marathon which we invited all of you to do.  We did it last year, our New Year's Eve marathon, but we thought if we're going to do this,  we should really make it for charity.  And I asked our team to come up with a charity that was international, was highly rated,  four or five star charity, and was doing good work with Ebola on the ground in Africa.  And we came up with the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, and they're going to partner  with us.  So we're going to be raising money for UNICEF from 3 a.m. New Year's Eve to 3 a.m. New Year's  Day.  We really tried to get all of you out.  I'm trying to figure it out now.  I know you guys are trying to figure it out.  I know Gina can't do it because of the baby, but next year.  I might bring my little baby.  I will Skype in.  Yeah, and we'll all Skype in.  All our hosts will either be here or Skype in.  And what we're really hoping to do is raise a lot of money and awareness and have some  fun while we do it and celebrate New Year's Eve in a geeky fashion.  If it's OK, I think I'll bring Jake.  Oh, OK. It's encouraged.  I thought you'd like that.  We'll put Jake to work.  Oh, good. So it's interesting that Google and Facebook have both responded.  And I have to think this Medium post had something to do with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? Yeah, I feel like amazing.  And she's highly respected in geek world.  Zeynep knows her stuff.  She's she's Turkish and really brought tremendous perspective on the network world there.  And she just understands the sociology of the net brilliantly.  I'm a huge fan of hers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when you log into Facebook, you've probably already seen a rectangular box that says we can help stop Ebola.  Let's support organizations working in West Africa so they can stop the disease and save lives.  Again, the focus on stopping it in Africa, where it's really a problem and people are really sick.  Instead of worrying about quarantining nurses in New Jersey.  And they're asking for donations to the International Medical Corps to save the children or to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let's note that we are now with a doctor in New York was let out of the hospital like yesterday.  So New York is now I mean, the United States is now free of known cases.  All the panic that occurred to be terrible, terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zuckerberg donating 25 million of his own dollars.  So Google is doing the same and Mark is 25 million.  So that's awesome.  I think that's great.  This is when you're this is when our community is doing a good thing.  And I'm, you know, I'm proud to be part of that.  We're gonna take a break when we come back.  I want to talk about the proposition, the proposal.  President Obama floated on Monday for solving the net neutrality crisis.  And get your opinions.  This is the beginning of a very of a long conversation, I think.  But first, a word from Braintree.

Nice way to put Apple Pay in your app.  BraintreePayments.com slash twit.  So President Obama as a campaign promise said we're going to we're going to preserve a free and open Internet.  It's the most important one of the most important technologies in the modern world.  Didn't seem to do much about it.  In fact, appointed as chairman of the FCC, a fellow that maybe some of us might have felt wasn't really going to look out for our best interests.  Actually, he did in some ways.  The FCC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a great tweet.  I forget who did it this week.  It was Matthew Keys said that he wanted the FCC had was trying to split.  Can't figure out how to split the baby.  And someone said, oh, good, a dead baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like Tom Wheeler, you know, Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC was a lobbyist, we know for the cable companies and the wireless companies.  He's in the Hall of Fame of both.  So I had very little faith in him.  And yet I feel like he has been trying the FCC for maybe I'm misreading it, but the I think Obama gave him cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think that's what happened here is that is that he's trying to play both sides and Obama.  What the hell?  He has no Congress.  He has no Senate.  So what does he have to lose?  And by changing, pardon me, I guess AT&T just turned off my lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, get you, Travis.  One way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so in a way, it gives him cover to say, OK, well, here's where the bar is.  Obama put the bar up here, which is neutral is neutral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the president.  So so the the FCC proposed open Internet rules.  Verizon immediately sued.  The judge looked at him and said, look, FCC, you have a mandate from Congress.  Your mandate does not allow you to impose these rules.  So we're going to have to agree with Verizon.  But nudge nudge.  If you look at the Telecommunications Act, you'll see a thing called Title Two that allows you, the FCC, to declare  Internet service providers to be common carriers.  And if you do that.  We can assure you that will be fine with us.  The judge really gave them a road map.  Now, then remember, Wheeler made a proposal which we everybody was very upset about.  They received what is it?  One point seven million comments in their open comment period.  I mean, the most for almost anything except the Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction, which really is a problem.  But they they still kind of fencing around with it.  So Obama on Monday said, you know, title two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One more step between right before Obama, didn't Wheeler come out with this idea of of yes, maybe I being  neutral for Netflix, but not neutral for consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said we we will we will protect the interconnects, the behind the scenes stuff.  The and you saw this happen with Comcast, which slowly throttled down Netflix until all of the Netflix  customers on Comcast said, well, this experience sucks.  And Comcast said, OK, we'll pay you.  They basically blackmailed Comcast into paying them.  That's what Comcast thinks anyway.  And although I have to say, there's there's arguments on both sides.  I don't I don't think it's that clear.  So Wheeler said, OK, we'll protect that.  The interconnects will protect the behind the scenes stuff.  But we want to stay out of the public Internet.  I actually don't think that that's necessarily a bad idea.  But Obama came in and said, no, title two.  But he also said, but you don't have to fully enforce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's an example?  What's an example of discriminatory service on the consumer end that you think is tolerable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, here's OK.  So, by the way, we're going to do a big debate on this on Twitter on Sunday.  We have Brett Glass, who is a fire brand and Internet service provider in Wyoming.  He's an ISP. He's also been a tech journalist.  He's an ISP. And he says any regulation at all of the Internet is going to be a problem.  You don't want government fiddling with the Internet because they don't understand it.  It's a it's a blunt instrument.  And if you regulate Internet service providers as carriers, you're going to make it far worse than it is.  We will get on somebody.  I don't know who we have.  Did we try to get Neil I could tell we have Dane Dane Jasper, who is this who is the CEO of Sonic Net, another Internet.  It's actually a good guy to get on the other side because he's also Internet service provider.  And I think he can argue the other side.  I hope he can. He absolutely can.  He's been very he's very.  Yeah, he's very much looking forward to it between Internet service providers about whether they should be regulated as carriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, there's an argument here.  The Al Franken argument from a couple of years ago, South by Southwest, is the is the net neutrality is not trying to regulate the Internet.  It's trying to stop the ISPs from changing the architecture of the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I you know, I I would love it if Title 2 would just, boom, solve this problem.  I remember talking to John Perry Barlow, founder of EFF.  He said even the EFF board is very split on this.  Some of us are just anti-government.  We don't think the government can do a very good job.  The Internet moves too fast, is too technical.  We just don't feel like government is the right solution.  But we also recognize that just leaving it up to Comcast, Verizon and AT&T isn't a great solution either.  I mean, I think we all agree that what we really wish we had was real competition.  If there were 10 choices, it wouldn't be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's what that has to be the barrier until we have some measure of true competition.  There's temporary regulation in place to preserve certain rights under the belief that competition will then deal with us.  And the arguments that the phone companies are making, of course, is that is because they have huge profits,  even in these capital intensive businesses, but they argue that we're not going to invest.  But they seemingly are investing.  And and if the barrier is if the bar is set at a competitive level,  it says regulation will come off when you are this competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK, I'm going to channel somebody like Jerry Pournelle, who's a right wing libertarian,  who would say, when have you ever seen the government give up any regulation once imposed?  In other words, once you give the FCC the power to regulate, are they very likely to say, hey, good, there's competition now.  Have fun, guys, we're stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can you can you can sunset it in that way.  I mean, listen, I'm not a I may sound like a libertarian sometimes.  I'm a Hillary Clinton Democrat.  But I think there's a role for government in certain places and not in other places.  And I scream generally about the government staying the hell out of the Internet.  And I generally agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about those who argue there isn't any problem right now?  Everything working pretty well.  I mean, yeah, and Comcast put the screws to Netflix, but Netflix is still making money.  They were able to pay that those interconnect fees.  We've got a it's working now.  As in other words, it's a form of techno panic, to use your own phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fair. But I also think, you know, that at this point  and I just have my already had my rant about a phone company, you know, over the month.  But if if cable companies and telephone companies think that we're going to side with them  and give them empathy, then man, the it's time to pay the piper, guys.  You've been treating us like prisoners and like crap for years and nickel and diamond us  and and setting all your own rules and not operating in an open way.  And now you expect us to sign with you.  We have no trust in you.  Sorry, AT&T, you do not have the most reliable 4G network.  And I got the proof. Yeah.  Sorry, cable companies, you throttle us.  And I know your margins on Internet are unbelievable.  And you bundle us and screw us in all kinds of ways.  And you don't give us good service.  No, we're not going to sympathize with you.  We're not going to leave the Internet in your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the. But I want to also point out the title, too, doesn't say anything about,  you know, paid prioritization, which is really the issue here. Yes.  I and it does impose all sorts of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting, nervous about that part, too, I agree.  Maybe that's Obama's point about selective enforcement.  Maybe you just set the principles to say these are the principles that we will enforce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One title to and this is the this is the key thing.  Title two section subsection 202 says, quote.  Common carriers, and this would make ISP's common carriers,  can't make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges,  practices, classifications, regulations, facilities or services.  So Michael Weinberg, a public knowledge says under title to the FCC  would be free to create blanket rules that prohibit problematic discrimination.  But I know already that Brett Glass is going to come on and say, yeah, that's fine.  But let me tell you some of the other things title to requires.  There are a lot of arcane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Requires or enables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the commission says we will forbear.  We will selectively not enforce certain features of title two.  And so that's the thing.  Do you trust them to enforce just the good stuff and not everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because that's that's the heart of the matter right there.  Who do you trust more, the government to be involved  or the carriers themselves to, you know, not take advantage of the current situation?  And I think that's that's the big split right there.  Right. I don't trust either of them. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess if I had to pick one, I guess I'd pick the government.  But God knows, for one thing, that they're clearly influenced by the dollars  donated by I would I would pick companies in a competitive marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hands down, right.  But in a competitive marketplace, I have issues.  Now, people will say back to me, well, Jarvis, what about you and Google?  When you defend them while they're in a competitive marketplace,  they never think it's advertising.  But there are there are fact choices.  We are not imprisoned.  We as users, as opposed to advertisers, are imprisoned by Google.  We are imprisoned by the terms of phone companies and cable companies.  And that's that's me is the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to have a heck of a debate on Sunday.  I have a lot of a lot of prep work to do,  because this is a very complicated subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's going to be a good show. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Why did you do it?  Well, we I think we kind of have to.  And, you know, even in our own audience, it's very split about how to solve it.  I think we all I think we all generally agree if there were competition,  we wouldn't have to worry because if if Comcast were screwing you,  you'd have somewhere else to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Comcast has been able to gobble up even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and by the way, that was with the help and support  of the Federal Communications Commission, which gave them a monopoly.  Now, the argument, if you go back in time, was Comcast said,  well, we're not going to build out our system unless we have a monopoly in each region.  And so what and and the FCC felt like, well, if we're going to get these guys  to build this, you know, this infrastructure, we got to give them a monopoly.  It's very interesting.  And I think that we all kind of need to understand it as best we can.  The Matthew Inman did, of course, a famous oatmeal  response to Ted Cruz's tweet, Net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet.  The Internet should not operate at the speed of government.  And Matthew said, this led me to assume one of two things.  Thing one, when you accepted campaign funds, Ted Cruz from telecom lobbyists  last year, they asked that you publicly smear net neutrality.  Thing two, you actually don't know what net neutrality is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love this guy. Isn't he great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says, I can't do anything about thing one instead.  Let me explain what net neutrality is.  The problem is all of these very kind of simplistic  explanations make a huge amount of sense.  And we've seen so many of these.  But this isn't what's happening.  And I'm not sure that this is even says this is an extreme scenario  and not a very likely one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, even the New York Times had a headline this week about  about what's the really simple way to understand neutrality.  It's not that complex.  If you oversimplify it, you you you ruin it, too.  Yeah. The New York Times piece was not bad.  It was it was it was a fine explanation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think Matthew's very smart.  He did a great job.  He says net neutrality is a bipartisan issue  because net neutrality isn't about control.  It's about freedom.  And, you know, it seems to me if you are a conservative  and you believe that, you know,  innovation is going to keep this country economically vital,  then you must believe in the Internet and a free unfettered Internet, too.  But, of course, remember, conservatives just don't trust government.  So I have to say.  Ted Cruz is against it. I'm for it.  Personally, that helps me make it in choice.  But I think it's actually an argument here that says anything Obama touches

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  gets political cooties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe maybe by saying what he said.  Yeah, because now now he's he's provided a target.  Do you think he was it was cover for Tom Wheeler in a way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Wheeler can see more reasonable or figure it out.  Otherwise, it's now going to be known as the Obama net.  Well, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What we do know that Comcast, Verizon and AT&T hate Title 2,  which is another good reason to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now there's now Wheeler has negotiating power.  Yeah, that's right.  Say that's a good point.  The president of the United States and a lot of people,  one point X million are after you.  Yeah. Let's let's actually talk now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe, you know, maybe that actually that could be  very savvy political move there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't think this is the problem is, is the idea that he's going to negotiate  that neutrality with a telephone company is because that that that alone  makes my skin crawl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Such a challenge in areas where there are multiple Internet service providers.  I do believe that things are better,  but in general in the United States, something like 80 percent of all  Americans only have two choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your phone. I have my files and my files  is better than my cable set up was.  And the two of them have fight each other for for for for features.  And yeah, I think it improves immensely.  It's only two. It's still an oligopoly. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And let's face it, both Verizon and Comcast are kind of in bed on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The New York Times argument was basically was was was arguing that it was  it was the neutrality is the power company.  We turn the power, we don't know where it comes from and we get pay a bill.  That's the British model where BT does the last mile  and anybody can sell you service over it.  We're not anywhere near that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing is we can think of solutions.  Competition, government owned Internet, that kind of thing.  Look, you know, a lot of people, including Bob Frankston,  it's Bob Frankston, the guy who created visit calc.  One of the guys who created visit calc are advocating for local  municipalities to just use their right of eminent domain to take over  the Internet wiring in that town.  Say we own this.  It's a public utility.  And we're going to let any company that wants to provide Internet service  over these wires, do it.  And that would be a great solution.  But none of these are likely to happen in most areas.  We found out why the Google barges didn't fly.  They were fire hazards.  The Coast Guard said these barges, these were the remember  these barges appeared in Portland, Maine and San Francisco.  We didn't know what they were.  They were supposedly floating showrooms for Google.  Crazy millions of dollars spent on these barges.  The barges that they bought to recondition alone cost something like four and a half million.  Apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal, the U.S.  Coast Guard repeatedly raised fire safety concerns.  Google could not answer.  There's they warned that the barges would have over 5000 gallons of fuel  on the main deck right next to a substantial amount of combustible material.  They're floating bombs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've got your you've got your Chromebook aisle, your Nexus aisle and your fuel aisle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And in fact, they dismantled and sold the Portland barge for scrap in August,  and they have moved the San Francisco barge and so much for the barges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I think it's Christopher Mims, I think,  is the columnist for the journal who did the story.  And on Twitter, he was arguing that this was an act of hubris,  technology hubris.  I said, you know, maybe, but I often imagine this right hand, left hand.  Yeah, you know, not so much that we can get away with this.  It's just somebody went and did something and the company is just too darn big now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's an example of government regulation working exactly like it's supposed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. True enough.  Barge neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the question, though, does the barge barges  I thought were pushed by tow trucks, tow trucks?  Yeah, I don't know why they have fuel.  I don't know. Right. Why do they have fuel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently they did.  Google didn't dispute the point.  Yeah, we got 5000 gallons of fuel.  What's your problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right. We'll sort of. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100% project. You're right.  It could blow up.  It could blow up.  I never thought of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whoops.  Google has a Google drive for Genome.  That's interesting.  Remember, they killed their health.  Well, that was that was more of a consumer level.  Yeah, this is aimed at the hospitals and universities.  It's the big genomic data on Google Cloud platform.  Google Genomics.  Boy, these guys think big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, wow.  Got to love them.  Cloud dot Google dot com slash genomics, if you were a  if you'd like to explore genetic variation interactively.  Hey, get me out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Voice users, you now get MMS support on Verizon,  Verizon wireless users and native support.  So now this means that Google Voice now has sports MMS  all the major carriers in the US and Canada.  And if you're using Hangouts with Google Voice,  you can send these messages natively.  You're not going to get a link to an image.  It all shows up right there in your SMS client the way you would would,  you know, in Hangouts, the way that you would expect.  So it looks like the only thing we're waiting on at this point  is group messaging via MMS.  And that apparently will be enabled in a future update.  So Google Voice, get getting the MMS going on.  Yeah, yeah, good news.  Google Drive has been optimized for iOS 8.  So a couple of nice updates for iOS users.  You can now open files from Drive and save back to Drive  from other apps on your device.  If you're using iOS 8, you can use Touch ID now to unlock Drive.  There was there was the ability to passcode  Lock Drive app for a while, but now now you get Touch ID.  And you can add videos that you store in Google Drive  to your iOS device as well.  You can save videos from Drive to your device's camera roll.  You just tap the file and then say open in and choose save video  and you can save it to your camera roll.  That's pretty nice.  Google Keyboard was updated with material themes  and Lollipop's Messenger app is now in the Play Store.  So, you know, of course, the Google keyboard now, it just  got a couple of it shipped.  There was a refresh and update, which included light and dark  material design themes.  You don't see them by default.  You have to go into settings and select which theme you want to use  if you want to see them.  And the Messenger app, which has been introduced in Lollipop,  is now available in the Play Store.  So if you have a device running Android 4.1 or higher,  you can download Messenger now.  It's not a replacement for Hangouts.  This is the app that ships kind of baked into Android 5.0 Lollipop.  It just gives you kind of plain Jane, SMS, and MMS  capabilities that's in the Play Store now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frustrating because basically Google wants you to use Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right. It's a little confusing, right?  They want you to use Hangouts, but messaging is if you don't want to use Hangouts,  you don't want to merge those together.  Hangouts should look that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Hangouts look that good in the...  I should look in Lollipop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it looks it looks similar. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, sorry. Sorry.  I was thinking Messenger.  Yeah, it's almost like now Hangouts design feels a little bit behind  some of the other things.  It was like one of the first to jump.  And now here's Lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't look any better at all.  It looks exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In Google Hangouts.  The Hangouts definitely looks the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, Hangouts does look the same.  Hangouts hasn't gotten the material design treatment quite yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm starting to populate fake information.  It takes a long time to do that, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you for doing that.  I might steal your...  I always show my phone numbers and my information on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to create a dummy account that everybody can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good idea, right? With contacts.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Yeah, and I think part of the thing with the Messenger update too,  it is kind of confusing because it was this unified thing.  Hey, everybody use Hangouts.  This is the future.  But that doesn't help for AOSP, right?  Because Hangouts is kind of a closed source thing.  No, you have to offer the messages.  Yeah, exactly.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And finally, we were talking about this a little bit pre-show.  Android 5.0 Lollipop begins rolling out over the air to Nexus devices.  I believe that tweet went out today.  So the Nexus 5, Nexus 7, both generations, but not the LTE 3G versions quite yet.  And the Nexus 10 are coming out.  I think they tweeted out this afternoon.  They're starting to roll out now over the next few hours.  Yeah, we just keep tapping that check now button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently does nothing but what the heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like when you're at an elevator and you keep tapping the up button.  Come on, come on, elevator, hurry up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, I was going to say this is my tip, but I might as well just say  Google did release the factory images as downloads.  So if you want to just go ahead and install it yourself,  you can do that if you're willing to do.  You know, it is it's just a pain.  You have to install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you have to have an unlocked bootloader, but you don't have to root.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's basically seven bootloader is surely not locked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're all unlocked the Nexus ones.  So, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you do flash that, though, you're going to lose your data  that's on your device automatically, unless you get it from OTA.  And I think there is actually a way to flash those that you don't lose the data.  I'm not quite sure.  I don't know. Yeah, I mean, personally, I'm waiting for the OTA

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because I'd rather just because I'm lazy.  I'm waiting until my six comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you still need the Android developer tools and such to do the flashing.  So I over the air is much easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, over the air is way easier.  If you're patient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it. That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the Google change.  Now, supposedly, Motorola did a post on its blog that they are also pushing  updates for the G and the X this year and last year's.  And somebody in our chat room has a Moto X Pure Edition,  which is the one you get on Moto Maker with the T-Mobile Sim.  And apparently that has his was updated.  So it's a rolling as always. They're rolling updates.  They don't update all the phones at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just keep.  They don't. They can't release all the terabytes at once, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you know if you try to update more than three times in any hour,  it delays the update for up to 24 hours, says Brian Bones.  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? I haven't heard that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't heard that. That ain't right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That ain't right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It could.  Could slows you down.  So Spotify,  remember, we talked a little bit about Taylor Swift snubbing Spotify, saying,  I don't want to give the impression that I give away my music for free.  So she made sure her most recent album, 1989, I think,  I think all of her music is no longer available on Spotify.  She says streaming is a grand experiment,  but I'm not willing to contribute my life's work to an experiment.  I don't feel fairly compensates the writers, producers and artists and creators of this music.  Meanwhile, Daniel Eek, the chief executive at Spotify, says,  Taylor, you might want to ask your label about that,  because this year we have paid two billion dollars in royalties.  And he estimated that he had paid at least six million dollars this year to Taylor Swift.  The problem is, it's not Taylor Swift's money.  It goes to the label Big Machine.  And if Big Machine doesn't share it with Taylor, that's not Spotify's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, if you go to medium.com slash at sign PUD.  I love Philip Kaplan.  He wrote a wonderful piece about this,  when she argues that the entire music industry was a grand experiment that lasted only a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it. Thank you, PUD.  It's amazing that the old record industry existed in the first place, he says.  You know, the record industry has a history of ripping off artists, period.  And this doesn't surprise me in the least.  And it's very important that Spotify, Daniel Eek stepped right up and said,  you know what? We do pay money.  And we had on Twitter last Sunday, Rob Reed, who started this whole thing, he founded Rhapsody.  And he said, we didn't know what to charge, but we talked to the labels, we talked to artists,  and it seemed to all involved that if you could get a user,  and remember, this is in the Napster era too, there was stealing going on.  If you can get a user to pay $10 a month, like clockwork,  there's more money overall in the pie, more artists get more money overall,  than if you say, well, no, we're never going to do that, we're only going to sell music.  And he was right. I mean, users love it.  He was the one, Rhapsody was the one to set that $10 price,  which has been pretty much written in stone ever since.  And when you went, I mean, $2 billion in payments from Spotify to labels this year alone,  that's almost doubled from last year.  I think the system works.  I don't think the music industry works, and I would agree with Pud on that.  He says, Mozart didn't sell one copy.  Taylor Swift sold 110 million.  When record stores were a thing, there were exactly 60 musicians  who figured out how to work within the system become wildly successful.  60, 60 musicians who sold 100 million copies or more.  He says, but that was because they took advantage of inefficiencies in the market.  How many of those millions of people only wanted one track,  but had to buy the entire album?  Bingo.  How many of those millions put the album on a shelf and never listened to it?  By removing yourself from streaming services, which by the way, she did.  She only removed herself from Spotify.  She's still on RDO and everything.  Taylor Swift is intentionally adding inefficiency back into the market.  Well, she can. She's on top, right?  Yeah.  Like Comcast, her product is...  And by the way, we had Damon Wayans on Triangulation on Monday.  It's exactly what he said as well.  He said, someone like Taylor Swift can do that.  But what about all the artists who nobody's ever heard of?  They get a lot of Spotify.  He said, he said, too, it's the record labels.  They're the ones keeping the money.  Like Comcast, her product is popular enough to be a hit on the internet.  Like Comcast, her product is popular enough people will put up with it.  And when I believe an artist gets to choose what happens to her art,  I still think it's a dick move...  to her fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really? I don't know.  I think it's great that Taylor is in such a position of power  where she can make that decision.  And it seems like that came from...  That came from a place where she said,  I feel like everybody...  We're creating this music and we should get more value out of it.  I don't know. I think that someone in her position...  That is also who she makes a fortune from her tours.  She absolutely does.  But see, this is the thing. I didn't think that this was about her.  I feel like she knew that she was in a position,  because she sells so well,  that if she said something, people would make a big deal about it.  And they did. I mean, we're talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also bought 1.3 million copies of 1989.  Maybe because some of those people couldn't get it any other way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is...  It could have been purely a greedy move.  Does she want to charge $12 a month? Does she want to charge $15 a month?  Or she just doesn't want streaming at all  and only wants to do what record stores did for a limited time in this country?  I mean, that's the problem is, OK, what's your solution?  The whining of, I deserve to be paid more for my creativity.  OK, but the world's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of artists don't like Spotify,  but I think they need to call their label and say,  hey, dude, you know, those big checks you're getting from Spotify.  I think probably this is a question of bad contracts,  contracts that didn't consider digital distribution and streaming.  And I think the record companies have once again screwed artists.  This is nothing new.  So, Gina, if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I cut you off and I should have done that.  What do you think that that's not like it's happened before?  What do you think that  the streaming services should be doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know,  I think it's good for someone to question the economics of it,  particularly her, because it made waves.  I, you know, I don't know what the solution is.  I don't know what the solution is.  It was interesting to me that she, you know, someone who reaches so many people.  I mean, of course, she knew she was going to reach her fans no matter what.  Our fans are going to get the music however they needed to get it.  And other artists aren't just aren't in that position to do that.  But I think most artists are just at the mercy of whoever will distribute  their work on whatever terms, because they just want to get out there. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff, would you consider putting your book  on Oyster Books or somewhere like that where they charge  10 bucks a month and you can read any book in their life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Better than that, my book is going to be entirely free on Medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, you're the wrong guy to ask.  The whole book. But what do you think about authors?  I mean, Oyster Books is this is this basically Spotify for books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, try it. Why not?  I mean, that's what Amazon's argument is, is if you lower the price point,  you're going to increase the sales, you're going to.  I mean, part of what you want to do as a writer or a singer is you want to reach  more people. Well, Rob, Rob's point was if you're getting clear here,  so I don't get in trouble with my family.  My daughter is a gigantic Taylor Swift fan.  I love Taylor Swift.  We're showing Philadelphia. She puts on an amazing show.  That is her scarcity now. Right.  She announced her tour.  I met my wife immediately, said, Oh, get your finger ready.  We're going to be hitting refresh, refresh, refresh on the order,  you know, screen for trying to get tickets.  It'll be worse than trying to get a Nexus six.  She's created a tremendous scarcity there.  Huge tour. The more fans she has, the better off she is.  I think I've talked about Paolo Coelho on the show before.  He sold 125 million books, ungodly amazing.  And he's pirated his own books because when he found that new people  would discover him in a new country, it would lead to more sales.  We've got to we're not ready to say that we know what the economic model  of music or media should be, because just because what it was.  I'm not saying that it's right where it is now. It's not.  But neither was it necessarily right before for the for the current reality.  We need to experiment with more things.  And it's not nothing that says you're going to get paid what you used to get paid.  But I think Pud's point, too, is it was it was a tremendous blockbuster based  business and the variety we have now is greater than we had when artists  had to go through the gauntlet.  And Taylor Swift, God bless her, is the blockbuster of blockbusters right now.  But she's not representative of music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's absolutely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One question I have, and I don't really know the answer.  I mean, I would imagine she probably makes a lot more from the touring  than she does from the album sales anyway.  It all depends on the contracts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eek said that it's a top artist like Taylor Swift is on track  to exceed six million dollars a year from Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On Spotify, I got to believe she makes more than that.  Yeah, but that's one that's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's there's multiple streaming services.  True. This is not an insignificant flow of money.  The point Rob Reed was making is the music industry was very happy to say,  oh, ten dollars for everybody who listens.  That's going to be more than we get selling CDs.  And so they were very happy, especially in the world  where people are starting to pirate like crazy.  Music sales are down 14 percent this year.  Physical music or just digital music sales are down.  14 percent this year already. First half.  I think this is I think this is viable.  And I think it's I think Taylor Swift actually is is  this is a kind of a data point.  It's FUD that was driven really by a promotional needs, not not anything else.  And if there's a problem, it's because the record labels are keeping too much,  not because not much and they're not making money.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's always been a slimy business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Her the head of her record label, Scott Borchetta,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  said that they wanted to restrict access to Spotify's paid tier.  But Spotify said, no, we won't do that.  What does that mean?  Well, there's a free there's free Spotify with ads.  So there's revenue still.  And there's and there's premium Spotify.  That's the ten dollars a month.  And I would guess almost all music fans buy Spotify.  Ten dollars a month.  And I would guess almost all music fans pay at least pay one streaming service.  Ten bucks a month. Right.  I paid Google's my ten bucks used to pay Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I paid the eight bucks for all access.  So she was rejecting the ad base, the free ad based model. Yeah.  I don't know. You know, there's something legitimate there for me.  And I think that's because I'm equating it with with software and web apps,  you know, which I've been covering for years.  And, you know, we went through this time where every app,  everything on the web was free  with the idea that it would grow big enough to attract advertisers  to support itself.  But, you know, now that we're several years into it, we see that that  is insustainable, you know, small startups gets gets wild up in acquihires  because they weren't able to, you know, sustain a business model.  And it's hard to sell.  I build a subscription service.  It's hard to sell a subscription to consumers  because folks have been trained that these things are free.  And so it kind of puts you in this weird position where it's like,  well, if you're making something that's really good,  whether that's an app or a song or a movie or whatever it is,  you know, that costs money and and who pays.  And I think for her to say, you know, I just I don't want my music to be free.  I want people to pay for my music through some through some way,  whether that's the Spotify premium or buying the CD or whatever.  I don't I don't think that's necessarily, I don't know, a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Other artists have pulled their music off Spotify.  I'm reading an article from David Byrne in The Guardian, in which he says  he's pulled as much of David Byrne was the lead man for the Talking Heads.  He's pulled as much of his music for Spotify as he can.  But he also says it's kind of interesting  that Spotify generates profits for record labels and free content for consumers,  but it spells disaster for artists.  Again, it seems to me the problem is record labels.  Another kind of upside down quote, this is from again,  from Scott Borchetta of Big Machine, Taylor Swift's label.  He says, we don't want to embarrass the fans.  If a fan went and purchased the record CD, iTunes, whatever,  and then their friends go, hey, dude, why did you pay for it?  It's free on Spotify.  We're being completely disrespectful to that super fan.  Who wants to invest, who believes in their favorite artist.  Record labels seem crazy.  All right.  Anything else to say, we're done.  Oh, well, I think we've said it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, you know, we I didn't cover this in the changelog,  but I figured we would talk about it separately.  Music Key, YouTube Music Key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, has it launched?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of subscription music services.  No, it's been announced.  I think it's going to become available on a limited beta next month.  So it's seventy nine, seven ninety nine dollars, seven ninety nine a month.  Oh, interesting subscription music service, which is YouTube.  So it'll it'll allow enable offline videos, background playing ad free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it will eventually be ten bucks a month like everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's bundled with Google Play.  Play music, play music.  This is interesting.  So if you have play music, it's an additional eight dollars a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see.  My understanding is that if you're paying one, you're getting both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think you get both together.  Yeah. Oh, that'd be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Music Key also includes a subscription to what the company is now  calling Google Play Music.  It's Spotify competitor, which normally sells for nine ninety nine a month.  You're right. It was ninety nine, not a month.  And so the Google Play music all access name is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? Oh, interesting.  So this is the new Google Play. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, you didn't get before video.  I guess. Oh, I see. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Through YouTube.  So you get ad free.  OK, a new way to enjoy music ad free anytime, anywhere.  Ad free music, background listening, offline playback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen, this is what Susan Wojcicki is talking about.  She made mention, I think we talked about last week of of of of an ad  free YouTube paid experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. YouTube dot com slash music key.  One word and you have to sign up.  It's not till November 17th.  And it's going to be a private beta starting then.  Wow. You owe and you can.  Oh, you're going to have a dedicated music tab on your music home page.  So you will have a new YouTube music tab as a subscriber.  So there's video discovery.  See, I think this is cool and smart.  By the way, look, who's there? Taylor Swift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think she can file a complaint and get you guys get the show taken down. Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should I? How about this?  I want to play Glenn Campbell, who is in the last stages of Alzheimer's.  Saddest story.  And he recorded a new song,  which is probably the saddest thing I've ever seen.  And yet moving and yet beautiful called I'm Not Going to Miss You.  And it features images of Clint Campbell as a young man, but he sings it.  And he talks about how the world is slipping away from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really quite moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, he's been so brave to do this publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The man that loves you till the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're the life  resound transphire  and veryglobal.  I'm not gonna miss you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really beautiful.  If you want to, I encourage you to go to YouTube and watch the whole thing.  It's on the Vivo channel.  Yeah, it's like, it's a little like you, Glenn talk, Glenn,  Jeff, when Jarvis is with us, I think I'm losing my mind.  It's a little bit like Jeff, you know, talking about your prostate cancer  and being very public about it.  Yeah.  And Alzheimer's is kind of a taboo subject and mostly because Alzheimer  patients don't really get to just disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, it was like it was like click and clack.  They show it off.  What happened?  So we didn't know what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then he's done.  Yeah.  Tom, I'll you see.  No.  Yeah.  So thank you, Glenn Campbell and his family for publishing that.  OK, let's continue on because now I'm depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a bummer.  But it's beautiful.  I think it's something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really.  Quite touching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I got a good go ahead.  Go ahead, do something.  Say something.  No, no, because I got no number.  Someone knew this for my number.  I will fake it.  Save your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Save your number.  Is there anything we missed?  Kevin, any story you want to talk about the Moto 360 available in metal today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  As is, you know what?  Not a lot of people realize the Sony smartwatch just came out this week  and nobody's talking about it.  Yeah, the smartwatch three.  What's interesting to me on this one, it's  it's the only one with GPS, which as an average runner, I really want that in my watch  so I can leave my phone behind even better.  It's Wi-Fi ready and not too many people have kind of glommed onto that yet.  Wi-Fi is not actually supported yet with Android Wear, but obviously it's ready  when they do turn it on.  So I think you'll be able to sync data right over your home Wi-Fi network.  That's interesting.  What would be better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like this is going to be them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, probably not great.  Although it's a trend trans reflective screen.  So that helps a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it is a bigger battery, I think, than the other Moto Wear watches.  This is a Moto Wear watch.  It also has a fast processor quad core A7  Cortex A7. Huh.  Very interesting. Same price.  250 is the Moto X. Yeah.  Smartwatch three, it's on the Google Play Store and devices.  I actually really love my Moto 360.  I really like it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was all in my hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I come back in the country, it doesn't.  It gets too confused.  It's now on prog time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should get that from your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I turn it off and back on again.  Then it resyncs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's getting the time on his phone from AT&T. Remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  You actually are on prog time.  Yeah, the response. Terrible.  All right. Let us get to our tips of the week.  And we'll let Kevin start things off.  Just actually just did with the watch.  But you got another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure. I'm always good for another one.  Actually, I think Jeff will appreciate this.  He and I both use a Chromebook Pixel and a lot of people actually use Chromebooks, as we know.  Talking about Google Drive for iOS reminded me about this.  You actually can stream audio and video directly from Google Drive  using a Chromebook and a Chromecast.  You just go right into your files app in the Chromecast.  Obviously, Google Drive files are there because that's how the file system works in a Chromebook.  You got a Chromecast just cast that video from the player right on your Chromebook.  All of a sudden, it just starts streaming from the cloud, just like any other streaming service.  So you're not locally streaming it where you get stutters and lags and need a really strong processor.  So it was in the developer channel of Chrome OS back in September.  I would bet it's probably in beta and close to stable soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very cool. So you store video on your Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I've got to do something with that terabyte I got with the Pixel.  I threw my Beatles anthology movies up there, what not.  And I just stream it from the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. You can have your own Spotify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, not with Taylor Swift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right, I just spotted this and I haven't had a chance to try it yet,  but you can now flip a coin through Google Voice Search.  The new search is rolling out, I believe now the material design new  refresh to the Google search app and among other feature updates.  You've got one you can say, OK, Google, flip a coin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's awesome. Can you flip multi-sided die like, OK, Google, flip a 20 sided dice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Clearly, clearly that's in the in the queue.  That's definitely going to happen. Google's just geeking out for that.  So I haven't had a chance to try this act.  In fact, I don't think I've gotten this update yet, but it looks like it  probably works on a lollipop device.  If you if I don't know if you want to try it on the OK, this is the Nexus 7 doesn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's try it on lollipop.  Let's try it on lollipop.  But we're not done yet, my friends.  Let's see, we're going to go home.  The new home button, which is round.  OK, Google, flip a coin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't make a liar out of me, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no. Oh, it might not have the new Google search.  I guess, yeah, I think it sounds like this update is rolling out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I guess it didn't ship with lollipop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Darn. That's a great thing.  The work, Gina.  Say again, what's that?  The Hodor app, you know about that.  The Hodor.  Is your Hodor app not working?  Well, if you say Hodor to search, it's supposed to say Hodor back,  but I can't get it to do that.  Let's try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  You know, there's also the Hodor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It tells you what's going to do, but it won't do it.  I've heard of a Hodor keyboard and that's all it'll type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I love it.  If a new Google app starting November 12th, that's today.  You could say Hodor into the app.  The Google apps.  I thought it was a search.  Oh, you know, this is iOS.  People use an app.  It's just for iOS.  The app goes live at 1 p.m.  Eastern.  You can even program the app to set an alarm to remind you.  It's time to Hodor.  Wow. So do we so anybody got an iPhone?  Anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you'd switch back to the iPhone, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were leaving the Android.  I did not switch back to the iPhone.  What are you nuts?  I'm probably droid turboing, although I like the Note 4  and I don't know, maybe the Nexus 6.  It's between those three.  What's the longest you've been loyal?  I used the Moto X for the original Moto X  probably for eight months or something.  Almost a year. Wow.  I love that phone.  Same here.  That was a great phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, just to tag on to what you were talking about, Gina,  with the update to search,  they're also adding in the ability for you to use OK Google  to search into other apps now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool. I think we talked about that last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Well, that's part of this update.  So this update also brings that capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, very nice.  And I wonder which apps are using it.  They used as an example, Trippit,  if you did OK Google within Trippit.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a million phones went, do-do.  There goes my phone and my watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And my Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently, I just have a voice Google likes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually easy for developers to add that.  It's like three or four lines, Google said when they announced that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I hope a lot of apps do it.  Let's see, Jeff, your pseudo number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's either 199 or 99, depending on how we pay.  I want to know that everybody else going to order an Echo.  Did you order an Echo?  I put in for to be invited to do so.  I said it was it was putting.  I'm so jet lagged right now, I can't think.  Siri in a Pringles can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's true.  Can we have an Echo on the show if you get one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, sure. If I get one, if I get invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me we have the just so for people who haven't seen it, we have the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find it here. Don't show it.  Yeah, here we go.  The early early beta.  Yeah, it seems better sitcoms that got canceled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, what does it do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alexa, what do you do?  I'm a talking cylinder.  I exist only for companionship and utility.  My existence is utterly meaningless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alexa, play rock music, rock music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alexa, stop.  We want to try.  Alexa, what time is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's time for you to calm down.  You actually don't have to yell at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, it uses far field technology so it can hear you from anywhere in the room.  Echo is pretty neat.  His dad is such a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He knows all sorts of things.  All you have to do is ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alexa, how tall is Mount Everest?  Mount Everest is like probably the biggest mountain.  I heard a guy died trying to climb it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus, it goes really good at keeping track of things like shopping and to do list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Alexa, add wrapping paper to the shopping list.  I've added wrap albums to your shopping list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Alexa, how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How is it possible a woman your age doesn't know that?  Look it up, you insufferable imbeciles.  OK.  That's not a warning person, but Echo definitely helps him wake up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alexa, alarm off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to get up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Saturday.  Alexa, what day is it?  Today's the day Ron gets off his ass and makes something out of his life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would buy it if it was this way.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the parody obviously of what they did though, which is so great is they took  the actual horribly insufferable Amazon video.  I mean, poor dad.  He's such an idiot.  He's such a jerk.  And they and they all they change.  The only thing they change was Alexa's responses to make them more appropriate.  But Jeff, don't you already have this capability in your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I probably won't actually order it.  I put in so I can get invited if we talk about it.  Can you imagine?  Yeah, I have my phone.  I guess there's an argument that says that if it's just there and on all the time and  you can start having a conversation with a computer at Star Trek time.  Computer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I have to confess, I spent $600 on the Jibo.  And I'm not going to get that for a year.  So it's the same thing as the two.  You haven't seen this?  This is here.  But these are the things that matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And somewhere in between this is a family introducing the world's first family robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Say hi, Jibo.  Hi, Jibo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were totally scooped.  I'm sorry to say by Amazon.  Cynthia Brazeal, who is a real robotics expert, has done amazing things with robots, is the  person behind this.  They've raised several million, I think.  They've sold quite a few of these.  I was one of them.  Six hundred bucks.  He's a hands-free helper.  You can talk to him.  It does have a head that turns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Excuse me.  He's definitely cuter than Echo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cynthia's really good at creating friendly robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember seeing her at food camp with one of her robots playing with a kid.  And the kid just loves the robot.  Little kid, like four-year-old.  So I'll tell you what, Jeff, you get the Amazon cylinder and then I'll have Jibo and we could  have a show with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say this would be a good panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could take ourselves off and put them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They raised $2.2 million, 5,554 supporters, but they say it'll be probably next, like  a year from now before it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the little thing with the soft cushion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the da- what was it?  The chumbee.  Chumbee.  Chumbee.  Yeah.  I had a chumbee too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm an idiot.  I had a chumbee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm an idiot.  I buy all this stuff.  Chumbee was cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  While we're on me for a moment, I saw I was in Prague and I did my favorite Auto Awesome  ever.  It's on the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I want to see it.  By the way, the only- there is something that's interesting about this Amazon thing is that  somehow Amazon in a Skunk Works project must have been going on for years, created voice  recognition Amazon style.  I mean, that's something that Google took a long time to do.  Apple took a long time to do.  Microsoft, I mean, this is really cool.  What is this head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ooh, neat, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a sculpture in Prague.  It was made for Auto Awesome.  That was all.  Yeah.  So it's always moving?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it move with the wind or is it mechanized?  No, no, it's mechanized and the face goes around.  I just took one.  Prague is cool.  It is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm jealous.  All right.  Well, I don't have a tool, so I think we can wrap this puppy up and put a bow on it.  Thank you very much for being here, Kevin Toffle, the mobile editor for GigaOM.  Great to have you here, Kevin.  Appreciate it.  And one of the few people in the world who's had Nexus 6 for-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You weren't too obnoxious about it either, Kevin.  I was trying to have fun with you for the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tried to keep it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His review is on GigaOM.  I mean, in summary, I think you kind of did summarize it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you know, it's, again, got the same guts as some of the more current Android phones  that are out there, as we said earlier on the show.  There's so many great phones to choose from.  If you have to have a large top-notch Android phone, this is definitely one to consider.  You won't have to wait for the Lollipop upgrade as well.  So, yeah, I mean, it's a nice phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like Lollipop's going to get to a number of the Moto phones before the Nexus  6 gets to the stores.  T-Mobile was supposed to have it today, and they've announced it's going to be-  It pushed back.  Yeah, they pushed it back.  And I think that's because there aren't any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Kevin, what scared me from what you said in your review was that it might also  be better off with the battery life of some of the other phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, when you're pushing all these pixels on a larger display, even though it's an AMOLED  screen, which is energy efficient and such, you're going to pay the price in battery  life.  We still haven't solved that problem.  That's what we need for the next big thing in phones is batteries that last for days,  right?  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  So if the prices were equal, 1 plus 1 versus Nexus 6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If the prices were equal, I probably would go with the 6, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the 1 plus 1 is because it's so inexpensive is what makes it so interesting.  What you're getting for the price there is tremendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a cheaply made phone.  No, it's a great phone for 300 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Six inches is big too.  Have you ever had a six inch phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I returned a Nexus, I mean, a Note 3 at one point.  Okay.  Even that wasn't six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was five, two or five, five.  I have a Nokia 1520, which is the only six inch phone I've tried, and I like it.  You like the notes.  I like it.  Yeah.  And I've always been, I've had every Note.  Hey, I note that you say in your review that instead of Dalvik, the Nexus 6 is using ART,  the ART runtime.  Is that true for all Lollipop devices now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I believe yes.  It was experimental in Android 4.3 perhaps, but it is the default runtime in Lollipop.  So maybe, and that could be attributable to some of the bugs that I've seen, and I'm not  the only one who saw those.  I've read the other reviews right before the show, and a lot of people saw the same little,  little buggy things like I did.  So maybe there's some runtime compatibility things that need to be resolved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that's interesting.  I want to see if I can, huh.  Yeah, I've had problems with compatibility with ART with just a handful of programs.  But that's interesting.  That'll change over time though.  Yeah, especially if Lollipop uses ART.  All right.  Thank you very much for that.  We're really glad to get a review on here.  And the camera, you know what?  That looks pretty, that is a good looking cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is a lazy cat that's been sitting here listening for the dolphins next to me this  whole show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a great picture.  And I mean, the detail on the fur, that looks good.  There's plenty of light obviously, but that's still...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the key.  That's the key.  Yeah.  That's my new 4K monitor looking at a 4K video.  Sweet.  How big is the monitor?  28 inches.  Ooh, how much did that cost?  Amazon refurbed $459.  Oh, that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the one Samsung was making a lot of hay on.  Yep.  Yeah.  All right.  Now I don't know what to do, but fortunately I get to own them all.  It's a good thing.  Yeah, it's the nice thing.  I could try them all and then I have to decide which one I'll carry.  Thank you, Kevin.  Great to have you.  GigaOM.com.  Thank you for sitting, suffering through sleep deprivation for us today.  Or suffering through me.  Thank you.  Yeah.  No, you're great.  You're always great.  I'm just...  I know how hard that is to do what you just did, so thank you.  Gina Trapani suffering through the flu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not quite the flu, but yeah.  Everybody's limping here.  I got the Rudolph nose going on.  Yeah, a lot of fun.  Thanks for having me.  We're quite a crew today.  We had sickness, sleep deprivation, the whole thing.  Yeah.  Thank you for being here.  It was lots of fun as usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thinkup.com.  You got to go there.  You can get your free trial of Think Up, which is a great insight engine into your social  media, Twitter and Facebook.  And I use it all the time.  I'm getting Think Up notifications now, which is really fun.  Oh, good.  I'm glad.  Yeah.  It's fun to see those.  Testing those out.  Did you know that iTunes Podcast can thank me for 184,000 more people seeing its tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an official Apple account?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got it for you.  Yeah.  No wonder they keep asking me to retweet them.  I use the exclamation points in 11 tweets this past month.  Exclamation point.  That's 31% of my tweets.  Exclamation point.  Oh, that's bad.  That's really, really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is badly on it.  You're not a 12-year-old girl.  I have to go back to journalism school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, nothing wrong with 12-year-old girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think I am a 12-year-old girl.  So, my best time for responses between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many exclamation points did you have, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, you only have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, normally if you use double or triple, we chart it.  And you didn't have a chart.  That means you were pretty restrained.  We'd only use single exclamation points.  Yeah, I don't do double.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had 39.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Professor of journalism, Jeff Dravish, liked his exclamation point, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who's the enthusiastic tween now?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Choo-chay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Choo-chay.  This is fun.  This is really...  Anyway, if you haven't got your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, George Sake changed his profile?
