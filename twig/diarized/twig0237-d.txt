It's time for Twig, This Week in Google, and today it's just the three of us.  The core group, Gina Trapani in mom's house in Brooklyn, wearing a Jets blanket.  Hi Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, good to be here.  Nice to see you.  As always, just getting the internet set up at the new house, you know, takes a while. Good to see you too.  Yeah.  Always love my Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going with Xfinity Comcast or what are you going to use for your internet service over there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We didn't have very many choices. It's basically Time Warner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well that's soon to be known as Comcast.  Yeah, that's right.  That's Jeff Jarvis over there. He's at the City University of New York, CUNY, where he teaches journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina's in her blanket. I'm in my warm...  Fleece?  Fleece, yeah. I'm not on warm California anymore.  Ah, did you have a good trip?  I had a spectacular trip, but thank you for your magnificent hospitality and generosity.  Well, I didn't do much.  Having us in, my boss in, she had a great time. She now knows what fork means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice! Now that's an education.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This whole discussion going by about forking Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She admitted it after the show. I didn't know what that was about, but...  She figured it out.  She obviously, she's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We had an incredible... The next day, I spoke to the content team at LinkedIn and we saw Flipboard.  And then the next day, Friday, I saw Vic and Bradley and Richard Gingras at Google.  And then I met with the head of product for Google class.  And then met with the strategy team at Google, which is an amazing thing.  And then I spent two and a half hours with Reid Hoffman, which was just plain honor.  Neat!  Phenomenal rest of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Neat. Well, it's good to have you. It was good to have you out here. Please come out anytime.  Great to be there.  And it was really fun having her. Sarah was great.  Sarah Bartlett, the Dean of the School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  We had a good time.  Yeah.  So, your Pixel end of life, April 2017.  They better have a new one by then.  I can't promise you a new one.  Is this new, the Chrome OS end of life policy?  This is something Mike...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a new list. I wish they wouldn't... I mean, I wouldn't you wish they'd do this for phones too.  They're committing to a date until which they will support Chrome.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess that's one way to look at it.  Instead of saying end of life, they should say, here's how long we're going to support this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that would have been a better way to put it.  Yeah.  Because it's a commitment that goes beyond the life of most Android phones, frankly.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Microsoft does this. In fact, you know, it's in the news right now because April 8th will be the end of life for Windows XP.  No more updates.  I had not seen this before.  No, I hadn't either.  With Google. These are Chrome OS devices, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Chrome OS.  So, my Pixel is till April 2017.  Which I think that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, it says these are unofficial end of life dates. Official EOL for these models will be at this date or later.  And the only exception there is the Samsung Series 5, which that's the officially announced end of life, which is January 2016.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I guess the difference here would be that after the end of life, you could keep on using your Microsoft device forever on your old OS and it's fine.  Right.  This thing, it might say, sorry, you're Chrome. We update Chrome and we can't update you. So, bye.  Will it?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When a device, as what Google says, reaches EOL, it means the product model is considered obsolete and will no longer receive full support from Google's enterprise team.  Additionally, enterprise customers using devices. Enterprise is not us. It's business.  That have passed their EOL update may find they cannot manage their devices as expected using the administrator control panel or leverage new management features.  Automatic software updates are not guaranteed.  Doesn't say it won't work anymore.  This is what happens with Microsoft too. They're just not going to fix it.  So, if there's exploits, that's bad. Chromebooks, I would worry less about exploits.  Is it possible having an old version of Chrome will keep you from visiting some sites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the thing is, I can't ever have an old version of Chrome. Whenever you restart the machine after a new version has come out, you get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. But you won't after April 2017. That's the point.  Not necessarily, it sounds.  Not even that. Not yet. Won't is not even right. May not. May not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have kind of mixed feelings about this disposable computer thing.  Me too.  It doesn't Microsoft, didn't Microsoft support Windows versions for like 10 years and there was such an uproar with XP that they extended it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So, I mean, obviously we both agree that you can't, you're a developer. You know you can't support software forever and ever and ever.  Comes a time you got to move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Particularly software that is so closely tied to the hardware.  I mean, you know, with Microsoft, Microsoft doesn't support so many different hardware configurations anyway by design, you know, over the years.  And part of the reason why Windows is so kind of crufty and heavy, right, is that it's got, it's got different drivers for different things.  And Android kind of has the same thing with the Chromebooks.  It's like, you know, it's a hardware software that the package is tied together.  I don't know. I kind of feel like they could do better than four years.  I'd like them to do better than four years.  But then again, their whole take on the Chromebook is that it's this disposable computer that you can throw in the river and get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, when it's 200 bucks, I mean, my 1500 buck machine, you know, probably pixel owners should be a little more upset.  But but but when have I ever kept a computer longer than three years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. That's true. That's true.  But, you know, if they're targeting developing countries or education or you know, it's a really good point, Gina.  Don't have, you know, that the kind of resources that we have or the kind of, you know, computing demands that we have.  I mean, look, it's a lot better than Android, right?  Android was, you know, purportedly supposed to be every 18 months they were going to upgrade.  And that's not shorter than even a two year contract.  We talked about this a little bit last night on all about Android.  So four years is OK.  But it's just interesting to see, you know, that change that commitment to backwards compatibility,  which was very much a hallmark of of Microsoft's approach to software for better or for worse, you know, kind of flipped on its head.  And that's I think because in its DNA, Google is a is a web company.  And when you deploy web software, you deploy it and it's updated.  Right. So like here's a web company trying to distribute devices running desktop software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're like, we're not going to, you know, Gina, I was talking to somebody when I was at Google.  I won't say who, but I was just talking to somebody at Google and I talked about web stuff and they kind of just poo pooed.  Oh, web. What?  They're a mobile company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wow. I wouldn't poo poo web.  I don't think that's going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't either. I think it was done for effect.  But wow. You know, where they're putting the resources is mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're putting the resources into GMS, right?  Which is that that layer on top of Android that that interacts with the cloud.  So I equate web with cloud services and there is a difference between consumer and cloud services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Web browser. I was I was complaining about something I wanted a web browser and I was kind of told.  Ha ha ha. Grandpa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Geez. That's absurd.  I'm sorry. That's just that's absurd.  People are going to use desktops for a long time to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, of course. But but in terms of where their resource, I think it was illustrative of where their resources are going,  where they see the importance of development and, you know, given choices of priorities,  they're you know, we see all these numbers now about these huge proportion of traffic on mobile.  I think that's a misnomer in great measure.  We talked about this in the show before because I think that bundles in things that are not mobile like tablets.  And we need to redefine what mobile is. Mobile means a phone to me.  And you're gone somewhere else.  But even then, you're still using a browser.  You're still using the web. But I pointed to my beloved pixel and was kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. So maybe by 2017, you won't you'll be using what is it?  I mean, I'll be using my Google Glass, of course.  It makes sense if you're Facebook or Google or Yahoo to think that what you want to do is transition your revenue to mobile,  because that's how more and more more than half now of all computing is done on mobile.  But doesn't mean the end of the world for desktop by any means.  I can't I don't anticipate that ever happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think I'm not asking you to reveal who you talk to, but I think this depends a lot on who.  Yeah. You know, what if it was Sundar Pichai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, hmm. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it was maybe because we were out there looking at what we should do as a journalism school.  And we keep on talking how we have to do more mobile and we know we have to do more mobile and every media company I know says that.  But when I heard that, I thought, oh, even more than I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yikes. Yeah, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had a night. I had a very pleasant lunch with Steve Lee, who is the head of Google Glass product.  I just asked as a condition that he not punch me out when we sat down and he didn't.  He was very, very nice. I have I wanted on the record.  I have ordered my lenses. Oh, he turned you around on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I've kind of felt like a schmuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And, you know, I need to know how this thing operates in office.  This thing operates in optimal conditions that I've never had in optimal conditions.  So my wife's not happy, but I ordered my lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I talked to somebody. So we had two people from Google in the audience, unbeknownst to me on Sunday during Twitter,  one of whom marked as marketing for Google Glass.  And she was sitting on her hands because I was saying things like every time I see somebody with glass on, I feel like I just want to punch him in the nose.  And but but one of another person came up who was wearing with prescription lenses and said, you know, you really haven't experienced it.  And I wear glasses like you, Jeff. You really haven't experienced it.  And that's I think what you're saying, unless you've tried it with your prescription glasses on.  I guess I have to do. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or I should have gotten contacts, but I'm too squeamish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so you were well, that's then you really weren't you couldn't see it. Couldn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I couldn't. Well, I was so what was over my Jeff's over my glasses.  Oh, you wearing it over your glasses.  Oh, that's really better with these glasses than than hormones or something.  Yeah. People who have black framed glasses can't use it at all here.  But you had to adjust it constantly to try to get right in there.  How many geeks don't wear glasses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like it seems like if you're a geek, the glasses go with the territory.  Yeah, I think so.  Gina, you wear glasses, I'm sure.  I don't. Oh, stop it.  You're not a genius.  I got lucky with good eyes. You have perfect eyes, really?  Gina is perfect in all ways.  I guess that confirms what we've always suspected.  But golly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina is an it's not about Android.  Gina is an Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I wish I'd be much more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gina is an Android.  Gina is an Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow. Filled solely by diet Pepsi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ooh, that's a good kind of answer.  You have reached singularity, Gina.  A world fueled by diet Pepsi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if we want to belabor this.  I think all hardware has to come to an end.  It does seem a little swift.  The Acer AC700, which is only a couple of years old, ends July 2015 next summer.  Three years seems quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there? Okay.  Yeah. So what's the number? Is five years good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd say ten.  I mean, this problem with computer hardware is the hardware itself,  especially with solid state drives, never wears out.  Right.  And it doesn't I don't understand why you can't support it.  Maybe it's going to get slower and slower.  But what what features?  I don't know.  When you make Chrome OS.  Well, see, that's this is the question.  What is Google thinking they're going to do that would make this happen?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know it seems like graceful degradation.  You know, even if they get slower, big deal, a new hardware, you know,  get it to work without that feature on slow hardware.  I mean, that slows down the development process and it adds, you know,  it can add some complexity to your code base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But isn't Gina isn't the whole notion of Chrome that every device is  automatically upgraded to the same Chrome level and that's what and that's  what makes it secure because it's verifying.  You always know it has the fixed up latest version of Chrome.  You have no choice about that.  You have a choice of which track you're on.  But you have a blessed version of Chrome when you turn this machine on.  And if it's not blessed, it will not work.  And that's what gives Chrome its security and its and its consistency.  Right.  Isn't that architecturally?  That's just different from Windows where I bought the OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, my favorite sort of little fun fact about Chrome is that the first  thing that the developers built before they built any browser functionality  was the auto update functionality.  Wow.  Like the first thing that they built, people ran just a little executable on  their desktop that would auto update.  Like that was the first thing they did because it was, you know,  Chrome was from the beginning supposed to do graceful, silent,  instantaneous updates that didn't require to restart.  I don't know if you remember Firefox was a bear.  You always had to restart.  You knew they made a big Mozilla would do these giant big parties  about new Firefox releases.  We all knew the version.  That's right.  That's right.  And now remember?  Yeah.  And Chrome doesn't mean Chrome's version numbers are insanely long.  They're constantly pushing out updates.  It happens silently.  You don't even know.  Well, you do have to restart though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You do have to restart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Occasionally you do occasionally do or the little hamburger turns orange  and says, hey, please update Chrome.  I mean, at this point, I really don't shut down my computer or shut down  Chrome very often.  So I'll catch that once in a while, but it's a completely different paradigm  than what it used to be.  So we came from a world of Windows updates that would be like multiple  restarts and packs service packs.  And then we had Firefox, which was like, you know, also sort of very  old school version, big version drop releases to Chrome, which was  the silent update.  So yeah, I mean silent updates that happen without you having to, you  know, deal with them automatically.  That's like one of the basis, you know, it's that and speed were the  two things that Chrome really promised.  So that's why this end of life thing seems strange to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From a hardware perspective, we've talked on the show about the  potential of the modular phone and Google's working on that.  Others working on that where you you take an old ship out and put a  new chip in shouldn't a laptop be like them?  And the screen is pretty much good for a long time.  The camera is good for a long time.  The keyboard is buttery and beautiful.  The trackpad is buttery beautiful.  You know what I need in Chromebooks is more RAM and there's a new  chip that offers something you're missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're missing the point here.  Chrome cannot ever get to the point where it won't work on the  mass of PC hardware and that's out there.  Forget the Chrome browser.  The Chrome browser, they're never going to say, oh, you can no  longer run the Chrome browser on your Intel Core 2.  It just will run slower.  They there's no way they're making Chrome incompatible with the  vast majority of PCs out there, right?  That's not an OS.  That's the Chrome OS is just a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but no, it does more with the machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the browser on top of what some sort of some sort of layer  that doesn't know the computer, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, what are you going to require fingerprint reading or  eye scanning?  No, maybe it's something that I think this is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You might be poking at something there.  I mean, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, security.  Clearly what's wrong with security in this world is that we  should get to the point where knowing your your name and your  social security number and one of the passwords used for a  service shouldn't matter.  Shouldn't matter at all because there's better security mechanisms.  So yeah, it could be something like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, they're trying to make people buy new computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they just bought a company.  They bought a company with the new voice security thing.  That's bogus by the way.  Oh, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, wait, is it it's voice or I thought that sound so you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to a website.  It plays an inaudible tone that your phone picks up and  authenticates you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, is that it?  Oh, I found out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were talking to Steve Gibson about this because he's doing  something similar.  That's an open source project to do a similar thing, but not  with sound and it's his opinion.  I think he's right.  This was an acquire.  This was hiring the engineers, but it's clearly shows a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  direction better than entering a freaking code from Google  Authenticator, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, well, it is if you have speaker and it's too hardware  dependent.  It's called slick log in password dependence.  No good either.  They want the engineers.  I don't think they care about well, there are better ways  to do this that don't require you holding your smartphone up  to the speaker that may or may not exist on your hardware.  What if you have a computer?  So yeah, that's silly.  I don't think that's the actual reason they acquired this.  I think they got they wanted the engineers, but we'll see  maybe Google will announce an audio authentication system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, if you know that what I go through for two-step  authentication at this point like that experience can be  proved so much more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not two-step.  This is something separate.  This is password free authentication, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what that's what Steve is also doing with his  squirrel project.  The idea being that just as you I'll give you an example that  will ring with you Gina where you use SSH you have the keys  stored on the server that you're logging into you don't use  a password.  It's more secure using public key crypto.  And this is something similar to that Steve's doing the sound  would just be like a QR code.  I think this is not something Google is particularly  interested in that would be my guess, but I'm just guessing  I haven't spoken to anybody at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can we talk about Google I oh, I know I'm skipping ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Google I oh it's in June this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai just and just posted to his Google plus page  less than an hour ago.  The new the dates June 25th, June 26th and they're making  changes to registration.  You won't need to scramble the second registration opens  Sundar says are successful.  They'll be implementing a new system where you could submit  your interest to attend Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, you have to apply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, successful applicants will then be randomly selected  and notified shortly thereafter will be like Howard Stern's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  birthday party.  It's like Burning Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it's anything like Google developer interviews, I'm  probably in big trouble.  You guys saw the scene in the internship when it was like,  yeah, man was shrunk down and stuck into a blender like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what how would they get out?  By the way, I never did understand how they got out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But okay, I saw the physics.  Let me let us go on the record right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyone watching from Google?  Please.  Please.  I'm pretty sure that press is different than developers.  Gina, Gina knock on that paneling behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, it's a measure of how popular this is and I'm  glad that they did this because in the past the whole thing  has been what all gone in 30 seconds.  Yeah, it's like that Nick Cage movie gone in 30 seconds.  So this is not who can click fastest.  Right, though it would be a kind of a good test who can  write the best script to auto register for Google IO.  Then you'd have to be a good coder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And then you'd have to get in just for your efforts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matt cuts comes and kills them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So this makes sense.  Although it shows how popular they are that they have far  more people wanting to go than they can fit in.  So they have to do a random drawing of all entries.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People want to go to Google IO not for the developer resources  and not necessarily to be there when they make big announcements.  They want to go for the schwag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay.  Can I make a suggestion and they stop, you know, no more Santa  Pachai.  They start just to stop giving away crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They start to pull back.  I mean, they started to reel that in a little bit last year,  right?  Remember that moment where he where I think it was a dark  said all this new phone.  You're not getting one like it's good 179 and the Play Store  and everyone in the room was sort of like,  Oh, that whole Oprah thing kind of freaks me out about IO.  I think we took away that element.  There would be less competition people to get in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's as a developer that must cheese you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, listen, I like my toys too.  But you know, I was in line at Google IO one point and I  and the person I was chatting with the folks in front of me  and they were like, oh, you know, we're students.  So with the student discount we got in for this much and  but the value of these goodies that we got is way more than  that.  So when we eBay them, you know, we're really going to make  money back.  That's why you're here.  I mean, I'm not saying that these these kids and they were  they were cute and they were and there was Mark.  I don't think that they were necessarily representative,  but it was a weird I thought it was a weird reason to want  to to want to go those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  There was a word for it in Yiddish.  They're snorers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a new one on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A bunch of Gentiles around here.  I'm an honorary Jew snores are chisellers sponges spongers.  They are just a snorer according to the Jewish dictionaries  distinguished from an ordinary beggar by dint of his boundless  chutzpah.  A snorer is far worse than a cheaper miserly person.  He's often unethical to the point of stealing.  Is the stealing always illegal?  No, in fact more often than stealing is quite subtle and  perfectly legal legal, but not ethical.  You're a snorer schnock it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What what I think is going to be interesting is how what  kind of system could Google possibly implement to make this?  I mean, it sounds like it's basically going to be a lottery,  but you know Andy Bayo does xoxo and he had an application  process for the conference, right?  Because he had a similar thing where he just had so many  people wanted to come and only so much space and he wanted  to maintain a level of intimacy that Google I O certainly  does not have but he had people answer a set of questions,  you know three or four questions.  He wanted makers.  He wanted people who were creatives and that him and his  co his co-conference chair went through them and chose people  kind of by hand.  Yeah, I think as much as it hurts me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should be there Gina because you are going to build  stuff.  That's right.  The truth is I shouldn't be but no, you should be there as

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, but I know this absolutely they should they should look

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  their self-interest in IO and they want people they want  developers who build things who build this future and and  they should be there should be like a university admission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly how do I how do they know that I'm someone  who's going to make stuff like do they say because you've

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  made it you look at good.  You know what do it on GitHub you get in by your GitHub.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get it by your GitHub account or do you have to have  you know an application listed in the Play Store or in the  Chrome Web Store?  Maybe you know, do you have to show your GitHub profile for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all we know for all we know they're doing that because it  sounds like there's this prequalification a little bit  right random but for all we know they're going to take  everybody who asks going to look at their GitHub account.  I bet you they've got a Python script.  That then sorts them and then randomly picks them actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they already know who they want there and they're going to  put it in your brain those want to come and they're going to  make you apply.  Yes, it's it's more presumptive than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you know, they're also trying to get new developers in  right.  You don't want you don't want devs who already sold, you  know who are already going to do the work anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You still want people who if you're sort of this way if  you're not putting stuff on GitHub should they want you  there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean a minimum requirement a lot of developers work, you  know work for companies who don't open source their stuff  and their works in the dark.  Does that mean that doesn't necessarily mean that they're  less worthy and a lot of developers work for companies  and build the Android app but their company's Android app  is listed as the company's Android app, right?  Because they're employed.  So this is this is tough.  This is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet you there's a there's an algorithm.  Google's an algorithmic company.  I bet you they figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure that there's some sort of algorithm.  I'm sure there's also major selection bias.  Yes, and I look forward to critiquing the algorithm.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, let's do it.  Let's critique the algorithm.  In any case Google, please.  Don't be a snorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought about I bought I bought my Chromebook.  That's right.  You did you did I bought a Chromebook.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I bought my glass.  I bought my frames.  I bought my lenses.

I was in I was there for the summer code like the Mentor  Summit and there were scheduled times and we were escorted  by a Google we had free run of the of the store.  It was a Sunday.  They clearly opened it up for us.  I mean, it definitely seems like a guest thing.  Yeah, it's kind of over the woods like to get there.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's just over it's over in 1950.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, but you have to cross that little bridge.  It's like a little bridge.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where Google Plus is.  So I was in that neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  I've never been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Speaking of Plus this this New York Times story.  Did you call this laughable?  I feel like we've got a lot of laughable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just screaming about it because it and it's going to  set Leo off to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't see it.  So tell me and I can get mad.  It just starts off on the old ghost town stick.  How can well, you know, and I'm the one of the people says,  you know, Google Plus a great place to talk with people who

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  work at Google but it is you know, and I was with Vic  and Bradley and Richard Gingras and and I'm sure he won't  mind me quoting into this effect because it's positive to  Google Plus but but Vic saying, you know, we've really grown  a hell of a lot in a hell of a short time and he likens it  to the growth of of you know, an Android or something like  that.  It's it's it's it's still on a spike.  I still think you know, it's very clearly the quality of  what I do on Google Plus versus what I do on Facebook versus  what I do on Twitter versus what I do on Medium.  They all have their roles, right?  And it's not it's not room for one, you know, zero sum game  my life and and so I use Google Plus.  I like Google Plus.  There are a lot of people who use Google Plus and and just  because you don't use it New York.  I mean, Claire Kane Miller is a tech writer and it was just  it was it was was that her thing is I don't use it.  So I guess that must be what it is because it's a ghost town.  But the real problem then was it comes around and says,  oh, it's not there for you to be social.  No, they have a secret agenda.  They want to target ads.  No, bullpucky.  Of course they do.  That's their whole business model.  You just discovered this.  It was it was it was just it was just stupid.  It was page one stupidity.  So there was no and I could see what's going to happen.  You know Bradley Horowitz goes for an interview and then  gets burned.  And so this was he interviewed in this article.  He's quoted a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pissed me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've really turned the corner with with Google Plus.  I have to say if you go to my Google Plus profile, it looks  as if I don't use it at all, right?  Because I haven't posted anything publicly in a while.  But I Google Hangouts has become a part of my daily life.  The video the video conferencing with my daughter is is amazing  that little hats and the must that little effects cracks her  up.  So we use that.  Yeah, I mean really the other day I had forgotten to push  some stuff to GitHub from my home computer.  So I hang out at my wife and said, hey, can you just allow  remote desktop access?  And I wound up, you know, remote remoting into my home computer  using Hangouts.  I turned on auto backup for my photos and videos the auto  awesome videos that Google Plus makes are amazing.  Like if you've got a little kid or a pet and you just you  know, I'm never going to edit video, but I still take I take  video now only because of Google Plus because the auto  awesome videos are great.  The auto backup of my photos is amazing.  So like I use parts of Google.  I use Google Plus a lot, but just in the door I use the  private private features.  So I'm not using, you know, the social tool really, but yeah,  I mean for a while we actually wound up switching to slack,  but my company was using Google Hangouts as like our internal  chat speaking of slack is really really good.  It's it's it's in preview.  But but yeah, slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's some Butterfield Stewart Butterfield.  Okay.  Flickr founder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stewart wrote a clicker Flickr co-founder and Stewart just  as a side here wrote a fantastic resignation letter from  Yahoo years ago about how he was in the tin business what  happened in business and now he has a letter to his staff about  being in the saddle business.  Stewart is a character.  Yeah, I love stories.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a fine piece of software that slack.  I got I've got to say is it a project management tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's enterprise focused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's it's communications.  It's chat.  So it's it's like a it's a really beautifully designed  web-based similar to IRC.  I hate to say IRC because IRC like in its you know, even  the nice clients like I'm using textual it's so much better  experience in that you can attach files and you can you  have different channels or whatever, but it's been it's  been really great for my for my team and the mobile apps  are just gorgeous and is it invite only right now or is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it is invite only and I'm not sure actually  really got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  million of those Yammer is similar to Microsoft Fire for  a while and then we're using Hangouts and yeah, it's yeah,  it's really it's really nice.  Let's see what I can do.  To hurry along your empty.  Anyway back to Google+.  I use Google Plus all the time.  It is not obvious from my my my page on Google Plus because  I don't use it to post public updates.  I could I should I have guilt about it.  Just like I have guilt about not blogging.  That's another thing.  But I think that people just have to stop equating Google  Plus with this the social product actually I just signed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  up and said I'll get invitation by February 28th so I can  wait.  That's not that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  Yeah, that is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Facebook just bought WhatsApp for 16 billion dollars.  Oh that just happened just happened 16 billion.  WhatsApp had said for a long time.  We are not cheese for sale team billion.  That's what they're saying in the chat room.  Do we have a link because I don't I'm looking for it right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  now 16 billion is a lot.  WhatsApp is extremely popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me a give me a link somebody because maybe that's  just bogus.  Here it is business insider.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be I've got I've I've used WhatsApp a little bit  at Davos.  I still don't understand.  What's that?  Oh, I use it all the time where it fits in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's internet-based messaging.  It's it's a very crowded space.  People use Facebook Apple's messenger and other programs  for it.  It allows you to send media as well as text right Facebook  for 12 billion in stock and 4 billion in cash according to  Business Insider.  That is a stunning amount of money.  I mean given that YouTube was just a billion some wow,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you know what's going to happen Facebook stock is going to  go up, you know higher than it'll make it up in no time  flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got the cash that does that's that's crazy money.  And of course crazy remember Facebook started this all by  paying.  She seems so long ago a billion dollars for Instagram right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and we all went nuts about that.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is a mobile app for iOS Android.  I think they have it for Windows Phone.  I'm not sure off the check.  It's cross-platform.  It's internet-based text and audio and video messaging.  It is probably the number one of these programs.  Remember they bought Beluga not too many years ago as well,  which was a very similar program.  So it strikes me that the technology they probably already  have this must be they're buying this for the users,  which is which is a big user base Facebook bought Beluga  in March of excuse me 2011 three years ago.  Let me see if I can find the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What the press release is just numbing.  Pursuant to the terms the merger agreement merger sub will  merge with and into WhatsApp the first merger and upon  consummation of the first merger merger sub will cease to  exist and WhatsApp will become a wholly owned subsidiary of  the acquirer the surviving corporation of the first merger  will then merge with and into acquirer which will continue  to exist as a wholly owned in part directly and in part  indirectly subsidiary of parent upon consummation the  stooping the closing of the transactions kind of Jesus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Christ.  I don't know why they would release the business deal memo  as a.  They did.  As a press release that's pretty stupid.  But it might be you could tell some stuff from that.  Yeah, you can't it's not unusual that what yeah, that's  basically what we're seeing is the SEC form 8k.  It's not unusual for you to do something like this when you  acquire a new company because what you don't you what you're  doing is you're acquiring the assets of the company without  the employees right exactly.  There's there's reasons that they would structure it that  way, but I don't think we just weird they would make up the  press release.  You don't really need to worry about it 16 billion most of  that stock though 12 million 12 billion stocks mocks for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  billion 183 million shares of parents class a common value  to 12 billion based on the closing price six-day proceeding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now when Mark Zuckerberg gives a record billion dollars  to charity, you could just kind of say well, that's you know,  nothing Mark.  Come on Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey Mark.  Hey Mark same journalism.  We have a few ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got some ideas.  I'll do it for 500 million honest, you know.  When Jeff wouldn't you and I get together to save journalism  for half a million half a billion easy.  Oh, yeah easy easy.  I mean Pierre Omadar only paying a quarter of a billion to  Glenn Greenwald Jeff Bezos a quarter of a billion.  Yeah, and all the jet is a few magazines will save all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  journalism will save all of journalism all of it all of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Motorola sold for 12 billion and WhatsApp sold for 16 think  about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  You're buying the users you're buying the users.  That's what you're buying.  How many users does it have tons?  It's it's the easily the most so replaceable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I went into I went I had a serious addicted what addictive  WhatsApp period I have since graduated but now it's like I  mean, it's a good app.  It's for people who don't want to pay for text messaging or  don't want to use regular text messaging.  You know, it's chatting on the phone.  I mean I get it means Facebook Messenger December of it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook has the technology in December of 2013.  What's app past 400 million monthly users regular users  400 million.  That's all.  That's double what they had in April though.  So they were growing quite fast.  In fact, you might assume that it is considerably over 400  million if they're if they're doubling at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They well on Facebook clearly sees its future as mobile right  and that that also illuminates that line from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a critical note.  There's a survey that came out in December that said at 44%  of all smartphone users polled.  What's I'm sorry.  They pull okay, what's app overtook Facebook as the leading  mobile messaging service back in December.  They have 44% of all mobile messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We can't beat him by him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, 35% Facebook Messenger.  44% of now this was a survey of 4000 world in five countries  4000 users in five countries 44% use what's app at least  once a week.  Yeah, wow, that's a huge amount of money.  If you're just tuning in this is kind of breaking news.  Facebook's just announced the acquisition of mobile messaging  app. What's app for $16 billion 12 billion in stock for billion  in cash that is huge huge.  We're going to take a break.  We'll come back with more you guys if you want to can do a  little thinking about what this means and we'll return and  we'll show you what's app.  I have it on a number of my devices.  If you want if you've not used it, I can't imagine anybody's  not used it at the growth rate something somebody in the chat  room said that it's at the current growth rate of what's  app it would have been able to buy Facebook in six months.  So this was almost necessary.  This is a defensive move.  No, they didn't have our show today brought to you by personal  capital.  My friend Bill Harris joined us on triangulation more than a  year ago.  He's a former CEO of PayPal and Intuit knows a little bit about  money and he was telling me about this startup personal capital.  He said, you know, the problem people have right now is just  every one of their financial accounts is a different website  with a different password.  There's no easy way to look at it.  We're not just talking all your checking accounts.  We're talking your mortgage your loans your credit cards and  your investments.  They're all spread out everywhere personal capital makes  it easy to see where you stand by combining all of those  accounts into a single page with beautiful real-time graphs.  And then once you do that you can make sense of it make the  right investments.  In fact, one of the things people do often is overpay for  management of these assets.  You can do it yourself with personal capital.  Com it'll show you how much you're overpaying in fees and  how to reduce those fees.  You'll get tailored advice on how to optimize your investment  strategy.  And it's free.  So why wait signing up just takes a minute.  It's secure.  I know sometimes people Gina you and I had this issue with  another financial service with do I want to give them all my  stuff.  They're using the same back end that all the banks do is  completely secure.  You're not giving them information that service doesn't  already have in other words and boy pays big evidence total  clarity and transparency to make better investment decisions  instantly.  There really are great personal capital.  Com slash twig.  That's the page to go to so they know you saw it on this  week in Google personal capital.  Com slash twig.  It's free and it's a smart way to grow your money personal  capital.  Com slash twig.  We thank them for their support and if you grow your money  right, maybe someday you too can buy a messaging app for 16  billion dollars.  She's doesn't seem possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just watching my tweets go by about this.  Yeah, that's a capital or employee half a billion per

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  employee capital is it total funding eight million dollars  eight million from Sequoia.  You're kidding.  I think so go to Crunchbase and see if I got that wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's amazing.  If that's all it's an Israeli company.  I believe is that right?  It says Santa Clara.  I thought it was in Israel for some reason.  Google had offered them 4 billion earlier according to  Dubai.  I think that's correct.  What's app has consistently said no, we're we're not going  to sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're Sequoia you say take it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Eight million dollars funding now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't the the the revenue model for WhatsApp is  probably sufficient, but it's a buck a year.  It's not an expensive app in the first year is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they have a cost structure of having to fit into SMS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're not SMS.  It's all internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I send to somebody I'm not sending into their SMS.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, although on Android you can determine what your  default SMS app is.  I've never tried using WhatsApp is my default.  I'm sss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's my dumb question is obviously I'm not a big user  of it.  How do I get a tribe on WhatsApp as opposed to my tribes  and any other messaging app I have to rebuild it from  scratch.  You know, I want to do WhatsApp if I remember correctly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like I logged into WhatsApp and I had a message that was  like 16 of your friends are all using looks at your content  was there.  Yeah, they were there already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very widely used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody wants to send me any messages.  I'm a ghost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's just that we know you're an old man.  So you're not going to use WhatsApp.  It's actually a lot of people use what's everybody uses  WhatsApp.  It's very just I took it off because nobody I really want  a message with uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's that's the issue.  I have.  Yeah, I mean I believe it.  Here's here's my obnoxious moment.  Not that I don't I have I have obnoxious moments every show.  Here's here's labeled another one.  It was used as the as the party roundup for Davos.  What's app was yeah.  Well, there you go.  I got into the WhatsApp app.  So I knew where the parties were.  That's all you needed to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was I was too old to go.  So looks like they had a single round of venture funding  and in 2011 April 2011 for 8 million dollars a billion for  16 billion Brian Acton Jim Coombe and are the co-founders  and they had a big payday today.  Let's see if the blog at WhatsApp is yeah, here it is  Facebook almost five years ago.  We started WhatsApp with a simple mission building a cool  product used globally by everybody.  Nothing else mattered to us.  You see the platforms.  They're on by the way iPhone Android Blackberry Nokia and  Windows Phone.  So they're very universal today.  We're announcing a partnership with Facebook that will allow  us to continue on that simple mission.  Doing this will give WhatsApp the flexibility to grow and  expand while giving me Brian and the rest of the team more  time to focus on building a communication service.  That's as fast affordable personal as possible.  Sounds like they're going to maintain see with Beluga.  It went out of business.  They just incorporated the Beluga engineering team and  presumably some of the code into Facebook Messenger and  that was it.  It was gone.  We liked Beluga was great group messaging.  Well, that's another thing people use this for is group  messaging as as a Davos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is that Jan comb or Jan comb or however you say his name?  Yeah, who's writing this?  Yeah, yeah, he dropped out of San Jose State where he was  studying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another college dropout billionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So a Neil just just tweeted a link to a blog post that  yawn or Jan posted in 2012 why we don't sell ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't sell ads.  In fact, they didn't want to sell the app.  They were very focused.  And I guess it's paid off on a personal note.  He writes Brian and I couldn't be more proud to be part of  a small team of people who in just under five years built  a communication service that now supports over 450 million  monthly active users worldwide 320 million daily active users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brian's appears to be the grown-up.  He was VP engineering at Yahoo in 96.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  He's an old guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's he's looking pretty sprightly to me right now.  So he's got a stand for his Stanford.  BS computer science in 94.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They they also support asynchronous messaging with voice  so you can leave a voice message for somebody.  It's a it's a you know what?  Well, you know nothing Facebook Messenger couldn't do nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Skype does that video message thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Facebook has a relationship with my Facebook users will

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  now be visible to once happened now once that will be useful to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the question is and I get the feeling from this blog post.  I know the answer the question is does it get folded into  Facebook Messenger or does it stand alone as a separate app  and it sounds like they expect to stand alone as a separate  app which really then makes you wonder what is the gain on  from Facebook that's worth 16 billion dollars.  Yeah, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seems to be the refrain from acquired companies from nest  and and Motorola.  We heard this from and now WhatsApp, you know the the  we're not changing.  We're going to operate.  This is kind of like even the way they worded it was we're  announcing a partnership with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's literally 10 times the purchase price if I remember  correctly of YouTube.  Yes, that's exactly right.  Times.  I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, YouTube they got it.  You know what YouTube was a bargain.  It was a bargain.  We didn't know it at the time.  In fact, it's kind of amazing, but it really was a bargain.  I can't think this is a bargain in any respect.  No, it is definitely eliminating competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, are you seeing let's look who could have gotten this  in a way that would have hurt Facebook horribly.  Google would Google about this.  They tried to for 4 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, conceivably Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft.  Microsoft might be the most credible.  Because of Skype.  Yeah, but they already have two products that are very similar  group me and Yammer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So well, but as you said, there's nothing here that Facebook  messenger couldn't do so it's not a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know Gina and I could write this app in about a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right Gina.  Why didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's because you know what?  It's not about the technology.  It's not about the code, right?  It's a it's not it's about use it right and it's about being  in the right place in the right time and having the right branding  in the right copy and getting in the right hands and having  that one lucky moment where somebody mentions it.  I mean, right?  You know, this is something that this is really a humbling  realization for me a different parts of my career.  I have to keep rehabbing it.  The code does not matter as much as I as a developer would  like to think is it design?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it UI?  Is it what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's whatever brought the people in.  It's the people who matter.  That's what I keep on trying to say to me.  It's everybody.  It's the people who matter.  There's the user base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes acquisition and it's and it's you know, it's it's good  user experience that makes that that flow.  It's it's compelling people, you know, I started using  WhatsApp because a good friend of mine was on WhatsApp and  I wanted to talk to her and I felt like that was the only  way that I could you know every other chat server she was  invisible on right?  So like it's yeah, and I think a lot of it is right place  right time right branding, you know, it's virality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the same thing as a viral video and it's very hard to  bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, to me it's like games.  It's like Mark Pincus's company, right?  It seemed to own the world and then that's the problem with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  virality.  What goes up must come down exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let's go back to watch McCall it.  What was the original Israeli chat company bought by a well,  thank you very much.  What about I see you already I see you I see you right.  So I have them first do you like this?  I use you go to you go to ICQ.  It still exists.  Last I looked it still has that nice little pretty flower in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a case of something like WhatsApp.  It's the network effect.  It's what made Facebook a success.  It's that your friends start using it.  So you use it.  So it's a snowball that gets bigger and bigger and there's  just it's like lightning in a bottle.  I don't know if you can codify rules for virality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see q.com just just for the historical purpose of the I see  you folks was bought by a well of early on it was what it was  kind of in a way was the first big network II webby internet II

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was a daisy icon, right?  It's a daisy.  I can't if you go to I see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I come it's still it's still up right free calls for everywhere  I see you from app.  It was it was it was a chat app.  It's all was it's not by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a well anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  They sold it didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a Russian company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.  Was one of the things that Armstrong got rid of.  Yeah, you know I see q was that was going to take over the  world was the whole world was everything in its day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way breaking news just coming in from the New York  Times Nick Bilton writing about it Facebook acquiring WhatsApp  for 16 is he saying anything new Wall Street Journal.  So this is interesting because you know, I'm breaking news  on my Android the Journal got it at 212.  We got it about at the same time Bloomberg public or Business  Week published it which is about 215 210 something like that  breaking news.  No, it's the same 223 for Nick Bilton.  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ben Ben Evans tweeted that Facebook paid about $35 per  active user for WhatsApp and its own valuation is about $180  per monthly active user.  Facebook you look at that book right Facebook.  So if you look at it that way they had a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but those I was the old lap cheetah then they're  double-paying for most of the every one of those users.  Yeah, how much over like I don't know.  I don't know what's app is not on Facebook.  I'm sorry.  They're all there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gotta be not in the US but maybe in other nations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean someone else was a tweeted Matthew Ingram  retweeted, you know, what's app is a de facto SMS in many  countries, right?  So, you know, this is about spreading beyond the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's a lot of it.  I think it has to be a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what do you say to this if you're Verizon or a phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  company, maybe that's who the threat was from.  Yeah, because SMS is very profitable for them, but it's  dying anyway.  I think they have to have to catamalize that they know  it's dying.  Hey, if you are in a market where you don't have gigabit  internet access, good news.  Google's this is to me a huge surprise going to add new  cities or at least investigate adding new cities to Google  Fiber.  I had really thought that this was just a kind of Mason  Dixon line a demo.  I thought they were just kind of saying, oh, let's you know,  let's show what's possible.  They launched in Kansas City then in Provo and Austin, but  now they're investigating Portland San Jose Salt Lake City  Phoenix San Antonio Nashville, Atlanta, Charlotte and Raleigh  Durham.  You're right around Atlanta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's lots of dots around Atlanta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the Atlanta Metro Raleigh Durham makes sense too  for the same reason.  These are the actual areas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would love to see hey folks chat room look at those markets  and tell me who are the cable companies are who were major  in those markets.  And who are they going after?  Do you think they Comcast markets?  Are they are they secondary markets that Google can win in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  San Jose is a Comcast market that would include Santa Clara  Mountain View, of course, Atlanta is probably Sunnyvale  and Palo Alto.  I'm not sure if that is Cox or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Portland, San Antonio's Time Warner Cable and AT&T according  to our chat room Nashville is Comcast Phoenix is Cox.  Cox.  Portland is Comcast and Charter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because what's always said I used to work on the side of  the cable business and what was always all the deal making  there is to get clusters that work together efficiently.  And so there's trading of systems that go on so the more  you can cluster the better off you are economically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what yeah, that's exactly what they did in the Bay Area.  They have a Comcast has a fiber loop around the Bay Area  and they bought all of the regional cables that were there  to make it a hundred percent and that regionality is what  makes it economical.  Right.  So it would make sense.  I mean if you look at Atlanta there, there's a whole bunch  of suburbs Avondale states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google's not doing that.  Google's going scattershot across the country.  Are they trying to go into every cable company's backyard  to say Nyan Nyan Nyan?  No, I don't think so.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This seems like it's a business.  You're right Mason Dixon line heavy south of the Mason Dixon  line heavy.  Although there's Portland Salt Lake City in San Jose, but  the rest of it is in the south.  And these are by the way not guaranteed these are potential.  So what they're doing as they did with Kansas City is they're  asking these communities to step forward.  And and and you know ask you know get involved be nice be  nice.  Boy I'd love to be on that list of cities.  So what I want to do is another story in there that even as

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they do this is this is gigabyte right?  Yeah gigabit.  Yeah gigabit.  I mean the Google is developing and testing 10 gigabit.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So does this mean that this is more than just a here's what  it should be cable companies shape up this sounds like  they're going into this is a business now a it's a business

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  be it's a serious threat to an industry that needs a threat.  I only wish they would do the same thing with telephone  carriers, but they're not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why not?  They had a chance and they didn't hey and they just got out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of the phone business.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you could be a carrier without making phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's the other carriers they depend upon for sales  and distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what they say is we'll be working closely with the mayors  and staff from each of these 34 cities will walk through  details about the Google study and about the fiber ready  checklist and will answer any questions they have after that  will be working closely with the cities over the next few  months as we work on a study and they work on their checklist  then the competed checklist items will do be due to us May  1st.  Does it it's not clear if they'll all be selected or not.  It's Google does say the process will take some time.  We hope to know by the end of 2014 which cities are going to  get it.  These cities are led by people have been working hard to bring  faster internet speeds and the latest technologies to their  residents.  I wonder if remember when we were all campaigning for Google  fiber if these are the next best cities, I don't know.  We either we believe these are communities will do amazing  things with a gig and they're diverse not just geographically  but in the ways they'll give us opportunities to learn about  the wide range of challenges and obstacles that communities  might face in trying to build a new fiber network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what how far would 16 billion dollars take you in building  this fiber?  Oh, I don't know.  It's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google has more than 60 billion in cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What did what did Verizon invest in files?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was told 5000 per subscriber.  So so many hundreds of millions of dollars.  Let me see if we can find a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  23 billion.  Oh, hello.  Well, so you're in the you're in the spitting range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember that Google makes money in a lot of ways from this  and you know, lately there's been a great push and I've been  kind of run over the coals for defending Google both on Twitter  this week on security.  Now there is this growing anti-Google.  Google is evil movement.  And I think these people are going to say yeah, Google just  wants to become your ISP so they can know more and more and  more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Assuming they get your end to end internet experience.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  New York Times story in your Times story about Google Plus,  right?  They're presuming venal motives, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This I worry.  I really fear that this is becoming a drumbeat.  That's going to be I do too.  Very strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it feels like that's one of Google's biggest challenges  going forward.  It's not the technology.  It's the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're right, you know, and I don't think they know it  fully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, unfortunately, they don't.  They're really good at a lot of things.  But yeah, I mean, I don't know.  I don't know what they do to fix the problem of the creepy  problem.  You know that the feeling of you know, I'm being watched  but every new product it feels like that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in Jeff in the book about Amazon breadstone writing about Jeff  Bezos talks about the very end of the book.  He talks about a list Jeff Bezos made as he sold out a memo  called Amazon dot love and the list he made is of attributes  of companies that are loved versus attributes of companies  that are hated or feared.  He actually included Google at the time of the writing in  those companies that are loved and Microsoft and the companies  that are hated and feared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's generally still accurate for but it's a massive  thing.  But media has certainly shifted to a hostility here and in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Europe and he was really it's really interesting to read this  because here's a guy who's very analytical and very thoughtful  about this stuff trying to figure out it's just like trying  to figure out what makes something go viral.  What makes a company loved versus a company that's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  loved is it that they yeah, no, go ahead.  Leo.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say Microsoft.  I don't think people care enough about Microsoft to fear them.  I mean in order to love or fear anything you have to not be  indifferent.  I think there's an indifference.  I don't know among well, that's what in the memo Bezos said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said why don't Microsoft's hundreds of millions of users  support Microsoft against the against attacks.  They don't they don't have any, you know, it's there's a few  and I know this because we hear from all time Microsoft fanboys  but in general Microsoft's user base is indifferent to Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's that hasn't always been the case.  I mean, you know people used to line up for the new version  of Windows.  I mean, you know people that the Microsoft discussion was was  heated.  I mean it was a much bigger thing and I think that Google  is moving toward, you know movie shifting from the company  that you love toward a company.  Maybe you fear.  I mean Amazon is a company you love because they bring you  the things that you need to your door, right?  I mean that's that's that's pretty straightforward and  Google's products are amazing and I can and I'm to the point  where I couldn't live without them.  But there is a creeping even for me who is very informed and  talks about this every every week.  I think like hmm.  You know, I could I imagine, you know, could I go Google free?  I don't know that I could at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, as I as I you know, I said recently I am completely  Apple free except for Skype.  The only reason I'm still on a Microsoft product or an Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  product is you don't look at me because we have because those  products work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're whining about hangouts, well, there's work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here here here is from the book here is here's what Bezos  wrote rudeness.  So he talked about cool and not cool that some things are cool  customers consider cool Apple Whole Foods Costco Nike and  Google others get piled on rather than definitive things  go badly think Microsoft Goldman Sachs Exxon Mobil and  Walmart.  He says the things that are cool young risk-taking winning  polite defeating bigger unsympathetic guys inventing  explorers.  These things are all what Google is right now, right?  Empowering others leadership conviction straightforwardness  that's something Google could do.  I think they do very well but continue to do that.  He says pandering to the crowd is not cool hypocrisy is not  cool.  Authenticity is cool thinking big is cool unexpected is cool  trust is cool trust is really going to be the big one for  Google.  He does you know, there is no trust on this list which there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ought to be humanity is the word that comes to mind for me  and I guess that that tells with authenticity.  There's a there's some products and glass comes to mind  particularly like there's a there's a little bit of a sense  that Google's a cold bot who's very efficient and very good at  what it does, right?  But there there's there's I think.  Humanity is is is I think is is the if you break down human

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I think you break down humanity in a sense the  problem for Google is that they've given you all this great  free stuff and then we say, okay now what are you doing for  us?  Right and they want to drive your car incredible incredible  free services maps and mail and all this stuff is unbelievable  for free and it's what have you done for me lately and and  so you need some human connection there.  I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you know, why are you giving this for free?  Yeah, I am from Brooklyn.  You want something for me?  I yeah, you're giving me something.  I'm thinking that you need something to turn.  It's the cat.  Hey, what's the cat exactly exactly?  So, you know, they want to drive your cars and they want  to get everybody online.  They want everybody online.  They want to put you know, a screen in front of your face,  you know, there's and I think the perception about those  things even though they're highly efficient.  I'm totally sold on the benefits of a self-driving car,  but it feels I think the people like, you know, which take  it, you know, taking away taking the humans out of out  of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what Google needs to do more than anything else.  I think is communicate why they want you know, what what's  what's the deal?  Why do you want this?  What are you doing with it?  Communicate be honest.  Tell me what it is so I can make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's remember back to conversations.  We had on the show about a year ago where we all said we  trust Google.  We kind of don't trust Facebook.  Now right now Facebook just spent 16 billion dollars to buy  users and I haven't heard yet of what's Facebook up to?  Right.  I'm not I'm not hearing.  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know why that a lot.  Right.  I know I do but not right today with this announcement.  Otherwise, Zucks.  I just put it up in the rundown sucks announcement is up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, let me find that you can opt out of Facebook and I know  that's not true for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the argument here was you couldn't the argument a year  ago and Schmidt made was that you could opt out of every  single Google service.  You could use being you could use hotmail.  You could use all these other services.  But if your friends were on Facebook, you couldn't opt out  of Facebook.  What's changed?  I think is that your friends aren't all on Facebook anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're everywhere.  That's true.  I guess for me like I can dip into Facebook once a week once  every couple of weeks and catch up with who I want to and  then come out of it, right?  Google is a part of the fabric of every single interaction  I have on the web on every web page with Google Analytics.  So every Google product Gmail, I mean, you know, and I've  opted into I realized that I can, you know, run my own IMAP  server email server.  Sure.  But but you know, I went for the convenience over, you know,  over, you know, kind of rolling on my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm hearing you say is your you depend upon Google and that  vulnerability utility.  Yeah, so there's a vulnerability there.  That you need they need to understand and deal with they  need to reassure you.  They need to go over the top reassuring you because you are  so dependent upon them as am I.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz I had that whole thing.  Oh, you could you could use Bing you could just you know,  incognito window you could you know, I don't know.  It doesn't it kind of rings hollow for me at this at this  point.  I mean, I guess I could use being I've been using duck duck  go for quite some time.  I often switch over to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I couldn't I couldn't use I have to use Gmail.  I have to use Google Maps and ways I couldn't use  alternatives to those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right?  Yeah.  No, I'm on Drive.  Yeah, Drive and become really I'm on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd rather be on Android than iOS.  I'm certainly gonna go to Blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could run pure Android AOSP, you know, right?  Like I could run just Android without the Play Store and  everything else, right?  But it would be a completely different thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I for one welcome my new master.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like in a way I just want to relax.  Invite me to IO.  I just want to relax and let it let it let go.  Let Google just take me Google.  Be me to your island because I just you know, and I think a  lot of people probably rightly especially last week have  accused me of not paying attention to the threat posed  by Google.  What O'Malley talked about on Sunday on Twitter was well,  you know, maybe now they're harmless.  But at what point does this switch where they just and  then there's nothing you can do.  Well, but you can say that about about he says they're too  big.  No company should be allowed to be this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hate that argument.  I just despise that argument.  Then fine show me the statute that says big enough to big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it's it maybe he's not statutory, but I think that  his he says with power, you know, absolute power corrupts  power crops.  Absolute power crops.  Absolutely.  The bigger a company gets a more powerful gets inevitably  it will correct get corrupted and there just is a natural  size.  The company should not go beyond.  There's no statutory.  I don't know.  This is not a law.  I was but it might be a law of nature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has to do with other factors.  Not size alone.  Can I can a company not be too big?  What are we going to tell Google not to do?  I'm sorry.  You can't do maps anymore.  Well, if it can't do maps that it can't that's that's no,  no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't I'm not saying the government now has to come in  and say Google's too big but users could very reasonably  say I am not sure I want to really continue to support this  company because they have gotten to be a behemoth and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have too much of my information to it even for users sake.  I don't think is is size so they stop doing some functions.  That means it doesn't work as well.  I mean, I want maps to tie to my nest to tie to my mail to  tie to my Google Nest is the one that really I think the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  nest is the one that actually put people over the top.  Oddly, but I think I think it goes that now Google knows  when I'm home like yes, so yeah, I want that but I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they know anyway because your Android phone has your

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  location anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, I think that Google's you know, and I was there on  Friday and every time I'm there I come away only more  enthusiastic about the company because they're so friggin  smart and someone say ah, it's the problem.  They're too smart.  They're too big.  They're too smart.  Yeah, too big too smart.  No, it's but what the covers are starting to sound like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and Rand and this is objectivism, you know, hey,  they're successful.  They're big.  Let them run the world because they are good at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the same thing can be said about Americans.  That's true.  You'd be blown that have a way.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, let's let me read Mark Zuckerberg statement.  We're going to take a break.  We've got a lot more including the Google changelog coming  up.  But boy as always on this show, we just get in these  great conversations.  This has become the philosophic heart of the Twitter network  and I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.  Oh, it really is the thumbsucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's what's what this weekend thumbs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think we talk about big stories here.  Mark Zuckerberg, by the way, I would love to be able to  write a post on Facebook and 30 minutes later have 98,000  likes.  No, I'm sorry.  Ninety-five.  Maybe not.  He does have 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of his words is parsed and analyze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does have 25 million followers.  I'm excited to announce we've agreed to acquire WhatsApp  and their entire team will be joining us at Facebook.  He says they will stay the team product roadmap will remain  unchanged.  This team will stay in Mountain View.  WhatsApp will continue to operate independently within  Facebook.  Facebook Messenger will continue Facebook Messenger.  He says is widely used for chatting with your Facebook  friends.  What's app for communicating with all your contacts and  small groups of people since WhatsApp and Messenger serve  such different and important uses.  We will continue investing in both and making them each  great products for everyone.  Credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That makes less sense to me then if you're not going to  integrate the two.  What do you get?  You just they did that with Instagram and that much money  you can do with whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's your they did that with Instagram.  But what you're saying is we're not going to we're not  going to play on the synergy.  We're just going to run it eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going to integrate it eventually.  Eventually when everyone's memory and everyone's memory  is short and a few years down the road, they'll start to  integrate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says more than 1 million people currently sign up for  WhatsApp every day.  I bet today 2 million might sign up.  I just I just downloaded it again.  I had removed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unfortunately, there's no there's no Davos party.  So I'm not getting new on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The process by the way of signing out.  Let's run through it real quickly of signing up for  WhatsApp is actually very simple.  You download it.  You'll give it your phone number which I will do off the  air.  Not that it really matters.  All the people who hate me already have my phone number  and then I don't even remember my phone number.  So I think that's right.  And then it will send you a text message to verify apparently  WhatsApp gets permission to read your text messages much  like Facebook does and will automatically detect the SMS  coming in read it and say, okay got it and then not approve

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that update by the way Leo.  Did you really?  I had not.  Yeah, I had not.  After the show I went and saw that it was one of the one  of the ones that needed a permission.  Anyway, carry on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Carry on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way might mention that this is poor timing.  There are four according to Panda Labs for Android apps  that are malware and what they do is they sign you up for  paid SMS services.  One of them for instance is how to lose weight, you know on  your belly or something.  It's in Spanish so I couldn't read it exactly and then it  it signs you up for an SMS service gives you a quick okay  and you say, okay, these are very expensive paid SMS  services and the reason it can instantly validate you is  it goes and it looks in the WhatsApp listing the public  WhatsApp listing which has your phone number in there and  it can do that apparently by looking at your WhatsApp  information.  So WhatsApp is actually a security hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't find Leo Laporte on my WhatsApp.  I'm signing up right now.  Oh is that it?  I don't find Junior Drapani on here either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been there.  You don't?  I've been there.  Oh, you know, it depends what phone number of mine you have.  That's probably right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just phone number.  That's why I was several phones ago.  Why do I never call you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me do a different phone number.  I want to can I use now here's a question.  Can I use my Google voice number which would be the best  number to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if I want to talk to Gina.  I think it has to be your native number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so.  So Gina if I want to talk to you, I just search for you  and I don't find you by name.  I have to know your phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's Chad.  He's a young person.  Right.  Let's find out what he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can't you can use your Google voice number.  Okay.  Oh it did it.  It worked.  Yeah, it'll send you a text but sometimes it doesn't automatically  notice the text.  If that happens you can it'll give you a call and you'll  write down six characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that worked.  So I gave it my Google voice and it now says please provide  your name and an optional photo.  It knows my name of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now you're already on here Leo under some other number.  It says that at the moment you're sleeping.

You get a free year service and after that it's 99 cents a  year and you know, it doesn't really ask you for anything.  It just kind of goes out there and gets everything out of  your phone book and and fires away.  So it's very easy.  I think that's one of the reasons a million people a year  sign up for this thing.  Hey, let's let's take a break and we come back to  Google changelog or show today brought to you by  Shutterstock images.  Lisa just started a new blog and she was saying the other  last night.  She said I love Shutterstock.  Whenever we want to do a blog post, we like to have images  as part of our blog post.  Shutterstock is a source of great royalty-free images,  illustrations, vectors, video clips.  Over 30 million of them right now.  Very affordable.  You can try it for free by the way, and they have a great  app Android and iPad app, which is just almost like one  of those just great gorgeous photo apps, but they have the  fantastic search engine which lets you search not only for  nouns but for adjectives and nouns.  So you can search for happy hippos, cranky hippos, blue  hippos.  It is just a fantastic system.  You can sign up for free.  You don't need to give them a credit card and that means  you'll be able to search for images and save images into  a light box so you can share them with others, but you can  also buy packages of images or do what we do.  We have the subscription 25 images a day, which is great  for a company.  They add 20,000 images every day.  So there's always something new each reviewed individually  for content and quality.  I just love Shutterstock and I am multilingual.  It's truly international with service and support more  than a dozen countries full-time throughout the week.  Don't forget to click the footage tab.  We also have a footage subscription because we use it.  In fact, this is fun.  We use it a lot during our shows to do, you know, kind of  matte images and so forth.  There's always a free featured clip.  I am a big fan.  I want you to try Shutterstock.  We actually have a good deal for you.  Start the account.  You don't need a credit card to do that.  But if you decide to purchase images use the offer code  TWIG214.  That's for February 2014 obviously.  TWIG214 and you'll get 25% off any package including the  subscription package, which makes it a very good deal.  TWIG214 at Shutterstock.com and now break out the drums.  It's time for the Google changelog.  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The trumpets then the drums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Here's Gina Trepanne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're a big big Google Sheets user not as in like bedsheets  but spreadsheets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are 600 thread count sheets.  They know how you're sleeping Egyptian cotton sheets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They know how you're sleeping.  They know when you're awake.  You'll notice a link on the bottom right of your current  spreadsheets Google spreadsheets and Google Drive that says  try the new Google Sheets and update to the app which you  have to opt into in your settings lets you edit spreadsheets  while offline which is very nice scrolls and loads faster  and has other new features for spreadsheet users like new  filter views easier to use formulas advanced conditional  formatting.  You can't convert existing spreadsheets to the new version  which by the way, I tried to do to twigs run down today but  failed but you can opt into the new sheets for any new  spreadsheets that you make going going forward doesn't  look very different just acts different and just just  scrolls better is faster and works offline just kind of  nice.  The new Google Maps, which I had forgotten was new because  I've been trying it for a long time.  Now, this is the new Google Maps that Google announced at  the IO developer conference that has been in preview mode  this whole time.  Well, it's coming out of preview, you know, used to be  able to switch back and forth from classic to the new mode.  The new mode is now becoming the default.  It'll be the default PC Google Maps experience going forward.  And finally, and I haven't actually gotten this on my phone  yet, but Google's added detailed transit schedules to the  Google search app on Android.  So if you have the update and you tap the microphone on your  Google search app and you say from New York City to Boston  by train, for example, Google will display detailed information  of schedules and fares the request of destination and a  countdown timer that'll show you how long until the next train  or bus.  That's awesome.  It's kind of nice.  And if the train gets delayed, there's a maintenance issue  or an accident.  You'll see a status result a status alert and the results  much like Google Maps now alerts you if there's a faster  route on while you're on route.  This feature I think is limited to users in the US.  And like I said, I tried it on my phone.  I haven't gotten the update yet.  I tried from New York City to Boston by train and didn't get  it.  But just seeing Google search getting getting a little smarter  must be rolling out little little by little.  That's all I got pretty short change log today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the drums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's my friend Josh Benton on Twitter.  I saw there's already a WhatsApp commercial.  It's in the in the rundown.  I put it in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this real or just just just just all right.  All right.  Say, oh, hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's that?  Who's that?  What's that?  Yo, it's D.  Hello.  Yo, it's D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It still makes me laugh.  It's still a great commercial.  It is.  That's not the original one, but that's I hadn't seen that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one.  That's good.  There's also not that we want to keep on going.  But right above that and that chat is gets is description of  why it's worth this much money.  It's very good post from from Bernard gets the subway.  Jim gets from Sequoia.  Okay, this company has only 32 engineers.  Yikes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's because it's really like I mean, Gina, am I wrong?  This is a trivial application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is not about to yeah, it's not about the technology.  The company is not.  Yeah, it's this is not a difficult.  I mean, look at this.  This application certainly has some serious scaling issues,  but it's not non-trivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right.  Yes, but nine months ago it had 200 million active users.  Now it has one.  That was a double hundred fifty million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, 72% the network engineers are good.  I wonder though.  What does it run on?  Does it run?  Maybe it runs on Amazon services.  Maybe it's not maybe they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Erlang.  It's built in Erlang.  Erlang.  That's why only 32 engineers.  No one understands Erlang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're all from Erlang.  You can't find it even everybody that knows Erlang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is that is Erlang is tell us about Erlang.  Do you know anything about Erlang?  It's a functional is not I think it's a functional language.  It's very popular among a certain group of nerves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got that kind of a cult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a general purpose concurrent garbage collected  programming language and runtime system according to Wikipedia  designed originally.  I did not know this by Ericsson.  This is one of the reasons it scales because it's distributed  so and supports hot swapping so you can this is actually a  probably a perfect language for this particular application.  Erlang is a reference to a Danish mathematician and engineer  that no one's ever heard of.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The language doesn't matter either.  No, but it helps with scaling helps with scaling.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they have 99.9% uptime.  And that's another reason users love them.  They just don't go down.  50 billion with a B messages a day across seven platforms.  I'm not sure what that means.  That sounds like they're aggregating perhaps Rackspace  and Amazon and Azure and no that means that means that  those seven seven host platforms.  Okay.  Yeah, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, clients like Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Windows.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Android iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  WhatsApp does not collect personal information that may  change registration is authenticated with a phone number  once delivered messages are deleted from WhatsApp servers.  Wow.  They had grown to dislike their time at Yahoo.  So they that's why they hate ads so much.  They didn't like targeted ads.  So they charged a buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cost more than a buck to run that's per user to run that  server.  Well, not a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But initially they don't do they have a business model.  They didn't have any business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Yan grew up in Russia under the Soviets.  He arrived in the US as a 16 year old immigrant living on  food stamps with the extra incentive of wanting to stay  in touch with his family in Russia and the Ukraine.  His mentor was Brian at Yahoo.  And that's when he began to build WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's a good story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I really curious what the network platform is.  God Sequoia has got to be happy.  Oh, million dollar investment.  You guys work for Sequoia.  They're nodding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, party is Sequoia tonight, baby.  One WhatsApp dev supports 14 million active users a ratio  unheard of in the industry says Sequoia's tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now that's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were so anxious to shun the spotlight.  There isn't even a WhatsApp sign outside their offices in  Mountain View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like the secret Japanese restaurant that's there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  You know, having used WhatsApp for a long time and I don't  really have a compelling use case.  That's probably why I don't use it.  It is easy.  Straightforward.  It just works.  It's reliable.  Do you use a chat on a regular basis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, not on a regular basis.  But it's one of those products that every once in a while you  find that niche for a weekend or a convention or something  like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like Davos.  Every time I'm at Davos, I use WhatsApp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to quote my I just I emailed my son Jake and I  said, do you use it much?  I didn't email him.  I WhatsApp him.  And I said, do you use it much?  He said not much just for group messages.  Definitely not worth 16 Instagrams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now here's you'll like this Gina on their WhatsApp.com  slash open source page.  They contribute back into the Erlang project, which is open  source free BSD JQ grid, which is an Ajax enabled JavaScript  control lib phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much cast is Twitter have?  Could Twitter?  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I doubt it.  Even with their very successful IPO IPO.  I doubt they'd have 16 billion to throw around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't seem like it would be the right fit for Twitter.  No, no, by the way, if you read Zucks post, the implication

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was a lot of people recording WhatsApp.  He's you know, he says I can't remember the exact words, but  they had a lot of choices every option in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm thrilled that they chose to work with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, ours is great.  It's worth supporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The queue is still in this list by the way, but that's  because the queue might have given way to a console set top  box.  We've been hearing rumors about that.  This would be the crib sheet for going to Google I o.  Why don't I make a bingo sheet of all of this and when we go

They went to the explorers groups there and they discussed  you know, let's start talking about the norms here and this  does go to this trust question in a way.  Yeah, Google should take a lead role in these kinds of trust  issues and say hello folks.  Don't be an idiot even though I think it's very close to  insulting us to say well, I know I don't take it into the  bathroom Nick Bilton and take a picture of your junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a lot of GoPro proposals by the way, Steve Perlman.  We know the name creator of Web TV, right?  And Moxie what else did he's done a lot of interesting things.  He's been working on a wireless broadband technology called P cell.  He's a guy who did on live right and that and then sold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  And what was it Andreessen was was singing his praises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, brilliant guy.  P cell will enable according to Perlman full speed wireless broadband to every  mobile device remark regardless of how many users are using the same spectrum.  The startup is Artemis networks.  They've been working apparently for a long time on this.  P cell will enable mobile data users to enjoy fast internet with no congestion  congestion dead zones weak signals.  I wonder if it's a spread spectrum.  He says you'll feel like you're on fiber the compatible with LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The New York Times today was that companies can't put cells too close together  because they conflict right and what this technology does.  Is make that an advantage and it passes off in smarter ways and you don't have  to change your phone.  You can still you will still be able to use it in your same phone because on LTE,  right?  So so you know, here's a bit about this here Steve in his lab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are six computers all streaming high-def video at the same time in the  same space on a single cell size show you that by using actual lab radios

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  instead of using, you know, a LTE radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To met his videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See I need P cell is frozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 1080p video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't play it back off certain things built into LTE like for example,  error correction.  So if there are any imperfections, you'll see them because we want to show you  them.  All right, and you can see that each of these PCs back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is his bid if he can do this apparently in his lab.  He's shown iPhones playing back 4k Ultra HD versions of House of Cards.  They're putting P cell transmitters on 350 rooftops in San Francisco.  And now of course they'd have to sign up other folks.  I guess if it works, it won't have any trouble doing that because we want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  show you works on your computer.  And you can see that each of these I get like an 800 year old Mac.  These are tablet PCs.  We're just not complaining.  We're gonna bring in my picture that allows us to go and be exactly Dennis

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really cool Google search feature, which made a brief appearance last year and then went away,  is back.  It's the Google Timer.  So I use that the other day.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll admit I'm a bit of a timer crazy person,  particularly when I need to work on something that I'm procrastinating.  I'll set a timer for 30 minutes and just make myself work on that thing.  You're obnoxious.  I love you, but you're obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

So then I try to time myself to see how close my estimates are.  I know.  I know.  I have a whole spreadsheet,  but this timer feature is back.  In order to set a timer in the search box, you just say set a timer for 30 seconds and you'll see in the  one box, a giant timer come up.  You'll watch it kind of live countdown.  Let's try it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  You can do set a timer for an hour and a half set a timer for 30 seconds timer.  There you go.  So you got a 30 second timer counting down there.  You can full screen it.  So there's that button on the right.  Yeah.  If you go, if you go full screen, it's just a giant timer, which is actually really useful.  If you're doing presentations, yeah.  Yeah.  Google, Google, don't they project the timer up on the wall at on certain in certain meetings or  certain big meetings where people are getting up and doing short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  There you go.

Transcript:  That was weird because I couldn't stop it.  I didn't see it.  Maybe I just didn't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Full screen timer.  So it defaults to five minutes.  So if you do set a timer, it'll just be it'll be five minutes and you don't have to be as  obnoxious as me.  You can use it actually for presentations or for for your students Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cool.  Cool.  Does it work on mobile too?  Okay, Google now set a timer for 30 seconds.  See, I think the problem if I use Google now it will do it with the alarm application.  Right?

Transcript:  Google timer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now ladies and gentlemen, we give you a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The number this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, by the way, I just Jake said to me then in WhatsApp that it's mainly international  and Rafa Ali, the founder of Skift and Paid Content said that it's a number.  Skift and Paid Content said that every one of his relatives in India is on WhatsApp.  That's what that's where this is big, but I'll use a different number.  A new study from Ohio's Wright State University finds that one of every 13 tweets includes  in English includes a curse word.  Most of them, of course, mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the rest of them have Justin Bieber in them.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So users swear the most on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  Men swear more than women, though everyone swears more around their own gender and F bombs  are far and away.  Twitter's curse word of choice.  That's not a curse word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's we got it.  We have to build a sync up in sight.  That's an emphatic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You do you do a chart of naughty language usage exists.  It's a Washington Post clip that's on there, Gina.  So yes, I think I think you you have to stick your usual cheery.  Hey good for you.  You're going to have to have a no.  F yeah.  Wash your laptop out with soap young man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So no, because as it's good show it you could show it if you have children have covered  their eyes right now.  There's no no, it's not that sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a link on there Chad where it says the code next paragraph down right there.  Okay, everybody close your eyes.  F word is more than double the s word which is about equal to the a word which is little  over the B word which is little over the n words.  Now they include hell is a bad word.  I would not but hell beats whore and I think that dick Costello would not like the fact  that his name is considered a curse word.  Dick Costello is in there.  The Costello is a curse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You cost a low you know Costello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I don't what's this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good list.  Just give me that list.  I don't care about the graph.  What's puta?  That means you don't know that you don't speak Spanish.  Oh damn prostitute woman of the evening or man of the evening.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey pomodoro.  Quasi cosi pomodoro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, that's a good number.  That's a good number.  That one that one wins excellent number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should impose.  So I just got this in the mail.  I got a couple of things to show you.  What is this?  A lot of people been asking me about Republic Wireless.  This is a an interesting play.  They offer Moto X phones.  It's the only phone they offer but that's actually a pretty good phone if you ask me and  that they've done is they've integrated Wi-Fi calling into the into the phone app in such  a way that when you're in a Wi-Fi area as I am it'll make a Wi-Fi call and then it'll  use cell if you're outside of the Wi-Fi area and by doing so they have very affordable  plans if you don't need the cell coverage at all, which they get from Sprint by the  way, it's five dollars a month and the phone I should check.  I mean the prices go up and down all the time, but sometimes as little as as free.  They have a ten dollar monthly plan that includes unlimited cell talk and text but no  data for 25 bucks a month.  You get unlimited 3G data for 40 bucks a month unlimited 4G data and you always get unlimited  Wi-Fi talk.  So this is a really interesting idea for affordable plans.  Now I just got this today.  So I haven't had a chance to use it, but it is a stock Moto X.  They only have black and white alas, but I think this is a really interesting idea and  I'd sure like to I'd sure like to see this take off this do well right now $200  and I think this is unlocked $299 unlocked.  So I shall let you know but an interesting play and I'm also going to be reviewing this.  This is a new Sony Xperia an Android phone for T-Mobile only.  There's a 20 megapixel camera with a Sony processing.  It's the Xperia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that the one that has the no, they don't have a Z1A edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be nice?  But I shall give you I shall give you a review.
