I'll introduce first our regulars, Jeff Jarvis from CUNY, the City University of New York  and blogger at BuzzMachine.com and the author of a fabulous book on Google.  I'm going to give you all the plugs now, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would Google do?  I've been upstaged but properly so.  You're going to get upstaged here in a second.  We'll explain.  Somebody who actually reported as opposed to me, I just blathered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That laugh of course is Gina Tripani from SmartAware.org.  Buzz Machine is Jeff.  SmartAware.org.  Hi Gina and think up.  Hi.  How's it going?  It's going great.  Really glad to be here because we have a fantastic guest on the line, Mr. Steven Levy who is  an immortal in the computer book realm.  He wrote the classic Hackers which I'm very pleased and proud to say it was reissued by  O'Reilly last year and I got an autographed copy in my little hot little hands.  One of my favorite books of all time.  Let the squeeing begin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let the squeeing begin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The new book is called In the Plex.  As you say, Jeff Jarvis, it is a reportage.  Steven actually, the modern word I guess is it was embedded at Google.  Were you embedded at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To some degree.  I spent a lot of time there and got access to literally anyone I wanted to talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was amazing.  How come they were so helpful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a couple things.  One is that they knew me.  I've been covering them a long time almost since the start for when I was in Newsweek.  Also, I think that at this point they think they have to open up a little more.  I think that they feel they've been maybe too secretive and now that a lot of trust  issues have opened up, they thought it was to their advantage to let someone in and explain  how things went in a little more depth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they try to strong arm you at all and convince you?  Did they spin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, originally, Elliott Schrag, who was the head of PR when I was negotiating the  terms here, said that if I gave Google approval over everything in the book, they would give  me a badge, but I thought that wasn't too good a deal.  Good for you for turning that down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody's going to buy a book that says approved by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happened was kind of the opposite.  I got so familiar with the place and people knew that I was seeing things that journalists  weren't allowed to see because everything was embargoed until the book came out.  We would wind up gossiping very quickly into an interview and they would talk to me more  like a peer than a journalist there.  So it turned out to be great that I was there so much and everyone knew that I was doing  this inside book so they felt free to talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what happens with cameras too.  Eventually people just get used to it and they kind of forget and they just...  And it had been several years, right, Stephen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When did you start researching the book in earnest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I started the intense research in June 2008.  So just by the time I started it wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So it's been quite some time.  So folks were just used to having you around.  You were kind of one of them during all that time.  I mean, it shows in the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just leave you there so we can keep talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is great in the sense that you've got quotes, you've got conversations,  you've got stories about things that we were covering from the outside,  from the inside looking in and that makes it so much fun and so interesting.  I confess I haven't finished the book.  I'm still about in the middle of it.  I should have gotten the audiobook edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You didn't get the China chapter yet.  That's my favorite part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about it because we were sitting here covering that from the outside  and starting with that December, infamous December meeting between Eric and Larry  over what to do about China.  Were you privy to what was going on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was the end of it.  And I have to say that there were things they didn't let me in on.  And one thing is they didn't invite me into their war building.  They usually have war rooms to handle crises.  But in this case, they did a whole building of people in crisis mode  after that break in in 2009, late 2009.  But that was just the end of this long process,  which I felt was leading to their inevitable pullout anyway.  They got increasingly uncomfortable with the original terrible compromise  they made to censor.  And there was actually after the Olympics in 2008, when China didn't let up,  there was a rump group of executives within Google  who started to urge them to reconsider the policy.  So this was stuff was going on even before that break in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If there hadn't been a break in, would it have been a critical mass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think eventually it would have.  Some people at Google disagree with me, but it just got more and more untenable.  China kept asking for more and more and more.  And the competition with Baidu was always going to be tilted.  And there was cultural gaps on top of that.  So I don't know, maybe they would have stumbled over for a longer period of time.  But certainly there were a lot of people at Google  that were increasingly unhappy with this compromise.  They thought that they were going to change China.  They thought that the justification for this compromise,  censoring the search engine, was that they would give more information to China.  And they would say when they censored things,  the people they felt would push back against the government and then demand.  We knew more information.  Stop censoring Google.  But it went in the opposite direction.  China was actually asking them to censor the search engine outside of China  in the Chinese language.  So if you searched in New York City for Tiananmen Square,  you wouldn't get any information about the protests.  You would just get happy bureaucrats and tourists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of ironic because one of the things I learned in the book  that I did not know was that Google was going to buy Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happened?  Yeah.  They bought Gizmo instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  When eBay wanted to move it, Google was just about to buy it.  They were having a meeting to give the final approval.  But one product manager, the guy who bought Grand Central  and was developing Google Voice, a really colorful guy named Wesley Chan,  devised a plan to sabotage the purchase during the meeting.  He sort of sandbagged it, made it look like he and other executives were on board.  He got Sergey on his side and Salar Kamandjar,  who's a very powerful figure at Google, a lot of people don't know.  And halfway through the meeting, he started pulling up all these questions  and it turned out the questions had no answers,  like who was going to take charge of it and other things.  And then he started pointing out all the negatives of it.  And by the end of the meeting, Sergey just said, this is terrible.  And actually, here's the worst word in that.  And Eric said, that's it.  And by the end of the meeting, the purchase was tanked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we wouldn't have Skype 5 maybe if it had happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you sound great now, Jeff.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might not have Google Voice if it happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank God we have Google Voice.  I love Google Voice.  But you do describe their management style,  Larry and Sergey's management style as kind of ad hoc.  In fact, there's a quote in here I'd love to find  that basically says that Larry is just shy and doesn't want to talk to anybody,  has no people skills, and Sergey has people skills,  but he's very arrogant about people who are not as smart as he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a quote from actually an ex-Googler about them.  And it's interesting.  Larry, he is not a very extroverted person,  but when he's in his comfort zone, he's very articulate and fun even.  When you see him at his TGIFs, the meetings they have every Friday afternoon  where all the employees get to ask any question of Larry and Sergey  and the other executives, he's very relaxed.  And he and Sergey banter.  It's almost like Hope and Crosby make jokes there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is out of the book, but what do you think of Larry taking over?  Was that a shock when Eric Schmidt stepped down and Larry took over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have been a big shock if it was someone besides Larry, I'll tell you that.  Then I found out about this literally the last weekend.  I can make changes in the book before it got shipped off to the thinner there.  I was very relieved it was Larry because I realized  looking through the book, it almost pours out of it  because Larry's values are really the Google values there.  Sergey also describes these values,  but it's really Larry with his obsession with speed and scale and ambition.  He'd take on big projects who really is the soul of Google.  It wasn't really surprising that after 10 years of not being CEO,  a job he never wanted to give up,  that he would come back at a time where Google really has to launch a fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How good a job?  What I said was that Schmidt was the Prince Regent  and we forgot, but always knew it was his job to train the true owners to take over.  Did he do a good job of training Larry?  Do you think that you sense growth in Larry over time?  How will he do as CEO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think in some aspects he'll do fine.  I really like some of the reorganization changes he's made,  but I think I would have hoped that he would have realized straight out the gate,  maybe he'll realize this eventually,  that now that he's the CEO, he can shut out the world.  He has to explain what he's doing and he has to really see  that one important product that Google is,  in addition to the important products like Android and search and ads,  is the public perception of Google there.  He can do a lot to shore that up by being transparent,  by being more of a public person.  Not totally, he doesn't have to be out as much as Eric was,  but maybe take some questions on an earnings score or something like that.  And so far it seems like he's resisting that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think he could do it?  Some people just can't or it took a long while, for example, for Zuckerberg to learn how to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think just like Mark has learned to do it, Larry can do it.  The times I've interviewed him when I finally nailed him down to the table  and said let's do the interview, he does just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're talking Stephen Levy, he is the author of a brand new book that is being widely praised.  I've loved it so far.  It's really a great story, In the Plex,  how Google thinks, works and shapes our lives.  And he literally was in the Plex and got amazing access to everybody at Google.  Brand new from Simon and Schuster, we're going to take a break, come back with more.  There is some Google news, but I think really we should take advantage of this chance to talk to  Stephen and get some more juicy gossip, frankly.  Yes.  That's all I care about.  Before we get to the juicy gossip, let's talk about squarespace.com,  the secret behind exceptional websites.  I am a big Squarespace fan.  We put our Twit blog inside that twit.tv on Squarespace and I can't tell you what an easy,  simple platform it is.  One of the needs that we had was for multiple users, multiple editors,  and Squarespace handles that so elegantly.  Now it's hosting plus software, some of the best content management software out there.  That's the wrong picture.  Let me show you what a good job they did with our blog.  One of the nice things about it, of course, is that Squarespace is very flexible in terms of templates.  Every Squarespace site looks different.  We use the Twitter widget to incorporate our tweets in there.  They've got Flickr widgets, other social media widgets, Facebook, of course.  It makes it very simple to design a site that looks unique,  has all of the features and elements you want.  It doesn't have to be a blog.  It could be, in fact, a lot of businesses use it for their business site.  If you don't have a website yet, your Facebook page doesn't count.  You need to have a website you own.  That's where Squarespace is so great.  It starts at $12 a month, but you could try it free right now.  If you go to squarespace.com slash twig, click that big green button.  You won't need a credit card.  You won't need anything but the name of your site, a password, an email address, and enter this capture.  Now you're setting up a site using all the features of Squarespace.  They're great iPad and iPhone application for posting content and moderating content.  Here's some of the amazing sites.  They just all look different.  But I think if you're going to give the...  If there's a quality of Squarespace sites, they always look fresh and clean and simple  and easy to use.  There's just something about it.  They also are always very responsive.  And one of the reasons they're so responsive is because Squarespace does the hosting with  some very sophisticated virtual hosting based on the Java network.  That means there's always bandwidth available for you.  I want you to check it out right now, free for the next two weeks.  Just go to squarespace.com slash twig and find out about all the great features that make  Squarespace a unique platform for you.  Not just your blog, but your photo gallery, your e-commerce, whatever you're doing on  the web.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support.  This week in Google, Stephen Levy is here today.  It's so nice to have Stephen.  Not only respected journalists both at Newsweek, now at Wired,  but also the author of a brand new book called In the Plex.  Jeff Jarvis and Gina Trapani also.  I've been hogging Stephen.  Go ahead.  You guys can.  Okay.  You can ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a question.  Stephen, I know that John Battelle asked you about your opinions of things in the book  and you said that you didn't try not to editorialize too much and that you just kind of laid the  facts out.  That's what I love about the book.  Anyone who listens to the show should read this book.  It's just so dense and has so many great quotes.  But I had to ask, do you think that Google...  Yeah, at one point in the book, there's the phrase Facebook panic.  There's a reckoning at Google that they have to kind of take on social.  Do you think that Google has the capability to do that?  They're so good at search and data, but they don't seem so good at people.  What's your take on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and there's been a litany of failures in the social space.  Not one thread to say this was wrong with every single social thing they did.  Each one had a different problem.  Maybe one thread going through it is that Google doesn't really stick with products  when they don't take off right away.  It's sort of a corporate ADD, which leads them to go on to the next thing.  And they're so enamored of the idea that if they fail every so often,  that shows they're trying hard, that maybe they don't work hard enough sometimes  to turn failures into successes.  But in terms of whether they can do it, I think there's nothing generic in their DNA  which says they can't do it.  They actually bring a lot of assets to bear to build a social product.  It's just that it's harder to do now.  And it is true that it's not Google's strength to catch up to someone.  I talked to one of the product managers for one of the earlier social products.  It said, we're not good at chasing tail lights.  We're good at going forward when there's no one out ahead of us  and we're ahead of everyone else.  But drunks chase tail lights.  So that's really not our natural strength.  Drunks and dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, what they need to do is not chase Facebook's tail light,  but to do something better, to innovate in social,  do something better in social than Facebook does right now.  And I think it seems like they're struggling with that.  And it also does seem like they throw things against the wall  and maybe not follow up as much like Buzz and My Beloved Wave.  But that's kind of one of the problems with becoming so big, right?  It's like, if you don't have an immediate success,  it seems like a failure and then you kill it and try something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I talk about this new initiative and they allow me to say its name in here,  officially.  It's called Emerald SIG.  This is a massive initiative in Google and you're not going to see it all at once.  And you see now things which I think Google identifies  as coming from their social initiative like social search  or recently the plus one button, right?  And they're running this thing differently than they've done their previous products.  It's more of a top down organized effort that's thought out more coherently there.  So let's see what happens there.  The idea isn't to kill Facebook.  The idea, and this is me talking, not what they said to me,  is that I think that what Google really wants is to bring Facebook to the table.  It just makes Google crazy that people share all this information with Facebook  about who they're in contact with and what their interests are and what they're doing.  And Google can't get at that.  That's very good information for Google, not just in a social sense, but in a search sense.  And I think what Google feels is that they could get an equally important corpus of social  information.  Maybe they can get Facebook to the table,  where it would be to the advantage of both companies to sit and share with each other.  Now as a user, I think it's just ridiculous that Facebook doesn't share this information  and Google might, in a peak, not give Facebook information in retaliation  because this is our information here.  So I don't like the idea of any of these big companies saying  they can't, we can't easily export our information when we choose  to any other site where that information could be useful.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's very true.  But I've been arguing that the war between the two and others will be over signal generation,  signals about us that Google clearly uses to target content and service and advertising  to us and Facebook and Facebook right now is a far better signal generator.  So that is the goal, that is the fleece.  I think it could be given up quite reluctantly.  The other problem is that I think that, well, ironically, put it this way, maybe,  Facebook could hide behind privacy.  Google wants us to share stuff and we wouldn't do that.  You would agree, portability is our right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But here's Google's strength.  Google or Facebook, you're right, is a great signal generator,  but Google is a much better signal interpreter.  Right.  Well said.  Well said.  Yeah.  So it knows how to take information and rank it much better than Facebook can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't really strike me that Facebook has any interest in that.  I mean, maybe they recognize that, but it seems like the Facebook attitude is,  well, we could do that.  Whatever Google could do, we could do better.  So what do we need them for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steven, you know, Eric has said for a few years now,  whenever he's asked what Google's biggest challenge is, he says size.  Gina just brought that up in terms of size.  I'd love to have your perspective, not just from the past,  but from where you think it goes in the future,  about how hard it's going to be to manage the size of Google in terms of,  A, getting much bigger faster,  B, figuring out how to get past the mistakes that they do make now,  and right-hand, left-hand kind of mistakes.  See what it's like for people to work there.  Does it feel like a big oppressive company to some now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you've identified it.  I think Larry is actually much more worried about that than Eric was.  Even though Eric might have identified his number one problem,  Larry is obsessed with making Google feel like a flatter company.  And I think what's behind that reorganization he just did,  that Google really hasn't formally put out a blog item about,  has acknowledged that the reports that first appeared in the LA Times  are accurate, that he broke this down to these product groups.  Kind of a gang of six.  Yeah, and that the czars of these various divisions are now working together  in a clear line of demarcation to be able to clear away maybe some middle management  and problems there.  It is a huge problem for Google,  and especially since they're going to hire 6,000 more people this year.  They've already hired the first 2,000.  So they've gone from 24,000 to 26,000.  Just this year, they'll be at 30,000 at the end of the year.  And what really makes this really hard for Google  is that Google selects people who have an intolerance for bureaucracy.  The kind of people they'd love to hire most are people who are hard-charging people  who really hate it when they're frustrated by management  to block them to do what they want to do.  They're the kind of people that say,  I'm out of here when they run into these Dilbert situations.  And some of these are inevitable in a big company like that.  And that's one reason for Google's brain drain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google has this thing called an OKR you talk about in here.  Is that their attempt to handle bureaucracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one of them.  And I found that Google has a number of these systems internally,  which are huge for people at Google,  but never really discussed with the outside.  OKRs is something that stands for Objective Key Results.  And it's something invented by Andy Grove and John Doerr brought it into Google.  But Google embraced it like no other company has.  So every Googler, for every quarter and every year,  they set these goals for themselves.  They're all measurable.  Everything has to be measurable at Google.  And at various times during the quarter, they stop and they sit down with people  and they say, how am I doing my OKRs?  For instance, when you're working on the Chrome browser,  your OKR might have been, we need a million users of Chrome by November.  And you see how you're doing on that.  One interesting thing about it is if you meet all your OKRs,  all your goals, then you're not really not being Googley.  You haven't set your goals high enough.  So upper level meeting is about two thirds of your OKRs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've got to really titrate your OKRs.  That to me is the epitome of a bureaucracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Six by, that's a good, you know, making your OKRs.  And one interesting thing is that everyone could get the look at everyone else's OKRs.  On the internal website, it has this amazing transparency within the company  that we don't have from without the company.  Google's like a lobster.  It's hard on the outside and soft on the inside.  And so you can look at Larry and Sergey's OKRs and see what their goals are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. Sounds a little bit like TPS reports, I'm sorry.  It's exactly the kind of thing that would chase me right out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I visited the campus and was in the Gmail area, I was struck by they had these giant  monitors all around.  And if there was any bug that was blocking the next release of Gmail,  the developers photo and the issue number and whatever the description was showed on the monitor.  And I remember thinking like, my God, as a developer, you know, that's quite a motivation.  But there was this like transparency and yeah, I'm blocking the build.  I got to fix that bug.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stephen, I still want to hear.  Well, let me put it this way.  Do you think it's still a fun place to work?  Would you want to work there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for what I do, I'm not an engineer, so I wouldn't have as much fun.  But, you know, in a lot of ways, it's fun.  The people who really still get a huge satisfaction from it are the those computer scientists  that are still pushing what can be done.  Google still wants to do more and more and more with big data and machine learning and  other computer science issues there.  So that's why a lot of the key people they hired, great computer scientists,  you know, five, six, seven, eight years ago are still with the company.  And I think it's interesting that of those gang of six you talked about,  a couple of those people have been there since almost the very beginning of Google.  And they had to essentially re-enlist.  They had to recommit to a few more years.  So that's something about their belief in Larry that these people who are richer than God by now,  they can do whatever they wanted, have decided, yeah,  I'm going to spend the next few years of my life working with Larry Page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's been some brain drain.  There's a great quote I'm trying to find in here about Facebook from somebody who left  Google for Facebook and it's saying that Facebook is the thing, is the real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Facebook is that company.  That's the, it was almost like a taunt to his former colleagues.  He sent an email out and saying, well, you know, you guys are working  for the horse and buggy company now.  Right.  Yeah, because we're going, I'm going to that company.  Interestingly, that guy has already left Facebook.  It wasn't that company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Google has had to deal with that kind of a brain drain.  But it isn't, you're right.  It's absolutely telling the Vic Gundrothra and Andy Rubin.  What about Marissa Meyer?  What do you think is your sense of what happened to her?  She was not in that gang of six.  Nor was local at one of the six categories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, in theory, I think an explanation I heard sort of secondhand was the old Jeff  Huber, who's in charge of local.  He's more of an engineering guy and versus more of a product person.  I haven't sat down and talked with her about that, but I actually feel that Google,  this is one reason I think you really have to put out some explanation about a press  release, a blog item.  You talk to a friendly journalist, right?  And because that way you could protect the employees that look like they got a bad deal  out of the reorganization and you can make an explanation about that.  Right now, it's sort of hanging people out to dry who people expected would have been  in that group.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You still got a lot of brilliant people in Google who are not in that group, but people  like Peter Norvig and others who are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, no, it's not all the smartest people there.  For instance, in search, there's one guy who's sort of like the Yoda of Google.  Ahmed Singal, who's just an amazing person.  He was my transcriber's favorite subject.  I did maybe like at least four long interviews with him as he tried to get through my thick  head how Google's search quality works.  He's an amazing guy and a terrific computer scientist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We quoted from the excerpt they published in Wired about Eric Schmidt asking if they  could remove some information about him from the Google index and being told by  Sheryl Sandberg that no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't Sheryl himself.  This was information that was given to me by the employee who actually got it.  Yeah, and it was relatively early in Eric's time.  The idea wasn't that he had made some political donation.  He didn't want anyone to know.  But I think that the context of the way she explained it to me was that her job was to  handle calls from people who couldn't understand why information that they considered personal  was coming up when people Googled them or they Googled themselves there.  So she had to deal with this every day.  People who had their address would be exposed to an ex-boyfriend or things like that.  She had to explain to them, as Larry and Sergey explained to her, that anything that's public,  we have in there, unless it's jing or illegal, we have to do this.  And then this call comes from Eric's office saying, you know, Eric wants you to get the  stuff out.  And she, I think, enlisted, according to her story, she enlisted Sheryl to back her up  when she went to Eric's office and said, we don't do that.  And Eric dropped the request there.  Now, Eric, I should say he wasn't very happy when this came out, even though I did try  to check it with him.  During the fact checking process, I checked about a million facts.  And for some reason, I guess this didn't get to him.  But he says, you know, I think he wants me to say this, as far as he's concerned, this  incident didn't happen.  But, you know, I have the person on the record that's saying it did.  So you can make your own decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Denise Griffin, who has since been replaced by a Python script, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think she was one of those people who retired very comfortably.  Before my book came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder how many millionaires Google has made, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even the masseuse was a millionaire, right?  Really?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the original cooks and the masseuse in the beginning.  I forget her name.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And more so now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. The stock keeps going up.  At one point, Larry and Sergey were absolutely besotted by Steve Jobs and even considered  making him the CEO.  I don't know if Steve considered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  It was when John Doerr and Mike Marge, the venture capitalists, who funded Google only  on the condition that they were going to get a CEO.  And then a few months afterwards, they tried to renege on the deal.  They called up John Doerr.  Doerr told me this himself and said, we decided we want to run the place ourselves.  So Doerr said, listen, just do this.  Why don't I put you together with a lot of great CEOs?  You'll see what an experienced CEO really does and how they can help build this company.  So they went on a tour of CEOs around Silicon Valley and up in Seattle.  At least they talked to Jeff Bezos.  And they came back and said, you're right.  We wanted an outsider for CEO.  We want Steve Jobs.  And that was about it.  Jesus, please.  Yeah.  And so then they convinced them to look at Eric and they liked that.  And I think that worked out to everyone's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Eric was exactly the right adult supervision.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think Eric's going to do next and when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, my personal guess is he'll stay there.  But if something great comes along, he might go off to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're talking to Stephen Levy, the new book In The Plex, a must read that is on Audible as well.  So we could say it's a must listen.  And I have one copy and everybody's trying to grab it for me.  Tom Merritt wants to read it.  Everybody wants to read this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are more on sale, Leo.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all about the Kindle.  I'm kind of a cheapskate.  This is the one the publisher sent.  So I got this one for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm learning to love DRM.  You can't learn to love DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stephen Levy learning to love DRM.  We will have more in just a bit.  But first, a little word from hover.com.  Hover is domain name registration made simple.  All you have to do is search the tweet stream for people who are saying,  Leo, thank you for telling me about hover.  There are some very happy people.  I got a tweet from somebody who said, oh, no, I'm having all sorts of trouble.  They're not very good.  And I watched because the hover Twitter person, the social media person,  responded immediately, got it solved, and that person ended up being just very,  very impressed, a very happy hover is the place to go.  If you want to register a domain name, if you have domains,  I would suggest moving them as I have to hover.com.  In fact, they will do that for you for free.  Normally, they charge $25 for the domain concierge service  where they do all the work for you.  You can do it for yourself if you want, but for 25 bucks,  they'll move all your domains, except when you tell them you heard it on twig,  they'll waive that fee even.  Now, they do charge $10 per domain that you move there,  but that gives you another year.  So it's extending it for another year for $10.  And the no upsell automatically built in free who is privacy  and a no hold policy for customer service calls during business hours.  You get a customer service rep, they will solve the problem,  and they will not put you on hold.  To get covered, the free customer service number, go to twig,  the free concierge customer, the free concierge transfer service.  There we go.  Go to twig.hover.com, and you'll see in the upper right-hand corner,  there is a phone number you can call and just say,  I heard it on twig, and they will absolutely do that all for you.  And I've talked to a couple of people who've done this,  and really, I wish I had done it.  It's really great.  Also save money on your registration when you use twig as the offer code.  So all in all, this is a good deal with a great registrar that makes it simple.  You see how clean it is?  This is what I like.  Not a lot of upsell.  Sorry, no sexy girls on the front page, just domain registration.  Isn't that what you're looking for?  Hover.  So nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that nice?  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twig, they don't spend a whole lot of money on television ads.  There's no Super Bowl ad.  They just good service.  And us, twig.hover.com.  It's our secret weapon for domain name registration, and we're just big, big fans.  So a couple of stories, and actually, Steven,  I'd love to get your reaction to these news stories.  For instance, it just broke this morning.  Yahoo sold delicious to YouTubers Chad Hurley and Steve Chen.  They left YouTube not so long ago.  But isn't Chad still at Google?  Oh, Chad's still there.  Steven left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Chad's more an advisory role now.  The CEO of YouTube is this amazing guy, Salar Camanja,  one person described to me as the secret president of Google.  He is a super influential person and a bright person,  but he makes Larry look extroverted.  He's very shocked in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've emailed him saying, why aren't we on YouTube Live?  And he's been very shy with me, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very sweet guy, very smart guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, good.  I'll tell him Steven sent me.  So I thought that was interesting, though.  I hope that they, I'm not sure why they bought delicious.  I know it was a good deal.  Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just thanked them for doing so.  Thank you.  Can they buy Flickr too?  Can they buy everything else that Yahoo's ruined?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was pocket change for them.  I think Yahoo was asking $2 million.  For delicious.  The company that Chad and Steven run is called AVOS at avos.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably a holding company.  I don't know.  Let's see.  About Us.  Let's see what it says.  It doesn't say much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just says that they acquired delicious.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Avos is a new internet company.  And we bought delicious.  And yeah, that's about it.  They spent, well, let's see.  They spent one one thousandth of the money that they got from Google for YouTube.  They could buy 999 other Yahoo products and properties.  Other stories.  Visa says we are going to, I guess, back with money.  Jack Dorsey's Square, which we've talked about before, is a really great product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which, I mean, the money is undetermined, but the more important thing in a way is that they're  going to back it as a service.  And that's wildly important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But of course, Square does take Visa cards.  So it doesn't add Visa cards to the Square capabilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It adds this credibility to it.  Yes.  Exactly.  We know the VeriSign, as you guys reminded me earlier, attacked them and sort of tried  to create fear and uncertainty and doubt that this was a safe way to do things.  So if Visa gets on board, then we know that this has the backing of it.  It's something that everyone can use and feel comfortable about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that.  You get this.  This is the Square device.  And they'll send this to you for free if you go to squareup.com.  And it goes into your Android phone or your iPhone into the, believe it or not, into the  audio jack.  So it's just really a little credit card reader.  It turns it into audio.  Then the Square, the free Square software sees the number and says, OK,  how much do you want to charge?  Believe it or not, into the audio jack.  Where am I getting my audio from?  Credit card.  It turns it into audio.  Then the free Square software.  That's from you, Stephen.  Did you suddenly turn on Twit?  It's usually me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, where is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where is that coming from?  You plug in your headphones.  So it's not VeriSign, it's VeriPhone.  I'm sorry.  Not Veri...  So I screwed you up, Stephen, by saying it was VeriSign.  It's VeriPhone.  Thank you to our chat room.  They're the company that was a little perturbed by Square.  I presume they're offering a competitive device.  There we go.  Can you still hear me?  Yeah.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm hearing an echo here from a couple minutes ago.  This is a little strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's coming in through your computer.  Make sure you don't have us running.  Like close your web browser.  Yeah, VeriPhone offers secure payment solutions for credit cards.  So they don't like this.  Anyway, this is a great little product.  I mean, I don't have any reason to charge anybody anything, but if I did, I would buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It kind of makes you want to come up with a reason to sell stuff.  It does.  I'm going to bring it to FooCamp.  I'm just going to take donations.  Yeah.  Want to give me money?  Give me money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we're going to sell bricks in the new studio.  We're going to have you could put your name on a brick for a hundred bucks.  Maybe I could just use this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll take it to FooCamp.  Get your name on a brick.  Get your name on a brick here.  Hundred bucks.  Get your name on a brick.  Let's see.  Square does sell it.  I'm hearing in the stores you can buy a Square device for 10 bucks, but then you get $10 credit.  So it's a good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which stores can you buy them?  Let me see.  Yeah.  Chat room saying that.  Is the Apple Store doing it now?  Apple Store.  That's right.  They're selling it.  That's right.  That's what it was.  Yeah.  Which is cool too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Visa, back square.  Let's see.  Google and Apple were summoned to a Senate hearing on mobile device privacy.  Of course, that's the big story that Apple got in trouble for.  Now Steve Jobs is saying, no, we were not tracking you.  We weren't bringing it to Apple.  We didn't really.  That was just, that was a mistake.  It was a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think the story was overblown.  However, it's just not hard to be transparent.  It's not hard to give people a choice.  It's not in Apple's DNA.  Yeah, boy, it's just we're doing this.  We're doing this for good reason.  You can cut it off.  It's your phone for God's sakes.  This is the same problem, Leo, when it comes to do not track is that we've all, you know,  the Wall Street Journal and folks like that have made, have so demonized the little cookie  that it could have a huge impact on the media business, on this very business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were talking on the security now about that and I hadn't really thought about it,  but if they enforce a do not track cookie, I don't know if the kinds of tracking that we do,  you know, when you download the podcast, whether you use iTunes,  Zoom or click directly on our website, if you notice the URL on all of the,  and everywhere that you get it, it is a redirect through our ad agency, PodTrack,  and that redirect basically is a tracking cookie.  It's not even a cookie.  It's just you send your IP address to PodTrack who adds it to a database  to make sure it's a unique address because advertisers don't want to pay for your 17 downloads.  So they only count it once.  That's why they have to track it.  But I think that's tracking.  And if the do not track setting in your browser prohibits that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I first blame the advertising and media industries for not being fully transparent  about this and just saying this is what we do.  This is why we do it.  It's a good reason.  It's how you get stuff free from the beginning.  So then that allowed the likes of the Wall Street Journal to demonize that.  And then in our new privacy industrial regulatory complex, along comes the FTC  and others trying to say, oh my God, we can make hay from regulating this and Congress.  And it turns into a spiral of unintended consequences.  And so Apple is hurting the industry by not having been more transparent about this.  Google is somewhat more transparent because it does make you opt in.  But in general, it's harmless and the industry should have let us know it was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stephen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with the transparency.  You really have to let people know exactly what the trade-offs are.  Now the trade-off is obviously different.  You just want to listen to this podcast and you're tracking it well.  Okay, I understand that's worth it.  But the question is, are people comfortable with the idea that they will be tracked wherever  they go on the web in order to get ads they hadn't seen before, ads that might be a little  more relevant to them and display ads when they go to a website?  Some people might think yes.  Some people might think no.  Likewise, some people might think it's worth it to let their phone send back information  about local Wi-Fi hotspots because that could help them locate themselves more accurately.  Apple also said, yeah, we're also getting information about traffic from there.  That's another way we're getting location information about people.  And that's a nice trade-off to say, yeah, I'll let the thing track me in traffic if I  can know the best route to take somewhere else.  So obviously, ultimately, the best thing to do would be say, hey, if you want good traffic  information, you have to share back.  You have to share back your traffic information and then we promise we won't keep it for a  long period of time.  One thing that came out in that Apple explanation was they said, oh, it was a bug that we kept  this for months and months and months.  We really don't have no really good reason to keep it for that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Google response to this, as quoted by TechCrunch, is all location sharing on Android  is opt-in by the user.  And we've all seen when you activate the Android phone, those two check boxes that say, and  by the way, Apple says, oh, we do that too.  They don't say it's location sharing.  They say, would you be willing to send anonymous user data back to Apple to improve our services?  But they say that's the check box for the iPhone.  Oh, BS to that.  Well, it is.  And if you look at the terms of service, it is in that 35 page terms of service.  We collect location information.  We share it with our advertisers, et cetera, et cetera.  Which everyone has read, of course.  Nobody's read, obviously.  Google says we provide users with notice and control over the collection, sharing, and  use of location in order to provide a better mobile experience on Android devices.  Any location data that's sent back to Google location servers is anonymized and not tied  or traceable to a specific user.  But the journal who quoted a security expert, Sammy Kamkar, says that the data provided  by Mr. Kamkar to the journal contained a unique identifier tied to an individual's phone.  It is not anonymous, probably something like the IMEI number.  But if Google's not keeping track of it, Google says that it doesn't save that unique  identification number.  But it's not a safe way.  As you pointed out, Leo, it's worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The phone company has all this and more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's the thing that's called?  Were you subpoenaed without a subpoena?  The pen register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pen register, right.  So the phone company not only has it, but offers it to law enforcement routinely  for a small price.  It's a little profit center for the phone companies.  But I am sympathetic for normal people who say, well, they're what?  I didn't understand that.  They're tracking me.  And I don't think it is explicit what you get.  My fear is that even if we make it explicit, look, you get better traffic data.  Or look, you get a podcast.  Or look, this advertising supports the free websites you read like Wired and the Wall  Street Journal.  Even if you explain that, people can say, well, OK, but I don't want you to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then that's the paywall I'll support.  Take the cookie or pay.  You know what?  Pay and don't get advertising.  Become a valuable reader in a different way.  I'd buy that paywall.  You know, economically, it's going to be really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I confess to find myself very uncomfortable to be on this side of the equation.  I almost feel like the music industry.  You're putting us out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're right, Leo.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because there's no harm.  But you know what a paywall inevitably creates?  I agree.  I don't want to pay.  DRM.  I don't want that.  If I have a paywall and I give you something for that money, I've got to somehow protect it.  So the next step is to keep you sons of guns from stealing my stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is the ultimate unintended consequences of do not track.  What will happen is if it really happens and it really happens big,  then certain media sites will have to go behind the paywall to get monetization they've now lost  and a lot of media will die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Jeff, when we go to France to talk to Mr. Sarkozy, we're going to tell him that, right?  Right.  I should tell everybody that Loic Lemur, who was the guy responsible, I found out,  for getting me invited to the EG8 forum, heard us talk about it last week on Twig and said,  I should invite Jeff.  Why did I invite you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, nice, we're going to have double representation.  Jeff's going to go too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now you had to get out of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.  I did.  I feel awful.  Mesh in Toronto, which Matthew England runs, which is a great conference.  I've always wanted to go to, but I figure if a chance to see Monsieur le Président.  I was very concerned that I didn't want to step on Leo's toes because Leo is the  president of the internet.  That was just-  I go as his valet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was just ridiculous.  As valet.  And by the way, my friend is lending us an apartment, so you don't have to worry about  because insane French hotel costs in May.  And the airfares are ridiculous too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which sounded pretty good.  How do I get on this?  You want to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the deal is that the G8 summit is coming up in Deauville at the end of May, and Sarkozy,  and I think with the kind of- I imagine Loic put a little pressure on him, has asked a bunch of  internet entrepreneurs and thought leaders, I guess, to go to France the week before for a  forum in which they will have working sessions and create a document to hand to the G8 leaders  about the internet and the economy.  And while there'll be big stakeholders like Jeff Bezos and I'm sure Schmidt will be there  and Mark Zuckerberg, I think it's a good opportunity for those of us who represent  the people to go there and to say, hey, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a fantasy of getting up for the microphone and having the chorus from Les Mis behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure, Nicholas would appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As soon as you said create a document by committee, I think I'm staying home.  Yeah, you don't want to do that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you get the schedule of plenary session, working group, working group,  plenary session?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, and we're going to get some crap and deserve it for, you know,  what makes you think this organization, and that's part of what I'm going to say too,  is Mr. Sarkozy, hands off, please.  This is not government's-  Right.  ...perfs.  But that's what, you know, why do these people point themselves?  And I think that'll be legitimate criticism we'll get.  On the other hand, I also think this is a discussion that has to be happening.  What are the principles?  Well, I was delighted that the justice minister in Germany  reacted to my silly little principles and talked about them, and it's a discussion that we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Well, I'm so glad you're going to be there. I'll just sit back and watch.  But I'm thrilled. Anyway, that's exciting.  Oyster is for all.  Stephen, I'm sure Laweka's listening. I could put in a good word for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's okay. I'm still selling my book out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Are you touring all around with this book? Is there interest from mainstream media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Literally, I just got back an hour ago from a two-week book tour, including talks at Google  and Facebook and Microsoft. It was kind of interesting to hear those questions in different  places there. And there's a lot of interest. And I'm on the bestseller list, so I can't explain.  Awesome. Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Congratulations. It well deserves you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I find it interesting that Google invited you to come to Google to speak about your book about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google. Yes, I actually did it in New York and in Mountain View there. They asked some pretty good  questions. I actually found the Facebook questions really interesting. The first question I got at  Facebook was, why don't more people leave Google and come here to Facebook?  And your answer?  I said, when I started, I asked how many people here are from Google, and over a dozen hands went  up. I said, isn't that enough? Yeah.  It's like a greeting, guys. Like a midnight raid on the place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why can't we hire more people away?  Well, you made that point already in this conversation that there's still some value,  engineers still find some interesting things happening at Google. Man, this stuff goes fast.  You know, it's an 11-year-old, 12-year-old company, and already people are saying,  oh yeah, it's over the hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and then you see people leaving Facebook. The guys who started Quora,  right? And other people, they're startups. That's really where people want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's true. As soon as something becomes a big company, inevitably it becomes a little  bit bureaucratized, and there's less opportunity and less excitement. And it's really fun  to be the people who are changing the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So Google's trying to give people this startup experience within the company there.  So they took John Hanke, who is the guy who did Keyhole, which became Google Earth,  and he was the head of all the geo products there. And they moved him out of day-to-day  operations, and now he's in sort of a think tank for geo, coming up with new long-term ideas.  So that's one way that they're trying to make the job continually interesting to their good people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I notice also that there is this feeling that each group has a certain amount of autonomy,  and we've noticed that they've all launched products on the same day, for instance. There  isn't so much coordination between them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it's usual on April Fool's Day, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, very good. They must have a lot of people working on April Fool's Day all year long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's their big holiday, really. It's like Christmas for them.  Really?  Yeah. The month before, they're all busy doing it. They have people who's... There's one guy,  I think, whose job... A huge part of his job, if not full-time, is, for certainly maybe half a year,  is coordinating and working on April Fool's things.  How could I get that job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a stockholder, that's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? Well, you start the book with a description of Halloween at Google, and Larry...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My first visit to Google, it was October 1999, and I heard so much about it, and I was using  the search engine. I thought it was great. I got to go meet these people, and I go there,  and Larry Page is dressed like a Viking. He's got a big furry vest and a hat with  horns coming out of it, and Sergey's dressed like a cow. He's wearing a cow suit with a plastic  breastplate with big disgusting udders coming out of it. So the Viking and the cow take me to  a room and explain PageRag to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think it's really sad when a serious company doesn't take itself...  It doesn't take itself seriously.  Now, that was a plan. Come on.  If I'd only had the fur jacket, it was that or the udders.  Stephen, we're going to let you go, but thank you so much. It really is a great book. I've  enjoyed reading it, and of course, it's always a pleasure to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I got to fulfill my dream, being on This Week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say that to all... I'm sure you said it at Good Morning,  Minneapolis. You said the same thing. It's been my dream to work with you, Tom and Sally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. This is it. This is the peak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Stephen, you can come on any time. You know you're always welcome.  All right, Stephen, we got one more question. One more question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  How often are we, especially I, wrong about Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm not going to judge you in particular, Jeff, but a lot of times people are wrong about  Google. They underestimate it because it looks so chaotic, and they do build it in a lot of chaos,  and some of the chaos really isn't intentional, but I think there is a core of what they do.  Even something as far afield, seemingly, as the autonomous cars, I could see the Google-liness  in it. It really is in the spirit of their other kinds of products in terms of it's a  machine learning device that draws information, the environment around it, and draws on information  from Google's servers and databases or data centers and things like that.  So I think that that's something people miss. There is a core of the company that's actually  coherent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that happens in, I mean, I have the same, I cover from the outside. You have this  great inside access. We cover from the outside, Microsoft, Apple, Google, on all of our shows  on Twitter, and really we're just kind of looking in from the outside. We don't do any actual  reporting or anything like that. We just sit here and kibitz, and I think that that's often  the case. I mean, I think it's very difficult to understand Microsoft from the outside. It's very  difficult to understand Apple from the outside. We spend a lot of, it's a lot of it's Kremlinology  trying to understand from outward appearances what's going on internally, so that's why a book  like this is really valued because it gives us a really rare, unique peek into what's really going  on inside, and it's kind of opened my eyes in a lot of places, so thank you for writing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, great. Well, thanks to all of you, and I'll come back sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the difference between slow journalism and fast journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm so glad you had the time you did to write this book, Stephen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Thanks, Stephen. Take care.  Thanks a lot. Bye-bye then.  Stephen Levy, and we're going to let him go, but come back in just a bit with our tool and our tip  and our number of the week, but first a word from our friends at Netflix. If you haven't yet signed  up for a Netflix account, I don't know what's keeping you. Netflix is amazing. I've been a  member for 10, almost, it'll be 11 years in December, so I mean, I drank the Netflix Kool-Aid  a long time ago, and I love it. Netflix started, and when I first joined was as DVD by mail, so  you'd sign up. I get five DVDs. I'll show you my queue. I get five DVDs in the mail, and I have,  as long as I want to watch them, and when I'm done, I send it back, and then it picks the next  title in my queue. This was the thing that I think really sold me on Netflix, is this idea of a queue.  So the next movie, when I send the Smothers Brothers Season 3 Disc 1 back, what are you laughing at?  It is a little self-revealing when you show your-  You're dating yourself, man.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you see yourself as Dick or Tommy, Leo?  Oh, I'm Tommy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what happened? Actually, there's an interesting story. Andy Anotko  told us about an Audible book called Dangerously Funny by David B. and Cooley,  and I was so inspired by Tommy the Rebel. I didn't really realize what was going on behind the scenes,  but he was very political, and the reason he got censored at CBS is because he took every fight to  the mat, and CBS finally just said, this is not worth it. I don't care how good their ratings are.  So after reading the book, I wanted to see the disc. He's also a parent at our high school, so  my-  Wow.  I'm so jealous. My son was at a party. His son is a senior at the high school at a party, and  Tommy came down and hung out with my son for an hour or two.  Jesus.  And I'm saying, I'm saying, well, how was that? He said, oh, he's very funny.  Apparently, he's very profane as well, which if you read the book, doesn't surprise you. So that's  why I'm watching the Smothers Brothers. But my next one, talk about revealing, will be Snakes on  a Plane. So I somehow missed that movie when it was in the theaters, and that's what Netflix is  great for. But I have to say, really, the best lately, I haven't looked at, I've had the painted  veil since January 3rd. The reason is, I got to like doing the watch instantly thing. I watch  something almost every night on Netflix without waiting for a DVD. Even if it's a business day,  I can watch The Terminator right away. I don't have to wait. In fact, these are recommendations  because of the movies and shows, the TV shows I've watched. This is what Netflix thinks I'd  like to see next. I actually have to say it's pretty good list of, I never, some of these I  never heard of, some of them are classics. So yeah, you go right there.  Dr. Shibako?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah. What are you laughing at? That's one of the-  I never would have known you as a romantic, Leo.  The greatest-  I guess I live, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course I'm a romantic.  Yeah, of course. That's right.  Greatest movie of all time. But anyway, that's just, that's just the idea is you press a button  on your Xbox 360, your PlayStation 3, your many Blu-ray players these days, many TVs these days,  the Roku box, the Nintendo Wii, your computer, your iPad, your iPhone, and you can watch these  movies right away instantly. You're never without entertainment. Some good new movies out. Salt just  came out. Easy A, I'd missed that in the theaters. Hot Tub Time Machine, The Graduate. Wouldn't that  be fun?  Easy A was really-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it good?  Oh, well obviously The Graduate, but Easy A is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm just dying to see it. I love the premise.  Yeah, it is. Really is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, now I know what I'm watching tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the lead is really cute. I forget her name, but she does a great job.  I love her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Glee Without Music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a high school comedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just watched The Joneses with Demi Moore and David Duchovny on Netflix.  See, I love David Duchovny. I'm not sure I'm a Demi Moore fan exactly.  No? Oh, okay.  I like her.  She's really the reason I watched the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? So you are a Demi Moore fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am. I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I interviewed her years ago when she was on General Hospital.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. Oh, very cute. And still cute. She hasn't actually aged. I don't understand really-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At all. It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Camera likes her very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was in that sexy movie where she was the stripper, right?  Yes.  I watched that on Watch and See. You don't have to actually order a DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The fact that she can do G.I. Jane and then do the sexy stripper movie is just-  There you go. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And see, that's the other thing that's great about Netflix.  If you're in the mood for a trashy movie, watch it. Just enjoy it. Enjoy yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kill free. You don't have to look at the DVD sitting around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to see The Fast and the Furious tonight? Go right ahead. No one will ever know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chat room, 100 years of movies and Leo chooses snakes on a plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

You're a tip.  Exactly.  Tip of the week, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So another Gmail Labs tip this week, background send. So Gmail has been getting a little slow  lately. You know, you write a message, you hit send, and you have to wait like a couple of seconds  before it gets done. I know this seems like a really small nitpicky thing to get upset about,  but you know, it adds up over time. You can send a lot of email. So they just introduced in Gmail  Labs background send. When you hit the send button, you get returned to your inbox instantly,  and the sending happens kind of in the background. So you can keep chatting or checking your mail or  processing mail while the sending happens. And it makes Gmail just a little feel just a lot more,  you know, a lot snappier. So if you go into your Gmail settings, into Labs, which there are a  million great Labs features, and I'm sure I have half of them enabled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably worth just checking Labs every few days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. It is. I mean, the Gmail blog does a good job of making announcements when they add new ones.  But yeah, background send, hit enable, and when you send mail, just don't log out until it's done.  And you'll have, you'll see a little yellow status message saying, you know, sending your message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cool. Now Gmail's slow. I can't get to the Labs. Oh, well. There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Question, question, guys. I just noticed in the last week or so, maybe this has been there for  five years and I've never seen it, is I started typing an email to Leo Laporte, and it says to me,  would you like to include Gina Trapani? Yes, I've been noticing that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a Labs feature that they rolled into the full Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the what about Bob feature. What about Bob or the wrong bill or something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And it's pretty smart. It is. It does two things. It does the wrong Bob and  what about Bob. So if the wrong Bob is if you send it to Bob Smith instead of Bob Jones, it says,  you meant Bob Jones, didn't you? I don't know how it knows that, but I guess based on your previous  correspondence. And then the what about Bob if you leave somebody out of something that you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  normally would CC everybody and that what I want them to do is I want to be able to, as always,  as Steven said before, I want to export that data and visualize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that would be neat. That would be really neat. You know, this is always what I think about  when we talk about Google and social. Google knows so much about my private life based solely on my  daily Gmail usage for the past five years and even my contacts. So it's interesting.  It would be a little creepy if they did something. I'm going to use creepy, the word that makes Jeff  nuts if they did something about it, because I have the expectation that that mail is private,  right? It's not I'm not going to profile and filling it out for public consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they could do it in your dashboard. I mean, I think that's one of the things that I would  bet that dashboard is intended to do in the long run. The idea behind Google dashboard is to show  you what Google knows about you. Yeah. Yeah. But if you could export your contacts and clusters

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  based on how you communicate with them, like you, you know, you two would be my twig cluster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be really cool. I can see some of that right now. Contact says most contacted. Those are  the three people I send the most email to. So I think that that's, that's conceivable. I mean,  God, that stuff I could find out about myself from looking at my latitude, my location history. I  mean, how many hours I spent at work, you know, I mean, it's well, you don't need that now. Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  knows that. And they will move it to every new iOS device you buy. That was the part about it  that bugged me was that it got backed up and moved on to my new iOS devices. Like, come on.  Well, they back the whole thing up. Well, right. But I, you know, yeah, I know transparent. I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to know. I want to know. I'm not defending them. It's so easy. Just give me, give me knowledge and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  control and then everything's okay. I'm not a dummy. You can tell me I can take it. I want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  say it. Apple, maybe everything's okay. Maybe the knee jerk reaction of 99% of the real people would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be turn that off. And yes, but hiding it these days is only going to get you shouldn't hide it.  You shouldn't hide it. Then the Wall Street Journal can act like they discovered something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's what cracks me up because I mean, this stuff has always been a known. I mean,  I wasn't surprised. It was a, I believe Apple and they said that was a bug. They didn't mean to save  it. But of course they're collecting that data. Just like Google was collecting data about Wi-Fi  access spots and GPS is with a street view. That's how you build those databases. Right. Anyway,  enough, enough. Your number of the week, Mr. Jarvis. Thank you for not stealing it. We didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have a chance. We hardly did any news. 39%. That's how many people according to Google use their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  smartphones in the bathroom. Show of hands. I've done it. I think it's a hundred percent in this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in this room. Oh yeah. Well, okay. Smartphone and also iPad tablet. Not yet. Really? But that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  good idea. That's because men read in the bathroom. Steve Jobs, when he was first asked about the  notion of making a tablet, he says, I'm not going to make a bathroom device. He knew it.  Yeah. He knew exactly what people wanted it for. So this is a survey of smartphone usage by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They put out and some other numbers. Let's go down. Wait a minute. Do they know where my bathroom is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How are they? Clearly. Apparently they're watching my location. Good God. Number two, they know.  Did you use the eco flush, Mr. Jarvis? You use two gallons on that.  We're actually contemplating, if you come out for our grand opening of the new studio,  we are currently in hot negotiations with Kohler for their super new heavy duty toilet that when  you get near it, it opens up for you and it has remote control and it plays music and it bathes  you in all sorts of scented chemicals. Is it wifi? Does it do anything with  wifi? I want to know. I'm sure if it could, it would. I don't know. I'll check.  Does it blow dry your bottom when you're done? That was a Freudian slip. I'm not going to go there.  And by the way, we have a title. I suppose I should cut that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, let me show you my... She has cameras so good as to show her blushing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's blushing. The entire chat room is like,  LOLing right now. So, okay, fine. I'll take that. Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a good line. And I didn't let you get away with it either because  I could have ignored that and moved on and talked about my phone, but no.  So, I do have a tool. First of all, I'm going to show you the tool on the new G2X,  which we were talking about. It really is all that and more. The G2X is the new T-Mobile Google  Experience phone that is running a Tegra 2, so it's dual core. And Gina, you really can see the  speed. I mean, it just really feels fast and lively. And I've talked about it before. Now,  I have to say, I'm very excited because I found an app for it that I really like that's free  right now. If you go right now to the Amazon App Store, usually the free app's like Doodle Jump,  but everyone's found something you actually want. This is an alternative calendar that I  never heard of. It's a $5 program. Normally, it's free right now from Macado Software  called Business Calendar, and I really, really like it. It has a very nice set of widgets to use.  You see, I've got a little mini widget down here that's the calendar. It has a lot of very nice  features that improve on the Android calendar. Of course, it syncs automatically with the  the Google calendar. There's the month view, which the Android calendar does not do. You can also  just have colored bars if you want to just get an idea of... Let me see if I can get that done.  Oh, I guess I do it here. Yeah, show bars. If you just want to get an idea of your busy time,  but I like to show text. You see all the categories and tabs down below, which is really nice.  Makes it very easy. Here's a week view. The day view is also excellent. You can edit events  directly in there. I just think it's a little bit of a better calendar. I don't know if I'd  pay five bucks for it. Actually, I think I probably would. I've paid some money for some  expensive calendars in the past. Look, I can jam more or fewer days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice. Look at that. Is that a slider? Oh, very nice.  This is really nicely done.  I just hit buy with one click. Get now with one click on my next one. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's free. I have to say every day now I go to the Amazon App Store. I always want to see  what they're offering because they have so many good things for free. Yesterday I downloaded a  couple of days ago TuneIn Radio Pro, which is still only 99 bucks. Absolutely the best radio  program I've ever seen. In and amongst the bubble level, angry birds and doodle jump,  there's occasionally something that you actually want. I think today's a good one. If you're  hearing this after the fact, well, you'll have to decide if it's worth $4.99. You could try it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for 15 minutes free. Crazy. 15 minutes. Hey, the official Google Docs  native app for Android also came out. We should say that pretty quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People were amazed, Leo, that you didn't pick that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't know about it. Yeah. So the cool thing that it does is that it does OCR. So you take  a picture with your camera and you upload it to Google Docs and it does its best to OCR,  the optical character recognition and translate it to text. I did a quick test right before the  show and I actually took a photo of my computer screen of the blog post announcing this. I left  a link to it in the doc. Let me see if I can find it here. No Google Docs for Android. She's got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in there. Let me just check. So this is the blog post. Oh, but you put in our doc, you put,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't believe I missed this. I'm so stupid. I took a picture of the screen and then uploaded  it just to see what the text recognition would be like. And it's okay. There are some Gs that  are Qs and that kind of thing, but yeah, it's a pretty cool app. So the Google Docs app,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  just search for Google Docs in the market. Here's the photo example. I got it right here  from you. Let me open this up and paste this in because it didn't convert it to a link as  it sometimes does. Have you noticed that sometimes in spreadsheet it doesn't convert it to a link?  Yeah, I think maybe I didn't. You got to press a button. Leave this page. Leave this page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's the photo. And then if you scroll down, that's the text.  That's a hard test doing a screen.  I wanted to give it a tough test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did a good job. Yeah, I mean, a magazine would probably do a better job. And look how hard that  would be to read. And I think it did a very good job. Yeah. I mean, it was certainly usable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I want them to do is to do a transcript of any audio I give them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they could do that. They have a very good... Yeah, they do. Well, YouTube doesn't do such a  good job, but they certainly seem to know what I'm saying. I don't know how they do. All right.  So there you go. I apologize for leaving that out. I know about it, but I'm downloading it right now  too. So there's a few tips for you. And yes, the G2X, nice phone, four inch screen, very fast,  good battery life, same as all the others, Droid X and all of those other phones. In other words,  not enough if you use it constantly, but if you can keep it plugged in every once in a while,  plug it in, I think you'll be pretty happy with it. And boy, I just love this phone. And it's a  native Google experience, which means no other stuff on here. Still 2.2. Someday,  someday they'll update it. They say they're going to update it soon.  Gina Trapani is at SmarterWear. The R-rated Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leah will get to meet Potty Mouth Me at Food Camp. She'll be a village-eller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's intentional offline. It's not a Freudian slip. It is not a Freudian slip.  Always a pleasure, Gina. Thank you so much for being here. Just the greatest. Great show today.  I can't wait to see you at Food Camp. Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun. Jeff Jarvis.  I'm going to see him too. And a little sooner we're going to see him in...  Perry?  Jeff is at BuzzMachine.com. We will. And his book. Oh, I guess we threw it out.  Just kidding. What would Google do? I know. No, you got to read them both. You got to read them  both. This is journalism about the inside of Google. This is philosophy that is still very  germane today. I mean, it's exactly what we talk about on the show. And if you love the show and  love Jeff's insights on the show, you'll love the book. What would Google do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's a very nice way of saying it's BS, but that's fine.  It's not BS. Well, hey...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blather.  If I call BS on this, what is my network? It is all BS. It is the Blather network.  But that's fine. Somebody's got to do it. Thank you, Jeff. Thank you, Gina.
