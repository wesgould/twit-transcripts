The show that covers Google, the Googleverse, the cloud.  And Danny Sullivan is here from Search Engine Land and Marketing Engine Land dot com. Great to have you Danny.  Hello, good to be here.  He's wearing his surf rider t-shirt.  I like it. Nice to see you.  Also looking better than ever thanks to Google Talk of all things.  Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.  Look at that. The color is good. You're on the pixel. You're using G-talk.  Why didn't we do this before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we thought that the codec that G-talk was using wasn't very good, but it looks really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and the reason for this is so that so the show understands is that it turns out my university must have put up a new firewall and it disadvantages Skype.  So that got to 15 frames a second max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And last last week you were just blur. You were blur.  It was awful. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now we thanks to the good work of Chad and Russell on the Twig staff.  Last night we figured all things out and tried a lot of things. Tried this and I think Twig is now in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And just for for the technical info, the drivers weren't working before.  And it also freaked me out that it used to be that you could hit the Google Talk button and it goes straight into what we're using.  Then they replaced it with the Hangout button.  And I kind of I kind of got shy of that and said, you know, we really shouldn't use this product because they could change it anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that was another problem I forgot is that we couldn't send video back initially.  But now we that that was fixed at some point.  So Blackmagic updated their drivers. Blackmagic did it.  OK, so I think we may start we may at least have this as a because we don't have to use Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have this as a backup on our shows because I think the other thing you should work on long term is WebRTC.  Yeah, I agree. That's a standard client that you can control and then you can do neat things with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We shall play with it also here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or or we won't have this at all.  And we'll just like Gina see the show up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Gina should be doing the show via glass.  Look at that. Yeah, she has joined the collective screen.  Captain Gina Trippani is here or also known as eight of nine.  And her blog is smarterware.org.  No, no, she's not seven of nine. She's eight. Very important.  Seven's already taken. So nice to see you.  So you got your glass. I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good to see you, too. What do you think?  I look like a dork.  That's what I think. No, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm rapidly getting used to it.  And you remember I was saying it was like the segue.  It's not that bad. I'm rapidly getting used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People keep saying that. It's not that bad.  This thing. I don't want people to say that about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to be just not that bad.  You've got a microphone strapped to the side of your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. The Madonna mic with that is complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I have so much gear on my head right now.  Ear buds. I've got the mic. I've got the glasses.  There's a lot going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you need an oxygen tube or something, too, just to complete it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we did get our finally. We got our email.  Remember, Jason Howell was at I.O. last year and he registered number 737.  He got the email today and I made an executive decision.  I gave him the glass because he's got a newborn.  People with newborns should jump to the head of the line with Google Glass.  He's pretty happy about that.  I'll pay for it. I'm not going to make him pay for it.  I tried Scoble's glasses. Scoble was on Twitter on Sunday.  And I got the idea. I don't think I'd wear it a lot.  What do you think? Remember, Scoble said he's going to wear it all the time  for the rest of his life. What do you think, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm definitely not in the Scoble camp.  I'm not like, oh, I can't imagine going through another day of my life without this.  But I do think that this is this is kind of interesting technology.  I mean, I've gotten awesome videos and pictures of my daughter.  I love getting text messages and just being able to glance up and reply really quickly.  I love not having to mess with my phone.  The nav is really cool.  But I have to tell you, if you if you're in the least bit self-conscious  and you don't live in San Francisco or New York or L.A.,  you really think twice about going out on these things.  Now, I mean, I wear and this is the other thing, I don't wear glasses on a regular basis.  So this is kind of a new thing for me. I wear sunglasses a lot.  And in fact, I put the sunglasses in, you know, I snap them into to glass.  And I feel I feel sort of more comfortable with going out with them that way.  But yeah, you know, I drove on the drive home from L.A.  I was talking about this online.  I stopped at a rest stop with the baby and whatever.  And a small kid, a child, like an eight or nine year old, was totally staring at me.  You know, I mean, why is that woman disfigured?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like kind of getting dragged along by her dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's kind of like, what is that?  What is wrong with that woman, Mami?  I was like, I'm scaring like a little girl.  Like, I don't know if that's a bug or a feature or what.  You know, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a whole feature of of through glass.  First, Gina, first, Gina, are you willing to show on the show  the best through glass picture I have seen anywhere yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. Oh, is it on?  Is it on Gina's? Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus, go to the rundown, go to the rundown.  There's a picture there.  It says exclamation points. It says best photo ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my golly gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what you want to see, because that's the mommy's view of of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.  And what's Edda thinking right now?  Yeah, I know.  She's well, her first words are going to be OK glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Well, what you what you're really getting is what a baby looks like  when she sees her mama in a way that you really wouldn't get  if a camera in front of your face.  She's looking at you and she's pure joy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, Gina, how did you how did you share that out to the public?  Because I thought the glass would only show the pictures out.  Oh, no. I was playing with Matt McGee because he got his on on Monday.  And I would have to watch him and take pictures and stuff.  And he couldn't share anything out to the public only to extended circles.  He hadn't set it up right. Probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You can.  If you go to Google dot com slash my glass, which is basically where you do  all the kind of advanced configuration under sharing contacts,  you can add any circle, any individual.  And one of the options is public. So you can add public.  Excellent. Yeah.  Although it's a purpose. It's so it shares.  It shares automatically. Right.  Well, instant upload is turned on by default and everything's private by default.  So any video or picture I take is uploaded up to Google.  So I've been doing a lot of that where everything gets instant uploaded up.  And then when I'm at my computer, I look at OK, and then I share kind of curate share.  But but that one, any any images that you see with a through glass hashtag,  somebody has shared directly from their glass, you know, right after.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, rich, speaking of which, I started a tumble blog.  Oh, I'm using through glass pictures.  What's it called? It's on the rundown as well.  It's it's a through glass.  Oh, my dot tumbler dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it. I'm following it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, there have been a couple of cool videos.  There was one of a guy dunking a basketball.  Ryan Warner, who's actually in the chat room right now,  he had glass on during his graduation and he got great footage of walking  across the stage and accepting his degree and looking out on the crowd,  which is really cool. I was like, wow, I would love to have that record  of my graduation.  The video video feature is really cool,  although watching it, if the person is moving,  it can get a little kind of you can feel a little losing,  you know, kind of watching.  So, yeah, a little motion sickness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is a fairly trivial use, though, if you say it's a head mounted camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Big deal. Yeah, you're absolutely right.  You're absolutely right.  This is the thing. There aren't a whole lot of apps for this right now.  Like I said, I like getting text messages and phone calls through glass.  It's convenient. You don't have to play your phone out.  Nav is great.  You know, taking videos and pictures is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Apple genius is looking at this going, what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you're right, Leo.  Mike, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say that when I wake up in the morning, I'm not like,  oh, I can't proceed in my day if I don't have glass on. Right.  Which I do kind of feel like that about my smartphone. Right.  If I lose my smartphone, that's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tell me, tell it describe for people who haven't tried it, what your what  what it looks like to you as you're wearing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So when it when it's on or just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. What are you seeing? What do you what does it look like?  What does it feel like? Give us the I've worn it now.  So I kind of know.  But I'd like to hear in your words, what is the experience  so that people can kind of experience what it's like to wear it?  And what do you see? How does it feel? How does it look? All that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, when it's on your head and it's not in the screen, isn't on.  There's there's this clear piece of piece of glass right above your right eye,  which you can see and you can see through it.  But you're aware that it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in your peripheral vision.  It's a periphery, though, because you can look.  I mean, mostly you're looking under it.  You just can see something there. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Most of you are looking under it.  But but you but you can if you look up at all, you'll you'll see through it.  You can wake it by either tilting your head up if you have that enabled  or tapping the touchpad.  And then you can see and you can actually see this.  You can see the screen come on.  Let's see if I get out of the glare.  You can see that actually in in the shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Scoble was pains to say, you see, people know if you're  looking at glass because they can see the screen.  If it's at the proper angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. If it's at the proper angle. Exactly.  So the so the screen is just it's pretty small.  It looks as if it's a couple of feet in front of me. Right.  It doesn't look right up in my face.  Looks as if it's a couple of feet in front of me.  It does look like a projector. Right.  So if the if the glasses slip a little bit, you'll see the red, green, blue.  You kind of get the sense that is projected.  But it is pretty crisp in sunlight, which there's a lot of here in San Diego.  It is difficult to see.  You kind of want to look at a dark object in order to see it, to see the screen.  Well, the user interface is very nice.  It's very Google now.  Like you swipe through cards using the touchpad on the side.  It's very smooth.  And honestly, and I think that's global was doing this with you on Twitter on Sunday.  Leo, they Google obviously learned a lesson from Android.  Remember, Android shipped and you couldn't take a screen a screenshot with glass.  You can screencast whatever is happening on your glass onto your phone. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so he had his phone replaying what I was seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really, really nice.  And in fact, sometimes I use that to look at videos  because it's a it's clearer and larger on my phone than it is on glass.  If I'm like, oh, I want to share this video to the public.  But let me just make sure that I haven't, you know, included any,  you know, I don't know, phone numbers or personal information  or something I don't want public.  I would look at it on my phone, which is nice.  It comes with.  It comes with, you know, shades that you can pop in.  It also comes with a clear, clear one of these.  If you're doing if you're out and, you know, it's raining or if you're doing athletics.  Go ahead, Jeff, what was your question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's just besides taking pictures and videos, clear value.  Are you using it for informational purposes so far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I turned on the New York Times app, which is there only two third  party apps available, Path, which I don't use.  And and New York Times, New York Times every hour or so shows me headlines.  And I turned it off because I don't need.  Yeah, I don't need headlines on my field division every every couple of searches  with it. Oh, yeah, I have done searches.  Yeah, you know, I've mostly all the searches I've done so far.  It's only been a couple of days that I've had it or just been to try it out.  I haven't. Yeah, I have seriously said, you know, like a glass.  I did say I have the navigation.  I have said, you know, navigate San Diego, navigate to, you know, here, there  or wherever navigation is really, really nice and helpful  and a really cool feature that it has if you're in navigation  and you're in walking mode, glass actually knows which way your head is turned.  So it will tell you which way to turn based on which way your head is turned.  Oh, that's really beautiful.  Yeah, which is really neat bit of of tech.  Yeah, there's a couple of really smart things about it.  There's zero voice recognition.  So and Leo, you saw this on Twitter, too.  If you say, OK, glass and then someone next to you is speaking, it'll pick up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Voice rejection. You should. Yeah, you mean voice rejection.  So, yeah, it doesn't it.  Anybody's voice will work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anybody's voice will work. It doesn't know your voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you tap your if you tap your temple and somebody says, OK, let's take a picture.  You're right. They're going to do it. It'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's going to do it.  It does have there's a proximity sensor on it.  So it knows if it's on your head or not, and it will sleep automatically  when you take it off your head.  I think it does that just to preserve battery,  which it really needs to because the battery is terrible.  Also, it will run down your phone's battery pretty quickly.  I mean, this is very much a developer prototype.  It sends text messages with a signature that says sent from glass, which is  don't know if I really want that.  I would like to turn it off.  I should I should poke around and see if I can.  I'm not sure that you can right now.  I've had text messages get sent twice.  I've had text messages take a long time to get sent.  So like things are buggy, although there's an update  that just pushed out today that I just did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get the XE five update already. Yeah.  So what happened? What does that do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there were just a couple of like stability improvements and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it says brings loads of new features and enhancements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. What?  I don't know about all that.  I actually should look at it.  It look closely. I haven't looked closely at the change log.  It felt like everything was just like makes sharing smoother,  which should work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Incoming G plus notifications.  Let's turn those off.  Incoming notifications.  Let's turn those off.  For those off transcription of queries and messages is now wicked fast.  OK. Long, long press to search from anywhere in the UI.  International number dialing hop animation on disallowed swipes in the UI.  What the? Oh, OK.  So it'll hop or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you so OK, so let's see.  So if you try to do something, I just got I just got a Google  plus notification. Oh, wow. Got a bunch of them.  So if I try to swipe it, it'll it's working. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New on head detection, calibration flow, show serial device,  serial number on device info card, more reliable estimation of battery charge.  New recipient list mosaic.  That that's not what I would call  exciting new features and enhancements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this is it's still really early.  Yeah, it's a bug. It's a bug fix release.  That's how it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Communicate with the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Bluetooth tethering.  So Bluetooth pairs with the phone using them.  The MyGlass app is really is really important.  I can't I haven't tried.  I don't know if this talks to iPhone at all, if it works with the iPhone or what.  But the MyGlass companion app links to your glass, you know,  same Bluetooth pairing process that shows you a pin on your phone,  shows you a pin on glass.  You tap to say, yes, the pins match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it will use your phone's data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It will use your phone's data.  Yeah. And it uses your phone's battery, too.  So it can run down your phone's battery as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of this and more is why I gave it to Jason.  Jason's howling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a developer prototype.  Like, I think it's really important for everyone.  And this is not how the final consumer product is going to look.  This is this is my my one line review is there's something interesting here  about the heads up display. Google did some nice work with the UI,  but this has a long way to go.  Long way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Robert, Robert compared it to the feeling he got when he first got an Apple  2 computer when he was a kid, like it couldn't do much either.  But this you could see this was the beginning of a revolution.  Yeah, like there's something here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, you miss developer Queen.  Does this inspire anything in you yet about things that you could imagine  making for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you know, honestly, I've been thinking a lot about notifications  from all my apps from ThinkUp, from TodoText.  So I've been thinking and I've been looking at the API.  I got whitelisted to get API access, which is what everybody does  when they get Glass.  So I haven't dove in yet, but I'm interested in kind of just basic stuff  that you'd imagine. So like on a to do list.  If I if I, you know, mark coordinates, I'm going to pick up milk at Ralph's.  You know, when I'm near Ralph's glass should pop up and say, hey,  you're supposed to pick up milk, that kind of thing.  We think up, you know, if there's a new a new insight that's high,  you know, high importance, importance of emphasis or emphasis.  I wanted to push the glass and say, oh, I've got, you know, got something,  you know, worth looking at here.  But, you know, you have to build with glass.  You have to be very judicious about what you're showing, right?  It has to be very timely, very relevant, very compelling.  Or else, you know, your users are going to shut the app off.  That's why I don't think the New York Times makes sense.  The only time that the New York Times headline makes sense for me  is like the Boston bombings, for example, like being in defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In New York, I think today we had killer rainstorms.  So so this morning, the first time ever,  and friends of seven of my friends to the phone went off when I hit the city  with a with a like a, you know, civil defense warning sound.  I've never had this before.  Flash flood warning till 9 to 15.  And it was weird. I've never seen that before.  And so so you can see that kind of alert.  Yeah. On on the class would be fine.  All right. Next question.  What application do you most wish would would do an adaptation for glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, glass is very heavily integrated into Google Plus.  And I've so consequently, I've been using Google Plus a little more,  but I spend most of my time on Twitter.  So I'm I mean, the most obvious ones I want are like Twitter,  the social apps that I spend the most time in Twitter, Foursquare,  I would like to listen to podcasts on this on glass, you know,  that that would be really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd like the way the how's the bone thing work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It works really, really well.  Yeah, there's a speaker on the back.  It's a bone conducting speaker.  It's right up kind of against the back.  You know, the bone behind your ear.  And it sounds surprisingly clear, much better than I thought that it would.  I could very easily listen.  I probably wouldn't listen to music, but I could very easily listen to podcasts.  And that's something I would love to do.  So so pocket casts.  I'd like for you to build some glassware for me.  That's interesting.  I mean, I want to do, you know, I want to do anything that I do on my smartphone.  That's that's a reasonably small amount of swipe.  You know, Foursquare check ins seems like an obvious thing, right?  I'm sure Google Attitude is going to be going to be built into this very quickly.  I would like, you know, I like things like Foursquare Explorer,  like, you know, four of your friends have been this restaurant,  you're passing by that kind of thing.  I would actually be really interested in that.  So all the kind of major apps I really would like to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so glad you're there first.  Yeah. And enjoy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to see and see, you know, see what I can see,  if I can come up with something kind of fun just to just to just to see how.  How easy it is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so Leo, I used to be the guy who sent stuff back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, Mr. Reebokser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, now you're the guy.  Pixel, get out of my way. I didn't send it back.  I didn't send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't send it back.  I didn't. I just not going to.  I'm paying for it.  I just think there's somebody who'd be more it'll be more of more used to.  And I don't I would use it for five minutes and I would put in a drawer.  So like every gadget of yours.  Not every gadget. No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The hangout feature is pretty cool.  And in fact, we can chat and I could try one out if you want to see it.  Sure. It's not a very good view here.  I mean, it's really it's just my messy desk.  Can we do that? Really, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can we do it? Yeah.  So so I'm watching my Google Plus stream right here.  And then Gina is going to. OK, glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hang out with Chad Johnson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that was scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now let me watch my stream for it to come in here.  Oh, look. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is kind of amazing.  And then let me and what it sees is not you, but it sees what you're seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's going to see my screen, right?  Oh, yeah.  Chad's going to turn off audio so I don't hear both.  So this is kind of boring.  This is just my messy desk.  There's my keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see. Look around the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, look around the room here.  I've got a picture of the Apple one up on my wall here.  I can see that.  Got my little audio box here.  Yeah, I've got lots of chords, messy chords going on.  Yeah. And it's it's sunny outside because it's San Diego.  I don't know if I come in on the screen, you could probably see a little better.  Yeah, you can see the rundown behind my Skype window.  Oh, look, it's recursion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a recursion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I got like I got the old school programmer talking  at the old school keyboard here.  But yeah, so if I were standing on top of a beautiful  cliff looking at over the ocean or if I was holding the baby in front of me  and Skyping with with grandma, the Hangouts is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I can see Chad and Monica and Google Plus and Monica has done wonderful things  with because she's disabled and can't get around much.  So she's had photographers do Hangouts with cameras  through these these jerry rigged operations.  Now you can show anybody what you're seeing, right?  When you have to go off on a trip.  Emma, here's where I am.  Here's where I am. Here's where I am now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or if you're working on a car and you call a service bureau and say,  here's what I'm seeing, is that normal?  That'd be kind of interesting.  Yeah, yeah.  I can see a lot of uses for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a video, I think is one of Google's promotional videos.  A science teacher went to the went to CERN and did a hang out with his class  showing him that the collider. Yeah.  Has the baby grabbed your glass?  The baby has reached has started to reach for glass.  And I've kind of I backed away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's still pretty little.  My kids stole my glasses for about four years.  So just warning. Yeah. Yeah.  Surgeons.  So I'm about to should I cut the left ventricle or the right vent?  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right. My right. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bomb bomb disposal is going to be used bomb disposal in a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you'll see these in movies soon.  Oh, yeah. I would guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been driven absolutely berserk this last week.  Media have gone completely nuts  trying to find everything that could possibly go wrong with class.  Business Insider wrote this ridiculous piece about, well, nobody likes glass.  That was the strangest piece ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't. That was like now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they've got their now they've got their own version.  Now Jay has got his his.  Oh, now suddenly he likes it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that coverage will change. Yeah.  There is a petition on the White House stock of site.  Ban Google Glass from use in the USA until clear limitations are placed  to prevent indecent public surveillance.  I'm just happy to say that so far, 30 signatures.  It's not exactly catching fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only ninety nine thousand nine hundred seventy to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think glass is a big privacy.  After having played with it now, it's so obvious somebody's wearing it.  And, you know, and Robert said he there, you know, he puts them on his head  when he wants to signal that I'm going to treat this as private.  And I think that that will rapidly become kind of derogatory.  But you're not going to see very many glass.  I mean, it's like, you know, you're not going to see them in the wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How to work with your contacts, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fine. You know, it's not I mean,  you know, it's not virtual reality or anything.  It's a little screen right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not is your right eye, your neocyte or far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to I'm told Robert told me that in the training, they told him  you want it to be with the eye that you would look at a billboard with it.  It's in other words, your far vision, your far vision. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about have you seen anybody try to wear it with glasses, which is my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have seen pictures. I don't know.  Robert says he's done it.  Although he got contacts, I guess, because he wanted to wear glass  all the time, I don't know. Oh, Robert would.  I just immediately became I got it.  You know, I wore it for a minute and I got it.  As I'm sure you feel to, Gina, you got it right.  And I don't think you need to continue to wear it to get any more of of it.  Maybe you do. Maybe you have to wear it all the time to really understand it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, when you start seeing your own data on it, you know,  when you start to get your own text messages, when my mom calls me on glass  and I just have to say hi, you know, there's something very personal  kind of about that you realize like, oh, this is a really great communications device.  Like, I'm not going to miss a call.  You know, I can I can, you know, I can just glance up to see a text message,  which seems very natural.  It feels really lazy to say that I'm just too lazy to pull out my phone  and check, check my text messages.  But, you know, sometimes I just miss them because, you know, I mean, look,  this morning I was feeding the baby at both my hands and I took a video  of her like eating mango for the first time. Right.  That's and she made this really funny face and I got that video,  which I wouldn't have been able to get because without glass. Right.  Because I wouldn't have been able to have the camera  and also the spoon and all this stuff. Right.  So, again, that seems like a really trivial usage.  And I agree with you, it kind of is, but it's meaningful to me  because it's it's very, very personal.  So, yeah, I think you can get it by seeing, you know, seeing the videos  and trying on for a minute.  But I think once you start, it starts to kind of get incorporated  in your own life with your own data and your own sort of circumstances.  You start to see glimmers of, oh, this is, you know, this is interesting.  Now, again, I'm not waking up in the morning reaching for glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't wait to get my glass on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm definitely not doing that.  But before I leave the house now, I'm like, oh, you know, I'll put,  you know, put them on if I see something, I'll take some pictures.  And definitely taking a lot more pictures and videos than I ever did.  And I think that's actually a good thing.  Did you see Tim O'Reilly was talking about the backlash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but he also was, you know, Tim, I respect a lot.  I guess we mentioned this last week.  He was very impressed with glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he's very pro glass.  And he said this was just yesterday.  He said, what's really interesting to see is how is to see how accepting  people are of public surveillance cameras while they're up in arms  about cameras in the hands of individuals.  I'd rather have empowered individuals with cameras than laws  than laws that corporations in government track us any time with video  while individuals have that right taken away.  So this is kind of this is the point that this is the White House petition, right?  This is the idea of like creep shots, right?  I mean, you know, Keane, Andrew Keane and and Scoble,  I just thought it was so funny that the first question about glass is like,  you know, would you take a picture of my junk in the urinal?  You know, which is like, really?  Like, this is I mean, I get it.  If we fall into that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I didn't see a picture in the Tumble blog.  And there is a picture of a urinal.  And my caption is, don't look down. Don't look down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't look any farther down. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not like you're going to see this sudden,  oh, we got to have glass up swell. I don't think.  I think the more people that see it, the more they have my reaction,  which is that's nice.  It's not a must have yet.  But but, you know, I'm waiting.  I think my problem with is the user interface.  I just really want it to be tapped right into my my optic nerve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, Leo, didn't you go to South by Southwest a couple of years ago  and you had a giant backpack with the stick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've done similar similarly stupid things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you wouldn't have to do that, right?  You're the live stream guy. You could do it.  And this would let you this would let you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of got past that, too, by the way. I haven't done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're over it. I'm kind of over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As well as your ugly George moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was. Yeah. Ugly George. Remember him?  Maybe if you're not from New York, you wouldn't remember him.  But he had a cable channel.  He went around with a camera in New York.  I we were trying different ways to the well.  Actually, it's interesting because the point of that was to see what  if I could give you a first person experience of South by  like what it would be like to be at South by.  And we realized this really it it doesn't work that well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Although that that crowd surfing video was pretty, pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it was a cool moment.  It was a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're a nerd in the chat room has asked a couple of times  whether or not Glass has a web browser installed in it.  And the answer is no.  I mean, the interface is those cards.  They look a lot like Google Now cards, except they have a dark background  and white text and you scroll through them horizontally, right,  versus vertically on your phone.  And so if you do a Google search, if you say, you know, Google, whatever kittens,  it will show you one result per card and you swipe through them  on the touchpad this way.  So there isn't a traditional web browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wouldn't work. You need I mean, if you look at the text  size on these things, you couldn't see a browser.  You couldn't read anything. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Which makes you add this to Siri.  The idea of content pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because the text, I mean, you get you really probably have what,  Gina, 10, 15 characters across at all. At most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. You can do different text sizes, but yeah, you really can't.  You won't see that much. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think it's a little misleading.  They say it's like a 25 inch monitor five feet away from you. It isn't.  It isn't. You can't see that much.  It's a tiny. It sounds like it reminded me a lot, too, of when

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you first had cell phones and you would get information.  You remember how cell phones are horrible.  We had to design everything. You were supposed to have card.  Literally, that's what we talked about, have the mobile cards.  And that wasn't a very satisfactory experience.  And wasn't it called WAP? Yeah, right.  But that's right. WML.  I remember the few times I've used it and I've seen those little cards come up.  And it's almost like when you go to wanting to get that information,  it's almost like you're not quite getting enough. Right.  It's leaving you like wanting more.  But then that also makes you feel like, as Gina said, you know,  it's going to get better that at some point, just like our smartphones, you know,  the idea that we would browse the web on the old phones that we had before,  we had to get things like one little tiny screen at a time.  It's so radically different that you can see it's it's going to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe I mean, there's there's there's  fairly insurmountable user interface issues the way it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's to me, it's like it's a notification platform.  I mean, one of these cards, I've got six, seven lines down vertical.  And I don't know, I haven't been able to count the number of characters across.  But you're definitely limited how much text you can show.  But you have to think about it as like the Twitter of user interfaces, right?  Like Twitter, you can only do 140 characters.  You have to kind of think about think of it that way.  So like the New York Times app, it just shows you the headline.  And one of the things that you can do is you can say, glass, read me the headline.  So it'll just read it to you and sort of a robotic voice.  But you're not going to read an article in your Times article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you said something really important.  I think that that's the key.  People think it's oh, it's a computer interface.  It's not it's a notification platform, much like a Pebble watch would be.  It's not more exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. It's a watch.  I think that's a good thing.  Yeah, I think that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're just always looking at it.  That's the that's the difference in that in a watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a it's it's a good thing in some sense, but it's going to have to change.  If if it's designed, for example, for you to use it as a search interface, right?  And tell me if I'm wrong, but if I recall it's basically doing that, I'm getting lucky.  You know, I'm I'm feeling lucky.  I'm feeling lucky, not getting lucky.  There's a significant difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Thank you.  But if you're getting lucky with glass, you might be in trouble.  One of the ideal or you may be so handsome, you can overcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But one of the ideal things you want for it,  so that it's something beyond just being like a glorified globe,  GoPro with Wi-Fi and everything, is that you would  you would be able to do a local search, right?  You'd be able to find restaurants and have it scrolling through the restaurants  and have you pick the right one that you want, not OK, I picked one type of thing.  And I don't know that it's going to be.  It's obviously going to take time to get there.  But that is the kind of expansion that you'd want that sort of device to do,  because otherwise, if it just continues to be this extension of your cell phone  and then you're having to go, oh, I'll just go back to my phone,  then then it really is more this notification camera type of thing  and not necessarily a search tool type of thing.  And and it seems like they want it to be that they seems like they want this  to grow into the device you would have, not the supplement.  Oh, I don't really think so.  Yeah, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's going to be the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not going to replace what they what they want it to be.  And I think it's going to grow.  They Google or they users Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What Sergey Brin said, says, hey, this is nice because I feel emasculated  when I have to go and use my phone.  That's that's him saying, I think this should be what we have.  I don't think that's him saying, and this is what it is now.  This is what's going to be in a year from now.  But I think what he's saying is this idea of wearable technology  is is what our future ought to be, not that we've got this handheld thing,  which is really just an extension of the desktop handheld things  that we were carrying around.  So, yeah, that would that would be kind of your evolution with it.  But I'm not saying you get there in a year.  I think you get there necessarily in two years.  And I don't even know that it turns into being a glass type of thing that we have.  I mean, it may be that, you know, we've got different things.  Maybe we've got one of these flexible bands  that goes around our wrist that you can take out and spread out.  And, you know, I want that Battlestar Galactica thing that they had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the cell phone is actually pretty perfect.  I disagree with Sergey that it's emasculating to look down at it.  It's it's got a nice screen.  This is 1920 by 1080.  I can do everything I want. It's in my pocket.  It's not so very far from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's you know, Louis CK does this great bit about how he went to his kids dance, right?  And all the parents were standing there like this, right?  Right. Taking a video, you know, and like kind of  not being present, looking at looking at the world through this tiny screen.  And this is one of the things that glass you never have to do this with glass.  Right. You just you either tap it.  That's just a head mounted camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can do that with a GoPro. I can do that.  I have another pair of glasses. The camera right here.  This is not this is not new.  It's not even innovative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But because it's all those other things, because it lets you share,  because you can also, you know, because it because it lets you  receive text messages and send text messages.  And actually, I'm pretty sure that if you do Google search  and you get results, you can scroll through them using.  So it's not just I'm feeling lucky.  It's not just one result. You can scroll through them.  So potentially something like the Foursquare app could say, hey,  here's recommendations for restaurants.  You scroll through them and maybe and then you tap one and it launches into Nav.  Here's how to get there.  I mean, navigation is another thing.  I mean, my wife is constantly telling me, stop looking down at your phone  while you're driving. Right.  Because I just I just never went and bought a, you know, a mount to put it up.  Now, I know there are laws that say, you know,  the glass guide said, don't don't wear glass and don't use navigation  while you're driving, because there aren't laws for this yet.  We don't even know if you're going to be kind of allowed,  even though it's a hands free device.  But walking in navigation, certainly, or biking.  It's so so, yeah, you're right.  There's a there's head mounted cameras, I guess.  There's wristwatches which show your text messages.  Glass just does kind of all those things.  And one other thing is in New York, it sounds like I'm defending and promoting.  I'm pretty ambivalent about glass.  I'm just trying to sort of make the case for what's interesting about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the problem with the cell phone, too, is you see this in New York all the time.  These days, we need a on sidewalks.  We need a slow lane for tourists and textures. Right.  People who are interacting as they're trying to walk and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because New Yorkers just have to move so fast all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we do. We got places to go, man.  Unlike you, Otis land.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm looking at the skyscrapers.  My God, I didn't know building could be that big.  And you're going, I'm sorry, I've got to be somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Got to go. Got to go.  We got we got things to do here.  Anyway, I yeah, it's something here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the beginning. But it's just a very, very early days.  And it's kind of unknown exactly where you go from here.  And I think there are some significant issues with it.  There's no question about that.  Sure. It's an early product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what that's. But that's why the things like that business insider piece  and all these other things are happening.  The things like that business insider piece and all these other things  that just dismiss it. No, it's ridiculous.  The point is, in developers hands, we'll see what happens with it.  It's it's a concept.  Ten thousand people will use it.  And this is how you get better. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is how you get how you make something good.  As you let very, very wealthy people try it for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The guy from Business Insider, I remind you, I try to remind him,  I don't think he knew this history because he was a young whippersnapper.  But the PC, the Apple PC, all that was absolutely worthless  until VisiCalc was admitted. Right.  In terms of practical use that changed the world,  VisiCalc was the thing that made the PC really important, made business.  So what's the killer app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the killer app for Glass? We haven't seen it yet.  We don't know. It ain't a spreadsheet.  I can tell you that. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Desktop publishing. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it's chess.  Chess Queen to Queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I play chess on my smartphone all the time.  I've got games going on right now.  Beating them too.  But we shall have more in a moment. Porn. Porn. Porn.  Now, I'm telling you that that screen is not for watching porn.  No, not for watching. It's for making it.  I do think that within six months we will see maybe less.  We'll see point of view porn from Glass.  Oh, yeah. Seen through Glass.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe the frames have to get sexier before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Earlier I was just trying to go to a sponsor and then I really was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to have a buffer now between the sponsor and that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The dorkiness factor is that going to have to be ratcheted down  a whole lot more before people want to want to get busy with these things on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet you there's somebody in San Fernando Valley right now.  Oh, yeah. Making something with Glass.  Making something.  The point the point is, though, you have cameras.  I mean, you have I mean, I have a I mean, there's plenty of ways  to put this camera on your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are ways you can put cameras, but I mean, they're not they're not  really that convenient, right?  I mean, and I have the look see which goes over your ear and is right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't seen a GoPro porn.  Where's my oh, I bet you there is GoPro porn.  I bet you there is GoPro porn. I don't know.  I bet there is.  I I somewhere I have my spectacles with the glasses with it's got an SD card in it.  And what is it called? Pivot head.  Dickey Bartolo does a lot of pivot head videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know what? That's what you may see, though, as you've seen people  try to put together the Google Glass clones and you will see a lot of,  you know, put that stuff together.  But the smart people would actually say, you know what?  Let's just put together something that is a Wi-Fi photo video device.  And it's as easy as taking a picture is tapping or it's as easy as taking a picture  is, you know, maybe you do speak to it or whatever.  Maybe it doesn't have the Wi-Fi aspect to it or whatnot.  But it shouldn't be that hard to build something like that for a couple  hundred dollars, if not less.  And that might give a bunch of people, you know, like.  75% of the usage that the that that Google Glass is already getting.  But then it would be interesting to see if you see these kinds of clones  and these sort of knockoffs of these developments come into that.  If it even further shapes or this acceptability that we're all walking around  with cameras and recording our our lives as we go around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For some reason, I just feel like that will be resolved.  There'll be some sort of netiquette established for glass.  Yes, make you feel better.  I don't I'm not too worried about that.  So now two out of the three hosts of All About Android  will be wearing glass during the program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so is Jason going to pick his up or is he going to get yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason, do you have you made an appointment yet?  Well, let me give you a credit card and then we should you should go down there  with a camera crew and because you should go down, right?  You're not going to have a male.  Yeah, go to Mountain View.  Yeah. All right. I'll give you credit.  If my wallet's in the desk drawer there, Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if you get them and you can't see anything because you got problems  with the glasses or contacts or whatever, can you you can give them the Leo  and cancel the transaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't wear glasses, do you, Jared?  You do. But you're in context.  OK, it's only on the right eye.  They don't have left eye versions. That's just it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can return them. I think it's 30 day return policy.  Oh, that's good.  And when you go down, I went to go pick them up.  If you go down and pick them up, there's a glass guide  who will sit down with you and fit them and do the nose pads  and show you how to use it.  And and so you'll sort it out pretty quickly, like right on the spot,  whether or not you can use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's kind of cool here. Give this to Jason.  He can charge it.  Now, by the way, I've just invented a new wallet that has look at this.  This is awesome. A chess set built in.  I don't need to carry a smartphone anymore.  I've got my. We're going to take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And come back in just a moment.  Gina Tripati, Daddy Sullivan, Jeffrey Jarvis.  The picture still holding up. Still looks good.  Google and Google. Google.  Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They make pretty good products, I heard.  Tell you, I got this thing on my face, so I must think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You are Google. Dark, dark, dark, dark, dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At least you're not calling me the other name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. What other name?  Glasshead. Oh, glass.  Yeah.  Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.com.  It is not a law firm, no better than a law firm.  LegalZoom lets you do legal work through their self-help services.  You direct it. You fill out a questionnaire and suddenly you've got a will.  You've got a trust. You've got an LLC or a corporation.  You've got your trademark, your patent, your NDA.  There's so much legal work you can do without a lawyer.  Just common sense. You've always known that.  Why spend hundreds, maybe thousands of dollars just to form an LLC  when you could do it at LegalZoom for $99?  And if you say, well, 99 bucks, I can't do that.  That's how Twits LLC was formed.  And still it's eight years later, still good, still works.  We have our own legal team now, and it's still LegalZoom.com does it all.  Well, not all, but they did that.  In fact, what they've got now that they didn't have before is this legal plan,  these legal plan attorneys, which are fantastic.  It means you can get advice from an experienced attorney in your state  for a fixed rate. That's awesome.  They have profiles of the attorneys on the legal plan,  including unedited customer reviews so you can pick the attorney  you think is going to be the best for what you need.  And then it's very simple to fill out the questionnaire and go through.  If you don't have a will, you know, the courts will decide where your kids go,  where your assets go, if something should happen to you.  You really want a will.  Living trusts, wills are just $69.  Copyrights, patents, trademarks.  Trademark, you know, something maybe you should consider for a lot of our audience.  You probably have a blog name or a brand or something.

Google hires a chief game designer.  What could that all mean?  Noah Falstein, Falstein, Falstein.  Is Google getting serious about gaming?  He asks TechCrunch, what would this be for?  I mean, there are games on Google+, but they're third party games, aren't they?  Does Google own any of those?  Is it for ingress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hmm, good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They had a game, Google had a game before this,  and they acquired an entire game company.  Did they did?  At one point. Yeah.  How interesting.  But yeah, no, they had a whole they were doing a whole.  It was even before Ingress.  They, because Ingress was Niantic.  They hired some game company, then they got rid of the game company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so Falstein worked at LucasArts 3DO DreamWorks Interactive.  He's now his title is chief game designer at Google.  He joined them last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was just investments that they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now Niantic, which they own, makes Ingress,  and Ingress makes a lot of sense in the glass universe  because it's a game you play with your smartphone as you move around.  It's basically an augmented reality game, basically.  What is it? Lively?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you not remember? It was Lively.  They launched it in Google Labs.  It was to allow people to interact with their friends and express themselves online.  They closed it in 2008.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if I'm Google, I think about gamification,  the gamification of things that are going to help me.  Like that's why Ingress is good, because it maps the world. Right.  So the gamification of something that, you know, I don't know what gamification.  I say gamification because I like to think of long slender gams.  No, it's just because it's just how it should be pronounced.  Look at this advanced game development topics on Google I.O.  Level up your Android game.  Practical Android games. There's a whole game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the game stuff makes sense because I mean, for all the talk about people  who like, well, Google Play has this many thousands of apps  and iOS has this many millions of apps and blah, blah, blah.  When you go back through and you actually look at what the top apps are, they're games.  Yeah. So a lot of them are stupid games, too, but they're games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, I don't think Google's in the interest.  It has any interest in making a successful app  unless it forwards their goal as having successful games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, so I had my you know, my two kids did this test where I gave them  Windows phones for a month, right, that they've shifted off the such a mean dad.  Oh, they asked for it.  They voluntarily said, do you have this phone we saw in the commercial?  And I said, yeah, I can. I've got that.  And so Microsoft, I said to Microsoft, hey, you want to try this thing?  Send down two phones and I'll I'll switch them out and we'll see how they go with it.  My oldest son gave up like within a day because there was no Instagram.  He was done right. No Instagram.  I do not need to use this phone. I need to use the iPhone or Android.  My youngest son has stuck with it.  He loves loves the Windows phone, with one exception that occasionally  he's going back to the iPhone, just this one particular game  with his brother, because it's only on the iPhone.  And I think that Google has a huge interest in having popular games  that are as good on Android as they are on the iPhone  or that only are available on Android,  because that can propel people to say, I want to get that device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe Faustine is not going to be a developer,  although his title is chief game designer.  Maybe he's a developer relations kind of a guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, we cover this.  Go ahead, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say, maybe he does something similar,  like with what Microsoft did with Halo, because if I recall  the whole history of Halo, it wasn't a Microsoft Studio product,  or just something that Microsoft worked very close.  That was Bungie and they bought Bungie.  But it helped make the Xbox. Absolutely.  That thing. And it may be that, you know, Google is at this point  where they're like, we need to have a flagship game  in the way that we have flagship Nexus devices,  because unless we set standards to a certain degree,  then maybe the other people won't go up there or understand  the kinds of things that they can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or here's another way to look at it.  Maybe and I'm not a gamer, so I don't know.  But is there a chance that Google, being a platform company,  could create a platform for game, good, great game creation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think this is what they're trying to do.  So we covered this on all about Android a couple of episodes back.  Actually, Android police, they do these APK tear downs  where they take APK, which is an Android app, and then unzip it  and basically look at the insides and see if there are any  there's any more information about things that Google is doing.  And interestingly, in the My Glass companion app,  there was all this code that that appeared to be related to games  around play services.  So play services get it looked as if play services  was getting real time and turn based multiplayer  invitation, in game chat, lobbies, leaderboards, achievements.  So to me, it looks it sounds as if and I think is going to happen  in I.O. next week, Google is going to is going to is going to announce  a game center, right, where they want developers to be using  Google plus sign in to have players sign in because it's because Danny's  right on the nose, right.  Games are the biggest biggest revenue generators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you're on it, Gina.  Google Plus and games, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Google Plus and games, exactly, because they already have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a game section on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but no, no, you want to involve you want to make Google  plus a game for some people.  That's what exactly involved in the game, the gamification of Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, right.  That is a game section in Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think it did as well.  I think that this is going to be Android based.  But remember last week, we covered the story where developers  that enable Google plus sign in on their apps that that that Google  aggregates stats like so if you search for Fandango in Google search results,  it'll say Google Plus users like this movie the most right.  So so Google wants this integration.  So they're going to be pushing that Google plus sign in next next week at I.O.  And I also think that they're going to make a big game related announcement.  I think this is going to be about I don't know if it's about the U.Y.A.  But I think it's going to be about, you know, part part of it is going to be about.  You I think part of it is that they know that games is games sell the best.  Right. And I think they want to make that platform for developers  to make awesome games on Android that you can't get anywhere else.  And I think they're going to use that integration across all their products  that they now, you know, can provide with the consolidated privacy policy.  This is all sort of building blocks on top of that.  I think that's that's where they're going to go.  I think this I think games can be a big part of the keynote next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the idea that it might be tied somehow to augmented reality and glass.  I'd love to see a glass specific games.  That I have to do with interacting with your environment.  And what Google gets out of it is more information about what's going on.  Maybe you're the next maybe you're the next Google Street View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Ingress or field trip on on glass would be awesome.  It makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they are, you know, do you know, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  L.A.Y.A. Yeah. Yeah.  That's an augmented reality browser.  I've got a reality program on a.  So if so, really, seriously, they can get rid of their whole street view fleet.  If they get enough people out there wearing glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. An image will be will be more up to date.  Right. If you have an army of folks taking.  I mean, you listen, glasses and on unless you have it on. Right.  And you're actually taking pictures.  But I mean, I take two to three times more pictures with glass  because it's so easy than I take with my smartphone.  And I felt like I took my smartphone. Right.  More data, more data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just more data.  Mm hmm. I don't think it's wrong to interpret Google hiring a gaming guy  not as a as a way to get into games or develop more games,  but as a way to create games that support Google's real mission,  which is gathering data.  Yes. That's why I think they could game.  I mean, look at look at Foursquare is a really good example of it's almost a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But well, not anymore.  They they they wish they had done that.  Really? They wish they hadn't done it.  Badges. Yeah, they don't want badges.  They want to be the location layer of the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they got all that information because of badges.  Yeah. It was a way in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But now now they they recognize that it's not the thing  and they're known just for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They want to get badges. Why should I check in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you get great information because you're going to be told  really interesting tips that that Danny went here last week  and they had they loved the right peanut butter cupcake.  You know, that's what they want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you guys get great tips from Foursquare when you check in?  Oh, yeah, it is awesome because we're in Petaluma.  All the tips are mine.  From two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It depends on where you're at, but I use it all the time.  I always joke that it's almost like my my personal tricorder.  I turn it on and I use that as an example of demonstrating my search.  Isn't just I type something into a box that's typically a box owned by Google.  If I get to an airport or I get to a city and I'm looking for a place to eat,  I can turn it on.  It knows where I'm at and it's showing me things that are nearby.  And I haven't even done a search. Right.  It's just there. It's very similar to what Google now.  That's precisely Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're kissing you right now because that's exactly what they want to be known for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. And they're great.  If you know, if you're in a place where people have been sharing stuff  and there have been times where I felt like people have actually shared more  in some places, some things than they have on, say, a Yelp.  In other cases, they're they aren't, you know, good or whatever.  And I think the challenge they have right now is they they need to  to probably get bundled in with a Facebook or a Google,  because I feel like they Google and Facebook are now pushing their own local  app so much that it's maybe more easy for people to contribute to those things  than Foursquare. And, you know, it's hard for me to get a sense on how much  Foursquare is getting beyond the group of people who started  because of the badge thing and then have discovered it in other ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting is in the really useful tool in the new Foursquare,  they they kind of buried it.  But in the settings, connected credit cards and savings,  they're encouraging you to enter your credit cards into Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in fact, we talked about this a year ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five five bucks from Amex every time I bought. Yeah. Yeah.  So if you've connected in credit cards, then you get exclusive savings  with Foursquare specials.  But isn't that really what everybody wants?  That's what Apple has. That's what Google Wallet has.  They got a credit card and it's one click to buy stuff.  Now they have a huge one, you know, leg up Amazon.  It makes sense that Foursquare would want you to do that.  They don't really promote it. I found it. It's buried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. Well, that's kind of a marketing deal with them.  But Foursquare, once again, the location layer of the net.  And that's and it's a social layer  that's going to give you better recommendations than a mere search engine. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But to give you a sense, like Foursquare on I'm looking at iTunes charts,  it is not in the top 100. Right.  You know, and that's it's pretty geeky.  Yeah. And, you know, in contrast, you know, these things like Tumblr  or something like that are showing up in there.  Even something like Pinterest is is there.  So that kind of that kind of  are you breaking through to the broader, broader stuff that you need to get to?  I don't know if they're there.  And I think that's because they've got great data  and they've got smart people who understand local,  really, really understand it well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Their view is that they've started on the coasts  and then they hope to, as other apps do, migrate into the heartland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt goes off the reservation again, talking at NYU Stern Business School.  He does it every time about Google and he says  people should have a delete button for the Internet.  Isn't this what Google's fighting in Europe?  The right to free free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His book, you know, I'm reading his book right now and it's it's  it's it's confusing because on the one hand in his book, he's saying like,  well, you know, once it goes out on the Internet, it's on the Internet  and you're never going to get rid of it.  And there's just nothing you can do about it.  And then it's like, but then we ought to have a delete button.  And it's like, well, I can't even go to your own search engine  and use a delete button, because if I were to say to you,  oh, my gosh, there's something really embarrassing, even the just the suggestion.  You're like, well, can't do anything about that,  because that's just what people are saying.  So I don't he says that sometimes I feel like he just says these things  just to like get people going.  But well, you know, I think it's more than that.  It's really interesting in his book.  He almost seems paranoid that kids somehow  don't have the ability to have any judgment until they become adults  about what they do or that until the age of the Internet,  people never did embarrassing things that could perhaps haunt them.  It's really very strong.  Like, well, you know, you have kids who don't have these social skills  who don't know what they're going to be doing.  Don't you know, we need to kind of protect them or whatever.  And I kind of feel like.  I think, you know, 20, 30 years, what you did on the Internet  when you were 18 is going to be like Bill Clinton saying, yeah, I never inhaled.  And then Obama saying, yeah, I inhaled.  You know, it's like those norms start to change.  And when everybody has their party pictures up when they were drunk  because they were 14 or whatever, and they shouldn't have been doing it.  I'm not saying that you should do this.  And boys, don't do that.  Well, we know, we know, we know that he's done that.  Then you're no longer embarrassed because everybody's done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's accepted psychological theory that adolescents take risks  because it's safer to take risk as an adolescent.  So from an evolutionary point of view, we're kind of programmed  to take risks at a younger age so we can learn.  So it's normal to make mistakes as a teenager.  Schmidt said in America, there's a sense of fairness culturally true for all of us.  If you have a teenage boy or girl who makes a mistake, does some sort of crime,  goes to juvenile hall, is released in our system, they can apply  and have that expunged from their record.  They can legally state they were never convicted of anything.  That seems like a reasonable thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of a crime?  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, but today that's not possible because of the Internet.  That seems to violate our innate sense of fairness.  This is the this is the quote.  This lack of a delete button on the Internet is, in fact, a significant issue.  There are times when erasure is the right thing.  And there are times when it's inappropriate.  How do we decide we have to have that debate now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is driving me driving me crazy in First Amendment land.  And I was on a panel  a few weeks ago here at CUNY with Bill Keller of the New York Times  was on the same panel.  They wrote a column about this afterwards.  And it sounds reasonable to say that.  But what's happened, in fact, is in some cases,  newspapers are being told to erase things from their archives.  That is a First Amendment issue.  That's a free speech issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's only a First Amendment issue if a government tells them to delete stuff.  It's not a First Amendment issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a law that says  there's a law that says that when this is off the record,  all the records are the record.  And then the other problem is, let's say the newspaper says,  well, you know, Danny Sullivan was arrested when he was 15 for blank.  And Danny says, no, no, that got expunged.  The newspaper says, well, no, but it's still it was still a fact.  It's still true. Happened.  And well, but now you have no proof of that because now the record has been expunged.  We can't do this. What drives me crazy about this?  You I'm offended by the notion that you can control knowledge,  that you can control facts. You can't.  Dana Boyd taught me this lesson.  You can control the use of knowledge.  But if we think you control knowledge, where does that end? Chairman Mao.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Gina, Ceasar's has just announced  we will not allow people to wear glass while gambling or attending our shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you'll see that everywhere in Vegas this weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, OK, so there's a little more attention probably on this delete button thing,  but I actually liked what Eric Schmidt said,  and it's probably worth repeating in another context.  The moderator, Nouriel Roubini, was apparently kind of grilling Schmidt  about Google tracking people.  And this is what Schmidt said, and I think this is important to hear.  Let me be very clear. Google is not tracking you.  It's not doing all these things.  Which is totally alive because it is.  Does everyone get that we're not doing this? Apparently, Danny doesn't.  He's talking about a different company or set of companies.  I think you're describing a world of tracking,  which I think is highly unlikely to occur because people will be upset about it  in the same way that you are. Governments won't allow it.  And it'll be bad business.  And ultimately, in a competitive market, companies want the consumer to be happy.  So it's true. Tracking in this context,  a situation where you go to people and say,  oh, here's our phone and we're going to track you.  People are not going to buy that phone. It's a bad business model.  So, Danny, you disagree you think Google is tracking you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course they're tracking you.  Every time I use Google, now it tracks me.  I have this thing on Google Maps. There's a button.  I'm looking at it right now. It's called My Places.  And when I click on it, it is quite literally tracking you.  See where I've been.  It's actually quite literally tracking you.  But you opted into that.  I was at Google headquarters on May 6th, so Google knows that.  But you opted into that, Danny. You turned that on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still tracking me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's still tracking me.  Depends on what the meaning of track is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it?  Rubini was saying basically he was trying to list all these ways.  And evidently Schmidt kept on trying to interrupt him.  Right. If he's saying like all these ways in which you're being involuntarily tracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't think Google is involuntarily tracking people.  No, I wouldn't agree with that.  Google is not surveilling you.  Even if they know where you've been, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's not. They're not.  There's no human going, hey, let's see where Danny's been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's no surveillance that says that makes a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has a record of all the places you've been to when you turn on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess the government can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So does my...  Hey, I'm better with that than the phone company does.  I'm not saying it's bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My Google now is better because it happens.  But yeah, Google has a pretty good idea of the places I've been to.  So does Apple. So does AT&T.  So does Verizon.  So does any number of people who have access to my phone.  So everybody's tracking you.  Our location gets shared all over the place.  So from from from Eric to say, well, we don't track you.  It's like, yeah, you do track people in lots of ways.  Do you track people voluntarily when they allow you to do it?  Sure. In lots of ways.  Do you track people in some ways that they probably aren't aware of  when they're all over the web? Absolutely.  You assign out anonymous cookies to people that they don't often know that they have.  And you can see them through their ad network and you can see them  virtually where they're going to be going.  You've got all sorts of applications that are on your own phones that turn on  and may tell people they're sharing stuff and they don't really think about it that much.  That's that's more down to the people than down to Google.  But yeah, there's a lot of tracking going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a very good point, Danny.  So is Eric lying or does he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I didn't hear the whole interview.  So that's why I'm saying if it's does Google track people?  Yes, of course, it tracks people.  Does Google track people in some evil, nefarious way?  I've got your stuff. Mostly no.  But he said they're not tracking. They are tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, they're tracking. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. He was trying to respond to Roubini.  Roubini was trying to paint a picture of a horrible, evil surveilling monster.  And and and Eric's reacting to that.  And let's be honest, we you know, we all hear this all the time.  And so I would kind of say the same thing.  Yeah, it is Bill Clinton time.  The fine is. But I would use the verb surveilling.  The tracking yet. Cookies track you. OK, fine.  Yes. But tracking is taken on an evil word.  And what I think Roubini is really trying to get to  what Schmidt was really trying to answer is, is Google surveilling you?  Is it is it tracking you for a purpose that is against your will  and and without your knowledge and that you would hate if you knew it?  And it's evil and awful.  No. Now, meanwhile, by the way, the government is trying to get Google to do that.  The government is trying to get Google to put back doors  into chats in ways that you will not be aware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Google was trying to do it with with CISPA.  Google was kind of supporting that effort.  They were trying to at least establish kind of parameters around that.  Well, let's take a break.  Some instruction. Yeah, let's take a break because Mike Elgin wants to defend  Jeff's wrongheaded support of the Google pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had my first I touched my I touched the pixel for the first time this weekend when I  went up to Google L.A. to pick up glass.  And so they had a pixel there to check people in.  And I said, oh, can I just can I just try something?  And the woman was like, sure.  And of course, the first thing I did was go to the verge dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you go full screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And and I started and I got a title, Leo.  Smooth as butter.  And she was kind of looking at me and I was like, that's all.  Never mind. See if there was.  That's all I wanted to do.  Whatever. That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So thank you. My glass guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I took when I went up to Google on Monday, I took the pixel out for the first time,  like on a road trip.  I was really nervous about it because I normally it's like MacBook Air and I want to  have all my stuff and it's great.  Didn't have any problems with that.  It you know, the battery not just fine.  And I was able to connect to my phone, had some problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Three against one for me include Mike Elgin now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Now, so Mike got his pixel.  He's using it. He says everything you've heard on entirely Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's I know he's like you trying to go and everything you've heard about the pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is wrong. Myth one, the pixels overpriced.  I don't know how you could say that's a myth, but OK, fine, whatever.  He says compared to what?  Compared to everything else.  Let's see page. That's the first page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, you can't get a screen that good and application files are on the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not true. In fact, more and more you're seeing apps that keep it on the the  touch screen is awkward and pointless.  He says that's a myth.  Pixels well designed and engineered is as well designed and engineered as an Apple  product, he says.  Not quite. He's not quite.  But it is better than any Windows product.  Yes. The pixels inconvenient.  He said it's not as inconvenient as you might think.  Now, this is a myth that he says there's no market for the pixel.  I don't think anybody's demonstrated a market for the pixel, but I actually agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with you on that, Leo. I don't think I don't think the point of the pixels are  market. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, all right. So I'm just wrong.  I'll admit it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So things you don't want people to say about your glasses, they're not too  that bad. They're not that bad.  Things you don't want people to say about your laptop.  It's not that inconvenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not that inconvenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's OK. I mean, it's it's still.  You'd still be better off spending the money on a retina.  You'd have a far more functioning machine for a similar price, perhaps a little  less. You know, I mean, you you would have a far more flexible machine and the  retina. It's not that big a difference.  Oh, it's slightly better than the retina, whatever.  The touch screen.  The touch screen is not anywhere near as good as, say, using the touch screen of  Windows, where you can actually touch the screen, pinch, zoom, do that sort of  stuff. I've used it a couple of times.  It's not as compelling as it is with Windows, which was actually built and  designed to have some touch screen stuff.  Unfortunately, you know, it's got all that other Windows stuff that kind of comes  with it. So, you know, it's nice.  But honestly, you'd probably be fine with just a Chromebook, you know, without  having to spend the premium on a pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I've said this before, they really should do a five or six hundred  dollar Chromebook. It's not as crappy as the as the netbooks that they're selling,  but not as high end as the pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Something is coming out with one that was on the run down.  Asus is coming out with one. We don't know what it's going to be yet.  You're going to see that, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Department of Justice says we don't need warrants to spy on your email  to read your Facebook posts.  And this is what you want to get mad about, not Google.  I am much madder about this, believe me.  Government documents obtained by the ACLU and then they gave it to CNET  say that there is a little bit of a split  within the Obama administration.  Justice Department prosecutors, investigators privately insist they're not  legally required to obtain search warrants for email.  The IRS said last month it will abandon the controversial policy that says we  don't need a warrant.  So apparently they're just going and asking they don't need a warrant,  although I think Google and others say no if you don't have a warrant, right?  Obama may back an FBI plan in related news to wiretap web users.  The Obama administration resolving years of internal debate,  according to the New York Times, is on the verge of backing a FBI plan  for sweeping overhaul of surveillance laws that would make it easier to wiretap  people who communicate using the Internet instead of phone services.  Right now you can easily tap a phone, but Skype makes it very difficult and others,  I'm sure Google Talk as well, make it very difficult to eavesdrop on our conversation, Jeff.  This is going to this is just yeah, talk about blood pressure raising.  So just watch with interest as our civil liberties go down the tubes.  But we've got very nice consumer electronics gear.  And that's what matters.  We're going to Google I.O. on Wednesday.  Are you excited?  So excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, let's get the changelog and then I'd like to get some predictions from y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about what we might see at Google I.O.  But ready the trumpets because it's time for the changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google changelog.  And now Gina Trapani with the latest from the U.S.  She's wearing it.  I'm wearing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gmail for iOS got an update that lets you link that links directly to other Google apps.  You can go into Gmail for iOS settings and you can say, hey, use the native YouTube,  Google Maps and Chrome apps to open any links inside my messages.  You can opt out of that by turning it off as well.  And that's the new update that came out this week.  Google now lets you add calendar events directly from Gmail if you click on a date and time.  So this is in Google I.O.  So this is English only for now.  And I believe this is also rolling out this week for people whose language is set to English.  But when you get it, if you get an email with date and time within the message,  you can click on that, the date and time and see your calendar.  So what you have on your Google calendar around that date and time.  And you can click on add to schedule if you want to, which is quite handy.  Google Plus just added remote desktop to Hangouts.  So this might be a little bit of a surprise.  So this means that you can, while you're hanging out with someone,  if they give you permission and you turn on the remote desktop feature,  you can troubleshoot their computer, see what they see on their screen,  remote control their computer via Hangout.  So you'll find this feature under the Hangout app section.  And the other user, of course, will need to grant you permission in order to let you see their screen.  Finally, the YouTube debuted a new trends map.  If you go to youtube.com slash trends map, I believe,  let me double check that URL.  I believe that's true.  It shows you trending videos in different areas of the United States only,  which is kind of cool.  I zoomed in on this and I was checking out trending videos by me amongst females my age.  I don't want to tell you if it's over below 35.  35 to 44.  Right now, the trending video is the guy who saved the woman who was the women who were locked in that house.  But it's really cool.  You can kind of see the different videos across the country.  You can see like, you know, in middle America, you'll see kind of country music artists trend.  Whereas, you know, you'll see the trailer for True Blood trending in California.  So you can see kind of different, different.  And you can filter by gender and age over time.  That's kind of neat.  Did I get that URL right?  It's youtube.com slash trends map, right?  Yeah, that's what we're looking at.  Yeah, that's all I got.  The change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Gina.  Sure.  So this is how tightly they're controlling Glass.  Jason couldn't use my credit card to buy it because it has to be in his name.  Whoa.  So he's using his own credit card.  We'll just have to reimburse you someday.  What?  No, we'll give them a check.  But isn't that they really don't want it to get out of your hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I kind of assumed that they would use your Google Wallet account, but they wanted a credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they use your wallet account, Jason?  No, they used a credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  1600 bucks.  Yeah, with tax, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And do you have to use Android?  There's no Glass app for iOS?  No, not yet.  Interesting.  Interesting.  You saw the Saturday Night Live spoof.  Fred Armisen.  I did.  Kind of true.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I'm too close to it.  The whole porn thing was a little much, but it was fine.  Although ironically, when I was using Scobel's Glass, somehow it was a little bit of a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I was using Scobel's Glass, somehow...  What was that that showed up, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was something like...  Oh yeah, you guys had issued a Google search, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By accident for porn.  I thought it was a Twitter message.  I couldn't figure it out. It was all of a sudden.  We need to go back to the logs and actually check the footage.  Something happened there.  So, here it comes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember how Junsbury made fun of PDA.  Yeah, farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a joke about the handwriting recognition on Newton.  Newton might be a good analog for this.  When Newton came out, I bought one and I had it.  I thought it was great.  But really, you had to be an early adopter to think it was great.  It was merely a look at what wouldn't really take off for at least 10, 15 years.  But there's a video somewhere of me holding...  I should find this.  My Newton saying,  Someday this will be smart.  Someday this will be small, light, connected to the internet.  You can take it with you wherever you go.  Oh, we're calling Jeff back.  Is that what that ringing is?  Now I'm seeing me.  His audio got a little bit off.  So we're just fixing the... Oh, the sync.  Gina, you should just say peacock.  I don't know what happens then.  Maybe you better not.  I'm not going to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Italian restaurant.  Italian restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, peacock was the WiFi password.  Right.  Peek, peek, peek.  It's very funny.  So what are we going to see at Google I.O.?  We will be covering good news.  I'm really happy to see that they've combined what used to be three keynotes into one.  That's great for us.  We will be doing live coverage of the keynote Wednesday morning.  Not me, Jeff and Gina, however,  because we're going to be in the keynote ourselves watching it.  But then what we're going to do after the keynote...  Do we tweet things to the crew?  Oh yeah, we could do...  Hey, you got glass?  You could be... Oh.  Wouldn't that be funny if Google forbade you to wear glass to the keynote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm thinking.  I would be surprised if they did actually.  I'm thinking.  I'm thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would be surprised if they did actually.  Well, they do ask people to shut down their WiFi,  to turn off their WiFi because it's such a...  So many people, and so many of those people have,  you know, three WiFi enabled devices.  But if I get a signal in there...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I've got...  So I'm going to bring my...  What kind of phone do you have?  AT&T?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't tell anybody.  T-Mobile's really good around here.  I'm getting like...  ...because nobody uses it.  Awesome.  It's the best-kept secret in cellphones.  All right. I'm not talking about it.  So, I'll bring...  I'll bring an AT&T and a Verizon phone.  You have T-Mobile. We'll find the best signal.  You can pair the glasses to that  and then you can interview me and Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be great.  That'd be really fun.  What are we looking at now? I don't know!  Well, they're going to livestream it.  They're going to livestream it, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Tom and crew will be here doing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It won't be the same as broadcasting it from your glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but they can cut to you then, right?  And now, let's see what Gina's seeing.  It's the same thing, only way far back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're really tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vic Gundotra's this tall.  But...  And then we'll come running back and we'll do this.  We can Google roughly the same time, I think.  One or two...  Driving very carefully over the bridge.  We're going to go so carefully down the middle of the bridge.  We're going to have a police escort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Last year, I think we were like  a half an hour or 45 minutes late  because I had to pick up a rental car.  So there was a little delay there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm throwing you in the back of my Mustang.  Whoever has the shorter legs has to sit in the back seat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I do.  Jeff isn't as tall on Skype as a person.  He's a very tall person.  People always say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're so tall, I didn't think so.  I guess my personality is short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This will be good. We'll have good coverage of Google I.O.  both coverage live of the keynote  and then post-facto  coverage with Jeff, Gina and Leo.  Any idea of what we're going to see?  Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google TV is going to be big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  No.  A new Nexus 7.  I think a new Nexus X.  A Motorola successor to the Nexus 4.  Vanilla Google.  You think they'll actually release it?  Why not?  Actually we'd know about it because  they'd have to have FCC testing by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It also reports  of a Nexus 4 with LTE.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be nice.  The Nexus 4 has LTE.  Just not on Verizon.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't have LTE at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The report is that there's an antenna in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Internationally it might.  It doesn't have the frequencies.  There's no LTE internationally.  Yeah, there is.  Just different frequencies.  Different frequencies.  They don't have it at all in Europe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  It was a big mess with the selling of  bandwidth.  They just got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room says  it works on T-Mobile LTE if you  use a trick.  I think they

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  disabled that.  But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the new Nexus 7 going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this the one they already announced?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Didn't we hear rumors that there was going to be  an updated Nexus 7?  They might drop the price.  It might be a little faster.  A couple more features.  Let me see if I can dig up that link at one point.  They're going to  announce at least one  new device if not several.  Every I.O. there's several new  devices. I wouldn't be surprised if it was  the Nexus 7 was one of their  most successful amazing  devices that they've ever created.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A new interface for  Google Maps according to the Google Operating  Systems blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a lot of maps  stuff in the program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lots of Google Plus stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Games.  I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  love to you know I'd love I still want to see this.  Please Google you have a week to develop it.  A Facebook home version  for Google Plus.  Put that right on the Android. It'd be beautiful.  Then we'll all be back with  Plus. Just use Plus Plus Plus  all the time. Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that there's going to be a  refresh of the failed Nexus Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chat room question. Pretty sure we're not going to hear anything.  How about 4.3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see 4.3 right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the biggest thing that ever came out  at an I.O.?  Glass.  Glass. Well but that was we already knew that was  there. Was there anything that was any surprise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wave. Was Wave announced at I.O.?  Wave was announced at I.O. Wave was

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  demoed at I.O. I can do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Peacock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Peacock.  I can do this.  If I had glass it would have been so much easier.  You know last year was the first I.O. I missed  since they started doing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Sergey  on the roof of Moscone Center was pretty  hot last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here we are. Products announced  during past Google I.O. Keynote.  So here we are. Classitude. Do you want the rundown?  Just pick one. Pick the biggest one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the biggest one on that list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android.  That's pretty big.  I.O. 2008.  That's big.  Chrome Store. Google Music.  Kinda.  Google TV didn't make it.  How about Babel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Babel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's not a very good track record  of stuff coming out of Google I.O. that goes anywhere.  How about  the stuff that came out that was supposed to be big that died  in the last few years?  Friend Connect. App Engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Wave.  Google C.Q.  Google C.Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually the worst time to announce stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You kinda don't want to be announced during it.  I think Babel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Babel's ready don't you think?  What do they most want developers to work on now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chromebooks.  Chromebooks were announced.  Chrome Keybook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love  to see  what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not really announced yet.  I'm actually kinda excited about Babel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I hope it's good.  How about a write API for Google Plus?  Yeah, write API for Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's going to be tons of Google Plus.  They could do that.  They could have done that so long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not going to do that.  They're not going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the next wave of Google Plus?  What could they announce?  They're going to announce something about Google Plus  because it's the thing they care about most.  What could that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By law, everybody has to use it.  To use Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where is it not at yet?  The gaming connection

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  between Google Plus and Android  I think will be the game center.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leaderboards and sharing games and  posting activity and games to Google Plus.  You know, that activities API  you could publish what you're doing.  We'll be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll be there and we'll let you know.  You'll hear it here first.  And then our analysis last.  I'm mad at Yahoo.  Marissa Meyer had the chance to buy to-do text.  Instead she bought that Astrid to-do list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was actually great for to-do text  because everyone was like,  companies can get shut down. I can lose my data.  I can't lose my data when I own it.  And it's in my own dropbox.  So I had a spike in sales.  So thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People are smart.  So Astrid, which I thought a very good to-do list.  It was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Most people would say, oh, if to-do text doesn't do what you need to do.  Get Astrid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I was fine with.  Or any .do.  Well, now there's Astrid's gone.  Are they shutting it down?  They're going to...  Apparently they're pulling it out of the Play Store.  Oh, they're pulling it out of the store.  That's right.  4 million downloads to date.  That's a pretty big number.  If you've previously purchased Astrid paid products,  Yahoo will give you a refund.  That doesn't sound good.  How much is it?  Well, I think Astrid's free.  But then there's these locale plugins and power packs.  Oh, the power packs.  There's subscriptions.  So, wow.  Refund. That's pretty hardcore.  All right.  Good for them?  Congratulations.  Good for them and good for you.  I'm glad to hear that people are smart.  That's what we should mention.  To-do text, your to-do list is stored in a text file.  In text format.  In Dropbox.  You can even have command line interfaces to it.  Which I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a bash shell.  I had a bash script that would do all that stuff.  I got that from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice.  I'm excited about Dropbox enabled apps.  Or not even just Dropbox.  Drive, Google Drive, whatever.  Would you support Drive with the to-do text?  Yeah, we could.  We had on our to-do list forever,  support multiple cloud providers.  We had a project that's an open source thing.  We just stuck with Dropbox and we're just working on the UI.  But we could easily do a version  or add Drive as an option.  To store there.  Have you seen Fargo.io?  This is Dave Weiner's outliner.  This also syncs to Dropbox.  Pretty cool.  I like the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the one that works with WordPress as well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Fargo is an outliner.  But he points out you could use it  to do a list or a notepad.  And it stores the docs in Dropbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's an OPM file.  So I love this.  Open standards, your own cloud storage, distributed cloud storage.  You could build a Chrome app  that syncs between  local storage and your cloud provider  of choice.  And you don't need takeout.  You don't need to depend on a centralized service.  You can own your own data and store it.  Use different clients for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright, we're going to take a break.  We're going to take a break with Gina's tool.  Our tip.  Our number of the week.  Coming up, triangulation.  With Mr. Adam Corolla  is going to be our guest.  He's going to give me some love advice.  But first, a word from  Hover.com.  The reliable domain name  registration and management service  that we use and we recommend.  It's simple, it's honest, it's clean, it's easy to use.  No more of the upsell.  No more of the sexy ads.  It takes the hassle out of owning and managing  domain names.  Great domain management tools.  It's clean.  I just love it.  And by the way, they have some great customer service.  When you call Hover.com during business hours,  you'll be talking to a live rep  who is empowered and eager to help you.  No more putting you on hold  or transferring you to somebody who could do something.  You're going to talk to somebody  right away. It's awesome.  They've got all the big top level domains.  Often people go there and they told me  to search for .com and one of the things they do now  is when the .com address is not available  they also show you that same domain in .net  which is really actually a pretty  good domain name. They also have  some of the unusual ones  .tv, .pro, .mobi, .biz  country codes like .ca,  us, asia, .uk.  Of course .org.  It is a great place.  This week in Google.net.  See? Somebody's already got .com.  We could be a non-profit .org.  Oh wait a minute.  There's that week in Google.com.  That's the other show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This week in Google.pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the bizarro.  We should get one in German.  You could be Farfugnugen  or whatever it is.  Farfugnugen in Google.  Yeah. So I want you to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go to Hover.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way we're going to give you a deal  10% off when you use our offer code twig.  So hover.com slash twig  will automatically  activate that code.  You'll get 10% off  your first purchases.  Hover.com slash twig. Use the offer code  twig  and enjoy.  It is a really great service. I'll get all my  domain names over there now. And new ones  all the time. Because it's fun to register  domains. Now  time for  our tip and tool and  pick and number.  Let's start with Gina Trapani and her  tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just a quick little tip this week. Google has  added street view images to its one  box results or an address.  Which is kind of neat.  So if you Google say for instance 140 Keller  Street, Petaluma, California.  You'll get a little  map, a little Google map, the top of your search results.  Which you'd always get. But then you also get the street view of  that address. So I'm excited for you to get your sign  up Leo. Because maybe your sign  will be right there at the top of your search results.  And you can click on the street view image  and go straight into street view mode  inside Google Maps. Which is nice.  It will transport you directly  to right outside the brick house. And then you can walk in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because we did do a 3D internal  mapping. By the way  that's where the sign is going to go.  See that old sign is down  and it's going to go right there above the window.  It's going to be just copper  3D letters that are going to stick out that say just TWIT.  Very subtle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you have to go through zoning stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently not. No there is some permitting.  Yes. Actually that's part of the cost.  But see you can go right in. And apparently  we're on some list of Easter eggs or unusual  things that you found while inside  Google Street View. Yeah you're on the best  right. Yeah some sort of weird  weird thing like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah this is awesome. How did you arrange this?  Did you have somebody come in with the backpack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah you have to pay. There are people who are  trusted providers. Somebody contacted us.  I think it was from Texas.  There's me with the booze and the dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh nice. So you were doing a show  while they came in at that self-porting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually I came back the next day because I wasn't  when they first did it I wasn't there. Yeah I was doing  it looks like the radio show. Yeah.  Sweet. Yeah.  I'm surprised Gina that you did not mention  Pushover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah I've been playing with Pushover.  I really dig it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you use Pushover Leo? Well when I saw  your tweet or whatever it was was it a plus  or a tweet? I immediately  signed up for it because I think this is really  kind of intriguing. Yeah it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of a developer tool right now.  So it's an expensive app relatively.  It's a five dollar mobile notifications app.  And it's just a way  for some apps work where they can push  notifications to it. And I actually wanted building a  Pushover plugin for ThinkUp because  we just haven't gotten to the place  we're going to build our native app yet.  But I wanted to get notifications so I hooked it up to  Pushover. But IFTTT  if this then that has some  hooks in the Pushover. So you can say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you probably want to use it. Yeah. So if you say

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  hey if I want to know immediately if  an RSS feed changes for example  in IFTTT you can say  if this RSS feed changes send me a Pushover  notification. So yeah I didn't bring it up because  it's kind of more of a developer tool  I guess right now. But it is cool if you want  to chain together recipes in IFTTT.  It's a neat, it's a pretty neat app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they give you code snippets for every  it's very simple. It's JSON so it's very simple  to add that capability. And watch  I'm going to send myself a notification here.  I've set up my  phone. I'm doing this on the website  and default I'm going to send  myself a bugle and I'm going to say  hey Leo  it's time  for triangulation.  And then I'll send this message and I'll  go to my S4 and I'll play a little  bugle sound.  It's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then the little message

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pops up that tells me it's time for triangulation.  So it's kind of cool.  And I feel like there's going to be  ways to use this.  So you know things like your nest  might be able to use it to say hey it's getting  hot in here I'm taking off my clothes or something.  Some sort of useful thing.  Any kind of monitoring scripts or

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  anything that you just want to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that something go wrong. It's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Instead of getting it as a message  or getting a phone call.  You can get a push over notification.  And it's nice you can set quiet hours.  You can say you sound for this or not.  It's really flexible. It's a good app.  Well worth the five bucks.  Pushover.net I think.

Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis your  number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I guess given the title of the show  I've got to do this one.  Google hit an all time  high at  873.88 per share.  Market cap now of  $289.84 billion  dollars worth more than Microsoft  in all possible ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  That's an 875.  Wow.  Amazing.  Hey Danny's anything you want to recommend or mention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know I would say  that if you haven't  if you've got an iOS and you haven't tried the new  Google search app you should go do it. It's been very  interesting. It's the one that gave you the  Google Now functionality.  And when it came out last week  I showed like my trainer  I was like hey you have iPhone you should check this out.  I saw him on a fun day on a Friday. He's like  oh my god this is great.  I'm getting all this stuff. This is like change my  life.  He really liked it.  But it is it's really  Google Now is really developed into this  pretty awesome predictive search  tool where it's coming up with information before you think  about it. And what I think's most interesting  that I found is that you know when they  relaunched the Google search app in October  of last year you could speak to it  and it would talk back to you kind of like  Siri and that got it up to the top  16 of the most  downloaded apps on iTunes.  And then it kicked all the ways down and  then before this latest update it was around  It is in the top 10 right now and it's been  holding that way so far. So  suddenly you know Google has finally  gotten something in terms of Google search  that's causing people to think  oh yeah I should search Google  but not just by doing it through Safari  in that little box. I should actually use  the Google search app a lot more and I think  Google Now has a lot to do with it. So I'd say check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am going to  I've done a review already of the Galaxy S4.  I ordered  the 8 core  unlocked 8 core version. That's the one  I'm using on T-Mobile. It works really great with  T-Mobile. And I was  using as you remember the HTC One was  very impressed by that but I have to say  this is much more of a pure Android  experience. HTC's really  kind of munged up a lot of the  features of Android. If you want more  Android this is a great phone I have to say.  Camera not as good maybe as the HTC One  but an interchangeable battery gives  it a leg up. I'm a big fan.  This is an Incipio case  but I have a couple others on order. But  the Galaxy S4 very, very,  very nice. Is it a big step  above the three? No.  The screen is great. I mean 1920x1080.  There's a lot of  crapware on it. They really  loaded it up but you can ignore it.  And you can even disable it so you don't  see it. Nevertheless  I have to say the speed,  the better screen,  and the cameras  got some nice features to it.  Some really gimmicky features to it.  It's just like a  somewhat better Galaxy S3.  It's the 4.  It's the next one. It comes with a  ridiculously low paltry amount of  memory, free memory, about 8GB.  But I put an SD card  in there and I guess 16GB versions are coming.  But my real tool  of this week is Google.com.  You got to go see the Google Doodle for this week.  Can you show my screen Chad?  This is just this year. Today's Google  Doodle is so awesome.
