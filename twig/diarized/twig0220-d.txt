Really whatever's on our minds because we've got the best panel ever as always.  Gina Trapani is here from thinkup.com.  We're going to talk about that brand new business coming down the line.  Founding editor of Lifehacker.  Hi Gina. Mother to Etta.  Also here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis of the City University of New York.  He's a professor of journalism at CUNY.  He also is the author of numerous books including most recently Public Parts.  And his blog is buzzmachine.com.  Gina's is smarterware.org.  Although I bet you we don't see a lot of postings lately because she's been kind of busy on something else.  We're going to talk about that in a minute.  Little bit busy.  Also really glad to have Aaron Newcomb here.  He's a regular on many of our shows including Floss Weekly and All About Android.  You were here last night and we said, yeah, you want to come in for Twig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I did All About Android last night, Floss Weekly this morning and then this week in Google.  Busy guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Aaron, you've got a new job since last we talked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A new job at NetApp. Yep, that's right.  Doing solutions marketing for them with their storage products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a lot of fun.  Good to have you.  Glad to be here.  I don't know where to start.  We know where to start.  Beacon for Google.  Is that where we should start?  I think we should start with ThinkUp.  Oh, we should start with ThinkUp and then we'll talk about Google's new privacy policy.  Thanks, Jeff.  You're absolutely right.  So thinkup.com.  Now, this is not a new product because we've been talking about ThinkUp for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is the thing I have been waiting for.  The dummy in the show has been waiting for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The hosted version of ThinkUp.  Is that right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, this is the easy sign up.  So ThinkUp is an open source app I've been working on for four years.  I've talked about it here on the show quite a bit.  But it's an app that you install on your web server and not everybody has a web server.  So thinkup.com is basically going to be the wordpress.com to the open source app.  It's going to be the hosted sign up, sign up centralized service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'll vouch for it because I've been using ThinkUp for over a year and it's amazing the analytics you get.  Now, I've just been using it for Twitter, but this won't be just Twitter, right?  No, it won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be right now the open source app supports Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Foursquare.  We just had Instagram pull requests come in and we get analytics from Bitly and we get location data from Google Maps.  I mean, it's a totally pluggable architecture.  So yeah, we basically hook it up to new services every few months.  We just did Google Summer of Code, actually, which is an open source mentorship program that Google runs.  And in fact, I'm going to be up at the Googleplex this weekend.  There's a mentor summit for all the mentors in Summer of Code.  Yeah. And one of my students, who I mentored this summer, built the Instagram plugin.  So I'm really, I'm really excited about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're doing a kind of a Kickstarter thing.  If you go to thinkup.com, you can join now and in fact, kind of pledging that you will be a member at $60 a year, five bucks a month for the basic plan.  That means one name for all the services just mentioned.  There's a pro plan that lets you do 10 names for every service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Up to 10 accounts plus API access and, you know, kind of access to our beta builds.  So that's the pro membership for folks who are kind of power users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We probably should do the executive since we are an organization and want to stake in your future.  So what do you get? You get the book, which is kind of cool insights, and then you get the service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. So we've got an incredible collection of interviews from some of the like some of the most really interesting people.  We haven't announced who's in the book yet, but trust me, it's going to be really good.  We're doing a series of interviews about how some of the most creative and smartest people online use social media.  That'll be the book. So you get the e-book.  That's a special just for the crowdfunding campaign.  But when you back the crowdfunding campaign at thinkup.com, you basically you're subscribing to the service.  You're buying an annual membership, essentially.  You don't get charged until we actually launch, which is going to be January 15th.  So you're just saying, hey, I want to pre-join.  And that's kind of a way for us to turn our users into our investors.  You know, we just want to be we want to build this product and be as accountable to our users as we are to our investors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you are you going to launch no matter what?  Or is this kind of contingent on raising enough money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're going to launch no matter what. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Which is exciting.  Yes, we do. We actually we closed a call it a modest round, a modest non-tech crunch  or the round of funding from some really great investors.  And we haven't announced the details of that yet.  But our goal as a company is to be as sort of open and transparent as possible.  So we're in the process of getting the final OK from all the lawyers.  And we are actually going to publish the details of our round of funding  because we kind of want to help make that whole process of how we're going to do it.  And that process, which has taken a really long time for us and has been a huge educational thing for me, more transparent  and make it give give some insight to other young companies who want to start doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We talked about it in the car coming back from Leo's when we were there for I.O.  Just enough numbers. How many times did you have to make the presentation to get the round done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man. I mean, luckily, Anil, my co-founder, is amazing and tireless  and is like the best I've ever seen. Like anybody do anything with a pitch deck.  I mean, he really took the burden of that off of me and he really did the pitches.  I went to the meetings. He did a lot of the pitches. I was writing a lot of the code.  But, yeah, it was a slog. It was a slog. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we should say it's Anil Dash, who many of us remember from Six Apart.  He was there for a long time and he's been your partner on Think Up for a while.  Yes, quite some time. And a great guy. Just one of the just I love Anil.  Yeah, he's amazing. Yeah. So this is a good team. Is that you in the background?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just going to ask. No, that wasn't me. There she is.  Yeah, there I am. I'm in the video at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I've signed up and I've shared it on Twitter and Google Plus and I invite everybody to do the same.  It's easy to do. Think up dot com. And trust me, I think, you know, if you have questions, browse around.  When you see the kind of valuable stuff that you learn, I visit Think Up a lot just because I love the  insights. And this has just been on Twitter. I can't wait to add all my other social networks to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you so much. And, you know, we were really we were really inspired.  I was really inspired by a lot of the things that we've talked about, particularly, Jeff, your principles on the Internet or or  or, you know, acting on principle. And and and Anil also pushed this.  You know, we published our our kind of values as a company.  And like part of our goal with this campaign is not only to launch a product that hopefully customers think is valuable enough to pay for,  but also to build a company that's extremely, you know, that's that's accountable to its users first.  And that is open as open source as the source code is for the app and is transparent and forthright.  So, yeah, thank you.  You know, it's hard, you know, when you when you publish a company's values, it's like, you know, it's like a kind of company have values.  It's like, no, of course, people have values. Right.  And it always I was tweeting the other day, like, is this, you know, does this trip your BS detector when you hear a company has values?  But it's about sort of creating the ground rules, you know, like this is what we are setting out to do.  And you should call us out on it if we're not doing the right thing.  And so anyway, I want to thank you, Jeff, for we're kind of hammering home the importance of principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's awesome. Don't be evil. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can still if you run a server and you know a little bit about it, configuring for PHP and so forth, you could still install think up on your own servers.  Right. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The app is not changing.  The app is open source.  It will remain open source.  And in fact, the company the purpose of the company is to fund development of the open source app.  That's not going away.  You will always be able to install it on your own server for free.  You'll always be able to hack it and modify it and fork it and send pull requests back to us.  That doesn't change.  And in fact, it would violate the license if we didn't if we did change that.  So this isn't to end the open source development or to make think of not free.  It's actually the opposite.  We're we want to spend our time instead of doing stupid pitches and VC conference rooms.  We want to spend time actually building a product.  So that's far as partially why we're doing that.  It's a crowdfunding campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That really is the WordPress model of the time.  And I talked to Polaris WordPress's VCs way back in the time and Matt Mullenweg and they got convinced to leave WordPress.org as the open source.  And that it's really a sensible model because everybody who uses WordPress has to add to the code base.  Everybody who writes extensions for it adds to it.  WordPress.com is the smartest company on top of it.  The first in.  But they benefit from all that free work that's going into WordPress.org.  It's it's it's smart.  Yeah, it's a win win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a win win.  And we're going to get Jean on Floss Weekly to talk just about exactly what she just said.  So we're going to we're going to absolutely do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one of the neat things about open source is the different models people choose the different ways.  It's a great way to experiment with new ways of thinking about business.  And I just this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's also about try to think it struck me from all this NSA stuff and listening to Steve on security.  So depressing is I know.  But but the notion that open source is the path to trust.  Yes.  And to do what you're right, Jean, and not just as code, but as a company and as hardware to as we get as we get into that.  It's it's all the more necessary and all the more laudable.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want to just in a nutshell describe the analytics that you get from ThinkUp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. So So ThinkUp is a really simple app.  It's a stream of insights.  Right. So the first iteration version one was kind of like Google Analytics.  You know, you kind of went to this dashboard and you just get a bunch of charts.  And we think that that's valuable, but we think that the app should do more.  It should tell you what do the charts mean.  So what the app is is a very simple reverse chronological stream of insights on things that are happening in those charts.  So things like, you know, what was the tweet that made my followers the happiest last week?  Do people like my old profile picture better than my new one?  Did anyone who is well known or have a lot of followers retweet something of mine?  And we send an alert, you know, if you do do any of my new friends or followers work at Google or work at Facebook, that kind of thing.  So it just it just pings you. It's just a little it's kind of like a newsfeed.  But it's of insights about your activity, about what's going on with your activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it provides you with all your tweets.  There's no limit to the number of tweets you can archive.  It archives all your tweets. And Steve Martin used it to create his book of Twitter aphorisms.  He's very funny and the comedians very funny.  And so Gina hooked him up and got him set up on ThinkUp so that he could have all his tweets.  I hope that was in the deck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was. It was. You know, there's a thing like I love what Google does with data liberation.  I get it. But to me, an export link is just not enough.  Right. So I can export my tweets now. Right.  So if I went to Twitter right now and I clicked on export my tweets, great, I get a zip file of my tweets.  It's not enough. The minute that I tweet something new, that that file is out of date.  And it's just a dead zip file on my hard drive. It's not enough. Right.  I should be getting all of my data. And when I say all of my data, I mean the replies from my friends.  I mean the favorites. I mean the links. I mean the expanded links.  I mean the number of clicks per link. Right.  And this is all stuff that Twitter has and knows about me and Facebook has and knows about me.  And they use that data to advertise to me more effectively. And I have no problem with that.  But I also can learn a lot more about myself and how I can get better.  You know, imagine it is sort of a quantified self for my social persona.  And I should be able to get that.  So while I love data liberation, I'm really glad that these networks are giving us the opportunity natively to export our own data.  Because that again, feature zero, right?  Like that's what we should be able to get when we put out. I just don't think it's enough.  So that's why I built ThinkUp because, you know, it's constantly syncing your data, learning about what you're doing,  and then telling you what you should know about what you're doing.  Versus, you know, just locking up those kind of insights inside, you know, the company's ad systems, ad targeting systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, when I export my data from Twitter, though, all I'll get is the tweets that I've done, not all the rest of that wonderful stuff.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does Twitter have to cooperate? You have Twitter's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is in ThinkUp, yeah.  I can add that in ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we are going to add and import your archive possible features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you join ThinkUp now, you can go back and add history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, from the API, programmatically in the API, you can go back 3,200 tweets.  I think Twitter hasn't, particularly Twitter, they haven't increased that.  But if you have an archive, we are going to have a feature that will let you just import your archives.  You have to export from Twitter, import your archive, and then that gives you kind of all the flashback kind of stuff.  Like, hey, what was I talking about three years ago?  What was, you know, what was, you know, what's the last time I, you know, who's someone that I haven't talked to and over a year who I'm friends with, that kind of thing?  Because we do kind of a lot of look back stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would make sense for Twitter to support this because it makes people use Twitter more, I would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the goal, ThinkUp's goal, and I know this is kind of squishy and people were like, what does this mean?  But, you know, our headline on the crowdfunding campaign is like, feel good about social networking, right?  Like, this is supposed to help people get more insight into what's going on on their network and appreciate what's going on in the network and make them tweet more and make them like more and make them participate more.  Because fundamentally, we think that more participation is a good thing.  Right. Right.  But we want to we want to make users participation participation more mindful, more thoughtful, more informed and more effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So now we have to push this show.  We have to push Google Plus to enable export, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Google Plus definitely has a lot of data locked up into it.  And it does have an API and we do have Google Plus support.  The API could be better.  It's read only.  That's what that's OK for us because ThinkUp is read only.  It doesn't post for you.  But yeah, I mean, plus ones and replies.  I mean, there's lots of lots of possibilities for for finding out, you know, making new connections and finding better content and figuring out what's what was important to you in the past and what is now what's important your friends through that data.  And yeah, they could do a better job with their API.  I'd like to see more improvements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What's the service that's not cooperating that you would most want to have an API?  Oh, that's a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, that's a really good question.  I mean, happily, we're in a place in 2013 where the most popular services, which I would argue are, you know, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and, you know, to some degree, Foursquare and Path like have pretty pretty good APIs.  There aren't that many services that don't have an API at all.  There's always like things that I wish certain APIs did right like like Twitter's API.  Twitter is always kind of focused on like follower count.  For example, that's something it's very easy to find out how many people follow someone on Twitter.  But you can't you can't very easily find out how many people are subscribed to someone, for example, on Facebook.  You can get their subscribers and page through 100 times, but they don't offer like a total, you know, so I have little nitpicks about, you know, I wish there were particular methods that were available, say on Facebook as anywhere else.  But there's there's no one company that I'm like these, you know, this is, you know, the API is completely terrible.  They all sort of offer their own take on what they think is important.  It's really interesting to see what those companies value, you know, through their API.  You know, they offer API methods for data that they think is valuable.  So on Twitter, followers is really, you know, is a valuable and important thing.  Your home timeline is a big thing for Twitter, but it's not as much on on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Does Reddit have one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a really good question.  I actually haven't looked into the API.  It should. It's open source.  I can't imagine that it doesn't.  Oh, yeah. Yeah, they do.  And I'm sure it has a I'm sure it has a wonderful API, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think having this federated view is is awesome.  I mean, this is what's was especially for companies or for people trying to, you know, that are kind of in the industry, so to speak, as we are that want to reach out and see, OK, what's my reach?  Am I am I doing well on Facebook?  Am I doing well on Twitter?  You know, maybe Google is really taking off all of a sudden.  What did I do differently there that, you know, made that happen?  So I think having these insights, especially for companies or individuals that are promoting themselves to a certain degree, hopefully not out of, you know, not out of ego, but like, you know, people like us that are doing shows and things we want to reach out to as many people as possible.  This is super valuable information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, yeah, thank you.  We're definitely targeting power users.  We're definitely targeting individuals.  I mean, one of the main things that we think is that social media works best for individuals, right?  Like the Barack Obama account on Twitter has way more followers than the White House account, right?  Because one is a sort of a faceless organization and one is an individual person.  So we think that social media works best with individuals.  But we're definitely targeting people like the host on this network or people who have a YouTube channel or an Etsy store Kickstarter, people who are, you know, purposely trying to gain audience, trying to have conversations, not people who are going to, you know, buy 10,000 followers for 100 bucks and then submit a report to the church.  And then you can send a report to the chief marketing officer and try to prove that, you know, the brand is doing better, right?  Like this is for people who actually care and who want to be honest and authentic.  I know that that's become kind of a buzzword recently, but individuals who really do want to get better at participating in these networks because they're powerful things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how well does it scale right now?  I mean, I mean, what if I was a company and I wanted to roll something like this out or use this to because I've got a, you know, just for my like main brand presences on Google Plus and Facebook and whatever else.  I mean, would it scale well enough for a company that's doing lots of things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, look, it's a it's a it's a PHP MySQL application.  If you're a company, we ran it for the White House.  They have tons of followers and get just gigabytes and gigabytes of of of responses and engagement from their followers.  We did a lot of work on optimizing and and and making sure that we had kind of, you know, that the app scales for people at that, at that, you know, at that rare air.  That is extremely rare for the big.  I mean, we're really kind of targeting people with, you know, individuals who have bigger audiences than than most of the population.  I mean, we are targeting for for for power users, but for, you know, really, it kind of depends.  It depends on the on how how how popular the brand is or or how many followers they have.  But it pretty much works for, you know, ninety five percent.  We do run into those few users who say, hey, my crawl time's out.  And it's like, you've just got so many so much data that it's just looping through pages and pages and pages.  But we built in a lot of stop gaps for that kind of situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've got to imagine if it works for the White House, that's going to cover that's a pretty good population.  And yeah, and see Martin today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've had some really big users with over a million.  We've had a million plus follower users and then crashed and we fixed it.  The thing was that we have four years of development and experience running the open source app behind us.  So I'm really excited. The rollout in January is going to be really super solid and stable because we've been building this thing for so much time.  This isn't brand new code. This is code that's been stress test and iterated over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excellent. Great. Again, think up.com and you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do it yourself. Sign up today. Thank you.  It's going to happen no matter what. But sign up today.  It's nice to have a built in customer base, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, look, frankly, yeah, it's we want to we want to launch with a customer base.  We want to be bringing revenue as you should. I can't imagine you wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So good. Congratulations. That's really great. Thank you. Thank you so much.  Let's talk about Google. You know, they're trying to make a little money on the side. I don't blame them.  You know, it's an expensive thing running all those servers and and so forth.  So they changed their privacy policy in advance.  Unlike Facebook, where they just change it and then wait till you find out, they change it in advance to let you know that at some point in the future,  unknown when they're going to start using what you plus one or I don't I don't know exactly what the criteria will be to do an endorsement ad to your friends.  Kind of like Facebook, right? Is this like sponsored posts on Facebook?  Well, it's like Beacon was. Ah, that's where it is different than Facebook because it's not just on Google.  Plus, it will go wherever Google ads go. Right. Wait a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't Beacon if you purchase shoes at Zappos, then it would say, you know, Leo bought these shoes.  That was a little different, right? This is only if you've plus one something or reviewed something positively on Google calls them shared endorsements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So starting as it may not be an endorsement. Yeah, it's just a plus one.  Yeah, and and and and it is a use of your likeness in advertising.  And there's all kinds of laws around that ever since the days of the 1890s and people in photography.  There was a young woman whose face was used on the side of a flower barrel against her wish.  She lost the case, but it's a major case. And the use of likeness. Right. In advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what Google says to ensure that your this will go into effect November 11th.  But you can't opt out now. By the way, you're opted in by default.  So you need to actually opt out if you want to get out of this to ensure that your recommended.  I love the language to ensure that your recommendations reach the people you care about.  Google sometimes displays your reviews, recommendations and other relevant activity throughout its products and services.  It sometimes includes shopping contexts.  So it is kind of like Zappos. If you buy a song at the Google Play Music Store, that counts and adds your profile name and photo may appear with a recommendation.  If you search for Italian restaurants, for example, you might see an ad for a nearby restaurant along with Aaron Newcomb really liked just the food.  Or Google Play searching alone.  Bless you. I didn't get the microphone down. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We call these shared endorsements alone.  You know, isn't so bothersome as and say, hey, your friends like this restaurant.  That's four squared. I'm for that.  It's the use of it in the ad without your explicit.  OK, here's three examples.  On Google's page, there's one where you see a street view of a restaurant and then Marsha Garcia says five stars more than just bagels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of a search. But then here is an ad in an AdSense ad for summertime spas in which Katya Klenova says super relaxing.  Can't wait five stars or an ad for Google Nexus 7 16 gigabit by Google.  I mean, I don't know.  I mean, it's pretty clear that this was not done.  This is not like and it's like referring back to something somebody said publicly on Google.  Well, that's the thing. I don't have a problem with that.  If you've already posted a review or endorse something with an explicit plus one, then I'm fine with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the shopping thing that bothers me.  So I went to Google Play and I purchased Nexus 7.  No, it means I bought the Nexus 7.  Maybe I hate it. Right.  Maybe once I got it, I hate it.  And is it going to say for your wife and you do it right?  Maybe it's for your wife.  But I don't know. We don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  None of these examples in all three of these examples, these are actual endorsements.  They gave it a rating and a review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's unclear.  Can just buy in a review.  Then put you in the ad?  I don't know. And what would it say?  Gina Trapani bought one.  That's all I would say.  And that has a serious implication.  Well, it's nobody's business either.  And for someone who does a show called All About Android, right?  If my face is next to the Nexus 7 as an endorser, that's kind of a big deal for you too, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You buy everything. Your face would be next to everything.  That doesn't necessarily mean that you endorse it.  You purchase things that are not necessarily your business.  This sometimes includes shopping contexts.  But it displays reviews, recommendations.  The problem is these words, other relevant activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is other relevant activity?  And I don't know if they're explicit about that.  You can turn it off.  Am I the only one?  I have a problem with them putting it in an ad.  I'm okay in an editorial context, in a certain context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm okay with it.  I'm okay with putting it in an ad.  I'm okay in an editorial context, in a search context,  for saying here's five people you know who plus one of this thing.  I think that's public.  And that happens all the time now.  That's already happening.  I'm cool with that.  But then to put it in an ad that they're getting paid for and using my likeness in advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's going over the line for me.  And the other thing is that it moderates a little bit,  it would only show up to people you are encircled with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In some cases even more so, because maybe I bought it as a gift or maybe I said this, I don't know.  It's just...  And you opt me in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. That's the thing I don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't like that.  To a shared activity fund, but to a commercial activity,  I don't know, Google.  Am I the only one who's upset by that part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like the fact that you have to opt out of this, that everyone's in by default.  I mean, I know it doesn't work any other way.  I get the logistics of it.  Because nobody would opt into this thing otherwise.  Exactly.  But doesn't that tell you something?  That nobody would volunteer to do this?  I don't get it. That's a really good point, Aaron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If you really think like the user,  then you've got to think what the user's benefit is,  and there's no user benefit to doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, they're trying to pitch it that way, but your friends want to know what you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The benefit is that you get to see...  Look, when I check into somewhere on Foursquare,  if it says, Leo has been here, which it does,  it'll tell me which of my friends have been to a place.  That's useful information.  And it will give you any tips that I share.  Tips is even more information,  but even if my friends have just been to a place that I'd never been to before,  my brain connects.  I see the faces of my friends to me.  There's a little bit of an implicit endorsement there.  I'm like, I want to be here too.  But is Foursquare...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it wrong for Foursquare to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no.  These are very close.  They're similar things, but they're also very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Leo's Pasta Palace  puts up a billboard in the street,  and it puts your face and says,  Gina Trapani, four stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's wrong, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why is that any different?  Although it happens all the time in fair use situations,  if you... in fact, you know this, Jeff.  Your name, I'm sure, was used frequently.  Jeff Jarvis gives moonlighting four stars,  and there's nothing you can do about that, Jeff,  because you did review it in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that happens with blogs all the time.  I find Lifehacker logos everywhere.  Is this different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But you know, there is,  but I don't know how that squares with...  That's quoting, but squaring with using your likeness to endorse a product.  By the way, I am with you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate this, and of course, I immediately unchecked it.  I did too.  Particularly because it eats into my own revenue.  We sell my endorsement.  That's the only way we make money on Twitter  is by selling my endorsement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, that's business value.  It's huge business value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no business without that, so I'm very careful about my endorsement.  On the other hand, you know,  why do people review things on sites?  Because they want their friends to see the reviews, right?  You don't review something, you don't give something stars,  because you don't want anybody to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  Whenever a brand says, like us on Facebook,  whenever I see my friends, you know,  I know all of your friends like Pepsi or whatever,  I always think to myself, like,  that's a declaration, it's a public declaration.  It is a public endorsement.  It always baffles me, because I very rarely like stuff on Facebook,  or Plus One stuff, unless it's something that I really, really, really like,  unless it's something that I would feel comfortable everybody knowing,  in whatever context.  I think that we have to think about our Plus Ones and our Faves and our Likes  that way, as a public statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You might have done it to get a coupon.  You must have done it to get this or that.  Have any of you ever reviewed anything on Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's public?  Yeah, and that's, I mean, that takes effort and time,  and I mean, that to me is the same as writing a post or a blog post, right?  I mean, it's a public thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the difference here is I can see all the posts, Leo.  I can see all the positive and the negative.  Right.  They're only going to show the five stars.  It's like the schmuck guy at a certain network when I was a TV critic.  You know, um...  Um...

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't they do this on movie reviews all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't they do this on movie reviews all the time?  Jeff Jarvis said, I was on my feet.  But they leave out the part where it says,  getting the hell out of there.  Getting the hell out of there.  Don't they do that all the time?  They misrepresent critics all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Bottom line is, this just doesn't seem like a very Google-y thing to do.  It doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems like a Facebook-y thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does seem like a Facebook-y thing to do.  It really does.  Facebook-y.  It's just as good as Google-y.  I have also a problem with the fall.  A couple of people in the chat room are noting that it went to their settings,  that it was unchecked.  I had the same thing. It was unchecked when I went to my settings.  But Google is saying that those are people who had opted out  of some sort of advertising setting in the past.  Oh, interesting.  Possibly could have done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're trying to honor your general feeling,  if you've ever expressed it.  Mine was checked.  Mine was checked.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what setting that they took that signal from.  But yeah, mine was unchecked.  So there was something there that it was reading from the past  that it made an assumption about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't mess with Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No siree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina's not going to like that.  I'll slip that bit in the database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So we see the effort to have what's now called the Schmidt-faced campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody's putting Eric Schmidt's face up.  They're changing their profile picture on Google Plus to Eric Schmidt's face  or they're making posts saying,  use Eric's picture all you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  That won't go far.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  Yeah, that's I think the biggest issue, right, is,  I mean, I understand Google needs to monetize.  It's just such a face-to-face way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not outraged.  I'm disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if they shared in the monetization?  I mean, what if they said, hey, if we use your image  and someone buys something, then you get a small percentage?  That's actually a great idea.  That is a great idea.  I would totally go back and change my setting to check if they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, here's the problem then.  Right.  I was thinking about that too, Aaron, but then it gets gamed.  Let's say they just gave you a play credit, right?  Just make a Google currency.  Yeah, play credit.  But then what you're going to see is somebody's going to like everything  they could possibly like.  Right.  And then Matt Cutts is busy trying to figure out how to figure out a new form of spam.  Right.  But I agree.  There should be some value back.  Give me a reason to do it.  Because that's the man.  Or make it more social.  Let me know when friends bought something that I recommended.  You know, I use affiliate deals.  That's the way to do it.  Or on the ad, say, see what your friends have said about this product.  And let me click and go to it.  But to just slap my face on their ad without my explicit permission.  Facebooky.  Facebooky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's an interesting thing.  Google is going to, apparently, according to Engadget,  Google will pay people for using their iOS or Android mobile meter apps  that monitor your app usage and web browsing habits  and send the data back to Google.  Google will offer you rewards.  Actually, Google says it's just rumor.  It's speculation.  But Engadget sources say Google will offer you rewards with the mobile meter program.  You'll have to give your consent, obviously.  Install the app.  Opt in.  And it's not clear what those rewards will be.  Google does confirm development of the new apps.  This is part of a marketing project called Market Research Project called Screenwise.  So you'll be, in effect, a panelist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, Google rewards you in other ways.  If you're a really active Google Plus user, you can get, you know, be marked as one and get swag.  I mean, there's things we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is precedent, perhaps, for Google rewarding you for participating.  It's rather just un-clever, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I'm a good product endorser and people buy things I endorse and in turn like them and endorse them,  that becomes an interesting social system that can be created.  But this is just so obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the attitude here is similar to what Mark Zuckerberg's attitude is,  which is, well, why wouldn't you want to let your friends know?  But here's the funny thing, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that feedback loop, though, is key, right?  It would make me really happy if I heard from my friends that they all bought Nexus 7.  They all bought Nexus 7 because they saw my endorsement.  And yeah, they really like it or they really hate it.  What was I thinking? Right?  Like that would complete the loop for me.  That would be as good as a play credit for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or my case, that they didn't buy it on Verizon because I told them not to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yes. And I didn't buy it on Verizon thanks to Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why Jeff is on the show, to keep people from buying it on Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They still have it on. They still have it on.  It's been another week. It's now five weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's nothing they could do right now because the government's shut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wrong, Mr. Laporte. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.  It's already certified as workable. It's already working in any other network.  There is absolutely nothing they need but to just put a skew in their system and it would go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're waiting for a call.  Verizon could do it.  They're waiting for the FCC to return their call.  No, no.  Just to tell them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The FCC is out right now, so they can't bring them to the justice they deserve.  Oh, maybe that's it.  In leg irons and public shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's what's going to happen tomorrow when the government gets back to work.  You're going to get satisfaction, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  First priority. First priority is go after friggin' Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You did file a complaint, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yes. Oh, yes.  Have you heard anything back?  I filed back again and said, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan, nyan.  You know, back to Beacon.  When I interviewed Zuckerberg for my book Public Parts, he said Beacon was a big mistake.  And I said, well, Mark, you know, I can imagine that you could fix it this way.  And he interrupted and he said, no, it was a mistake.  People didn't want that. We shouldn't have done that.  It was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, maybe Larry should learn from his friend, Mark.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Related to the mobile meter story, Facebook just bought O'Navo.  I'm not sure how to pronounce it, but it's basically a mobile app analytics company.  I noticed the news because I had featured one of their analytics apps on all by Android.  It was on my Arena Picks.  And it's basically the one that I featured is an app that monitors your mobile usage  and tells you which apps are consuming the most bandwidth and how much, you know,  Oh, that's good.  categories of what kind of bandwidth you're using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's always Facebook that uses the most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, right. It's true.  Facebook and Instagram were consistently one of the highest bandwidth hogging,  which either means they're being used a lot or they're just bandwidth hogs, probably both.  But it's interesting.  These companies are basically asking for users permission to install spyware to see how we're.  And, you know, there's a lot of good that could come out of that.  Like understanding how users consume data on smartphones is one of, you know,  is an important part of extending our networks and increasing coverage and, you know,  getting Verizon to work on Jeff's Nexus 7.  Ha! Ha!  But it's like, it feels like the key loggers of like back in the day, you know,  when those like spyware key loggers that would get installed on our Windows machines  and watch what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Big bucks for this. $150 to $200 million for our Navel.  Expensive.  So wither the Nexus 5. We thought we'd see it by Monday.  I'm holding off. I'm kind of, you know, ever since T-Mobile announced a couple of days ago  that they're going to offer free international data roaming.  That is so huge.  It's edge only, I found out.  So it's not, I'm not like quite as excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's what I get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm on my AT&T now and, you know, I pay, when I'm over doing my big Davos thing,  I pay $100 extra for that month for the data and then I get close to going over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and you don't, I paid $250 to get 800 megabytes.  That's the biggest package they offer on my travels.  It's expensive.  So now admittedly that's 3 and 4G in areas where you can get it.  But I, as soon as T-Mobile announced this, I said, great, that's it.  When I travel, it's T-Mobile only, right?  And it's in most of the countries you go to, you can find out more about it.  And that makes the Nexus 5 to me more compelling.  Actually makes the Nexus 4 compelling because even though it doesn't have LTE, I don't even need LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, as reports now, I saw reports there might be a new Nexus 4 with LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.  I saw that one report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can't buy the Nexus 4 now.  Yeah, they removed it, right?  Yeah.  Of tech blogs is that the slightest little tiny thought or rumor or guess gets spread and metastasized like Andromeda Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a game of telephone.  It's out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I search every day for Nexus 5 the way I used to search every day for Nexus 7 LTE.  And because I want to know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nexus 4, we are out of inventory.  Please check back soon on both the 8 and the 16 gig version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's continue what you think they take it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They didn't take it down.  So maybe that's what's going on.  I mean, we've seen a lot about the Nexus 5.  Here's my theory.  The FCC was shut down by this government shut down 16 days ago.  The reason we know anything about the Nexus 5 is because of FCC approvals of the Bluetooth radio and things like that.  I bet you there's some approvals that are just hanging.  And as soon as they go through, then maybe Google can release it.  Gina was telling us a variety.  I guess this is from all about Android last night.  A variety of release dates based on everything from astrology to hit songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so on the Google Plus page, the KitKat Google Plus page, this is plus dot Google dot com slash plus KitKat, which is run.  And we're actually we can't tell if it's run by Hershey's or by Google, but it is clearly like an Android branded KitKat page.  They keep posting these images which appear to be clues to the release date.  So the first one that they put that they posted was a chocolate KitKat Android dancing.  And the cat the caption was everybody dance now.  So people looked up and said, oh, everybody dance now was a hit single released by CNC Music Factory on October 18th, 1990.  October 18th must be the release date.  And then they posted an image which says this is it in KitKat bars.  Now, this is it is the name of Michael Jackson documentary, which was released on October 28th.  So everyone said, OK, it's definitely the 28th because CNC Music Factory used to be named like the 28th Brigade or something.  So it must be the 28th. Right.  That is ridiculous.  On all of the Android wheat, we are guess is that it's Halloween because KitKat is a Halloween candy.  We really have no idea.  I think it's I think it's hilarious that that Google is clearly baiting Android enthusiasts and bloggers with these so-called hints about dance now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm told we talk about this on MacBreak Weekly that the artists who create Apple's invitations to their events release, you know, when the invitation goes out, they sit around reading tech blogs, watching shows like this, drinking and laughing at all of the speculation that occurs.  And I imagine the KitKat folks are probably chowing down right now on a chocolate bar, just howling.  Having a good laugh.  I doubt very much that they said everybody danced now as a very obscure clue to a release date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. That's pretty Googley, Leo.  It's pretty Googley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, it is Googley, but I don't think this is a Google account.  Well, that's the thing is this points back to KitKat.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  KitKat.com. And if you even if you go to KitKat.com, it's amazing to me.  They built their whole site around Android.  It's incredible.  I mean, we in case you missed it, you might want to go back and take a look.  We looked at their website and it's all like I can see Google writing this for them and saying, hey, look, we'll give you the whole code.  Just go throw this up on your website because it says KitKat four dot four, you know, all this stuff.  And it's all like a technology website for selling some sort of phone or new gadget or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute. Let's do a who is on the KitKat site and find out who owns it.  Well, we'll see how obscure this information is anyway.  It's going to be an agency.  Oh, Hershey's. Oh, it's owned by Nestle, folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but they definitely owned KitKat.com before this partnership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true. Right.  This record expires in May 2014. It was created May 1997.  So, yes, they've owned it for some time.  Registered through two cows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then they went to the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How forward thinking of yes.  So, yeah, I guess there's nothing to be deduced.  They already owned the domain.  No, but no, remember, no money was changed at any time for this fabulous relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're just teams of people were hired to implement this, but no money was exchanged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very important.  They just like they like Android that much that they decided to redo their whole website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like chocolate. Leo, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're just being cynical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So and does that is it related to the Nexus five?  Like they're going to release the same the two at the same time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the special. Yeah, that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, because actually they would because you're not released.  You don't release KitKat.  You have to put out a product with KitKat on it.  I mean, most of the time, it's meaningless to say, well, download KitKat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not going to be the air push release.  Yeah, there's definitely going to be a device.  There's going to be a flagship device.  There's a device. Right.  And then we've already seen screenshots of phones running on the Nexus five display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's already in Best Buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a Nexus five display in Best Buy with no phones on it, but it's a Google interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And three spots for phones to be up there.  And whoever put the picture up said I asked the manager.  And yes, it's a Nexus five display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we were thinking Tuesday.  I'm thinking maybe it was planned Tuesday and it's just been held up by the government closure in the United States.  The rumor, according to a Romanian Android blog that we're down to that.  There's the there's the empty display.  Wow. Does it say Nexus five anywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Just know the guy asked the manager.  The other thing that I've seen again, it's meaningless.  It's just, you know, report of report mutating, but said that this time was not going to have the supply problems of the Nexus four and that it was going to be available all over and stores and so on and so forth, which I hope is the case.  I don't want to be screaming at myself or taking a smaller unit.  I want to get the larger memory this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, you know, I've been playing with the Galaxy Note three for a week and I love it.  And, you know, I like the notes.  I like the big phones, but I'm not going to buy it.  I cannot use touch with.  I want a googly phone.  Yes, I like my Moto X.  I wish I had it on T-Mobile, but I wanted a red back and I could only get that on AT&T.  So that's why I put it on lock now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Huh?  Get it unlocked.  You paid for it so you can get unlocked.  I get unlocked.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's why I put Google Edition on my Samsung Galaxy S4 as soon as I got it.  Right.  Because I hate touch with.  So now it looks just like a Google phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And that's it's totally workable.  The camera work well and everything.  The camera works well.  I'll talk about that a little bit later.  Okay.  And you know what the best part about it is?  Because it's not running all that touch with crap in the background, I double the battery  life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you probably double the storage because those Nexuses, those GS4s come with scant  storage because of all the crapola.  That's right.  So you went, what is it, a 16 gig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a 16 gig.  So I started out with touch with.  I think I had nine point something already used.  Oh, used.  Used.  Holy cow.  And I went down to four point something.  Isn't that awesome?  Five free gigs just by getting rid of Samsung.  And it runs better and the battery lasts longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.  I'm going to do that.  Is that an easy thing to do?  Very easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.  Yep.  So you have to root it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung is the Microsoft of phones.  I have had problems with the triangle count.  You know, the, can you reset that now?  I'll have to look.  I'm not sure.  I had some failed rooting efforts.  So my count is now maxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oops.  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll help you with it if you want to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Help me.  Help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Help me.  I'm a wide Kenobi.  So did the camera on the Moto X get improved with that reason?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The firmware upgrade.  Yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're not seeing it?  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Supposedly.  They said it did.  Yeah, sure.  I'm sure it did.  It's still, it's still, you know, I mean, there's only so much you can do to make it  better.  You know, some of that's hardware, but I guess, yeah, they said the color rendition's better  and I don't know.  I don't know.  I took a lot.  It wasn't, it wasn't ever awful.  Let me go look at my pictures and see.  It was, it was, had a little green cast, which as far as I can tell, so this was taken with  it before the update and you can even see the little green cast.  In fact, you do not see my screen anymore.  Oh yeah, you do.  So you can see the little green cast on there.  In fact, I have, I did a little trial because that guy on the left, Jamal, has an iPhone,  had an iPhone 5S and his picture was so much better.  Does that mean going black?  Gosh darn it.  And then I took this after, I think it is better.  This actually, the color rendition looks a lot better on this.  Yeah, it does.  Unless I did that.  Oh, wait a minute.  I did that with an iPhone 5S.  No wonder it's better.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Both of these are iPhone 5s.  Nevermind.  I'll take a picture with my Moto and post it.  I should take an identical picture.  Here, I'll do an identical one.  The one that looks just like Andy, but this time it'll be Gina.  I think it's not quite as good.  It'll take a little while to upload.  That looked funny, you shaking it.  I like this.  Everything about the Moto X I like.  I like the fact that I have a little NFC tag right here that keeps it unlocked.  I like the fact that it doesn't, the Moto Assist is surprisingly useful.  That's that little app that knows if you're driving or in a meeting or sleeping.  And it's never bugged me on shows ever since.  I used to have to turn the phone off.  I just made sure that every show was a meeting by adding a person.  And now it no longer rings during shows, which is very nice.  That's incredibly useful.  It's little things like that.  It's not huge.  Just little things.  I think I got some pretty good pictures while I was traveling.  These are all Moto X pictures.  I think the color rendition was pretty good, actually.  This is before the firmware upgrade.  I think if there's enough light, this camera is pretty good.  It's not iPhone 5 quality, but it's okay.  Those are really nice, Leo.  Yeah, I don't think that this is bad.  And some of these are very low light.  These are all with the Moto X.  You see, and this is one thing I've always had a problem with the Moto X, lens flare.  For some reason, bright light, it just really baffles it.  This is in a very dark cistern.  And it actually was able to get...  It's grainy, it's noisy, but it was able to get a picture.  And it's really dark here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the Medusa's head upside down.  That's the cistern.  That's the kind of lighting.  So that's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's okay.  Don't buy it for the camera.  Let's see, moving along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Other stories on our mind today.  Now I'm on a KitKat bar.  I blame you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Adage says, Microsoft's scruge ads work.  I would have thought that these ads would have infuriated people or they would have  been baffled.  But according to Adage...  Oh, see, proving that it does call.  You had to say it.  Well, you know why?  By the way, how do you like my ringtone?  You know why?  Because this moron who's calling, and next time you call him, I'll give out your phone  number, knows that the meeting thing doesn't...  I have it set so that if somebody rings twice from the same number, it will almost be an  emergency.  So they called once.  I saw the call come in.  It didn't ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they called immediately again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have it set so that if family members call, it rings, and second ring, it rings.  You know what I'm going to do is just change that setting and you'll be at a lock 714.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's my mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The scrugelled ads, negative the core, a rarity for consumer tech, even the mean-spirited  I'm a Mac, I'm a PC featured a product comparison at least.  But while the tactics may be ugly, says Adage, the ads are working according to two ad effectiveness  firms and research...  Oh, wait a minute.  Commissioned by Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a research for Microsoft.  Yeah, this is my fault.  I put this up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really should read his...  Yeah, I think you should.  Yeah, I'm not going to do that.  That would be mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a nice guy.  I'm going to stoop to his level, but I will change...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let's give out the last two numbers and scare them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I started with the area code.  I don't know why people are this way.  It's very sad, frankly, to me.  For Microsoft, it's a win, said the executive vice president at Ace Metrics.  More than 53% of people who saw the scrugelled ads...  I don't need to describe those, right?  Those are the ads where Microsoft goes, you know, it was scrugelled by Google.  53% of the viewers mentioned Google in their response to the ads and said they would look  at being in a new light or at least seek more information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let us be clear, this was done for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, this is...  So according to two ad effectiveness firms and research commissioned by Microsoft.  So I don't know if...  Ad Benchmark Index said they have certainly raised a level...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought I turned this guy off.  Maybe the silence setting isn't working because he's got a special number.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, now I know what that means.  So that means it will override even silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have to go into assist and change the setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I must really...  This guy's called like a bunch of times.  He must really want to talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe you want a million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, there you go.  Keep trying.  Good luck.  So one of the way they can measure this is they sent people to a site called scrugelled.com.  Once viewers do hit scrugelled.com...  Now this is the Microsoft stuff.  Data collected for Microsoft by Answers Research show a 45% favorability gap in favor of Google  contracting to just 5%.  In other words, when they go in, 45% are favorable.  By the time they read the crap, which is mostly disinformation, 5% are favorable.  Data shows the likelihood of someone recommending Google to a friend drops by 10% and increases  for being 7%.  I wonder if we'll see more of these ads in that case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's kind of a prime target for this kind of thing because I think that people who don't  talk about technology and think about technology every day like we do, Google is so good that  even we have these moments where we're like, how did it know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It plays to what they already kind of suspect.  It just confirms your suspicions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's playing on people's fears.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think the bigger thing is not that.  It's the new programmable ads where if you search for something on Amazon and two days  later you see that same thing pop up in an ad in front of you, that shocks people more,  I hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that is surprising.  We have the baby and I started looking at baby products a lot more online.  I would suddenly see ads for baby stuff.  It was such a surprising, it was to me, even though I understand how this works, I was  like, oh, that's okay.  Yeah, that works.  That's really good.  It was a noticeable shift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it does surprise you though when you see it, right?  It does.  It does.  Because you're not expecting it.  You're just like, you're like, do do do, doing my thing.  Hey, how'd that get there?  You know, like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was researching car seats and then the next day I got an ad for the one that I was looking  at, you know, that I was just about to buy, but then stopped midway because I got busy  and I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So, I mean, there's a there's a there's a grain of truth there.  But, you know, I always wonder about these things like, you know, what happens?  So I imagine these people like going into this room, right, and they watch this ad and  then they immediately put down like what they think.  Right.  But what what what about the day after that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The day after they don't even remember.  I think they're not going to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like, is it really that effective?  I mean, I know you're measuring it to the ideal here, but is it really that that effective  the next day or maybe when Google announces something cool that comes out all of a sudden?  Oh, who cares?  I forget about it.  Here's the real test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they stop using Google?  Right.  No, no, no.  That's the real test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, all of a sudden they're using Bing.  No, no.  But the survey said they were going to.  They were going to.  They had planned on this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Pepsi challenge or no.  Coke is still number one.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the Pepsi challenge, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, same idea.  I can tell the difference.  I am.  I can you when I drank Cola Pepsi and Coke.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I can.  Pepsi is sweeter.  It is.  Yeah.  Coke's more has a more of a ting ting walla walla bing bang.  Google, you know, it's interesting.  Initially, this looks like a victory for Google.  Not so fast.  Federal judge in Delaware on Wednesday dismissed a class action lawsuit over the Google iPhone thing.  This was Google bypassing Safari on the iPhone setting to block third party cookies using a trick and, in fact, tracking people, even though they had explicitly said, or at least Apple.  So this is where Google's contention was.  Look, this is a default setting by Apple not to allow third party cookies.  We don't believe that the user set that.  So we're going to ignore it.  Class action lawsuit.  The judge says you can't prove any harm.  So I can't find in your favor.  The judge did not say this is harmless.  This is OK.  In fact, we have no standing.  It just you know, you have to show suffering to get an award.  Judge Sue Robinson wrote the companies had circumvented browser settings, allowing allowing users personal information to be sold to add companies.  But the judge said the plaintiffs could not show they suffered because companies collected and sold their information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's that is important, though, because we try to run the law on I don't like that or on creepiness.  When in fact, it's actual harm.  What's the actual harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Provable harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, never.  Well, but the judge admits that the judge said, yeah, you tricked the browser.  You ignored a setting.  It's just that there's no harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's no law against against going around a setting.  Good God, we all know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But listen to what Google said.  A Google spokesperson said the company's pleased with the decision, quote, protecting the privacy and security of our users is one of our top priorities.  But that's not what the decision had anything to do with.  The decision said you did not, in fact, protect the privacy and security of your users.  It's just there was no harm, so no foul.  But you didn't, in fact, do that.  They ignored privacy settings and went around it.  It's just there was no damage done.  And I think there I think you could say there is damage done, but it's de minimis.  It's not like it's hard to demonstrate.  Well, how much damage is it?  A dollar?  Is it a penny?  Is it $500?  Or you can't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why you can't come up with an award in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't know if that's a victory.  I just think you just can't prove that how much damage there was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, I don't know about you guys.  I get so it's get court case burnout sometimes.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what I remember.  We talked in July about Google saying you cannot have a home server if you have Google Fiber.  Yes.  Well, they reversed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good for them.  Yeah.  Took a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that's not the case.  I don't think with any cable company I know.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The acceptable use policy used to ban any type of server.  The new terms say Google Fiber customers are not allowed to operate servers for  commercial purposes.  However, personal non-commercial use of servers that complies with this acceptable use policy  is acceptable, including using virtual private networks to access services in your home  and using hardware applications that include server capabilities for uses like multiplayer  gaming, video conferencing, and home security.  So you still can't run a web commercial web server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I couldn't run my crowdfunding campaign on a server on this network because that would  be considered commercial use.  I feel like that's probably an acceptable line, right?  Commercial use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that was the big complaint was, hey, people run servers all the time.  If you play games, if you have video games, you're running a server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Internet of Things is going to be doing that like crazy.  I wonder how many people are aware of that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think everybody, I mean, there are obviously people running servers out of their  house for commercial purposes, right?  Yeah.  I wonder how many people are actually aware that that's illegal.  Illegal or at least I think it's in the back.  Against the terms of their agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's their rules.  It's against the terms of their agreement.  It's not where you can't get a static IP so you can't really use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure you get a static IP.  Really?  Well, maybe not.  When you do.  You're not guaranteed a static IP.  You're not guaranteed it.  But there's ways around that.  There's DynDNS and stuff.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People use dynamic DNS to get around that.  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, I remember when I first started with trying to run something on the internet a  long time ago, I ordered a DSL line that was separate from my internet connection because  of this very thing.  I thought that I had to do it.  You wanted the dedicated IP address and you wanted the ability to serve.  I wanted the traffic to be separate.  So I mean, it's in your best interest to do that anyway.  For security, if nothing else.  But I mean, it doesn't seem to be a big deal.  It doesn't seem like anybody's going after people who are running commercial things out  of their house because I think logistically, if you're successful, you exceed the bandwidth  limitations that you have anyway.  You need something more.  But I don't know.  It just seems interesting to me that probably most people have no idea that this is a clause  in their agreement with their cable company or internet provider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this must be from you, Jeff Jarvis.  This is the Google Maps one?  No, the gracious Bill Gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, well, I just put that up.  Yeah, it was.  I thought it was just interesting that it was the history of the Google ad model.  And it's a little bit long to go into.  But Bill, Bill's a friend of mine.  Bill's been on the show.  He's a wonderful guy.  He's a great, great guy.  Unfortunately, I'm not seeing him today because I'm seeing you guys.  He's happy to be in New York.  We're going to get together.  But I couldn't.  So shows where my priorities are.  Thank you.  But it talks about how another friend of the company helped me out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Goto.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Goto was really the original model.  And there was a suit and it did involve some considerable reward to Goto after it was sold.  But what was it still around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's going to be like the yellow pages now.  Like everything Yahoo buys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, it was overture.  They became overture and Yahoo bought overture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bill Gross started it in February 1998, seven months before Google launched.  We didn't like Goto at the time because the search results had ads mixed in.  So you could get paid search results in effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it was the view.  And Gross somewhere in here says that, you know, aren't you upset about this?  And Gross says, quote, or says, not really says gross.  We didn't patent the idea.  Right.  So if we don't patent it, they can copy it.  Gross is convinced the concept of cost per click auction based search advertising system  would have been patentable in retrospect.  But by the time he thought to do it, though, it was too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would guess Bill Gross has left.  I would guess Bill Gross has left a lot of money on the table in his many years as an innovator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, he's a tremendous innovator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, the way he did it was kind of reprehensible because basically you would buy an ad,  but instead of an ad placement on the side, it would be in the search results.  Right.  He said, well, this will help with spam because people paid for it.  We'll just go to the top.  I'm not sure that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I looked at Bill over my glasses at the time.  But it was a visionary thing.  And he was on the beginning of it.  He often is.  So, you know, the great thing is at the end of the story, it says Gross for his part seems  comfortable, even happy with how things turned out.  He has nothing but raves for Google.  I'm wildly proud of coming up with a paid search model, he told me.  I don't I didn't know how big it was going to be.  It was at the time, you know, that's that's what struck me as pretty darn gracious.  He says, I wish I had come up with a Google idea.  The Google idea was the idea for organizing the world's information.  Mine was just an idea for making money.  That was a nice touch of Bill.  Yeah, very gracious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And to Larry and Sergey's credit, they thought that mixing the results in was reprehensible.  They didn't want to do that.  They talked about partnering with Overture, but they didn't want to do it because they  didn't want to mix it in together.  And they thought they could do their own thing, in which they did, of course, with AdWords.  And it also made a competitive advantage for them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It said, you know, we're not evil.  This is what we're going to do instead and thus be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it not the case?  It seems to me that that was the original we're not evil was that.  We will not mix ad results in ads in with our search results.  Yes, I think so.  That was the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it was engineers who were giving up a conference room for an ad sales meeting.  Isn't that the origin story of Don't Be Evil?  And before they left the room, Jeff, you probably know this.  They wrote, don't be evil on the whiteboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that that rings a bell.  That sounds right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it was from in the plaques.  But I feel like that was that's my understanding the origin story.  Yeah.  Hey, you salespeople, don't be evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to put that on our whiteboard.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's according to Wikipedia.  You are correct.  Yeah, that's a great story.  I love that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a great story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't be evil.  Make good choices.  It was institutionalized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  A first look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab.  This is from The Verge.  There's a short film, I guess, that debuted at the Imagine Science Films Festival  that shows some of the...  We can play a little bit of this.  That shows some of the research projects, including computing at absolute zero or near  absolute zero quantum architecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Colder than space, they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Colder than space.  Wow, that's kind of cool.  Quantum chips.  The D-Wave processor, which uses a behavior that links particles with no apparent physical connection.  They say the first practical application has been on Google Glass.  Engineers use the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector, helping it to better  distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks.  Obviously, the glass does not have a quantum processor in it.  Right.  But...  What a while it was so cold.  But the better blink detecting algorithm came from quantum processors.  That's interesting.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not using the quantum processor?  So it's not used itself in the process, but it...  Right.  ...makes the algorithm better.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also beautiful.  ...coming up with the best...  That's just the shots of their data centers.  I've seen those before.  ...problems as they get larger.  So now, what is an optimization problem?  Here, give him an example.  You want to do a trip through South America and you want to visit a number of cities,  and then you ask, what is the cheapest ticket I can get to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think all chip-group scientists should have this accent.  Whatever this accent is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ...of course, different routes and different...  I thought it was Sebastian at first.  Yeah, I thought of...  Yeah, it sounds like Einstein.  ...all the different options I have for my different routes to travel to these cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We currently, as a civilization, we generate vast amounts of data.  It could be climate data, genomic data, but it's very difficult to generate  useful insights off times from that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you can solve optimization problems better, you have an important resource...  Optimization.  ...in your hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that.  So the blink, I guess, is that kind of problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was an optimization problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very cool.  Very, very cool.  Very cool.  Extremely cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's colder than space.  I'm cooler than space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now, you may be wondering, Leo, when are you going to get to the Google changelog?  But there's no changelog today for the first time ever.  Yeah, there just isn't enough to fill a segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, guys.  There just haven't been a lot of releases this past week.  Everything's the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We changed our privacy policy.  Now we can't do any more.  It's all because of the federal government shutdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  All the stories have been...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Changes because, like, you know, like the ad thing that we discussed, and  Yeah, just sort of regular pushes, you know, of other apps, but none of the Google apps have had any significant changes this week.  No.  So I don't know.  Correct me if I'm wrong.  I didn't plan anything either.  I did a trip through my subscriptions and didn't see anything.  So next week.  There'll be more changes next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we could take a break and come back with our tool and tip and number and Aaron,  whatever Aaron wants to do, if you would like.  Or do you have any other stories that we have not yet covered that you want to mention?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Can you talk about the last one under other Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I can.  That's what I was asking.  I was wondering.  You like that one?  I love this.  The last one on the other.  Let me scroll down.  Yeah, I could talk about this.  I actually donated money to this when they were raising money.  So there is a company that is trying to sue podcasters.  They haven't sued us, but they've sued I think the major networks, ABC, NBC, CBS, Discovery.  They've sued Adam Carolla.  They've sued a bunch of different podcasts saying we have a patent on podcasting, of all things.  And you better give us money or you're in trouble.  So the Electronic Frontier Foundation has the Mark Cuban Chair to End Stupid Patents.  Is that it?  Something like that.  So they've been very active in this patent troll issue.  And they've decided there are a number of ways you can fight a patent troll.  The obvious way is to fight them in court.  They sue you or you sue them.  In fact, a couple of companies have sued them proactively saying we're going to sue you  trying to get the venue in New York instead of in Texas where the patent troll is trying  to get these suits.  So you go to court.  Often it's a jury trial if you get that far.  A jury of people, in this case in East Texas, and they like to do it there because they've  had a lot of success in East Texas, both the judges and the juries, will decide.  And this company's already won in other cases against Apple, not the same patent,  and won quite a bit of money.  The other way to fight it is to go to the patent office and say, hey, we want to overturn  this patent.  We don't think this is a good patent.  The EFF has decided to file with the patent office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not that there's anyone there to get the challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Nothing will happen right now.  But I guess we're going back to work in the next couple of days.  So they filed a formal challenge to the patent.  I could read you the patent.  They call it an inter partes review.  It takes a while.  For a while the EFF was asking.  There's a website, I can't remember the name of it, where you can go and give examples  of prior art in an effort to help this process.  There it is.  So if you see the prior art link there, chat, if we're under help save podcast,  it's ask patents.  That's it.  So a number of people contributed there saying, hey, there was prior art here.  Lots of, you know, I don't know how helpful any of that was.  I don't know if there was a perfect example, but there were quite a few examples there.  The prior art has to predate the patent that the patent troll is invoking,  which I think is a 1995 or 96 patent.  In any event, apparently the EFF believes that it has enough material now  to successfully appeal to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to overturn this.  That could be very good news if they succeed because if the,  now this could take 18 months, by the way, a year and a half.  But if the USPTO overturns it, the whole thing just goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, you know the technology these people were working on.  When they filed this patent, right?  It was audible magazines on cassettes, not even digital.  So they're sending out cassettes to people reading the magazine.  And that's what this patent's for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and it was a system for disseminating media content representing episodes in a serialized  sequence.  And there's a particular clause that they're basing the lawsuits on.  You know, I can go on and on.  I know a little more about this than I care to.  The clause, if you want to read it, is clause 31,  apparatus for disseminating a series of episodes represented by media files  via the internet as said episodes become available.  Which sounds a little bit like podcasting, you know.  And this is the problem.  You can fight this and you can even say, no, this is an obvious, this is trivial.  But a jury's going to sit and look at this and go, well, golly, there you are, CBS, big company,  sitting on some poor guy who invented this thing, you know, 20 years ago, and you're not giving  them a penny and they can easily find against you.  So it's a complicated thing.  Fighting in a court costs millions of dollars.  It's much less expensive if you can win by filing a patent inter partes.  On the other hand, there are risks to doing that.  Every strategy has its risks.  If the patent office says, nope, we reviewed it and it's a good patent, that makes it much  harder to win in court.  So while I'm thrilled the EFF did this, you know, I have mixed feelings about it.  If they lose, that's really bad news.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I would highly recommend for people that are interested in this topic to go out to  This American Life.  They did their second episode.  Second episode, they started covering this patent right here that we're talking about.  And they have some interviews and some details about it.  You know, I won't go into the whole thing because it's wonderful to listen to.  I just listened to it last night in the car on the way home.  It's very good.  Listen to both of them.  I mean, the second one covers pretty much everything in the first one plus some resolution  of some patent cases that they were actually investigating.  So I think it's when patents attack, I believe is what it's called.  And that's on This American Life.  Just search for it, download it, listen to it.  You'll be up in arms after you listen to that show because of what patents are doing to  innovation in this country and others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a huge, it's a huge sink.  Episode 441 from last July when patents attack.  Oh no, part two is 496.  Sorry, from May of 2013.  Episode 496.  This American Life, great show.  Yep.  And a podcast.  And yeah, I don't know.  I don't think they've been mentioned in the lawsuit, but I got to say,  we're all vulnerable as podcasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, well, they asked him that actually.  This is the only part I'll give away in the show is they said,  you know, we're doing a podcast right now.  Are you going to sue us?  I said, that's it's balls.  Good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm sure, and I know, I know who they were talking to.  And I'm sure he said, well, no, we're not going to sue you.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Unless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We decided right now not to pursue that.  And that's what we're just leaving it there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's really, that's the real consequence of this kind of trolling is that it isn't big  companies riding roughshod over inventors at all.  It's not that at all.  But juries don't always see it that way.  Okay.  Well, I'm glad you brought that up.  What a downer, Debbie Downer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I know it's interesting to everybody listening, right?  I mean, it's.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, everybody listens to podcasts should be aware of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The EFF has quit.  Speaking of EFF, we talked about this on the Security Now.  The Global Network Initiative, a group of tech firms dedicated to opposing internet censorship,  they said that it doesn't have any confidence that members of the group, which includes  Facebook and Google, can really talk about privacy and surveillance given the government  and PRISM.  They're afraid that these companies have been gagged by the US government.  And so they really, this Global Network Initiative is no longer useful of any kind.  EFF said it can no longer sign its name on joint statements, knowing now that GNI's  corporate members have been blocked from sharing crucial information about how the  government is meddled with these companies' security practices.  I don't know.  I don't know if there's evidence, frankly, that Google and Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, I think.  But I have tapped out to the government.  Tactical thing.  Yeah.  To say that to bring attention to the way they are getting.  Right.  I was talking to somebody who used to work with a big communications online company,  and about this idea that I've had for some time, wondering if there are people with  very high security clearance working for you, and the managers of the company do not have  that much security clearance.  It leads to the presumption that there are things going on in your own company that you  don't know that the government is managing your company.  That is a frightening prospect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And...  Does Chad have security clearance, by the way?  No.  Do you, Chad?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I should have asked.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They don't give security to people with red hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's definitely, yeah, that'd definitely be an issue for them.  I've had family members who have been dating other people who had security clearance,  but that's about it.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like there's a countdown to KitKat going up on the KitKat site.  Plus site?  It's not live.  Android actually viewed the source, looked through the JavaScript, and found a reference  to a coming soon countdown.  So the coming soon countdown is coming soon, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we know from the JavaScript when the coming soon countdown starts, but not when it ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are such...  Is that what you're saying?  That it's coming, that the countdown might be coming soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The countdown is coming, but we don't know what the countdown is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  We don't know what the countdown is.  Coming soon countdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the most useless piece of information ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And now it's going to spread across 4,000 tech blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to announce a date, and then they're going to put a countdown on the site.  So it's not going to happen just out of the blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At some point we'll also scroll.  This is a new...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is this reference to Android Gingerbread?  That's making me nervous.  I don't know if I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's the Froyo.  It's all in there, huh?  It's all in there.  Coming soon launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What it does mean is we'll know at least 24 hours before.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In a related...  I just want to lighten things up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I'm not done yet.  In a story related to that, but not exactly the same,  the directors of all the major internet organizations have said,  we are no longer going to be involved with the United States government.  We're no longer a fiefdom of the Commerce Department.  We are a non-governmental from here on in.  This includes ICANN, the IETF, the Internet Architecture Board,  the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Society,  all five regional internet address registries.  All said, they called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA  functions towards an environment in which all stakeholders,  including all governments, participate on an equal footing.  We explicitly rejecting the U.S. Commerce Department's  unilateral oversight of ICANN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And this is just huge in the long run because this is how the government truly blew it.  And this invites in Iran, China, and company.  And Russia.  This is dangerous to the net.  Thank you very frigging much, NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't blame them because who can trust the U.S. government?  I don't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But this affects the future of the internet.  This affects the business of the internet.  This affects Americans' views of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Square Cash has been launched.  You can now send money from Square via email.  You could do that with Google Wallet.  Yeah, there's lots of ways to do that.  Big deal.  I like this one.  Bank robbers alleged.  Bank robbers.  I forgot it. I'm a journalist.  They were charged in Massachusetts with robbing a bank.  Of course, what did they do?  The cops, they went and got the computer and they looked at their history.  And apparently they were searching for things like, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What happens if you rob a bank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happens if you rob a bank?  Also, what happens if you rob a house?  And what happens if you rob a drug dealer?  Apparently the least risky is robbing the bank.  By the way, unarmed robbery, not robbed, is probably one of those things where they put  the finger in the pocket.  The getaway driver is also being held on $25,000 bail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Who probably had Google Maps labeled as getaway from bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do I, what's the fastest route away from the bank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who searches for what happens if you rob a bank?  I mean, even a bank robber, I don't, why?  We got to do it.  What happens if you rob a bank?  Well, I better not rob a bank.  Of course, that story, number one.  In fact, we can no longer, okay, here's 10 potentially catastrophic mistakes made during  bank robberies.  This is good.  This is useful.  Boy, gosh, you know, this story has ruined these search results.  Because the rest of the search results are these guys.  Thanks guys for ruining it for the rest of us.  Now I don't know what happens if you rob a bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does happen?  What does happen?  What does happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll never know now.  We'll just see that stupid story.  Google may be doing a watch.  Yeah, that's exciting.  I had the Google, the Galaxy Gear.  It was better than I thought.  You know, everybody was really slamming it.  It's the best of the watches out there.  It's got a built-in camera.  It can, you can run any Android app apparently.  So now the rumors are Google is doing a watch.  Functionality of Google now, of course, would be front and center as it is, you know,  I would guess in any wearable device.  Apparently, Google will announce, and this is the rumor, a Nexus watch, code name Gem,  when it announces KitKat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  More to count down to.  You can get a watch that counts down to counting down to get a new watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, maybe that's the countdown.  It's a special countdown watch.  Google did buy Wim, remember.  That was one of the early, early players in smart watches.  It was Android based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My theory is that since it's October 31st,  they're going to give a bunch of these out to Google employees in KitKat wrappers  and then give them out, you know, for Halloween for trick or treat.  Like, oh, that's a nice costume you have there.  Have this special candy.  Have some candy dandy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Now we will take a break.  Now that we've got the robbers and the watch in, I can now safely move on.  Arshonde brought to you by...  Definitely downer.  Yeah, no, I got, we've distanced ourselves, I think, sufficiently.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The depression.  Sorry about that.  Lawsuits and non-governmental organizations.

I gotta find which episode that was so I could send people to it.  I'll find it.  Coming up, by the way, triangulation today.  Jerry Ellsworth is here.  Jerry, you all know Jerry, of course.  She's a great maker.  Worked for a while at Steam.  Left Steam to work on something very exciting, which she's going to show us.  Virtual reality glasses.  It's cool.  Did you play with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to try them.  It's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Castar or CastAR.  They funded, by the way.  So that's really good news.  She has raised $418,720 and they still have 30 days to go.  Isn't this cool?  Good for her.  Yeah.  So we're going to give our first look at CastAR  in just a little bit with Jerry Ellsworth on triangulation.  Time now, though, for our tip, our number, our tool of the week,  and anything Erin wants to throw in.  Let's start with Gina Trippani and her tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New Google search trick.  Find out what your tip should be for us right now on a big screen.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean that kind of tip?  This is a tip tip.  Money tip.  It's a tip tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You go to Google search and you type in what is the tip for $37.  And Google will return for a $37 bill.  What the tip should be if you want to tip at 15%.  In this case, it would be 47%.  Wait, is this right?  Yeah, 15% would be five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can change the percentages and the splits, too.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can change the percentages.  You can say, hey, what about 20% split between two people?  And I'll tell you the tip per person and the total per person.  Do people really give 15%?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that kind of low?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so.  I would have made the default 20%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you can split it so if there's three people at the bill,  each of you can throw in your $8.89.  This actually splits the bill, too.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It splits the bill.  It tells you the tip per person.  So really handy if you don't have a tip calculator installed in your phone.  I'm sure you could just say this into Google now as well.  And yeah, split your tip.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you really want to stiff somebody, you can go down to 10%.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it go below?  How low does it go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How low?  It goes to 0%.  It goes to 0%.  Well, we know that's 0%.  That one I could figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's such an engineer thing to do.  Why would you ever have 0%?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you love Google though?  That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess that's if you need to split an amount without a tip.  Yes, that's true.  I guess that makes sense.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because a lot of them, you don't care because if you have more than six people,  they've already included the tip.  Right.  So you just put it in the total.  That's right.  Split it six ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.  Good point.  So yeah, tip calculator built right into Google search.  Woohoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I can tell it's getting dark earlier here because I'm...  Yeah, look at that.  She's sitting in the dark.  So Chad, at the bottom of the Google, there's a video that I'm...  There's a video I think is kind of neat.  So the number of the week is 26.  An amazing story that Google's telling of Saru Munshi Khan,  who when he was five years old fell asleep on a train in India with his 14-year-old brother.  And so then he woke up 1500 kilometers away in Calcutta, having no way to get home, nothing at all.  He gets adopted by a family in Tasmania.  What?  He does not know where his home was.  He's five years old.  He doesn't have the details.  But then he uses, get ready for the goosebumps, Google Maps to track back and find his home.  And the end of the video is him in a reunion with his mother.  Back in his home address.  It's just friggin' amazing.  Wow.  I don't think we're gonna play the whole thing.  But it's a wonderful tale.  26 years later, going back home with an Australian accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I don't see the link.  So where's the link, Jeff?  You put some other numbers in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's not a video there?  Well, yeah.  No, it's at the bottom of the top.  No, no, it's at the bottom of the Google section.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's the bottom of the Google section.  So the number is 26?  Yeah, I just decided to go back up and rescue that story.  After falling asleep.  That is such a strange...  The whole thing is strange.  He falls asleep on a train and he never gets back home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, don't play the whole thing.  I don't have any tissues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my God, that's a killer.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ...train together.  My brother just said, I'll stay here and I'll come back.  And I just thought, well, you know, I must just go to sleep and then just wake me up.  And when I wake up the next day, the whole carriage was empty on a runaway train,  a ghost train taking me out of nowhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But a black hole of Calcutta.  I was looking out to Australia, to an Australian family.  And Mum had decorated my room with the map of India, which she put next to my bedside.  I woke up every morning seeing that map and hence it sort of kept the memories alive.  I'm confused.  People would say, you're trying to find a needle in a haystack.  Sort of, you never find it.  I'd have flashes of the places that I used to go, the flashes of my family faces.  There was the image of my mother sitting down with her legs crossed,  just watching her cry.  Life is just so hard.  That was my treasure.  And I was looking at Google Map, realized there's Google Earth as well.  A world where you could zoom into.  I started to have all these thoughts in what possibilities that this could do for me.  I said to myself, well, you know, you've got all the photographic memories and landmarks  where you're from and you know what the town looks like.  This could be an application that you can use to find your way back.  I thought I'll put a dot on Calcutta train station in a radius line that,  you know, you should be searching around this area.  I sort of came across these train tracks and I started following it.  And I came to a train station which reflected the same image that was in my memories.  Everything matched.  I just thought, yeah, I know where I'm going.  I'm just going to let the map that I have in my head to lead me and take me back to my hometown.  I came to the doorstep of the house that I was born  and walked around about 15 meters around the corner.  There was three ladies standing outside adjacent to each other.  And the middle one stepped forward and I just thought, this is your mother.  She came forward, she hugged me and, you know, we were there for about five minutes.  She grabbed my hand and she took me to the house and got on the phone.  And she rang my sister and my brother to say that, you know.  You know your brother that you lost?  His full son appeared 26 years ago.  The one that put you on the train?  We found him.  And was reunited again.  There you are.  Everything's all good.  I helped my mother out.  She doesn't have to be slaving away.  I told you I'd get him back, Ma.  Rest in peace.  Oh, God.  With a needle in the haystack.  The needle was there.  Everything's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, if Jimmy Kimmel shows up later in this video, I'm...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Good point.  You know, it is too good.  You're right.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Touch far-fetched.  But okay.  Okay.  He's got a book.  There's more to it.  He's written a book about this long way home.  Did Google pay for this thing or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would imagine they produced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they paid for the ad, right?  Yeah.  And since it's an interesting story.  Wow.  His mother is Jimmy Kimmel.  That's it.  Aaron, why don't you do a...  He's the big brother, Jimmy Kimmel.  Why don't you do your tip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  So this week on that note, boy, that's hard to find.  Wow. Yeah.  Take that number.  Yeah. Thanks.  Thanks for that, Jeff Jarvis.  So I've got an app actually this week and it's called Focal.  And there's been a few of these apps that have come out of the Cyanogen mod going public thing  where people have taken the Cyanogen mod...  Developers that were helping with Cyanogen mod and maybe had a piece of that  have taken what they were working on and actually put it on Google Play,  on the Google Play Store for people just to download on any phone they want.  They don't have to download Cyanogen mod.  So one of these is called Focal and it's in beta right now.  It's not perfect.  It doesn't work every time.  Just a heads up.  But what it does do is pretty cool.  So Focal actually gives you the opportunity to do things like the Panorama,  the Google Panorama mode or the Photosphere mode and all that kind of stuff.  If you don't have Google Edition on your phone, you can just get this app.  It does a pretty good job of emulating all the features.  Oh, there we go.  Here it is.  So it does a pretty good job of emulating all the features that you would get in the Google,  but with more too.  There's a ton of features in here.  So you can do things like they have an HDR mode.  They have different scenes for night mode.  Just click on it.  It'll give you all the scenes over here.  Sunset mode, things like that.  Party mode.  A bunch of different effects that you can do.  Sepia, black and white.  You can adjust the ISO.  You can do things like burst mode if the app that you have on your phone doesn't support.  Burst mode, you can use this to do burst, which I was doing earlier with IaaS.  Timer mode, things like that.  So there's all kinds of cool things that you can do with it.  Also, it's got some advanced focusing features.  So I don't know if we can do this live.  We'll see if the camera can pick it up, but you can click anywhere on the screen  and it'll focus on that particular place.  So the focus doesn't have to be in the middle.  You can move it around.  I can focus on my laptop.  I can focus.  Whoops, come on.  I can focus over here.  I can focus over here.  You just touch.  It focuses wherever you're pointing and then you can take a picture.  The other really cool thing that it does too is it gives you a preview  that's separate from the preview.  Oh, look, I took a picture of my laptop just then.  It gives you a preview, a quick preview of some different things.  There's IaaS checking something out that he got.  This is the burst mode.  So there's a bunch of these.  And then if you don't like one, if you don't like a photo,  you just swipe down to delete it.  So it's really easy to use and a really basic camera with a lot of features.  And again, it was put out by this guy who was doing this for Santa Jemod  and for whatever reason couldn't have this app in the public version of Santa Jemod,  I guess.  And so he decided, hey, I'll just put this over the fence as an app in the Play Store.  The other really cool thing about this guy is they are starting a new mod  and it's called OmniMod.  And I would highly recommend people go check this out.  I'm sorry, OmniROM.  It's at OmniROM.org.  And what they're doing with OmniROM is they're kind of picking up,  I would say, where Santa Jemod left off.  Everything on here is entirely open source and it's also being used as a learning tool.  If you're into modding your phone or you want to take an open source version from  Android open source version and mod it and make your own mod to run on your phone,  they're actually giving you the tools to do that.  So they're putting up the source code, they're putting up tutorials,  they're helping people get involved in the Android ecosystem.  Kind of what I would say the same way that Santa Jemod did when they first got started.  So if you're into open source and you're into Android,  I would highly recommend checking out OmniROM.org.  And those are the same people that put up this application called Focal.  So it's really cool.  It's free to download.  And if you want to donate, there's a donate option.  You can buy a different version of the app that's $299,  but it's not a pro version or anything.  It's just a way for people to donate and support the app.  So there you go.  Very cool.  Focal, check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thanks to the chat room.  They pointed out that AnyDo's beta is now public.  The calendar version of AnyDo.  If you're an AnyDo user, and I apologize, Gina,  because I know Gina makes a great to do app for Android.  But Any...  No need to apologize.  Any.do is really beautiful and gorgeous and works with Google calendars.  I use it a lot for task management.  And they've been kind of saying, oh, we're going to do a calendar,  we're going to do a calendar.  You can now get it on...  You've been able to get it on iOS, but you can now get it on Android.  But to do this, you have to go to Google Plus,  to the AnyDo Superusers Google Plus page and join that community.  So if you show mine, you'd be better off.  There you go.  Join this community, AnyDo Superusers.  It's Google Plus, AnyDo Superusers.  And then you'll see in the About This Community,  the ability to check, become an AnyDo Superuser or a Cal Superuser.  That's what you want.  Once you've done that, it'll say, OK, I see you.  And then you can join the test.  Then you can download it from the Play Store.  You have to do this.  And that's because it's a little buggy.  It's beta.  But it is very interesting and very beautiful.  I have to say, I've been a fan of AnyDo for a long time  because it's a gorgeous app.  And I think they've done a very nice job with the calendar app as well.  It's got some unique features.  Do you want me to show it over this way?  Because in that way, you don't have to change calendars.  I'll give it to Aaron.  You still got that?  There it is.  So you can see there's the calendar.  If you swipe that up, you'll see the to-do list and the task manager.  It also has a photo theme and some other interesting features.  It crashes a lot.  It's very buggy.  But if you've been wondering, when am I?  Now you're getting a phone call from that fellow.  If you're wondering, yeah, that's his number just in case anybody wants to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We didn't do it on purpose.  We can't be held responsible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want to know, if you've been seeing this and want to know how to get it on Android,  that's how you do it.  And this just went public today.  So you join the AnyDo Super Users group on Google+.  AnyDo, Any.Do, I guess.  Any.Do space super splash users, space users.  And then click that link and you can download it.  Cool.  I know.  I've been waiting for a while.  I'm a big AnyDo fan.  I'm just interested to see what they come up with as a calendar.  And it's very beautiful.  Very, very gorgeous.  All right.
