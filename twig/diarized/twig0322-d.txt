Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Jeff Jarvis has the day off, but Mike Elkins here, Barry Schwartz from SearchEngineLand.com.  Why did Twitter appoint a Google stalwart to run the board?  I have some theories.

Jeff Jarvis is traveling and unavailable today, but that's not anything to worry about because  look who we have.  Mike Elgin, news director at Twit.  Now that's something to worry about.  And for the first time you've been on this show, you're using a computer.  It's a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has a keyboard.  I figure everybody's doing it.  You're using a Mac.  Is this a new Mac or you just decided not to use your Pixel?  This is the Mac.  I like to switch it around, flip, you know, but this is frankly, I'm too lazy.  I'm too lazy to come up with a novel device to use.  I'm just using my regular laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also here, and I don't know what he's using, Barry Schwartz from Search Engine Land.  Great to have you here as well.  Great to be here.  Big honor.  Thank you so much.  Oh, no honor at all.  We're honored to have you.  We love Search Engine Land.  I'm using a Mac also.  Oh shoot.  Me too.  What are we doing this week in Google?  This is crazy.  Let's just make a Mac break weekly and be done with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google send us a gross of pixels and we'll all be using those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually I'm really, and I was talking about this before the show, I'm waiting in a couple  of weeks I'll have the new Microsoft Surface Book.  And I'm actually seriously thinking I'm going to try to use it full time for a month.  Like not use Windows for a month.  That is a challenge for me as a Mac user for many decades.  But we'll see.  We'll see.  I just, I feel like Windows 10 is pretty nice and I'm really looking forward to using the  stylus and the touch.  And I also feel like once you get used to using touch, you want to touch the screen.  I find myself touching the screen a lot.  And I think this was, the Pixel, that's one of the things I love about the Pixel.  And it's funny because this is like the Pixel.  It's 3 by 2 instead of 16, 9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I want, they have the big Chrome bases.  They're giant screens.  They're designed to be proper.  You had that for a while.  Well yeah, we reviewed it before you buy.  And it's so close to being the perfect computer for me.  It's just too low.  It's just too slow.  It's too slow.  I'm like, I want a Pixel version of that.  A high res, beautiful screen, fast performance version of that and I'm done.  That would be the computer I would use full time.  Well, not full time because it's not mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft's Surface Book is the same size as a Pixel.  13 inch screen, but it's higher resolution.  It's 3,000 by 2,000.  Yeah, it's a beautiful, beautiful screen.  So that's going to be interesting to see how that is.  I mean, I think the Pixel looks great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The only thing I'm worried about, and you can confirm whether this is a problem or not  a problem with the Surface Book, is whether or not when you rip off the, well you detach  the top, you're looking at three hours with the tablet.  Yeah, that's a little light.  As just a tablet, forget about the keyboard, that's the worst battery life of any tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We talked about that on Windows Weekly and Paul was of the opinion that the reason they  did that is if they had put enough battery in there to go longer, it would have been  tippy.  Yeah.  And so they really wanted to, that's why the weird hinge.  They really wanted it to be stable.  A lot of touch screens, you start touching the screen, they actually fall over.  Yeah.  I haven't had that problem with the Pixel.  That's a big heavy thing.  But if they put more battery in the lid, apparently it would just make it top heavy.  And also remember, you can detach it, flip it around and close it so that then you get  all 12 hours you have to carry around the big bottom part as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you only get the three hour battery life when you insist on the super thin tablet.  Otherwise, you can use it as a tablet and still get 12 hours of battery life.  It's also I think has to be said that they did all kinds of engineering gymnastics to  make sure it wouldn't tip over, especially the hinge.  The whole point of the hinge.  Hinge is why?  Nobody understands this unless you've been watching Windows Weekly.  But what it does is it makes the bottom of the back go back further so that it doesn't  tip over.  So that the hinge sort of unrolls so the actual distance from the very front of what's on  the table to what's the back of what's on the table is an extra inch.  Right.  Right?  And everybody wonders why the crazy hinge but that's what it's all about.  It also looks pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty cool.  Which you can't deny.  Now I feel like the Chromebook Pixel is in many ways a perfect computer.  So I'll be interested to see.  I think 3x2 is not a bad thing.  We're so used to wide screens now but I don't think it's a bad thing.  Google buys a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y,  z dot com.  For some reason.  Yeah, because it's not live now.  If you go there nothing happens.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think they're crazy.  That explains it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, hey, you know Larry Page had an extra 10 bucks in his pocket.  They are called Alphabet after all.  And they had to use xyz.com.  Which was kind of, or no, what was it?  What is it?  It's abc.xyz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  .xyz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which I think is a little easier to type than abcdfgh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I for one would prefer that they use this one, the long one.  It's going to go to Alphabet anyway.  All the products and stuff like that are on the individual company websites.  So why not?  Just do it.  It'll really make them stand out.  That's my advice to you, Larry Page and Sergey Brin and all the rest of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Barry, when you say the whole alphabet, you don't sing it, do you?  I do not sing period.  So I find myself going abcdfgh.  The programming worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does.  And that's a great way to remember what comes first.  It's like, well, does P come before?  I don't remember if so.  I'm just going to sing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But my kids do sing it, yeah.  Yeah, of course.  The domain was created in 1999 by somebody.  Google updated on Wednesday.  They took control of it according to the Whois domain database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The most boring possible explanation is they just didn't want anyone else to own it.  And so they're going to, they're buying it to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They wanted the headline Google buys Alphabet.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus they're cheap.  Plus they lost, they lost Google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why wouldn't you hook it up to something?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, come on, Google.  That's an, that's a strange oversight.  Do we know who owned it before?  No, do you?  I don't know.  And why they owned it?  Probably some, probably some Joe bought it and just, you know, but someday Google will  name itself Alphabet and then I'll be able to sell this for millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google does own more than 18,000 domains.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they are a domain registrar themselves.  So I doubt they actually had to buy it.  They just took it.  They just took it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're Google.  We're Alphabet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How does that work?  Does ICANN get a cut?  It must get a cut.  How does that work?  Cause ICANN makes you a registrar.  You have to be ICANN approved otherwise you can register.  You don't have any names, but nobody will know.  Presumably the Google domain registry is at ICANN.  Do they kick back to ICANN?  They must kick like a buck back to ICANN.  Got to be.  Got to be.  Otherwise domains, you'd be able to get them for two bucks, right?  There's got to be some amount that ICANN gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's got to be a wholesale price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Barry, did you know that when you got on this show, we'd be talking about dopey stuff like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this?  Yeah, I've watched a couple times.  Oh, you knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Okay.  So he bought Google.com.  He bought it for 12 bucks.  He owned it for one minute before somebody noticed.  A guy was a student and a former Google employee, Sanmay Vid, he bought Google.com due to an  administrative issue at the search giant, according to CNBC.  He was surprised as one might be to find the name up for sale.  When he bought it, the $12 transaction went through and ownership of the site was transferred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he had access to the webmaster tools for Google.com.  Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  That's gold.  He could have been next to the whole entire site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Holy cow.  So now recently he's been given a bug bounty by Google's security team for revealing the  weakness in the domain buying system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it really a weakness?  They released the name.  The weakness was Joe in accounting who's no longer there.  He's been sent to the Russian front.  It's not a programming flaw.  So he had it only for about a minute before the purchase was canceled.  What a minute.  What a thrilling minute that must have been.  I own Google.com.  And he did it through the Google Domain Service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard he actually donated the money that Google gave it back to some charity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google doubled it because he did that.  So it's a very happy ending here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, gosh, that would be fun.  Just to own for a minute.  I own Google.  I'm the man who owned Google.com.  Just for a minute.  Nobody used apparently the notification center in Chrome.  So they took it out.  Yeah, actually, I found it very annoying because you'd go to a page, say the verge, and it  would say, would you like us to would you like to allow notifications because you have  to permit it?  And you'd say that.  And then in addition to the OS notifications you're getting, which are annoying enough,  you'd be getting notifications from your browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then when you wanted notifications, they would happen while you were sleeping.  And then you come back and they were gone.  And so I just think this is one of those features that nobody really cared about.  Nobody noticed.  Nobody knew was there.  In fact, the majority of people listening to this and watching this show are like there  was a notification center.  I mean, this is really under the radar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And while it's gone now, it'll be removed from Windows, Mac and Linux in the next version  of Chrome.  However, you'll still have it in Chrome OS because the OS itself has no notification  capabilities.  So this is how it does.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Barry?  This is a very common thing.  Google is constantly releasing new cool things.  So then a year or two later, just saying nobody actually started using it.  So we're going to ditch it and try something else.  So it's not unheard of from Google.  They are constantly doing these types of things.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't you think it hurts them a little bit?  Because for instance, a developer in order to use this would have to put the code into  the app saying use the notification center.  And that's some work.  And I think every time Google does one of these things and pulls back on it, I understand  why shouldn't they prune useless branches.  But I feel like developers might then be less likely to try something out the next  time like AMP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  What's going to happen is that they're going to... notifications are going to result in  an error.  Now I have to fix my code.  Yeah, exactly.  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there going to be an error now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  That's what Google says.  And API events tied to the center will no longer fire.  So it's...  I'm not really clear on exactly what the effect will be, but I guess we'll hear about this  when it's really implemented.  So yeah.  And Google does have a reputation for killing things that small numbers of people really  love.  And of course Google Reader being the biggest example of that.  So everybody's really worried about everything Google does.  And nobody really feels like they can jump in with all fours into things like this because  it's just... who knows what they're capable of.  Who knows what these people are capable of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just today they also announced that the Ajax crawling schema for webmasters is no longer  being recommended and they're getting rid of it.  So that's another example.  And they're constantly doing these things and they're constantly releasing new things  like app indexing and the AMP thing we're talking about.  So the question to me is always, should we go ahead and invest in these technologies?  I used to be the first.  I used to be the first to implement everything Google said.  And then when app indexing came out and AMP came out, I'm like, you know what?  I'll just wait a little bit and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the Ajax thing?  Does that mean crawling Ajax pages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google has been getting much better at crawling Ajax web pages over time.  And they used to have this protocol back in 2009 to assist Google's crawlers, Googlebot,  to crawl Ajax related content.  So you actually kind of had to hack your website if it was built in Ajax with different codes  to enable Google's Google's spiders to actually crawl through your Ajax website.  Google said today that they are no longer supporting that proposal because they're good  enough at indexing real Ajax websites without that hack.  And they're telling people to remove that code and just build it the normal way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, you're not going to get an error, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you will get an error.  The question is, will your site be indexed in the future?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  I don't see.  I used to see all the time errors from crawling JavaScript sites.  Like you'd see in the site description would say this site requires JavaScript, things  like that.  But I don't see those much anymore.  Is that because Google's gotten better crawling sites that are not HTML?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Google's much better at crawling sites that are not HTML.  Plus Google will sometimes if you have a website that just has a search box or something,  kind of like the Google homepage, they might go ahead and actually enter content and submit  just to get behind the content to get in there so they can start crawling the site.  So they're actually much better at detecting that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason I mention that is our website is all in Node.js.  So if you view the source code on our site, there's not a lot of content.  It's all JavaScript.  I mean it gets rendered by the time actually when you view it, you're seeing HTML.  But what Google might see when it crawls the site is probably not what you're going to  see when you surf the site.  So that's always been in my mind, oh, is that a cause for concern?  But I guess not.  Google's smart enough to...  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you ever go into the Google Search Console and you actually do a render of your website,  I'm sure it actually looks like what you see it now.  Googlebot is actually now able to see what the user sees for the most part, except for  Flash and certain other technologies.  But for the most part, they're able to see the actual website as a user would see it.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crawl errors.  So this is part of the Webmaster Tools.  Is this the search appearance thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So go to crawl, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, crawl errors.  Fetch as Googlebot.  Fetch as Google.  So this will show me what a page...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can click on the fetch and render button for your desktop, the big red button in the  middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fetch and render.  And then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's trying, and then once it goes, it's going to give you a little link to click on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  It says pending.  Redirected, redirected.  So this is, by the way, something we've been kind of banging on because, as you can see,  Google has not been doing a good job of indexing our site.  And it's because we moved to a new site and I think we did something wrong.  So stuff is getting redirected.  Ay, ay, ay.  I shouldn't probably be doing the...  Yeah, see?  Getting a redirect.  Oh, I know why, because I did HTTP, not HTTPS.  What a mess.  Trying to do the right thing because Google says make it HTTPS and we'll index you better.  But then it's a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to go ahead and now verify your site on the HTTPS side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get that, Patrick?  Verify on HTTPS.  Barry from Search Engine Land says so.  And maybe that might be what was wrong all along.  So we verified it, obviously, in the old days under HTTP.  Now that we're HTTPS, we need to re-verify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  The trick for webmasters when they're moving to HTTPS, if you do it for Google reasons  or for security reasons, is you keep your HTTP profile there and you add your HTTPS  profile into Google.  And then you'll be able to see as Google starts to de-index the HTTP version, you'll see your  index count in Google Search Console drastically go down.  And at the same time, the HTTPS index count will drastically go up.  And that's basically a tool for webmasters to follow that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Webmasters stuff is so complicated.  By the way, I see that we have some very nice ASCII art in our robots.txt.  Somebody spent a lot of time doing ASCII art in our robots.txt file.  I wonder who did that.  Is that you, Patrick?  Yeah, everybody who has a website should obviously be using Google.com slash webmasters.  And those webmaster tools are fabulous.  We've had, of course, the guy who for years was making those videos was Matt Cutts.  Very really great stuff.  This is useful stuff.  Barry, someday we should just do a show.  You could explain what all this crap means to me.  Look at all this.  Holy cow.  Google has filed paperwork with the Federal Aviation Administration for two new drones,  unmanned aerial vehicles, UAVs, and gadgets spotted these.  There's one already, which is the Google drone delivery project, Project Wing.  But it turns out this is not for Project Wing.  This is from Project Titan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to be confused with Apple's car project called Project Titan.  Oh, you're right.  Oddly enough, they think they're a bunch of Titans.  They are Titans of industry.  They are Titans of the tech industry.  So this is their very high-flying solar-powered drone program that is...  So it's for internet.  It's internet access.  Yes, exactly.  And so part of this story...  This competes with Loon.  Well this is an alternative to Loon.  It competes with Facebook's internet.org high-flying drone delivery system.  But either way, it's really cool.  What's interesting about this in part is the fact that they are going to be testing in  the U.S., which has been difficult for a lot of companies.  They also have a great relationship with NASA.  They manage Moffat Field right near their headquarters, which has a lot of opportunities  to test drones indoors because the building is so large.  It's a dirigible hangar.  It's an old dirigible hangar.  So this is the kind of news you hear about this.  But there are no details to be had other than the fact that it exists.  There's two of them.  On paper they look identical.  The FAA requires cryptic information about each of the drones, and there are two of them,  and both have exactly the same numbers in every single field.  So we don't know the difference between these two.  They could be identical, and there's just two physical vehicles.  But who knows?  Who knows what's going on?  It's kind of interesting.  I saw this story break.  I sort of started looking around at the job boards, the kind of people they're hiring,  all the stuff they're doing around drones.  They're staffing up big time around this.  They've got a New Mexico facility where they're doing a lot of drone development, literally  under the radar, I guess you would say, or in this case over the radar, because the altitude  on these things is so high.  But this is really exciting.  Meanwhile, they are still working on delivery drones.  So I have a cool...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How cool would it be if they actually went ahead and made real-time Google Street Views?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be cool.  And the funny thing is, if you look at the type of jobs that they're hiring for, they're  building these aircraft completely from scratch.  They're hiring materials people, people who are specialists in wing design.  They're hiring...  They're doing it all.  It's really fascinating that a company like Google does this.  I wonder why they wouldn't just buy off-the-shelf drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe nothing like that exists.  Or just random from Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not like the drone is the product.  It's like a cell tower.  You're not going to...  It's kind of how Google works, though, isn't it?  Well, I think they get dissatisfied with the pace, and they can throw money and engineering  talent at things.  For example, Project Loon is a perfect example of people who have been doing ballooning and  doing some of the things that they've been working on, the navigation of the balloons  and so on, for a long, long time.  But when Google got involved and really started pouring Google money at it, they were shattering  records for how long a balloon could stay aloft after decades of research facilities  and all kinds of other people working on how do you keep balloons aloft for a long period  of time.  And so they really just accelerate the development of this, because of course, if they just waited  for off-the-shelf parts to serve their particular needs, they would probably have to wait a  lot longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Off-the-shelf drones.  Off-the-shelf drones.  Exactly.  This is one actually that Barry says is going to affect him.  I didn't know that you have a cloud service called ShulCloud.  Is this for synagogues?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a synagogue management platform that's completely web-based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How cool is that?  So you say that this might imp...  We talked about this last week, the new Safe Harbor ruling or the overturn of the Safe  Harbor ruling in the EU means that if you're a data provider in the EU, you have to adhere  to laws of each of the individual countries.  So that would impact you.  So you do have operations outside of the US?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have physical operations, but I have customers that use...  I have synagogues in the UK and different EU regions that are paying a monthly service  fee to use this service.  And part of that includes us storing data, collecting financial data, donations, membership  data and so forth.  And a lot of the EU, mostly based in London, are saying, well, we need something from you  Now that the EU Safe Harbor ruling has been overturned, so what do I do?  And then I'm pointing to Amazon, Salesforce, Google, and they're all using this type of  model clauses, but it's much more complicated for me to implement that because I don't really  have the infrastructure, the legal background and so forth to do that.  And my lawyer is not so aware of what to do.  So it's not that easy for me to actually implement.  So I'm still waiting to see.  You're not alone apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even the EU is not sure what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Barry, what if you were just...  What if you just moved to Europe?  Solve this problem?  No.  And bring your servers with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think some of the options are to have a representative base in Europe, which makes  it easier.  But I still think it doesn't solve.  I don't know.  Honestly, I got an email from three of the synagogues in London area saying, what do  we do now?  I'm like, just trust us.  We're OK.  And they're like, no, it's not good enough.  So I'm figuring out what to do right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently, there's a debate even within the EU about what it means.  This is from an article at Data Center Knowledge.  There are two schools of thought.  One school of thought is that safe harbor is dead.  And that means that there's no protection for overseas data center operators like you,  Barry.  You just have to adhere to the laws of the various countries you're in.  The other, and according to David Snead, who's the co-founder and attorney with the Internet  Infrastructure Coalition, which is a US kind of industry group that includes Google, Amazon  and Equinix, says that he thinks that the European Union and the European Commission  in particular have to just figure out how to interpret it.  That there needs to be some new policy.  So meanwhile, Barry and people like him just don't know what to do.  It's unrealistic to think Snead says that all transatlantic data is going to have to  stop as a result of this decision.  That certainly would be an impact that the EU would not like.  The European Commission is likely to figure out a way to accommodate it and the US as  well.  So in other words, he's saying, he's probably right, there's no need to panic.  What are you going to do, Barry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Panic?  I asked my clients, my synagogue clients there to just hold off, give me a couple months  to see what they're doing and we'll figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're not going to allow overseas customers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're just signing up.  I'm not stopping them from signing up.  They can't use it.  They could use it.  I think it leaves a liability on them versus on me and they don't want that, I believe.  I could be completely wrong, but according to New York law, I don't have to do anything  until the end of 2016.  If they want to sign up, I'm not liable for anything.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, I'm sure the EU does not recognize New York law.  I know.  So you're good luck.  Have fun.  And you thought it was a good idea.  Just a little business on the side.  Exactly.  Actually, it's really cool.  When did you start that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We started this about three and a half years ago, almost four years ago, just for my own  synagogue, and then all the other synagogues in the area started wanting it.  And now we have close to 400 synagogues using it across the world.  It's pretty insane.  And what does it manage?  It's basically when you have members sign up to your synagogue, they get dues, they  get monthly dues, and they get different honors they give to their shul, and they pay different  things, and they get reminded about family birthdays and death notices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't forget to buy your Rosh Hashanah tickets, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  High holiday Rosh Hashanah tickets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very important.  Get those tickets early.  That's cool.  That's really interesting.  And you wrote it just as a service for your own temple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Like most software companies start, it's like, hey, you scratched your own itch.  There's a need for it.  You built it, and it's filling a need.  What's it written in?  It's PHP MySQL, and it's on Amazon's AWS service.  AWS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think AWS, I mean, that would be in Amazon's interest, wouldn't it, as a provider  of these services?  There's a billion dollar business we now know for Amazon.  It would be smart of them to act on behalf of all their customers and kind of go to the  EU and say, okay, we've got all these guys doing this.  What do we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So I think Amazon has their thing directly with, but I don't think it covers everything  for the provider.  So I would sign up.  I would pay a thousand plus dollars, whatever it costs, to have a third party verify whatever  I need to verify and confirm that I'm compliant, like you have with PCI, HIPAA, all these verification  services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would pay for that.  Right.  And we hope that's all that would be required.  Although part of the problem is that, for instance, Germany has much more draconian  laws than, say, England.  And I presume this means you'd have to be, I don't know, compliant with each country.  Amazon has obtained approval from the EU data protection authorities for an agreement and  model clauses, which allows it to continue to serve its European customers.  So it says, with our EU approved data protection agreement and model clauses, AWS customers  to run their global operations using AWS in full compliance with EU law.  That's what I'd say.  I'd say, hey, I'm cool.  I got AWS behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've said that to them and they said, we're cool with the AWS side, but we need to be  also managing our data.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's complicated.  This is the whole problem with this entire fiasco, which is that instead of working toward  an alternative for safe harbor, they simply threw a monkey wrench in it and everybody's  confused.  Nobody, including Amazon, really knows what is going to happen here.  And Barry is a perfect example of what the real problem is.  Barry himself has been around long enough to where he knows, I think this is going to  be fine.  But he's got customers who are pushing back and saying, well, we need assurances.  We need more than just your sunny optimism.  And there are none to be had.  There's no place where you can go and be assured that this is what's going to happen.  Nobody knows.  It's a really, really bogus situation that Europe has created here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  We got more to talk about.  Barry Schwartz is here from search engine land.com.  What do you cover, Barry?  I've seen you.  I see your byline all the time.  Is there a particular beat you cover there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I cover most of the organic search stuff, SEO, webmaster and local search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, you have a big article on Search Cap right on the front page.  And Google has discontinued support for Ajax crawling.  We just talked about that.  So this is right up your alley.  Well, I'm glad you're with us.  It's nice to meet you.  Thank you for joining us.  Thank you.  Mike Elgin also here.  We just pull them across the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Sometimes I have a rolling chair, we just roll it across the staff.  Yeah, it's very convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so good to have you.  He's the news director here, of course, and runs Tech News Tonight.  I'm sorry, Tech News Today every Monday through Friday at 11, I'm sorry, 10 a.m. Pacific 1700  UTC on twit.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where you will also occasionally find Barry as a guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  I don't think there's anybody in the tech news business who hasn't been a guest.  How many editors a day do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It ranges from one to five.  I've seen sometimes a big number.  We probably average 15 a week.  Wow.  Something like that.  Yeah.  And it's not all of them, it's just the good ones.  We don't have the pickup artists, we don't have the people who are lagging.  We have the bleeding edge people like Barry who are breaking news and finding things out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what you want.  You want to watch a new show with the authoritative sources, the reporters who are covering it.  Is that what they call them?  Pickup artists.  I like it.  Those are the blogs that just take somebody else's story, rewrite it.  Exactly.  I hate it when I follow a link and I see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is part of what we do on Tech News Today is we know the difference between who broke  the story and who didn't.  We get the person who broke the story on the show to talk about how they broke it and there's  always content you won't read in their articles.  I try to do that when we're talking about something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Follow the link.  At some point they'll always, I hope, always credit the original source.  I like to follow all the way down to the original source.  Our show today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.  If you're in the unenviable position of having to hire people for your business, think of  it this way.  What is a challenge is also a huge opportunity.  Those people make your business.  That's what a company is.  It's made up of the people who work there and your company can succeed or fail based  on the hires you are going to make today.  That's why it's so important to go to the right places to find the right people.  Sometimes that means kissing a lot of toads to find that prince or princess.  ZipRecruiter, this is their new tagline.  I've just invented it.  Makes it easier to kiss a lot of toads.  A hundred plus job boards with a single click of the mouse, including all the social networks  like Twitter and Facebook and Craigslist.  It'll give you access not only to all the people on those job boards, but they have  six million current resumes in their database.  Within a day of you posting, you will start getting lots of candidates.  Here's the best part.  You're not going to get them calling your phone or sending you email direct.  They'll all filter into ZipRecruiter's trademark interface.  This interface is great because it gives you a chance to very quickly, and since you're  going to get hundreds of applicants, very quickly screen them so you get rid of anybody  who doesn't fit and rate them and then hire the right person in a day or two, you're going  to have the best candidate for that job you've ever seen because it's very easy to separate  the wheat from the chaff, the toads from the princes.  It's a great system.  No wonder more than 400,000 businesses, including Twitter, have used ZipRecruiter to hire.  You can do it too.  We got an email from Dan.  He was very happy.  He sent us an email.  This is the quote.  The best part about running a business when you need to hire is you have to spend extra  time recruiting exactly when you're short staffed, when you have the least time to spend.  But with ZipRecruiter, I've gotten quality candidates within 24 hours of posting a job.  ZipRecruiter's website makes this process so much faster by letting me manage candidates  in one place.  That's the secret sauce here.  Not only do you reach out to more people and more places and more candidates, not only  do you get more people and more candidates for that job, but you have an easy way to  manage all those applicants.  And that's fantastic.  Find the right person fast.  Go to ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  You'll get a four day free trial.  That's enough really to hire that person you need today.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twig.  And we thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Barry Schwartz from Search Engine Land, Mike Elgin from Twitter, myself.  We're talking about the week's Google news.  Jeff Jarvis is on assignment.  He's probably on a plane, actually.  This is a story from Search Engine Land I found interesting.  More than half of Google's searches are on mobile now.  Half of Google's searches happen on mobile.  You knew it was going to happen.  Well, you know, more than half of our visitors to our website are mobile.  I'm sure that's true of Search Engine Land too.  But search is a little different because I don't know about how you use mobile, but  I don't go to the Google web page and type in a search on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's an interesting fact because, of course, a huge number of access of content  on the web is through apps.  So there's apps over here and then there's people using browsers on their mobile devices  over there and they're different.  And this is saying that among all the browsers, desktop and mobile, now more than half are  on mobile.  The vast majority of access of Internet usage is on mobile devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what that tells me.  If half our searches are on mobile, that means like 90% of computing is on mobile, right?  It has to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has to be.  And people are using it.  Yes.  And there's also an age differentiation on this.  The younger people are, the more likely they are to use their mobile device for everything.  And the geezers are the ones using desktop computing for everything.  And then there's this spectrum between the two.  But yes, people are still using, people are still opening browsers on the mobile devices.  And typing in that window.  Yeah, and typing, I'm searching for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, it seems like such a pain in the butt.  It's fun to browse on a mobile keyboard and all that.  What's interesting also, the stats come from Comscore, is that searches are not down on  desktop.  The desktop searches continue to be strong.  It's just that mobile has ramped up so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've outsourced our brains to the internet and we just don't even have to know anything  anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet you a lot of the searches are, okay Google or hey Siri.  I bet you that's, I mean, because typing is such a pain in the butt.  Do we know how many of these are voice driven and how many are typed in?  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they haven't shared much about what's voice driven, what's not.  If it's Google now on tap and all these other things that drive search per se.  And they might not be direct searches, but we don't know if it's typed.  I assume it includes both typed searches on mobile as well as voice searches.  And maybe also native searches, searching for apps and searching for content within  apps using app indexing.  So it can be a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well you make an interesting point.  Now on tap is just starting to roll out with Marshmallow, the Android 6.  That's going to double the number.  As soon as that becomes widespread immediately because you'll be using, it's pretty cool.  The only Marshmallow I've been able to use is Jason's Nexus 7 and he side loaded Marshmallow  onto it.  And it's so cool.  You're on anything, any webpage and you just tap to select a word or an idea or whatever  and you get these results.  I think you're going to see more mobile search because of that.  Google's nuts.  Google, those guys at Google are smart.  They figured that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus more people are going to be using Siri and Google Now and Cortana and Alexa and what  half the time when people are asking for arbitrary information, that's going through a search  engine as well whether it's Bing or Google, Google's knowledge base, whatever it is.  And I think that's another trend in that direction.  So it's really kind of a fascinating fact that people are doing this kind of behavior.  And it also raises the question of what's a mobile device?  So a smartphone is a mobile device.  Is a tablet a mobile device?  Is that like that?  You know, a 7 inch tablet.  Is that a mobile device?  Yeah, I don't know.  Is a Microsoft Surface Book a mobile device?  No.  Is a Surface Pro.  But is an iPad Pro?  I say no.  That's iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg famously said it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he would have to admit that it's a portable device.  So he carried around the house was his idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Barry, how do they break this down?  CommScore must have a rule of thumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't know if they're breaking this figure down by tablet searches, but in terms of Google's  definition of what's a tablet, what's not, it depends.  I would think on some cases, does the device have apps on it?  And then those are mobile apps.  So maybe it's a mobile device.  But on the other end, when it comes to building a mobile friendly website, according to Google's  Webmaster guidelines, a desktop version of your site rendering on a tablet is perfectly  fine.  There's no problem with that.  But a desktop version rendering on a mobile device, like a phone type of device, is not  acceptable.  It's not mobile friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh.  Is six inches the cutoff?  What's the size cutoff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't really specify what the cutoff is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean, so this is an Nexus six at six inches, an Nexus seven is one.  It's a little bit bigger.  Is that the cutoff right there?  I mean, that's a weird place to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe if it gets phone calls or not, maybe that's maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  But why would that why would that matter for data?  It's like it's a muddled thing to define.  It's clear on the iOS platform.  You have iOS, you have OS 10.  One is a mobile and the other isn't.  That's one way to do it.  You go over to Google and it's less clear.  Of course, everything on Android could theoretically but now we have the Pixel C. So is that like  a desktop computer?  I'm going to say anything that doesn't have an attached keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's tough.  I'm going to say if there's not an attached keyboard, that's mobile.  Physically, so a Surface Book would not be mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when I use a keyboard with my phone.  But that's not attached.  I see.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's not attached.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just dumb.  You had an article in Search Engine Lane in which you talked about and I thought this might  be telling.  Despite the growth in apps, search remains strong.  Google search in mobile browsers is big.  This comes from a Morgan Stanley report based on the com score data.  But Google search within the Google app is even bigger.  In fact, Google search is the fourth most popular app overall in the US.  And that would include Google, right?  That would include voice search because that goes through that app.  At least on iOS it goes through that app.  I don't know what it does on Android.  I guess it doesn't go through any apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And all of this raises another interesting question which is the number one app by far  is Facebook.  And Facebook is constructing an alternative to the entire internet.  They've recently come out with their own shopping sites.  So they're going after Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've reinvented AOL is what they've done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly what they've done.  So you think of an alternative reality and an alternative internet and when you search  on Facebook, good luck finding anything, but eventually I think they'll have search.  Is that a search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because that whole knowledge graph or whatever they call it, the social search,  that was a big deal when they released it.  Where is it?  Does anybody use it?  I know I use it to search for a person's name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Search for the content of something in a post on Facebook and you will find literally nothing.  It's bizarre that this doesn't bother anybody.  You can't search it.  You can't search it.  And again, they're taking over the world.  If you look at the number of users on Facebook, on Instagram, on WhatsApp, on everything that  Facebook has on their own messenger app, that's the vast majority of users online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The top 25 mobile apps by unique visitors, this is from comscore, June 2015, plus year  to year, year over year growth.  So Facebook is 125, I'm assuming this is million, maybe it's billion, I don't know, 125,000,727,000.  But 9% year over year growth.  You know who's growing faster?  Facebook Messenger, 144%.  But you combine those two, it's completely dominant.  YouTube's in the middle with 18% year over year growth.  Google search is the fourth, as we mentioned, with 16%.  Google Play, Google Maps, Pandora, of all things.  Gmail, Instagram, also a Facebook property.  Apple Music, which is pretty big given that it's only on iOS.  Apple Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pinners is growing.  Meanwhile, Twitter and Snapchat are laying people off.  Yeah.  Because...  Snapchat's laying people off?  Oh yeah.  Yeah, they stopped...  Oh man, I was bullish on Snapchat.  Well, Snapchat itself is doing pretty well, but they launched into creating original content  and this week they decided they're not going to create any...  So the people they're laying off are the people, the editorial staff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  But you know what, I think they're still a very strong platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But again, they're in a different universe, a different stratosphere than...  That's the wrong term.  But they're in a whole different level than Facebook.  Facebook is the equivalent of many, many Snapchats in terms of users.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should Facebook continue to attempt to acquire Snapchat?  You know what I think is interesting is now the executive chairman over at Twitter is  Omid...  You say his name.  I will and just, you've got to give me a second.  He's a Google employee.  Yeah, a long time Google guy.  Kordestani, I think is how you pronounce it.  That's right.  He is actually a former...  So he's not still at Google?  No.  Oh, okay.  See, I was drawing a lot of conclusions from that.  Like, maybe this was the wedge, the camel's nose under the tent of Google taking over  Twitter, which I still think would be a smart thing to do, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was employee number 11 at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's very, I think, very well respected at Google.  He would be the guy.  He was the chief business officer from August 2014 to August...  Oh, till the company reorganized under Alphabet.  And he's now a senior advisor.  So you know what?  He's in that special Google camp of we don't have a job for you, but please continue to  accept this check.  And if you think of anything good, let us know.  He's like big head on the roof.  He is the mole.  He is the guy on the Twitter board now that begins the conversations.  I think this is a sign Google wants to acquire Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would Google...  I mean, of course, I'm sure we've had this conversation many times, but what benefit  could Google bring to Twitter other than truckloads of cash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not what benefit Google could bring to Twitter.  It's what benefit Twitter could bring to Google.  It's all those social signals.  Don't you think, Barry, that helps a lot with search is that one of the things that's missing  at Google.  That's why they created Google Plus.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google's talked about this a lot in terms of social signals.  Katz has talked about it since then.  Other Googlers have talked about it.  And Google's afraid to use Twitter signals because remember when they turned off the  fire hose?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they've remade that deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That deal was remade.  They remade the deal, but they don't want to use that for ranking purposes because they're  afraid they're going to turn it off again and the ranking algorithm will break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why you buy it.  You can't turn, right?  They own it.  They can't turn it off.  So we accept that Google wants those signals.  They really want those signals, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also say it's very, very easy to manipulate, although links are very easy to manipulate.  So plus favoriting something, retweeting something, I don't know, paying a very high profile Twitter  personality to tweet out a link and share stuff.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I may be reading too much into this, but the fact that this guy is now executive chairman  at Twitter just feels to me like Larry called him and said, look, we're not going to have  anything for you after Alphabet.  We would really like to, we've got to, it feels like it's like a John le Carre novel.  Mr. Smiley, you're on the beach.  Go ahead, enjoy your retirement.  Oh, by the way, if you should have any free time, we got a little job for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now Cortestani, he's a really, really deep go guy.  He was employee number 11 in 1999.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's been all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's Iranian.  He moved to the US, I think in 79 or so.  But he worked, where did he work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He worked at a bunch of big companies.  He was at Netscape as a vice president.  He was at Hewlett Packard.  That could be good or bad depending on when he was at Hewlett Packard.  Google.  That's the guy who makes, makes biz deals, right?  Isn't that the guy who would?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's the guy.  He probably, they probably fell in love with a guy when he was going over to the make business  deals with, you know, from Google.  Hi, I'm from Google.  Well, I want to talk business deals.  Jack Dorsey says he tweeted, of course, because that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why would you have a press release or an interview or anything?  He says a great chairperson is the first step toward continuing to make our board one of  the best in the world and purpose built to serve Twitter.  By the way, the first thing he did, of course, was get rid of Dick Costello, the former CEO.  He's still got to have Williams look breathing down his neck.  The other the other founder.  Right.  He's next.  I bet you Eves next.  Omid is a proven and experienced leader who will directly help and coach me and our leadership  and help us recruit the best folks to Twitter.  Well, that's for sure.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think he left Google because he was set out how much money Google spent on the ABCDEFG.com  delay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to say the whole thing if you're going to say ABCDEFGHJK.  I can't.  I'm going to pick URSDUVWXYZ.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And sometimes you got to ask why.  Sometimes why.  So one of the interesting things about him is he grew up in Tehran, Iran, and he went  to an Italian Catholic school in Iran, moved to San Jose at the age of 14 and graduated  from San Jose State and worked at HP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Netscape where he was there kind of at the big growth spurt of Netscape after their  IPO.  Yep.  He also before then he worked at Go.  Remember Go Corp.  You've been around long enough.  Yes, I do.  I do remember.  It was a pen based operating system, right?  Yeah, it was.  Yes.  Or do they make hardware?  I can't remember if they made hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think that was it was an operating.  It was going to be an alternative.  Now one of the things about Kordestani that's a little surprising you think, oh, who's this  guy?  He's a former Google employee.  He's probably, you know, upper middle class lives in Palo Alto.  He's worth $2 billion.  The guy's a billionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He doesn't need a job.  Yeah.  But of course a guy like that, the challenge posed by Twitter would be of interest.  It's the same reason that Marissa Meyer would move to run Yahoo.  What a challenge, right?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How's that working out for her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  What do you think?  We haven't talked about Marissa in ages.  What's going on over at Yahoo?  Ever since Kara Swisher got acquired by Vox, not a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just think that if she looked back at where it would be today, like in hindsight, I probably  think she probably would not have done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Really?  Like she'd be better off at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe.  Yahoo is a hard company to turn around.  I don't think if she looked at her progress as of today that she would think, I turned  the company around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Can't say that.  I think that what's interesting about it is not whether Marissa Meyer has failed or isn't  great enough to turn Yahoo around.  I think what's interesting at this point is we have to confront the probability that Yahoo  is unsalvageable.  First of all, nobody knows what it is.  Nobody knows what its function or purpose is.  Nobody is able to impose a purpose or function on this company after the fact.  I just think it should be stripped for parts and sold off and just dismantled and everybody  should go home or something like that.  I think that Marissa Meyer has done a perfectly good job, as good as anybody could do.  It's just something that can't be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It may be that it was a ship that couldn't be turned.  Or maybe she wasn't the captain to turn it.  Turn it where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it?  It was a portal.  In addition to that, they bought a gazillion little semi-related companies.  It's a content play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She couldn't decide, though, whether it should be a content company or a services company.  She bet on both.  People expected her to choose one or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But again, once you choose one or the other, once you decide, from now on we're going to  be Tumblr.  That's our big play and everything else we're going to get rid of.  You're stripping it for parts.  I think that's exactly what should happen.  By the way, Tumblr is awesome.  Tumblr is a great service that is doing okay.  But again, once you have it inside of the Yahoo umbrella, it's kind of a turd.  You know what I mean?  It's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right.  It could be Squarespace as a standalone or WordPress.com.  Instead, it's a division of Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really think that they need to go in 50 different directions or maybe become Alphabet  and just have independently run companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She got a free pass for a while because they were living on the Baidu cash.  But then they spun that off.  And now the chickens come home.  Didn't they take a mobile approach?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That wasn't that like, we're doing mobile and we're going to do mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little bit.  Remember they updated the Flickr app.  It was really nice.  That's all.  Again, yeah.  Again, Flickr.  But remember, look at the Yahoo stock thing.  It was in the top 10 of the most used apps for reasons I don't fully understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's no reason for a single company to own these different individual properties.  There's no reason.  I don't understand other than, you know, to sell ads and you have an ad network.  But so what?  The ad network itself should be a separate thing.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's one thing she's up to.  She and Mark Pinkus just invested in a startup that makes brain drugs.  They're going to need them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, what's that show?  Limitless.  Have you seen this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you take a pill and you're suddenly smart.  It's a great show.  That's Flowers for Algernon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you die.  The startup, which was founded, is called Knowit.  First of all, do not name your startup NeutroBox, N-O-O-T-R-O-B-O-X, if you want anybody to  say it right.  Apparently they make Neutropics, which are cognitive performance supplements or smart  or brain drugs.  Way better than old tropics.  Like coffee without the jitters.  And I guess one of these guys had worked for Meyer.  She actually hired him at Google.  So maybe that's maybe it's just a personal thing.  He's apparently doing some angel investing.  They're going to make four supplements, Rise, Sprint, Yawn, and a new gummy coffee replacement  called GoCubes.  How could they fail?  How could they fail?  This is a guaranteed.  I'll have some Yawn.  And do you have any of those GoCubes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yawn sounds like a sleeping thing.  What would you want Yawn for?  Go to sleep, right?  Yeah.  It's just so random.  It's just so random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Simple, clean packaging.  I shouldn't say anything because maybe there'll be an advertiser next month.  And monthly subscriber auction.  Is Neutropics going to?  No, okay.  Clean packaging and monthly subscription option.  Well, remember, I don't know if you remember when we first started, before your time, Mike,  we had this company called Brain Tonic.  Remember this?  They came by and they said, we'll give you all the Brain Tonic you want as long as you  just drink it on the air once in a while.  It was supposed to be make you smart.  But it made me sleepy.  Did it make you sleepy, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't remember it making me much of anything.  Tastes like grapefruit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, sleeping more makes you smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would drink, now we probably shouldn't have had four or five cans, but I would drink it  and then I would get loopy.  So it definitely had a maybe.  It was doing something.  It was doing something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we'll see if we'll see what Yawn does.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jerry Kaplan, Robert Carr, Kevin Doran founded GoCorp in 1987 to create portable computers  and operating system and software with a pen based user interface.  Oh, they did have devices.  Omid Kordestani, former senior VP of global business at Google, began his startup career  with Go Corporation.  Bill Campbell, who's chairman at Intuit, also was there.  Randy Commissar, who became CEO of LucasArts was there.  And VP Marketing Mike Homer, who became VP Marketing at Netscape.  And I guess that's probably how Omid got over at Netscape during their IPO.  You have the Penpoint OS.  It ran, oh, remember this, on AT&T's EO personal communicator.  Yes.  Oh God.  I think we have an EO in the basement.  I'm pretty sure we do.  I'm pretty sure we do.  That was going to be the future of something.  It was the future of something.  The EO.  AT&T pulled out.  Co-founder Jerry Kaplan says, in its lifetime, Go generated no meaningful sales.  And there it is.  Where did you find that?  Oldcomputers.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was a big, so imagine a black and white, sort of greenish device with a two inch bezel  and four inches thick with like giant handles on the side.  I've had ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I vividly remember this.  And it looks like, it looks very much like a Newton, doesn't it?  That's the Newton, that looks like the Newton OS on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And look, there's your calendar.  Yeah, those are the days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still have it appleduded in the other room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have several in the other room.  I don't know why.  But you know what was bleeding edge about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was wireless.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wireless.  This was an example of a great idea, of an idea whose time had not come.  Yes.  Because the technology wasn't there yet.  And that's all.  And if it weren't for these, probably.  The Palm Pilot wouldn't have come about.  Yeah, we wouldn't have had the new, we wouldn't have had the Palm Pilot, we wouldn't have  had the iPhone.  So you know, it all kind of works its way up.  But I feel sorry for the people who bought the EO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a collector's item now though.  Look at that.  Look at that.  It has an antenna.  It looks like a phone on there too.  You could send a fax from the beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why AT&T was in it, of course.  The ears were put there by Frog Design.  They said this will differentiate it from everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because AT&T said no to the flippers they wanted to put there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no flippers, we just want ears.  It's incredible.  I probably bought one.  That's what's really sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember spending an enormous amount on mobile devices back in that era.  I think you, like me, believed that this was the future.  I bought an HP Omnibook for $3,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had an Omnibook.  That was the one where the mouse was attached.  You press a button and it would go boing and it had an arm that went back into the machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was literally the best mobile device ever created.  So this was made by the calculator.  You're talking about the first one.  I ruined it by turning it into a regular laptop over time.  But the first one had a little popsicle stick thing, the mouse control.  But it ran on AA batteries.  Remember that?  It had rechargeable batteries, but you could pop those out, put in AA batteries.  It had an incredible keyboard.  Again, it was from the calculator division, so it was super high quality.  It had 12-hour battery life in an era when two hours was normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there you go.  There's that mouse with the arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to love that device.  You would push it down and it would go into the laptop.  And then you'd close it.  That was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not so great if you're a lefty.  But otherwise...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can have re-education camps for people who are left-handed.  That's not a problem.  I had one as well.  I read the Omnibook very well.  But even this version, which wasn't even in color...  Oh, and the other thing that was weird about it is it had Windows and Office in ROM.  Remember that?  So it only had 2MB of RAM.  Well, a lot of these, that's how they worked.  Because the applications executed in ROM.  They said, oh, we'll be updating these and just buy a new ROM.  It's the future.  And then they never did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike and I are old farts, Barry.  Just ignore us.  Yes, we're old.  Someday we'll be sitting on the porch going, you remember the Omnibook?  Whatever happened to that Marisha?  What was her name?  Whatever happened to her?  Oh, she got super smart and moved to Saturn.  Let's take a break.  So Yahoo stocks is bigger than Twitter in application use.  It's grown 10%.  It is not in the top 10, but it's in the top 15, right under Apple Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, the thing is that to compare Yahoo with Twitter is...  You can compare Tumblr, which is one tiny bit of Yahoo with Twitter.  They should be a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see Tumblr on this list at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure they're considered a social network.  No, this is apps.  Those are just mobile apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not even sites.  These are the top 25 mobile apps.  Not even the top 25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's...  Yeah, mobile apps.  I don't think people use Tumblr in the mobile app so much.  But Tumblr has a significant...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That means it's history if you don't use a mobile app.  That's a good point.  Snapchat's not very high.  It's just above Google+.  Are you still...  Are you still...  Well, I'm going to save it for that.  Yeah, save it.  Are you still using that thing?  Our show today brought to you by Where's My Harrys?  Where's my razor?  Give me that razor!  Barry, it's not too late to shave that beard.  All you got to do is get a little Harrys and you'll get a little less Harry.  Harry, I don't think that's their slogan.  I'm good at making a bad slogan.  That's really one of my fortes.  This is the Harrys razor.  The idea is these guys said...  This is what everybody now is...  If you're a hot young thing coming out of school and you want to do a startup, you say,  what is ripe for disruption?  What industry begs to be reinvented on the internet?  Of course, it doesn't take long.  You go to the grocery store and you look at the razor blades under lock and key.  I think a light could go off and you could say, you know what?  These are so expensive that they lock them up in the drugstore.  Surely you can make these for less.  So the guys at Harrys did a little research.  They had some experience.  Jeff, one of them started Warby Parker.  So they had a little experience and they had a little venture funding.  Actually, I think they went to the venture funders and they said,  look, I got an idea.  We can do a direct to you business in razors and razor blades.  But we've got...  There's one little catch.  We've got to buy the factory.  Oh, yeah?  Where's the factory?  It's in Germany.  Well, how much?  It's a lot.  But once we own it, we will own one of only two places in the world that can make these  blades.  And we can make them to our specification for precision, for quality.  And then because we make them, we can sell them for less.  And that's exactly what Harrys does.  They engineer them for sharpness, for high performance.  They ship them for free to your door.  And because they make and ship their own blades, Harrys can charge you a lot less,  like half as much as that Gillette Fusion locked up in the drugstore.  Start with the kit because you're going to need the handle.  Go to harrys.com.  You can get the Truman, which is an amazing deal, for 15 bucks, although I'll tell you  how you can save even more.  Or I have in my hands the Winston.  This is what I use at home because I am an upscale kind of guy.  25 bucks.  You get the rate.  In both cases, you get the handle.  This is the Winston is a nice metal handle, which you can get engraved and everything.  Plus three blades.  This is all for, well, as little as $10.  Plus three blades.  Plus you get the travel cover, which I know people laugh when I say this is my favorite  part, but this way you don't cut your fingers when you reach into your shaving kit.  And then you choose from the Harry's shaving foam gel or the Harry's cream.  As little as $10 when you get the Truman kit and use our discount.  That's an amazing deal.  Then sign up for the monthly resupply or, you know, bimonthly or quarterly, whatever  it is you want.  You can get more shaving cream.  You can get more blades at a very, very good price shipped directly to you for free.  No cost for the shipping.  They also have an aftershave moisturizer that protects and hydrates and smells fantastic.  This is actually a good place to go if you've got a dad or a grad or, you know, you want  to gift somebody in your life.  This is a really welcome gift for men.  They even have this little stand, this cube that you can put your blade in and get engraved  with dad's name.  I just feel like this is really half the price and the best quality, better than what you're  getting in the store.  H-A-R-R-Y-S dot com.  And here's the deal.  Use the offer code TWIG.  Let them know you heard about it on This Week in Google and we'll give you five bucks off  your first order.  That means that Truman kit is ten dollars.  You don't have to tell dad that when you give it to him.  Harry's dot com offer code TWIG.  Save five bucks off and let them know you heard about it on This Week in Google.  We thank them for their support and for keeping us smooth.  So they took apart the OnHub.  Did you buy an OnHub?  I did not.  I bought it and canceled it.  Yeah, I got one.  Did you get one?  I did.  Because I read Ron Amadio's review on Ars Technica and he said this thing is not fast.  It's just a router.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not so special at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I needed something special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a pretty tall house and it didn't, a big house.  It doesn't reach the whole thing.  I was hoping that this would cover all the range of three zones.  I thought I'd get rid of two of my zones and just keep one zone.  Now I have like four zones because of the OnHub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's worse than what you had.  I just read a really good article by Brian X Chen in the New York Times, I think it was  last Sunday.  He said if your router is more than three years old, it's time to get a new router.  And I had been using the Apple Airport Extreme, which I'm sorry I had been recommending for  years.  It's an expensive 180 buck router.  That's why they call it the Extreme.  It was a reference to the price.  I thought it was the best router out there, but I was having all sorts of trouble and  kept dropping.  And I went out and I bought a very nice Asus, it was much more expensive, it was over 200  bucks.  Is that the one with the claws?  Yeah, it looks like a spider.  It's got six antennas, it's three bands.  The AC3200, it's not that new one that they showed, but at IFA that's not out yet.  This is the top of the line Asus.  I got it because they use a version of DDWRT in the firmware.  You can easily hack it.  In fact, I put Merlin on it immediately to turn off the bright lights on the front.  I just love it.  I mean, it's amazing.  In fact, I asked Lisa today, this morning, we've had it for a month, I said, how's the  Wi-Fi been?  Has it dropped lately?  Nope.  Everything working?  Oh yeah, she says so much faster than what I thought was the premium router out there.  So I actually canceled the OnHub because I saw Ron's review and I thought, no, I need  something fast.  Turns out, Brian Whitman writing for Android Police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another frequent tech news today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, he's, and this is actually quoting the exploiters, exploit.rs.  They tore it down and rooted it.  And it turns out the OnHub is basically a Chromebook.  I'm disguised.  There's even a hidden switch, just like on the old Chromebooks, that lets you put it  in developer mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the thing that I'm confused about.  So, okay, when this came out, when they were talking about it before the Ron Amadeus of  the world got their hands on this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were pissed, by the way, about Ron Amadeus' review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure they were.  Yeah, but it was true.  But the spiel that they gave us was this is a new kind of router.  This is unlike anything.  This is for the Internet of Things, home automation, and all the rest.  Okay, so that's exhibit A. And then it comes out and it's like, it's a router.  And it's not that great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got 13 antennas and it tunes the antenna.  And then they, by the way, made by TP-Link for Google.  TP-Link's not a bad manufacturer.  In fact, in the wire cutter, they recommend as their favorite router for under $100 the  TP-Link Archer C7.  So it's not that it's a bad company, but I think Google's specs were very limited.  It turns out when they had to correct it, well, it's 13 antennas and it tunes, but it  doesn't tune all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Things like that.  Right.  So I think we're learning that it's essentially a Chrome OS device, Chromium OS device.  And so I have the feeling that Google is hatching a scheme here that we don't fully understand.  For example, it would make a lot of sense for a future Chromecast, for example, to be  a home automation hub, right?  Or to work with a home automation hub or something.  I think that what I'm saying is that I think that what's going to be interesting about  the on-hub is not in the on-hub yet.  They're priming themselves here for a future where they're going to do something interesting.  So if that's not vague enough, then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there was speculation it might be a home automation hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what it was supposed to be.  It has Zigbee in it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has 802.11.14 or whatever that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Barry, do you have any insight into this?  What do you think they're up to here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no direct insight, but I'm thinking maybe you could even start talking to it,  asking it queries, get search queries back to you.  What's the weather?  Stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We thought that too, because it has a speaker.  It looks like an Echo.  It's only used for once in the whole time you ever use it to do the pairing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the reason I kept it, because I think the future, there's going to be major upgrades  to it.  But who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it absolutely should be an Amazon Echo type of device.  I'm just still so confused why Apple and Google aren't all over this category, why  they're letting Amazon run away with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they, like many of us, didn't understand what the Echo meant until you use an Echo.  It just says, well, I could do that on my phone.  What do I need a black plastic tube in the middle of my kitchen for to do something that's  really not even as good as a Google browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know for a fact that the Siri and the Google Now that are both sitting on my phone are superior  to Alexa, and yet I use nothing but Alexa when I'm at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love Alexa.  And we're going to be buying a second one.  I figured out why it is, by the way, because you're talking to your house.  Yeah, that's right.  You're not talking to your phone.  You're talking to your house, and your house responds.  You know, it's really weird.  Alexa, by the way, we're watching a video of the rocketeers rooting this sucker, whatever  they're called.  This morning, my Alexa woke up, and I realized it's my ringtone.  My ringtone is the twit theme, and in it, it says, this is twit, this is amazing, something  like that.  It woke up the Echo because all of a sudden, my Echo starts playing you.  I'm listening to the live stream of TNT.  What a great feature.  And it's, I think, my ringtone sets off the Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, you just gave me an idea for a tip for the new screen savers.  I'm going to do a tip that says, create a ringtone that wakes up Alexa and asks for  the weather.  Oh!  So your phone goes off, and then you get the weather from Alexa.  Oh, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's dumb, but it would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe we'll come up with something better than that.  It's kind of an annoying ringtone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is interesting because they're doing all this stuff on home automation and making these  phone calls.  I'm thinking maybe, I mean, you walk into your car, you got Android Auto, you got…

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want everything to…  See, this is the appeal of the Echo.  I want everything to respond to me.  I want to be able to talk to wherever I am, whatever I'm doing.  You're right.  The next thing would be in the car.  Talking to the phone isn't quite the same thing, although Apple obviously is aware of  this because they turned on Hey, Shlomo as the default.  It's always listening.  And you have to spend some time.  I'm sorry, Sailor Lion and Dr. Mom, they're annoyed because we've woken up their Alexa.  I mean their Echo.  I call it the Echo.  I try to get out of that by calling it the Echo.  This does not look like something one would want to spend a lot of time doing, rooting  your on-hub router.  But Barry, you got one.  So if you've got some free time this weekend, you might want to root it.  The funny thing is it's basically Chrome OS.  But why not?  Why wouldn't you make a Chrome OS?  Why would you reinvent the wheel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially with all their development on the home automation side around Chrome.  So maybe it'll be easier to plug that into your devices that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does lend one to think that all of these conspiracy theories about future capabilities  are real because that's why you put a real OS in what is essentially an IoT device.  It's interesting that these guys at the Exploiteers said maybe we could do the same thing to this  as we do to our Chromebooks to root it.  And it worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So just before we let this topic go away, imagine that Moore's Law kicks in and further  development and economies of scale and all the rest happen and the price of this comes  down to well under $100.  So let's say it comes down to $79.99.  Or maybe they subsidize it and it's $59.99.  It should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  It's no better than a $50 router, right Barry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's better than that.  It definitely has a much better range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm saying in the future, let's say they really go for cost.  If you look at the cost of the Chromecast, it's so cheap.  And if they had something that was conspicuous, not as cheap as the Chromecast, but very inexpensive,  and they pitched it as an Amazon Echo type of thing where Google Now is available just  to talk to your room.  And they would encourage you to have multiple.  You need one in the bathroom, you need one in the bedrooms, you need one.  And then they would have a car version, it would be part of Android Auto.  Put it everywhere.  Put it everywhere.  Imagine that all of those devices are also routers that auto switch and so on.  How much great connectivity you would have.  You create a mesh.  You would magnify.  Plus they would be like the Chromecast Audio.  They would be speakers that would simultaneously link up and play music all over.  They have all the pieces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need to put it all together, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And maybe Apple's going at this with the Apple TV because you can talk to that.  Your TV is always there.  You know, hey Siri, on Apple TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A conspicuous lack of mention though in home automation features on the new Apple TV.  We all thought that's what it was.  And maybe it still is, but it's not apparent.  They didn't seem to think that that was important.  I'm not sure home automation is that important.  But I am sure that talking to your home is important.  And once you start talking, then you start expecting your home to be able to respond.  So you expect to say, please open the garage bay door and it will open.  Somebody's at your door.  Yeah.  Speaking of awesome products.  Somebody's ringing your doorbell.  That's so funny.  He's got the ring.  Yeah.  So let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you teased before the ad that I was to launch another defense of Google+.  Are you?  Can you?  Sure.  Sure I can.  Yeah.  I'm going to make an argument for Google+.  Mike, it's a ghost town.  Well, that's what everybody says.  It's basically been shamed to the point where you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google stopped mentioning it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google is not supporting it the way they should.  But let me just give you a couple of ideas to think about here.  So the two social networks that really people gravitate toward, Facebook and Twitter, have  multiple problems.  If Facebook is in its own universe, you can't really compare it anymore to anything.  So Facebook is Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As you say, it's become a gated community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have a monopoly on everybody.  And so that's a separate thing.  So you look at Twitter and there are two problems on Twitter that are actual social political  problems.  One of them is the shaming ritual.  I grant you that.  Twitter is a sexual...  It's a pitchfork mob.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what the latest one that pissed me off...  What's that?  And I think without Twitter, maybe Facebook, but I think without Twitter this doesn't happen.  Meryl Streep is promoting her new movie, which you probably saw ads all over the Democratic,  weirdly enough, the Democratic debate.  It's about British suffragette, the British movement to get the vote for women.  And she plays one of the leaders of that movement.  And in the junket where they do the interviews, everybody in the cast, I think it was for  Vanity Fair, no, no, it was for Time Out London, the Time Out magazine.  They wore a t-shirt that said, I'd rather be a rebel than a slave, which is a quote  from the character that Meryl Streep plays saying, I know it's upsetting to people that  women want the right to vote, but I'd rather be a rebel than a slave.  And on Twitter, everybody started conflating that with the Confederacy and the Union and  the Civil War.  And I'd rather...  They said, is Meryl Streep saying she'd rather be a Confederate than a slaveholder than a  slave?  No, you nitwits.  But if it weren't for Twitter and the nitwit culture on Twitter, that would not have happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  And there's a lot of that.  I did this morning on Google+, about there's a ritual that they have in the Chinese airline  industry where if you work a certain number of hours in your flight attendant, you have  to get inside the overhead bin.  What?  It's a hazing ritual.  They called it hazing.  But now there was so much Twitter outrage, or it's not Twitter, but the Weibo or whatever  in China, that the industry is backtracking and they're banning it and stuff like that.  And this is an internal cultural thing.  Everything...  It's nobody's business.  Nobody is forming these mobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room, and I think this is exactly right, says outrage is in vogue.  PSChops for the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It absolutely is.  And a tiny minority of people can make themselves feel super good by being better and holier  than everybody else.  And they form this mob and then they get this huge number of people who are ignorant, frankly,  who back that just because they like the feel of the shaming that takes place and they feel  powerful and like we're really changing things here.  It's just an ugly thing.  There's that and then there's also the misogynistic silencing of women and minorities and homosexuals  and others on Twitter that we've been talking about for a long, long time, the trolling,  all that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're not a fat white boy on Twitter, you're out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody complains about that stuff, but nobody does anything about it.  The reason that stuff exists is that nobody leaves Twitter.  They just keep using it.  Whereas on Google+, get this, people have arguments.  They have reasons, sometimes not reason, but oftentimes it's a very critical place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm getting a lot more spam on Google+.  There's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did before.  Exactly, because what's happening is that Google is rolling this out internationally.  And so there's a lot of people in other countries, mostly, who are discovering that they can  spam it.  But the tools for beating spam, for blocking people are super great on Google+.  So I just keep knocking them down.  But again, Google+, is the only place that I'm aware of that has exactly what the world  needs, besides love, sweet love, which is argument.  You can actually have a sustained reasonable argument that is not ruined by a lynch mob,  that's not ruined by trolls, that's not ruined by anybody.  It's like the well.  It's today's well.  And yes, it's a tiny minority of people who are using it, but they're better people.  I'm just going to say it.  The people on Google+, are better than the people on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you get is a death spiral, whereas fewer people use it than the people who are, like,  For instance, for some reason, I have four or five men's health magazine posts in my  feed I was just looking, because they're posting all the time and everybody else is backed  off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to be active.  You have to block, you have to unfollow, you have to mute, you have to use the tools.  And so it's an ongoing process.  In my case, I go in there and I get two or three comments every day from people that  I don't want to have anything to do with.  So I block them and they're gone forever.  And by doing that every day, I have like a fantastic...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How important is it to plus one?  Do you do a lot of plusing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't see any value of it than just to...  I don't think it has any signal value.  I think it's just a way...  That's a mistake, right?  I don't think it's a mistake.  I just think it's a way to sort of give an attaboy to somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What we need is Bradley Horowitz needs to start putting some effort into this and get  some elbow grease.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it's been tainted by the lynch mob on Twitter, ironically.  This has been driven by the journalists who are obsessed with Twitter and who hate Google  Plus for obvious reasons.  That obvious reason is that they love to be influential without any effort.  And that's what you can do on Twitter if you have a following.  On Google Plus, it's effort.  You have to argue every point and everything you say is challenged.  It's a very contentious place and it's not for lightweights and it's not for people who  are too busy doing other things to really engage with the stuff they say.  What people like to do is they like to write their articles, they spend their time on that  if they're a journalist, put it out there, put a link on Twitter, have people retweet  it and then they're done, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you get, though, as a journalist...  Because I know you cross post your computer world articles, for instance, on Facebook,  on Twitter and on Google Plus.  Do you get a lot of engagement and traffic, more importantly, on Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a bad person to ask because I'm going to hit 5 million in a couple of months.  So you're 10 times more than I have.  I get 3,000 additional followers per day on Google Plus.  Because you're the last person to post.  Exactly.  So I'm not a good person to ask, but I get way more engagement on Google Plus.  So you do get engagement.  Far more engagement and it's great engagement.  It's such a luxury because I'm blocking people left and right, I'm deleting comments and  I make sure that every conversation on Google Plus is just a great conversation with really  smart people.  I should maybe spend more time here.  The funny thing is that Google Plus is not perfect, but look at how horrible Twitter  is and look at how horrible Facebook is.  Everybody's on Facebook, but they don't want to talk about issues.  They don't want to argue.  They don't want to engage.  And Google Plus is also great if you're into stuff.  I'm super into making cheese.  I'm super into making bread.  And the bread community on Google Plus, the art of bread is amazing.  It's like the greatest resource for baking bread on the internet.  And nobody cares.  I joined that group because I like looking at pictures of bread.  But the Twitter journalist mob doesn't care about that.  It's just irrelevant.  But that's an example of one of 10,000 enthusiasms where you find all these great people.  So I don't really care if people are bad-mouthing Google Plus all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, in a way that's good, right?  Because that drives off the trivial people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But also on Google Plus, that's where all the Googlers are.  For a show like this, to find the tidbits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know what, Barry?  I would disagree.  That used to be.  You don't get as many Googlers on Google Plus, which is part of the reason I think Google  has lost interest.  It used to be, of course, you want to...  Everybody I was following, half the people I was following were Googlers.  I don't see a lot of posts from them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the reason Google has lost interest is because it was an internal political thing.  Google has become...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was Larry Page's thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Google has become a little bit more like Microsoft as they've grown.  So Vikandotra made Google Plus...  He was full of fire and passion for Google Plus.  Apparently pestered Larry Page for years.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And when he left, it was kind of like the Sundar Pichai era began.  And that was like...  I have the feeling there was a huge battle between Sundar Pichai and Vikandotra.  And Vikandotra ended up leaving, and now it's Sundar Pichai's world.  And so Google Plus is kind of like you don't want to speak the G word within Google.  So I'm just guessing.  I'm just guessing.  There are people who are very passionate about Google Plus and very knowledgeable about it.  But again, how much of the internet can you really handle?  Google Plus, as it is now, is far more content than I could ever even get close to.  You know what I realized?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, I would probably...  Do you use it on desktop or on mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both.  Mostly desktop, but both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I find is that most of that stuff I use on mobile, and it's a diversionary tactic  when I'm in line or I can't sleep or whatever I reach for my phone.  And I find I will go to Facebook and Instagram.  I play chess online, so I'll play my chess game.  And I, less and less, am hitting that Google.  It's still on my front page, but I'm hitting it less and less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not as accessible emotionally and psychologically as Twitter or Facebook.  With Twitter and Facebook, you can get a quick hit.  What's happening?  With Google Plus, you're like, okay, I've got to brace myself.  I'm going in.  And then you've got to go slog through and find the stuff.  It could be improved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For instance, this button that says, new posts, touch to see them.  Is that the best way to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's how Facebook does it.  The way to think about Google Plus, which nobody does...  I'm similar to Robert Scoble in the sense that I believe that I'm the only one who does  it right.  You look at Google Plus as a social search engine.  So every circle that you have is a search.  So if you go in and you find the Twitter circle...  I have a Twitter circle, which is everybody who works at Twitter.  I have that circle too.  And so I go in there and I'm like, okay, I'm going to shift gears and I'm going to be engaging  with Twitter for a while.  And how many of us post there?  Lots.  Lots.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason still likes it.  That's good.  Actually, do you post your show stuff there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we do our polls and the shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Proud Soar's thing and stuff.  It's a great source for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I'm very dialed into Google Plus's Android slash Google side of things.  And there's a lot of people that are there that are passionate about that too.  So there's a lot of good conversation to be had around that.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You talked me into it again.  Every time you're on, Mike talks me back into using Google Plus.  I admit Twitter sucks, but I notice you've got it running.  It's easy.  I have it running.  It's on all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Facebook, I always hate myself after I visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like Twitter, but I'm fortunate that I haven't been the subject of a pitchfork wielding mob  yet.  Yeah.  And so it's great for me.  It's not so great for the people who have been silenced by the trolls and by the haters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the only way I can use it is by just having a thick skin and using liberal use  of the mutant blockbusters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most people don't have the opportunity to develop such a thick skin.  It took you decades.  It took me decades.  To have skin thick enough to deal with Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's still maybe not quite thick enough.  Barry, do you use Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  I use it a lot.  And I do it the same way.  I have my circles.  I try to slice up my circles so that I can find certain content and engage in that and  also cover that as a reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I may need to do more circle management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so let me just give you one last pitch for why Google Plus is great.  Google Plus, if you use it as a live streaming service.  So what that means is that I post this to my immediate family.  I post that to my extended family.  I post this to public.  I post this to myself.  I post a lot of stuff just to myself.  And I'm the only recipient.  It's a secure way for me to remember everything.  And then later when I want to remember something, I go in and I type my name and then I type  the thing that I'm looking for.  And it's exactly it's a great search engine, unlike Facebook, which has zero search.  It shows me exactly what I'm looking for.  And then, of course, Google Photos is plugged into it as well so I can find all the photos.  So, for example, my son right now is in Barcelona and I've lived in Barcelona and he was  asking me for restaurant recommendations.  I went straight to Google Plus.  I typed in Mike Elgin, Barcelona.  I got most of the posts that were public.  I also got some on the private.  But every single post that I where I mentioned the B word Barcelona, I saw laid right out  in front of me.  So it's a little life blog.  It's a life.  It's a live stream is what it is.  And it's brilliant for that.  Nobody uses it for that, but it's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? I would use it for that if I could capture those into my blog for preserving  them. And this is what you did.  You stopped blogging and you made Google Plus your blog.  Exactly. And if they would just for crying out loud, give us an API that had more than  just reading. Yes.  Then I might consider I need these to I need to save it.  I don't like putting all my content in a temporary basket.  Yeah. So I would do that as long as I could get into my blog.  But I can't do that right now.  Right. I think maybe I should look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing to keep in mind is a read API.  Google Plus is very secure.  Like it's the best. My knowledge has never been hacked.  Right. And as Twitter's good at this.  Yeah. And so this is the thing that's so great about if you really pour yourself into it,  you get a lot of the other thing that Google Plus really needs is a Twitter view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need so I auto post to be less of a silo and more a participant.  Yes, exactly. And that's where an API would help.  Yeah, so we've just solved this.  It's simple. All you got to do is make an API.  So if you get to work on that, we'd appreciate it.  Barry, Barry, Barry, you get to work on it.  But now I think it's going to have to be that that Brad fellow.  Yeah. But do you think Brad's paying any attention to this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's really been focusing on Google Photos.  I know. I know that he still believes in it.  But again, once again, I think the problem is just the and I think it's so ironic that I  think I literally think that the Twitter hate campaign machinery has bad mouth Google  Plus into a reputation where it's not easy for anybody to be super enthusiastic about it.  Right. You know, and so I would say you are still.  Yeah. I mean, I just I as a writer and a broadcaster, I kind of feel like I need it.  I need I need the crowds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what you probably don't want and Bradley, I have to reframe this is somebody posting  their Twitter feed into Google Plus.  That would just trash it. Although you could block them.  That's the nice thing about Google Plus.  Very easy to get people out of your stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. And they're gone forever.  And it's just great.  What's great. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. So you still use it, Barry, as part of your is for you as a professional, too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't use it for family at all or for friends.  It's all about me discovering content around topics that I cover as a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's ironic as we were talking about this and I'm going through my Google Plus feed, I  found two stories that I want to talk about.  Yeah. Yeah.  In just a bit, we're going to do that.  But first, a word from Blue Apron.  I love cooking, but I rarely have the time after work.  I'm exhausted to go to the grocery store.  That's very European, isn't it?  You have a little string bag and on the way home from work, you get a baguette, you get a tomato,  you get a chicken, you know, you bring home your ingredients.  Blue Apron solves this problem in our modern, hectic world by delivering those ingredients to your door  fresh, straight out of the garden, never frozen.  Even the meats and the fish, they're all refrigerated in this box, ready for you to cook that night.  And they come with these beautiful eight and a half by eleven recipe cards with glossy images,  coated stock so you can save them later.  I wish, you know what, a little tip, Blue Apron, hole punch those and give me a Blue Apron binder  because I want to save all those recipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you don't need that.  You know why? Because their app has 100 percent of those recipes.  Oh, that's right. They're all online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, videos are online too.  So if you don't know how to dice an onion or, you know, some technique they're talking about.  And by the way, you really learn.  There's a lot. I cook stuff and even ingredients I've never heard of.  I found a new bok choy in one of the recipes that is like my new thing.  And I love it.  So you're going to learn a lot about ingredients, about cooking, about recipes,  and you will gain confidence and you'll make these incredible meals for less than ten dollars a meal.  There are two different plans.  There's the date night plan.  You and another person.  It's really, really a romantic way to to to to win somebody's heart, by the way,  is to make a beautiful Blue Apron, set out the candles, the tablecloth.  They're going to love it. You're going to think you're a master chef.  It's incredible. They also have a family plan with kid friendly ingredients.  The menus never repeat.  You can always tell them what you do and don't want.  They have vegetarian menu plans, for instance.  It is just so great.  How about one pot shrimp perlou?  Now, I didn't even know what perlou was until I got the recipe for one pot shrimp perlou  or seared chicken and autumn vegetables with apple cider mustard jus.  There's the shrimp perlou.  Yeah, it's a rice dish big in the kind of Cajun country.  It's incredible, by the way.  And every bit of the ingredients you need for it comes in your Blue Apron box  and exactly how much you need.  So there's no waste.  You need two scallions.  They give you two scallions, not three, not one.  Two scallions, two of whatever you need, two ribs of celery.  I mean, it's everything you need. Nevermore.  You do a little chopping, a little searing, a little sauteing and boom,  you get the best meal you ever had.  And now you can cook it again, by the way. Blue Apron dot com.  We got your first two meals free.  If you go to Blue Apron dot com slash tweet.  I hate doing these ads because my mouth waters every time.  I'm craving Blue Apron.  I cannot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing I personally that I love most about this is that  they send you ingredients that there's no way you're going to find that in.  No, that's true.  You'd have to go to to to San Francisco and find that one little.  Asian market. Yeah, exactly.  And they just give it to you.  And you're like, wow, I've never even heard of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love them. You love them, too.  First two meals free.  Blue Apron dot com slash slash tweet.  We thank them so much for their support of our podcasts  and of especially this week in Google.  So two stories I found in Google Plus. Yep.  The power of Google's power Google Plus,  the breakthrough candidate in the Democratic debate last night.  Well, if you go by Google, it was Bernie Sanders. Yep.  This is the graph of Google's search interest.  Maybe it's because he said things people went what and they searched it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. You know, my theory is and I know we don't like to talk about politics,  but but Bernie Sanders is a problem for the Democratic Party  in the same way that Donald Trump is a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's unelectable because he's a socialist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't want them to be more popular.  Hillary is the Democratic Party's candidate in general.  And and and Bernie Sanders is not.  But he says the kinds of things that are real crowd pleasers.  And I think that an objective analysis like this would show that Bernie Sanders won the debate.  But not in the media.  You go to you go to the media and it's like, oh, clearly, Hillary Clinton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think what that shows is that the machine is why a third party candidate  has such a hard time in America.  The machine is so powerful that even in media coverage, somehow,  the machine candidate always is the winner.  Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is part of the problem with our system.  And I think that the tech angle in all this, of course, is that Lawrence Lessig,  who is I wish he'd get more attention.  He's running on a single platform, which is to reform the corrupt system  we have for elections.  And he wasn't in the debate. Why?  Because he hasn't reformed the system yet.  The very thing that he wanted to fix kept him out of the debates,  keeping him out of the race and will prevent him from ever having a chance of being elected.  And I think that's really interesting.  And it's a tech angle, of course, because he's been involved very heavily in a lot of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Larry's been a regular guest on Twitter.  We interviewed him. He was our first triangulation episode.  And he was, you know, for a long time, his goal was to eliminate DRM  and to fix the music industry.  And then he realized, well, you can't do that until you fix politics.  And then he realized you can't fix politics until you fix  campaign contributions and the influence of money in politics.  And then he realized you can't fix that outside, because, of course,  the incumbents are the beneficiaries.  So they're going to always vote to increase and continue this influence  of money in politics. Of course, they are.  The only way to get rid of it is to become an incumbent, get rid of it.  And he says he will do that.  And then he will pick a really good vice president.  And he'll resign the day after he fixes the money issue.  He says, I don't want to be president.  I just want to you have to be an incumbent to fix this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it'll never happen. There is one bit of hope, though.  And I think that there's an Internet or social media  driver behind this, which is that the the the Bernie Sanders of the world  and the Donald Trump's of the world for whatever.  Regardless, forget their politics for a second, forget their their perspectives  on anything for a second.  The thing that people are responding to, I believe, above all,  is the fact that they're unscripted.  They're not the product of a gaggle of handlers  who are telling them exactly what to say and how to say it,  because we know that this wins and that, you know, so on.  This will get you through the whole process.  They're basically speaking off the cuff.  They're they're speaking in plain language and people are responding to this.  And I think it's because it has something to do with social media.  And so that is a bit of hope there that the people are seem to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Social media will be the democratizing influence on this.  And I think that that's why you see this, like in this article,  all of this traffic around Bernie Sanders, which you wouldn't see  if you just read the mainstream media, that there was apparently a lot of interest  either that or he said a lot of things people had to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's possible.  That's why I'm with you.  I think that Curtis Drew, Drew Curtis, Curtis of FARC should run for president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's running for governor of Kentucky and maybe he'll win.  Yeah, if he does, I think that's the next step.  White House. Yes.  I'll vote for you can count on us.  Yeah, the two of us.  Yes, we can't vote for you now, Drew, without voter fraud, but soon.  We also interviewed him, by the way, on triangulation.  I'm really I'm a good at interviewing  candidates who I don't have a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My mother was a journalist and she she interviewed Ronald Reagan  when he didn't have a chance.  And then he went on to surprise everybody, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is the other story I got from Google+.  I got to do Google+.  More. You convinced me.  It's great. Leaked screenshots showing we've heard we'd heard rumors  for a while that Facebook was going to do a new breaking news  notification app called Notify.  Well, I guess they're getting close because  this was reported by Business Insider and others back in August.  Here's some screenshots.  So this Facebook already has, you know, realized the strategy.  And it was very effective, as you could see earlier  when we talked about messenger and how much messenger growth is shown  by splitting out stuff out of the main big blue Facebook app,  a notify app that would let you know, for instance,  what when Vivo has a new music video or when there's new daily freebies  and deals or when BuzzFeed posts its most popular, you know, the trending stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's interesting about Notify, I think, is that there  it's kind of like what they were sort of kind of trying to achieve  with Facebook Home.  Remember that when they wanted an Android user interface  that went on top was your essential essentially your lock screen.  It was a flop, but they want to be the first thing you see.  They want the phone to be a Facebook phone.  They want the phone.  They want to be what you see when you turn on your device. Right.  And this would give them that because it grabs the notification screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says, you said they want to take over everything. Yeah.  They want to own it all. Yep.  And we finally know what the dislike button is,  which is not a dislike button.  I wish they were testing this.  Have you seen this button in action, Barry, the the new Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I have not seen it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to be in Europe somewhere, I think.  So we only have screenshots.  They're testing it right now.  And I can't remember where the idea.  What do you think of this? Spain and Ireland only. Yeah.  What the idea is instead of just a thumbs up, you'll hit the thumbs up,  press it hard and you'll get these choices.  A heart for love, a ha ha smiley face, a yay face, a wow face,  a sad face, which I think they did need because I hate liking the news.  Right. Somebody's died. Right.  And an angry face. Yep.  But I've seen so many people say they hate this idea.  What do you think, Barry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Honestly, I hate Facebook.  You're the wrong guy.  I'm the wrong guy for this.  I'm on this week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you would you make you would it make you hate Facebook less?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, no, this makes me hate Facebook more.  It would be an angry face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why they can have emoji.  We need the poo emoji so we can talk about Facebook.  That's what I'm saying.  All right. I mean, I think it's it's it's it's I think if I can summarize  why people object to this, the like function and the thumbs up  imagery is iconic for Facebook. Right.  It's what Facebook it's so closely associated with Facebook  to have all these other alternatives that are non-iconic.  It feels like it's kind of like when Twitter says  they're going to have algorithmically sorted feeds.  It's like, well, that's not really what we signed up for.  So I think that's an element. But it's it's practical.  Like you said, somebody says, oh, this great person died.  Do you do you like it because the person was great or so?  What do you do? You know, you need an action to take there.  You need a neutral reaction like wow.  That wow could be positive, negative, doesn't matter.  But it's a way for you to interact without saying, yeah, I like this  because content is too nuanced for just like or nothing.  So I think it's it's a it's a necessity for them to a certain extent.  But people don't like it because it sort of doesn't seem Facebooky. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now, apparently, here's another one.  If you put something on Facebook, presumably,  it was part of your day and your year.  Facebook, of course, as you know, has an on this day feature and a year in review  feature, which will show you pictures from this day in previous years  or your entire year.  But apparently, sometimes those memories aren't welcome.  And the social network is now giving you a filter.  I haven't been able to find this, but I have to find my on this day  preferences that will let you filter out bad memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because right now it's like, oh, remember on this day  three years ago when you lost your arm in that horrible industrial accident?  Well, we want to remind you about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, why did you post it on Facebook if you didn't want to remember it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still have the other arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a good this is a good.  I guess it's a good thing. Yeah.  I feel like well, when you have the choice,  if you put it on Facebook,  I think it feels like it should be fair game for your year in review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the fact is that most users aren't going to touch any of these features,  but it's now your fault.  It's now if you get something in your in your feed that you don't like,  it's no longer Facebook's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whose fault is this?  Playboy is no longer going to put nudes in its magazine.  It's the Internet's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pornography. It's Facebook's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard somewhere somebody played Facebook. What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So apparently Facebook, Playboy itself says the online porn is why  you don't need it's easy to find naked pictures.  Yeah. So you don't need that for Playboy.  So for those of you who say I read Playboy for the articles.  Well, guess what? It's true now, no matter what.  Starting in March of 2016.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the Playboy is the Yahoo of it's kind of an anachronistic, isn't it?  Yeah, they don't really have a reason to exist anymore.  And I just I don't know.  This is this will give them a little bump of publicity where here we are  talking about them, but they're pretty much done as a relevant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very strange. Very, very strange.  Yeah. What else?  Is there anything else I haven't talked about?  Andy Rubin's remember Andy Rubin was the guy who ran Android,  in fact, invented Android, sold his company to Google and ran it for a while.  At Google left.  He has an incubator called Playground,  and they just closed a round of three hundred million dollars in funding.  That means there are a bunch of rich people who gave Andy Rubin  another rich person, another rich person, three hundred million dollars  to invest for them, because they figure, well, if anybody's going to do a good job  investing my money, it'll be Andy Rubin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody wants to be a  a venture capitalist and throw the money around and be the kingmaker.  But I don't understand how you walk away from what he walked away from.  They basically said, Andy, you know, we're going to put you in charge of  we're going to buy eight robotics companies and you can be charged the whole thing.  You get the Atlas robot, you get, you know, and you get the big dog robot.  You can play with all that stuff and you can invent, create this and do, you know.  And he's like, you know, that sounds interesting, but now I'm going to go be a VC.  I just that was the coolest.  He had the coolest job in the valley.  He's in charge of all the robots.  Yeah, it was so cool.  And he walked away from that or maybe he was pushed out.  Who knows? But

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and, you know, Calacanis was on the new screensaver a few weeks ago.  Jason Calacanis, you know him. Yes.  Made a lot of money selling.  He was a blog entrepreneur. Yeah.  Created, among other things, in Gadget and sold it all to AOL  for something like one hundred thirteen million dollars.  He did well for himself. Did well.  He's he's quite a character and he's been investing as an angel investor  ever since and doing well.  He told me I should become an angel investor.  You should become an angel investor.  He said the best angel investors are the whole key in investing.  He says, first of all, it's well understood.  The mathematics of the game, 80 percent will fail.  Twenty percent will succeed.  You you figure out which 20 percent are going to succeed of your investments.  You kill the others and you double down on the 20.  It's kind of like if you've got a good hand in 21.  Yeah. And blackjack, you split your kings. Right.  Then you double down on those.  He says very it's very algorithmic.  He says the key is access is information flow.  The key is access to the startups.  And he said, this is why all Malik became a VC.  This is why so many tech journalists have become VCs,  because they have the best access to deals.  They know what's going on in the valley.  So we're wasting our time here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I wasn't going to be wasting my time, I wouldn't have gotten into journalism.  I mean, it's a it's a vow of poverty.  So it's a little it's a it's a little, you know, off the track.  But you're absolutely you know, here's what we do.  We should do an alphabet like restructuring for Twitter.  Right. And I can run the VC wing.  We can call it. That's good.  We get ventures. Yeah.  Twitter ventures. Exactly.  We're going to get in on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Sign me up.  Have you considered that ever?  I mean, feel it. Here you are.  You're sitting in the catbird seat.  You've got a ringside seat.  You know where the big guys are going, where the money is going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm in the consulting business.  So everybody comes to me, do you want a piece of my business in exchange  for building it? I'm like, no.  Yeah, because the people coming to me are not the big players.  But I feel it's more important for me to build out software  and features that I think I could control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so anachronistic.  You want to create something instead of just getting rich?  What are you nuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. Right.  Like, why would I get into a niche selling synagogue software that's so small?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should demand a percentage of the synagogue donations.  That would be big. That would be huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I remember there was a PR woman.  I don't remember the name. I think it was Antenna.  Remember Antenna PR or Antenna?  No, she was very smart.  She said to companies, I will do your PR for you as a startup.  For you, just give me a thousand shares.  And if you're a startup, you're worth nothing.  She did very, very well.  I think among other companies, there were some pretty big names in there like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, what's funny about that is what's interesting, of course,  is when you're when you're an investor, if you strike it rich with a,  you know, two percent of your investments, you're doing great.  That's right. You're going to fail on most of them.  And this is essentially the same bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the guy who painted the mural at Facebook.  Remember that? No.  Yeah. Mark said, I can't pay you to paint this mural on the wall, but I'll give you a stock.  Millionaire. Yeah.  It's like the massage therapist in the early days at Facebook.  Yeah. Multi-millionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I had a friend around 1999 or whatever that  he he had good friends of his.  They were neighbors and they had this incredible McMansion.  And they were they were I think the woman in the couple was  she was a a personal assistant or something at Yahoo when they went public.  Nice. She got a little bit of stock, which was huge back then.  And yeah, that's good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you got to know when to hold them and you got to know when to fold them.  And I hope she sold that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Here's from our chat room, the latest video from Google  Play Music, a three hundred sixty degree experience.  This is on YouTube.  Hey, before we play this, I just want to mention that I watched  the Democratic debate last night in my gear VR.  How boring was that?  It was nauseating.  But I wasn't sure if it was the content.  It's hard to tell. But it was really it was actually very cool.  I couldn't do it for more like 20 minutes.  But they had cameras on the stage on left and right.  And they started off with a camera way in the back.  And, you know, these these VR cameras, they look like just weird,  like golf balls with lots of cameras on them.  And I'm sure people didn't realize what that was because I'm sitting here  at the beginning and I'm looking down, there's a guy looking at his phone.  I can look right at his phone.  I'm looking over here, the camera guy is chewing gum.  And he's like next to me. I'm looking, hey, how are you doing?  And then I could see like Cheryl Crowe tucking in her shirt  before she came out to like they show the steady cam guy.  You're backstage with a steady cam guy and Cheryl Crowe.  And she's getting she doesn't realize there's a golf ball camera right there.  This is going to change the world.  You're going to be able to spy on all sorts of stuff. Yeah. Yeah.  So that was actually a very interesting experience.  And you know why it's good for the debate, because you're not dependent  on the director's cut to see what the reactions are.  So you can look at each candidate as the other candidates are talking.  Exactly. And actually, I thought that was pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah.  So let me see what turn your volume up. What are we going to see here?  OK. Oh, this is that thing where you can watch a video.  Oh, but I have to get the controls working.  So you're watching a music video.  What's that? Why? Why is it pointing at that?  Should I go go there?  Oh, whoa. Let's not.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A mouse is not a great interface for no, no, you want to wear this with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I can't show you what it looks like with the helmet on.  Exactly. That's interesting, though.  Can you do you think there'll be more three or sixty degree music videos  when I get that theta Rico theta s in a couple of weeks?  I'm going to do the podcast. Yeah.  60 degrees. Yeah.  Then you'll be able to see the engineers screwing off in the back.  I'm working.  Hey, I want to thank you very shorts for being here.  Barry writes a search engine land dot com.  I hope the thing with the Shul cloud works out OK.  The Europeans don't get you.  Thank you. Appreciate it.  It's great being here. Appreciate it.  Thank you. At Rusty Brick on the Twitter.  Anything you want to plug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So if you are in Israel, we're holding a conference for a search  market, the expo, which is part of the search engine land brand.  November 1st on a Sunday.  So if you are in the Israel region, go to search market, the expo dot com slash  Israel and sign up for the event. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great. And of course, search engine land dot com,  the place to read Barry's byline work.  Oh, look, see now he's driving in the car in the 360 video.  And I can I can look outside the window.  Can't look behind me, though.  Who's in the backseat? We'll never know.  I like this idea.  I think we're to see a lot more of this, right?  Yes, we are around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I've just recently started an oldish book called Ready Player One,  which you're very familiar with, I'm sure.  And that is such a clear vision of where this is all going.  It's about our time. Depressing, but clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it. I love it.  Although some people still get nauseous.  I tried to Lisa was going to watch the Democratic debate in the thing  and she like five seconds.  She said, I'm getting queasy. I can't do it.  But she's a Republican.  So maybe there's other reasons, other reasons why Mike Elgin.  It's great. Always great to have you and your spirit of the defense of Google.  Plus, somebody's got to do it.  Keep on tilting it will windmills.  Thank you. You catch Mike every Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.  Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern Time for tech news tonight.  Today, that's our morning news program. That's right.  And pretty regularly now on Twig, which is great.  I love having you here. Yeah, it's great.  Thanks, Jason, how our producer put together a great show.  You betcha. By the way, if you didn't see all about Android from last night,  they had the new Robin phone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Nextbit Robin.  We had the we had the folks from Nextbit in the house.  And yeah, it was it was a great interview.  We got to kind of play around with the Robin, which if you haven't seen it  from the Kickstarter, well, it looks like you just pulled it up.  Very unique, different looking design.  It looks just like this, although it was comfortable.  It looks very rigid.  And that was my main concern was sharp corners.  You know, it looks very sharp on the corners.  And it's actually a pretty darn comfy device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can chip ice with it.  He says definitely January there.  They're on track to get it out when they said they would get it out,  which with Kickstarter is never given.  In fact, another 3D printer company just went belly up  after raising some three million dollars on Kickstarter said, you know,  those of you haven't got your printer, you're not going to get it.  This one, though, I think he's going to come they're going to come through.  They have some the people behind it are pretty sharp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Scott, Scott Croyle, who was who we had on last night, he was pretty much  the main design guy behind the original HTC One series.  So, you know, and in my opinion, that's one of the devices  that really elevated Android device design.  And everybody kind of played catch up from there.  So pretty influential as far as that's concerned.  So it's interesting to see them doing something so different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will be interesting to see.  I ordered one, so I'll be getting mine in January.  The thing that's unique about this, it's a little bit constrained on memory.  What's 32 gigs or 16?  I can't remember. It's not a lot of storage.  But the reason is apps, when you don't use them, go up to the cloud.  And when you hit them, if you want it back,  it'll re download it after a short period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it does it it does it kind of smartly for you.  So you don't have to manage that.  In fact, you can't right now.  You can't explicitly say send this one up to the cloud.  It does it all for you. And it was very interesting.  He demonstrated that by recording a video that was longer  than the storage capacity left on the device.  And you never knew you never knew it because in the background  it was doing the things and making the decision to send an app  you haven't used in months up to the cloud to make more space for it.  It's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
