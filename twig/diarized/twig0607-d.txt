That was pretty show fun. I'm not trying to market. She's like me. She doesn't want to market. She doesn't want to. Those are so cute. They're cute.  It's the logo from the website, but it's cut out. It's die cut. So, oh, that's great. I want some. I love that. I'll put them on my website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zeroes and ones. My friend Biz designed this for me after GigaOwn blew up. She did such a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is also the podcast logo. The IOT podcast you do with Kevin Toffle. Stacey on IOT. That is a great logo. Yeah, I like it that it's die cut. I think that was really smart. Yeah.  It was fancy. Yeah, definitely. That's Jeff Jarvis. I hear Jeff Jarvis' voice. Hello, Jeff Leonard, town professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Cray.  Graduated School of Journalism at the City University. Hello, Buzz Machine. Hello. Hello. And former TV guy. Gutenberg day. I almost you know what?  I was going to surprise you and say Google Gutenberg and you will see something before we Google Gutenberg. Let's let's say hello to Aunt Pruitt from Hop.  Hands on photography. Hello, Aunt. How are you? Unbelievable as always. See always in a good mood. I've been seeing a lot of football footage on your Instagram feed of late.  Yes, you have. Proud dad. Proud dad. They were proud and the season's winding down this week. They're playing it late because they couldn't do it in the fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It was all of the COVID protocols. So they gave them a partial season this spring. Now, granted, there are other sports that are happening right now as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they did give them a chance to play five games now. That's cool. You would enjoy it just because the tennis players are practicing with the football players.  It adds to the fun of the game. You have to dodge people. That's one way to work on agility. You tackled the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What other sports do the hardheads play? They both enjoy track and field as well as football. But my youngest hardhead also enjoys soccer.  But he's not going to do soccer because it's during track season and track is one of their favorite. What other track and field events?  My oldest hardhead, he's a quarter-miler, but I think he could be a good half-miler too if he wants to try it. But I don't know if he wants to try it. He's claiming he wants to try to get into the 200.  Nice. He's fast, but that's the hardest race on the... He's on the JV. Pardon? He's on the JV. No, the senior's on the track. Right. Senior's varsity.  He wants to do the 200, but I'm trying to tell him, no, dude, just go to the half-mile and the quarter-mile because you'll sell there. 200 is a hard race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here you go. He's going. He's fast. He could be. He's going all the way. That's the freshman hardhead. He's going to be a jumper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then is this the senior hardhead? Let's see. It's the freshman that's been having... Yeah, that's the freshman. He's been tearing it up these last couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he's a quarterback. Yes, sir. Oh, nice. I love the music you put to this. Let's watch some more highlights. I'm really enjoying this. Here we go. Here we go.  Well, see, now this was a lesson learned video. Lesson learned video. Don't let somebody sneak up behind you. Just watch what happens. Whoa. He fumbled the ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He fumbled the ball. And can't you kill that video? Yeah, really? Did you really? Nope. Nope. It's a lesson learned. I was saying he was a nice guy, but now I'm thinking it's a teachable moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to share the teachable moment with... Well, Chris, you, to be honest, to be fair, you show a lot of highlights. No, it's a teachable moment. I mentioned it even in the post because that was Cardinal Newman. You know how great they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they are a tough, tough team. They're really good. And hardhead fumbled the ball right there. They got the ball back and immediately went down the field and scored. So essentially his fumble led to a touchdown. Oh, God.  And he was bent out of shape over it. And I had to tell him, I pretty much went down to the sideline and yelled at him, say, look, don't act like this is the first time you've ever fumbled or the last time you've ever fumbled. This is life. Suck it up. Get back out there and go ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man. Oh, my God. Where's our real talk with Aunt Pruitt show? Yeah, exactly. It's a short show. It's pretty brief. But this is life. Suck it up. Suck it up. This is life. You're going to screw up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what matters is how do you bounce back from screwing up? Because I've screwed up a gazillion times in my life. Yeah. And still pain. No shame to screw up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel better because I used to tell my daughter, I'm like, come on, suck it up. You're fine. You got this. And one day she turns to me because I was upset about something. And she's like, just suck it up, mom. And I was like, oh, that's harsh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I shouldn't have been saying that to my eight year old kid. My kids, I never said suck it up and they're complete failures. So you're doing the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had a recent conversation here in the house because I hate losers and I know that sounds harsh. But I played ball on a lot of losing teams coming up as a kid. And there's a certain loser language that I know it as soon as I hear from whoever starts to speak it.  And prior to that Newman game, Hardhead came home and was telling me this and telling me that about this player and that player. Excuses. And it was no, this is before the game. You know, before the game even started.  And I said, look, this, this sounds like loser language. And I got pissed off. I said, you haven't even played the game yet and you're already defeated. You can't go through life that way. You know, and we had, we all had to have our little come to Jesus moment here in the Pruitt house.  Cause I had to, I went in on all three of them, went in on Queen Pruitt and the other boy too. Cause I, I hate loser talk. I hate loser mentality. I hate feeling defeated. I just, we all got a fighting chance. Just, just, you know, some people have different advantages or whatever, but please just keep fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't, don't just give in right out the gate. You know, can I share a victory for my son? Please do. Please. His TikTok for some reason, this video got 415,000 likes. Go ahead Hank.  He's doing cooking salt underscore Hank. He changed it from sodium underscore deficiency. He decided he was going to embrace the salt. But the funny thing is he has COVID while he's doing this, right? Which is a shame. Cause I can't, I can't eat any of this soup. And I think the reason he got so many views is cause of, cause of this one.  Oh, those tomatoes look good. Jeff, doesn't that look good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. That does. Go ahead Hank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's putting the chicken in. Now listen here, listen to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He doesn't sound that. I think I'm having that. He can't smell anything. Poor kid.  Why would you put that much effort into making something that you can't eat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Jennifer, his mom says her refrigerator is full of food that I can't eat cause he's sick.  Anyway, 43,000 likes, but almost half a million views. I don't know how you get to that many views on that.  Go ahead Hank. Yes, what's up?  Go ahead Hank.  How's he feeling? How's he doing?  He's sucking it up. No, he's feeling much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't tell him that when they're sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. Suck it up. Get out of there. Go out and play football.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's when they're whining you tell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. He, he had one bad day where he said, I felt like I did 12 rounds in the ring. Next day he's up and around. Day after that he still can't smell anything.  That's why I was saying that in the video. Now he can. He's fine. He's feeling much better. It was five days and he was.  How's the smell? Is the smell back?  Oh good. Oh, so, you know, he's young. He's 26. He got the minor version.  I got the second shot today. So at any point I could just pass right now and you better not say suck it up.  Anyway, getting back to the very important birthday today. Jeff, happy birthday. If you go to.  It's not really a birthday, but who cares?  It's an anniversary.  So, so what, so if you go to Google.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know why they chose now because no one knows exactly the year or the time.  So it's just celebrating. Show my screen.  In fact, 1400. He was born sometime, give or minus.  They don't even know the year.  Four years from 1400. They didn't know the year. They chose 1400 because it would be convenient for celebrations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. And he died on February 3rd, 1468. We know that.  Yes.  But we don't know when he was born.  He put it down and printed it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He should have printed it.  His name was, he never put his own name in print.  That's not his real name?  No, he, well, he was born Johan von Gensfleisch, which means goose flesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got the Gensfleisch. Just hearing that.  Gensfleisch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So laden zum Gutenberg.  Yeah. So, but, but, but, but in that time you tend to, you often took the name of the building you lived in and he lived in the Gutenberg. Gutenberg means good mountain.  Good, good, good, good mountain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Your last names are a relatively recent invention, aren't they?  In a sense, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So that's why Stacey's known by many first names Johan, Hannah.  She lived in Higginbotham or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was, yes.  Yeah. Happy birthday, Stacey. Stacey's birthday was Monday. That's a real birthday. Yeah. Did you have fun? Did you do something fun?  I had a migraine, but that's okay.  That's not fair. That's not right. Did you eat something good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did. I had, so my daughter actually today made me my birthday cookies. Yay. Yay.  And then I got sushi. Yay. Yay.  Both excellent. I was excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have gas station sushi every Wednesday.  Where do you actually get the sushi?  No, it's from the, I love just calling it gas station sushi.  I know, I love that too.  Because you can. There are gas stations in town where you could buy sushi. I wouldn't.  Please don't.  There's a nice Japanese restaurant across the street.  Okay. Anyway, happy birthday, Stacey. It's wonderful. I'm not going to ask you which birthday it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm 43. I am not shy about sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't look a day over 42.  You do not look a day over 42.  No, you actually, if you'd asked me, I would have said 32. Easy. Easy, right? But no, that's great. Congratulations. 43 is a wonderful age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is it ScooterX seems to be indicating that it may be his birthday as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Go ahead. April 12th.  Is it your birthday, ScooterX? Was it your birthday on Monday? Well, happy birthday.  ScooterX is our chat moderator. One of our chat moderators.  Aren't they, ScooterX?  Yeah, I really love Scooter.  Okay, the chit chat portion of the program is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody tune out. We're going to talk about Google Dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that. Call me crazy, but that's the part of the show I enjoy the most. Of course, it's chit chatting about me.  So what a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, shall we talk about phones?  Let's.  Or, no. I see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot to talk about. We did the puzzle last week for Google I.O.  We don't know when they're going to announce the Pixel 5a 5G, but that might make sense to do it then.  There was a rumor last week that it had been kill it.  That it wasn't going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which makes sense, coming from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google, in response, sent the following official statement. The Pixel 5a 5G, which would normally come out around this time,  will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan only.  And announced in line with when last year's A series phone was introduced.  Who wrote that? Not Stacom's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, watch it, my friend Stacom's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no. I'm saying good things about Stacom's. He would never have written a sentence like that.  Well, hey, Jeff, you're a professor. It will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan.  And announced in line with when last year's A series phone was introduced.  That's pretty awful.  I mean, I understand what he's trying to say, but.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's awkward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody was rushed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it could have been. Yeah, they were hoist by the word count.  So they announced the last one in August 2020. So it would be around August, I guess.  Could be earlier, could be later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could be up for a new phone by then.  Well, we love the 4a, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I had a 3a.  4a is quite nice.  4a is wonderful.  The thing is, good luck getting a phone that's not 5G.  No, of course you don't need a 5G phone, but good luck getting one that's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, well, I mean.  It just comes with the territory.  I guess I feel like I want to wait a year because I always, you know, the new, when they add the radios, the battery life is going to be kind of sucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first 5G phones were more than a year ago, so you're in good shape.  We understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's time, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember, remember Verizon's suggestion that for better battery life, disable 5G.  Yeah.  So you might, you might be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I'll wait a little longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I wonder when they're going to do the, there's another product that we're starting to hear rumors about.  In fact, Dave Phelan writing for Forbes where he writes about consumer tech says the Google Pixel Watch leaks with dazzling looks to challenge the Apple Watch.  True that.  True that.  Are they, were you dazzled?  I was dazzled.  Yeah, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm still like, what, is it going to be an Android Wear device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess so.  It has to be, right?  Unless.  Well, they got Fitbit.  That's right.  They just, the Fitbit acquisition has gone through.  What if it's a Fitbit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would, I mean, I've worn a Fitbit since 2011 and I've tried almost every wearable out there and I always come back to Fitbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the render.  It's not a picture, a render from Jon Prosser, the fairly accurate rumor guy.  So what do you, so for people listening, what is it that you like about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a stupid square watch.  It's round like a watch should be.  I like it because it's flat.  It has a nice square shape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Android Wear watches have almost always been round compared to the stupid pill shape of the iPhone.  Yeah, see, even Leo thinks it's stupid.  No, it's crazy.  It looks like a big fat metal pillow on your wrist.  But functionality wise, the Apple Watch is spectacular.  And that's the problem.  And that's why Android Wear has been laggardly.  They just can't compete.  It's been Fitbit, Apple Watch, and it's been Fitbit.  Fitbit and then Apple Watch, and then slowly Fitbit went down and Apple Watch went up.  And I think Apple Watch is easily the dominant, not only smartwatch, but wristwatch in the world.  I'm not saying much.  It's like saying we're the best buggy whips money can buy.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't see a price and guess on this.  And I hope it would be something affordable the way OnePluses was, but have a much better review after it  because Mr. Howe had the OnePlus and he talked about it on all about Android.  His hot review comes out this week as well.  Not so good.  He didn't like it.  How much was the OnePlus again?  I wasn't ready to pull the trigger on that.  I want that.  It looked great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason, what didn't you like about, he's in our chat room.  What didn't you like about the OnePlus?  Well, you tell me, Ant, because you watched the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the first thing that immediately pops up in my head is it's not an always on display.  It's a watch.  Why do I have to tap it to see what time it is?  And then there wasn't an app store for it.  So you're very limited on some of the app functionality versus what the other smartwatches have.  And performance wise, it had its moments of being quick and moments of not so quick.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason's capsule review in five words.  Excellent design.  Software is half-baked.  There you go.  This is pretty.  But software can be fixed.  Sure. It can be easily, right? With a download.  I think this is pretty because it looks thin.  It's round, but we don't know how big.  It might be pretty big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wish it were along the lines of that 46 millimeter like the OnePlus would be.  A big round watch.  I like the larger watches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would like it to come in two sizes then.  This is a dinner plate I'm wearing.  You don't want a saucer on your wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is it? Biggie Smalls?  Where's the big watch around his neck?  Oh, that was Flavor Flav.  Flavor Flav, of course.  You knew it right away.  Of course.  I'm wondering about the band.  This doesn't look like it's detachable.  I would hope it would be.  That's one of the things Apple Watch does really, really, really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right. It doesn't.  But this is a render.  But this is a render.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who knows? It could be ugly and clunky.  We don't know.  I think I'm off the watch thing.  I don't know that I'm going to be hankering for it.  All you young people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love a good watch.  I'm with Miss Stacy. I'd like a good functional watch.  But you want one that's always on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like looking at my screen, so I don't want it actually to be always on in here's way.  Because if it's always on at night when I'm wearing it, because I wear mine for sleep tracking, it annoys my husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's terrible.  It's close.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I used to have to wear, I actually used to own, I still love them.  What are those called? Sweat bands.  And I would wear a sweat band over my watch to keep it dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I go to bed at night like Richard Simmons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sweat bands and love warmers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually think it's really neat if you look at like what Apple's doing with Apple Fitness.  Having, tying your wearable to like your workouts in a really complete way.  If you look at what's that, there's a program you pay $150 for a coach that's delivered via an app.  And they like monitor you from your Apple Watch.  What is it called? And surely you know what this is called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's an invasion of privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. You sign up for it and give them, and the reason you do it is they'll like, if it's like four o'clock and they're like,  Stacey, you have sitting on your butt all day.  You know, I'll be like, oh no, my coach knows I'm sitting on my butt all day.  I got to go work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.  I've heard about that. I don't know the service though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a picture of Stacey from this is what she looks like when she goes to bed, just so everybody's prepared.  That's Flava Flav with his big old clock hanging around his neck.  Why do we always need to know what time it is, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because some of us are always busy doing something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got places to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say.  I can't say I have places to be, but I usually have things to do.  Here's the picture I should have used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey with attitude.  Ready for bed.  Wow.  That's a trademark. Giant clock around the neck.  He's a legend.  He's a legend.  All right. Well, we'll watch.  I'm thrilled.  First of all, Google's doing I.O. this year because it was really felt like last year was kind of almost a lost year for Google.  Yeah.  And maybe they'll announce to watch.  I'm hoping they'll announce for your sake, Jeff, a Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope so.  Yeah.  It's the least you could do for me for after you abused me all these years for being your workspace paying customer you abused.  The least you could do for me is make a Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mr. Jeff, they're selling Chromebooks, not Pixelbooks.  So why are they going to continue to push Pixelbooks?  Well, it's a Chromebook.  It's just a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's their special.  It's their special.  It's the good kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Special Pixelbook.  Maybe you should watch the Samsung Unpacked event, which is two weeks off, April 28th.  They the they didn't say what it is, but judging by that picture and the title, the most powerful galaxy is coming.  It's not going to be a phone.  It's it's going to be a laptop.  And, you know, Samsung makes very nice Chromebooks.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So well, they have they have the they just have a new one out, which fixed the problems of the last one.  The new red one has more battery power, but fewer features.  That's that's only a few months old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So maybe not.  Maybe just and they do have beautiful windows machine.  Yeah, maybe it's just a Windows machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How old Jeff, do you currently have a Pixelbook and how old is it?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How old are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels like it's four years old now.  It still runs fairly well.  Mine, although mine hasn't seen a whole lot of action.  My battery is dying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it?  Yeah.  I still it'll be fine.  And then suddenly it goes from 70 percent to zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These were expensive.  They were.  If you if you could have spent easily over fifteen hundred bucks on these Pixelbooks.  What did I get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got the Pixelbook.  October seven, 2017.  So four years old.  With my pen and the 128 gig Pixelbook and the personal care.  Total order was fourteen hundred thirty nine dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have as Google said, what the end of life is going to be, because that's one of the things I don't like about Chromebooks.  June twenty, twenty four for the Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say this one ain't making it there.  Yeah, you may not.  It's three years hence.  So it's it's struggling toward the finish line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The slate goes to twenty twenty six and the go goes to twenty twenty six.  So I don't like that.  I have to say it kind of peeves me a little bit when you have hardware that's perfectly good.  But the company says, we don't want to keep it up to date.  So we're going to end the life.  Which I agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you've got to have a long enough life to it.  Ten years.  But security.  Ten years.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but these are just kind of supporting the software updates.  I understand.  But, you know, especially for the price we paid for the Pixelbook.  Ten years is a lot for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think I think those ten years.  So I think what's going to be interesting is we're getting to this place like, you know, now that we're kind of the end of Moore's law.  Right.  We're getting to this place where our hardware is actually good enough to last for maybe not ten years if you look at like battery performance.  And if you think about it, you can replace it off and flash your memories going to degrade.  But I mean, five years is starting to feel like a minimum for a phone or a tablet.  And then seven years feels like a medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, I'll accept that.  Ten feels a little long still.  Yeah, no, seven is good.  I just you know what happens to these end up in the landfill.  I don't I just don't feel like that's a for it.  Everything's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  France has they've got they actually have are working towards or have no it's the EU is looking at adopting some regulations around end of life and devices that France has pioneered.  But I cannot talk about it because I don't recall how it works.  But it's actually really exciting legislation that would help and includes right to repair stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scooter X birthday boy is mentioning maybe this is for you, Jeff, that HP has updated its Chromebook X 360 with 11th 11th generation Intel processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, look at this judge in the chat room points out the electrical goods sold in Europe need to be repairable for at least 10 years.  There you go. January 20.  There you go.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they agree with my 10 years.  I wonder what the definition repairable is.  Yeah, that doesn't necessarily mean the software can be will be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It still works, but it's vulnerable to 100 attacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But mostly what they're saying is we will continue to sell battery fixes or yes parts if you have to fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's I can't imagine what it would cost to get my battery fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  Yeah, these because all the new stuff they glue it in.  It's so it could be thin and light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm still running into Shiba Chromebook 2 and a couple years ago I replaced the LCD on it, which is found one on eBay.  Somebody sold it, swapped it out and it runs just fine.  I I don't really need much support from Google on it.  It's just the browser for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this you do want the security updates.  You want to security be patched, right?  You don't care if Google adds flock to it, but you do want to be patched.  And that's the I think that's what puts these things out of business is should you use an operating system or browsers that are not being patched for security flaws.  And my God, you know, Microsoft yesterday released I think was 118 patches of which more than two dozen were critical patches.  The NSA found four more flaws in Microsoft's exchange server.  The FBI has admitted that it's been going around, you know, software over the network looking at people's exchange servers and killing any installed web shells installed by the bad guys.  Just, you know, going in the court, they took they got a court order.  They can go in and do that.  And that gives you an idea of what a nightmare this is.  So in security is very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if you happen to read the Ben Evans thing I put up.  You know, I'm a fan of Ben's.  I put these up and you probably ignore them.  But there was no, no, no, no, I just don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't read it till I get to it.  So is content moderation a dead end?  That one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Well, the reason I'm bringing it up right now is he he draws a parallel between the openness of Microsoft in the early days and the necessity and what it what it took to be to go to go away from an open operating system that could be hacked and had tons of vulnerabilities toward trustworthy  computing. Yeah, which really meant closing off the APIs were abused.  Right. Checking for bugs being exploited.  I had to create a whole infrastructure of scanning and monitoring.  Yes, Microsoft made it harder to do bad stuff and wrote software to look for that bad stuff, which sounds very familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's saying with content moderation, I should point out that that's true.  Although it's like plugging holes in a dike or Swiss, you know, piece of Swiss cheese.  It's a never ending process that Microsoft has been singularly bad at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And that's what he's saying is learn the lesson from that.  Oh, you can't do it. It's even worse when you're dealing with human beings.  Right. Because we'll right.  We'll find our way around.  So that's where he says maybe it's an architectural issue, which I found really interesting that the fact that you can't put links up in its Instagram block links just don't allow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. When you do that, as for example, you can't put links in Instagram.  You cannot put a clickable link in Instagram.  Right. So what does that do?  I don't know. It doesn't. It's not as bad as Facebook because of that.  I guess you're right. Yeah.  You can control it by limiting sharing and retweeting and a lot of the things that amplify.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does that look like that you get to a point where Clubhouse doesn't ever applies quotes or screenshots.  Email newsletters don't seem to have morality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That may be what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some people argue the problem is ads or algorithmic feeds, both of which he disagrees with pretty strongly.  But it's the same underlying point. Instead of looking for bad stuff, perhaps we should change the paths that bad stuff can abuse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. And actually, I would add to that things like the YouTube recommendation engine, which slowly radicalizes people over a period of time.  They could fix that. Yeah, there's that too.  They don't need the recommendations. By the way, I do love Benedict Evans before picture of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Hogarth. This is Hogarth. It's a very good piece.  And he says in the piece Hogarth contrasted dystopian gin lane with utopian beer street.  Alcohol is good so long as it's the right kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So these are the course he says this is 19th century gin drinkers or actually 18th century gin drinkers in London.  And it's not good. It's not good.  It's not good. If you've never seen this etching, it's a classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a biography of Hogarth coming out that I have to order directly from the UK.  I love his stuff. It's just it's just amazing.  The life that he had. There's a favorite one of mine about a musician with the noise of London driving him crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's full of life. And by the way, kudos to Benedict Evans for for finding that.  That's that's a perfect illustration. If you want to see it, Google gin lane Hogarths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So just one more sentence, if I may. He says, of course, if the underlying problem is human nature, then you can still only channel it.  No one robs payroll trucks anymore.  But I get lots of messages asking me to send my life savings to Nigeria.  And so I don't know if no one robs payroll trucks anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But OK, for argument's sake, I'll accept that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know how much. When was the last time a payroll truck he saw a big heist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. Isn't that a big thing in Boston? There's a whole there's a whole.  I think that's even watching the movies. Yeah, maybe that's just in the movie.  I don't know. What's good, fellas? It's been a while.  They're armored cars. He calls a payroll truck site for reasons I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's British. So anyway, anyway, I think it was interesting that that Microsoft has been fighting this forever.  And there's lessons there. For humanity as well. That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Ben. I've been watching City on a Hill, but it's about 1990s Boston.  You may be right. There you go. Stop. Stop robbing trucks around then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just break your Bitcoin. What's the truck for? Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  BTC all time high. Sixty two thousand five hundred ninety nine dollars and ninety cents per Bitcoin.  New record, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. Yeah. Keep going.  Keep going. Bitcoin. Keep on going. Do you have any? No, no.  Oh, I wish. Oh, it's actually three points zero three to two bitcoins.  Oh, worth two thousand dollars. You're a millionaire. Oh, nice.  Stacey, you're you're muted, Stacey. Do you have any Bitcoin or do you just have cookies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm Stacey. Oh, you are. You're back. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That explains why you were like not listening to me when I was trying to talk.  Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry. Wave your arms and you'll see you.  I was like, oh, man, they're so rude. And then I'm like, maybe I'm muted anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We muted you. We muted you because you're typing really loud.  I know. I'm sorry. Are you on deadline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was trying to find something. Oh, OK. That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can I get your quiet keyboard? OK, I'll stop.  No, I can get you a quiet keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, normally when you hit the space bar, it turns you off, but it doesn't right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't know why. Yeah. See, I have this is I have I type all the time on this show,  but I have a mushy keyboard. You can't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think even with a mushy keyboard, you could probably tell.  I think with her, I type like this. Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're a very passionate type. I forgot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Instead of go squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish, squish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK. Well, I was going to tell you, I'm writing about it in my newsletter, but on the Bitcoin story,  I have made like a crazy amount, like just random amount of money on my helium router, which is all just bonkers to me.  Wait a minute, your router is mining?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. I remember like a year ago, it's their own token.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I like I showed off this this hotspot.  It was a Lora Wann hotspot that helium made.  And I was like, y'all, I'm so excited about Lora Wann.  I'm sharing my Wi-Fi with Lora Wann network and blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Lora Wann is the low range network that Amazon Sidewalk uses as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Sidewalk has a proprietary version of it.  Yes, it is a low power wide area network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's like an official open low-rand as well.  Yes.  Oh, I didn't know that. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And lots of things run on it, believe it or not.  Most of them are business, not consumer stuff.  But anyway, I checked like a month ago and all of a sudden, because people kept asking me what I was doing with my router.  And I was like, I don't know, I'm providing, you know, Lora Wann to anybody in the general vicinity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is no one since you live on an island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not true. Oh, I can see that like people are actually I can see when someone sends packets using my router.  Wow. Oh, that's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it fun? It's secure. I take it. I mean, they're not on your network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're just they're not. They're just using my network as back home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are there hikers or? Yeah, I think it might be shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Shipping? Really? Well, we're going to wave at Stacey, by the way, next July when we sail by on the cruise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to wave at you. I'm going to get everybody out on the railing and say, use your Lora Wann while you're sailing.  That's so strange. So you're close enough. You think what is the range of the Lora Wann?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lora Wann goes out up to three kilometers. Oh, so it could be shipping.  Yeah. So I mean, yeah, maybe it's on the sound.  And ships do use Lora Networks to track containers and things. That's not a weird thing. A lot of ports have it.  That's why I'm guessing ships from your house. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She has a very nice place. I can see the center of your view. I know. I think she has a nice place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the point is, I checked and like helium network tokens went from being completely worth nothing to being worth like $15 a token.  And I had like a thousand of them. What? Wow. Because I just... So then I was like, holy cow.  Where do you exchange them? I went to Binance and I like... Binance will buy them? ...catched in a chunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's nice. So are the boats giving you that money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How is this happening? You're mining crypto.  Yeah, it's mining crypto. And the idea is that's the incentive for people to actually put these hotspots on, right? To build up the network.  So you get money for like witnessing a new network, challenges on the network to make sure you're still part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not proof of work mining. It's a proof of coverage. Yeah, that's really interesting. That's actually really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was really excited because I like basically found a few thousand dollars on the sidewalk that I had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it that much? That's awesome. Holy cow. I pulled out like $10,000. What? I'm going to buy one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. Have you heard about the chip problem? Stacey can tell you about that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the chip problem is a problem and apparently demand has skyrocketed because people are crazy.  But yeah, so Kevin is like... He bought his in January, so he's excited.  But I just thought it was kind of crazy. And I've been jokingly calling this my retirement network for the last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm like, oh, for no reason. So at some point we will be able to buy these again, right? Or is it over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. Well, you'll be able to buy them and add coverage. I don't know if you'll make money on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's a story about a 60-week delay in routers right now because of the chip shortage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's for ISPs, but yeah. Yeah. So yeah, I don't know. I mean, this is not a go invest in helium as like a get rich.  To me, it's just like, oh, I found money in my couch and it just happened to be a lot because cryptocurrencies are weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What you're actually doing is great, which is you're providing a low-rand network for people in your...  I mean, I would see... I'm not crazy about Amazon Sidewalk mostly because it's from Amazon, but the concept I love.  So let's do an open network like that. I think that's a great idea. I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what's the brand? Is helium the brand of the router?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Helium is the network operator. They used to sell their own routers, but now they have deals with other companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm saying it wrong. It's LoRaWAN. LoRaWAN. It stands for long range wide area network.  So what Amazon was doing was called LoRaWAN or was it also LoRaWAN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's also... Well, it uses the LoRa network. That's it. LoRa. Radio. Yeah.  But it doesn't... They've put a proprietary protocol on it and they've done it actually for security reasons.  So you can't see what devices are communicating on the network. So that's why they are using Sidewalk purportedly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. And here's an article from December.  The LoRa Alliance is in talk with Amazon to switch Sidewalk over to LoRaWAN.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's that. That's basically the Alliance being like, come on Amazon. You are a giant company.  Do not screw an open standard. And Amazon's like, yeah, we'll listen to you.  So the Alliance is like, okay, we're in talks. So everyone gets excited, but you don't think that's going to happen.  Don't get that excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, see, that's disappointing. And I can say, I'm not going to buy a Sidewalk device or allow Sidewalk.  I already turned it off because I don't want to support Amazon in that.  But if it were open like this helium thing, I think that's great.  We need this is going to... Amazon gave a lot of good use cases, lost dogs and mailboxes and stuff.  I would definitely have a lot of uses. If I were near the shipping channels, I would definitely do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I turned on Laura because I think it's important and the use cases are so compelling for having cheap access to low power, wide area internet access.  So I will use, I will do helium. I will enable Sidewalk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So you don't mind having Sidewalk be non-standard, non-proprietary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't impinge on the ability of helium to do its thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't hurt me. And if it broadens the ecosystem, that's all I want. That's all I want, man.  Can you explain something to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey's podcast, by the way, from December 17th, discusses this whole Laura, Laura Wan and the attempt to work with Sidewalk.  We haven't heard anything since then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you explain something to me?  So is your router mining just because it's on and doing that because it's got nothing better to do?  Or does the actual use of it as a router, as a Wi-Fi router, have some impact on the mining?  I'm trying to see the relationship. I don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, the relationship. So it mines by saying, basically by saying, I am here and then other routers and saying to other routers,  Hey, can you basically run this proof to ensure that I am who I say I am and I have coverage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not the traditional proof of work that Bitcoin or Ethereum does. It's proof of connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's proof of being like I am on and this is my coverage range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you get a reward for that because you're supporting the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you lived in Montana near no one who would end up using your signal, do you still mine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. And Helium has a coverage map so you can see where everybody's routers are.  It's actually super public in a way that is a little uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't have your name associated with it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they have all these crazy, crazy names like Bamboo, Sticker, Panda.  Okay, so it's not nobody could identify you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, although we now know your Bamboo Sticker Panda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could figure out mine pretty easily because there's not that many where I live.  Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah.  But if you don't have one near you, it makes it harder to, I guess, earn as many tokens if you're doing it for money purposes because

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you earn them through your connections.  Okay, got it. Right. That's what I meant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a little break. We have a lot more to talk about. This has been fascinating. Thank you, Stacey.  I appreciate it. By the way, thanks also to Jason Howell who took over the show last week.  He did a great job. I really appreciate it.  He's great. Host of All About Android and our producer.  Our show today brought to you by the Enterprise Tech 30.  Now, if you listen to Stacey and you or you know, I think there are a lot of people going,  okay, I'm going to write down these companies that she talks about.  These companies are going to be hot. I got something for you.  The Enterprise Tech 30. It's a piece of seminal research developed by Wing Venture Capital in partnership with NASDAQ.  Part of the part of the thing that's interesting about this is these are not public companies.  These are private companies, which means it's kind of hard to know what's going on in there  because they're cagey about growth and revenue. They don't have to publish it.  Sales cycles in some of these businesses can be long, arduous.  You don't know where on the ramp they are. There are other lists.  I'm not going to deny that that feature startups or tech disruptors, but a couple of things wrong with them.  First of all, it's really easy to lobby these lists.  And so a lot of them really are basically either pay to play or heavily lobbied, not the Enterprise Tech 30.  The other problem is, you know, they're often dominated by consumer brands or maybe even names everybody already knows.  And that's how they made the list.  So that's why I want you to use the Enterprise Tech 30, because these are enterprise startups with the most potential to tectonically shift how enterprises operate for the better.  If you get into the ET 30, that means you are on a fast track, both of growth and of transformation in business.  You're transforming how business is done.  And of course, you know, I know one of the reasons people pay attention to this, they're interested in the big exits or the IPOs that are coming along.  And all of these companies are on the track to that.  And you absolutely cannot lobby or buy your way onto the ET 30.  In fact, you have to be selected by a very talented, very smart team of researchers.  The Enterprise Tech 30 focuses on companies with potential at all stages of maturity, too, rather than just, you know, those companies everybody knows about.  The ET 30 should be considered a buying guide for enterprise executives seeking to bring more validated, incredible digital innovation to their organizations.  These are vetted companies that are producing a product of real value that are on the right track.  And by the way, if you're on the ET 30, congratulations.  That's the highest endorsement of your current and future success.  And if you are, in fact, aspiring to build a publicly traded company, getting on the ET 30 is a major moment in your journey.  Tech executives and high performance operators use the list to help guide their decisions on what companies to join.  It's a really valuable list and it's fascinating to the 2021 edition of the Enterprise Tech 30 from Wing Venture Capital and NASDAQ is out.  Just came out. Head over to Enterprise Tech 30, 3-0 Enterprise Tech 30, the number 30.com to see who made this year's list.  That's the Enterprise Tech 30.com now out from Wing NASDAQ.  And we thank both Wing and NASDAQ and the ET 30 for their support of this week in Google.  Enterprise Tech 30.com.  Uh, do you need to explain the story to me?  The one in all caps? No, I don't know who did that. I wouldn't do that. Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason was screaming.  The CCMI story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes. So, you know, last week, I guess the week before when I was here, we were talking about how exciting T-Mobile is going to support RCS,  this rich communication services that Google is pushing on Android messages.  It's to basically make it, you know, the Android messaging app as functional and as interesting as useful as say Apple's messages or Telegram or one of the above.  And so we thought that was very good news.  Then the bad news, because Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T were all working together on the cross carrier messaging initiative for RCS.  And now they've decided to shut the doors. That's over.  It was originally slated to ship last year. Never happened.  Now it never will.  A spokesperson for Verizon confirmed the scoop by Light Reading dot com.  Quote, the owners of the cross carrier messaging initiative decided to end the joint venture effort.  Because it was being nice to Google or what?  Because these companies all hate each other. They're all in competition.  And that's why we have such a fragmented system.  Nobody can, you know, there's nobody saying, oh, we should all use the same system. No.  In fact, even, you know, this happened back in the in the IAM wars.  You know, originally there were a number of programs that would let you go cross platform on all the IAMs and IAMs companies put up silos.  A lot of them died because of it so that they wouldn't be part of that.  And I know. Would you agree, Stacey? You follow this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate this stuff. It drives me absolutely bonkers.  And there's a very clear business reason.  I mean, Tim Cook was in his he was talking about like why they don't open up messages to Android users.  It's like, well, it's the only reason people are not kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kids, iPhones. That's right.  It was Phil Schiller and Craig Federighi.  It was depositions and emails revealed in the discovery during the epic versus Apple battle.  But it was, you know, everybody kind of knew the reason Apple doesn't make messages for Android is it's a, you know, they want that competitive wall.  Exclusivity. Yeah.  And they but they even said the smoking gun was in this email saying, well, we don't want parents to buy Android phones for their kids.  These fifty dollar Android phones. We want them to have iPhones.  And in fact, it turns out they actually had an Android app ready to go and decided not to release it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably the same for FaceTime. But yeah, any communication.  It drives me nuts. Like communication technologies.  Communication should be free and open. Right.  This is like what people want to do.  And using it as a cudgel to like lock people in not a cudgel as a barrier, a wall.  To put to lock people in your ecosystem is just wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's good business probably.  But I do have to point out that that's how email was.  Jeff and I are old enough to remember MCI mail.  Remember, which didn't talk to anything but MCI mail and Genie and CompuServe.  And they all had their own mail systems, but nobody would talk to anybody else, which made it not very useful.  And at some point, for some reason, it was just agreed.  All right, we should federate.  I remember the big deal when you could send AOL mail to other people on other services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe that was the ruin of it all.  Now that you mention it.  That's when email went downhill.  Because then anybody can send anything to anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you had it with IM, remember Jabber?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But then remember that, you know, and by the way, they're gone.  AIM and IARC, ICQ is still around.  But a lot of these guys said, no, no, no, we don't want to interoperate.  I think it's understandable.  Companies want a silo.  Users want interoperability.  Users want to be able to.  I want a messenger that I like that will talk to everybody else in my family.  Yeah.  We don't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and you probably won't get it unless Congress decides that's important.  Is that how you have to do it? Does government have to force it?  Or threaten it.  Or threaten it in a way that is actually threatening.  Okay, we'll do it.  And then they'll be like, okay, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the bigger question then is why these carriers even considered CCMI.  You know, why they started it in the first place.  I have to point out that SMS is cross-platform text messaging.  Because each carrier has a gateway to the other carriers.  Because they realized, in fact, it wasn't always that way in the early days of SMS.  It never took off in the U.S. until they did that.  Because if you were a T-Mobile customer, you could only text message other T-Mobile customers.  If you were a Verizon customer, you were stuck there.  Until they got those gateways in and are operated.  Which wasn't, it's in my memory, it wasn't that long ago.  This is what I remember. Text messaging was huge everywhere but the U.S.  Everybody talked about text messaging in Europe and Asia.  And we didn't do it because it was useless.  Well, and it was expensive.  And that's another thing.  I mean, texting was like, remember it was like a dollar or a quarter a text?  Yeah, it was really expensive.  So they solved that.  But the problem is SMS is nowhere near the capabilities of the database messengers that we see now.  And that was what RCS was supposed to do.  And you know, the carriers have been dragging their feet with RCS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So would RCS have created that single messaging application?  Well, that was the idea.  That was the plan.  See, you want to get mad at technology companies, folks?  Start with your phone company.  Start there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I hate the phone companies.  Yeah.  They're giant.  Most of us do get mad at phone companies and cable companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, this is called This Week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And kudos to Google, which came up with RCS.  Actually, I think they bought a company.  But they were the big proponents of RCS.  They've been the ones that have been pushing it.  So I go back to my question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was this was this in part a way to say screw Google or was it no, no, no, no, screw all you guys?  It's just a scroll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We hate you all.  Yeah.  But but I think it's important to point out that there are good business reasons to do that.  But there might be better business reasons to interoperate.  And there are some examples like email and SMS where interoperability made these technologies take off.  Yes.  The other thing that is important is Google's RCS in Android Messenger is end to end encrypted.  And that's another thing I think users really want.  So big plus.  Yeah.  But it's not.  So is Signal.  So are a lot of things.  But it's not any good if you have if it's not cross platform.  All right.  Cross or cross carrier.  It's too bad.  It's really it's really a shame.  Google's I think as far as I know still, you know, big on as RCS rich communication services.  But to what end?  Yeah.  Well, without the carry.  But carries is always minimal.  You know.  Yeah.  It's just another messenger.  Well, OK.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Google has enough of those.  God, yes.  Yeah.  She's dumb questions continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There might be.  There's another reason to do this for the carriers, which is that SMS is as technology rides.  And Stacey, correct me because you know all this stuff much better than I do.  It's not a rise on the voice channels.  It's not a data.  It doesn't use data, although everything's using data now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It uses data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does now, I guess.  But it's not what we call as data service.  It's it's always it's always distinct from the data services.  Whereas Messenger RCS WhatsApp Telegram Signal, they all use just pure data.  They don't.  And that's why it's a problem with SMS.  SMS is the lingua franca.  Every every smartphone has SMS capability.  But nobody wants to use SMS.  I use SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use it, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I was pitching two weeks ago that Hangouts went away.  Yeah.  Actually, it was actually wasn't on this show, but it was last week.  It was on Twitter.  It was on Twitter.  I wasn't here last week.  I was really mad because while we were in Calistoga, all of a sudden Hangouts dies and I don't  have my Pixel phone with me.  I count on Hangouts so that I could get my Android messages, which are the Google Fine  number.  It's the public number I use on my iPhone.  Then Hangouts dies because Google whoops.  Yeah.  And so I went on this search for a replacement.  I ended up getting a program that's not a great replacement, but it's better than nothing  called Pulse by Luke Klinker.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard you mentioned that Sunday on the show.  Is it working for you?  Yeah, it's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unfortunately, there's the Apple does not allow them to have an iOS app.  Of course.  So you have to use a progressive web app, a website, but it's not working well.  Yeah, I know.  It works everywhere else.  It works on the desktop.  It works on Linux.  There are other solutions, but like for instance, Signal only works on one thing at a time.  I want the same message to appear on all my devices.  Exactly.  So when my daughter who is using Android texts me on Hangout, well it was Hangouts, but texts  my Android number, I can see that everywhere and respond everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is Hangout now dead for that purpose or you're just going to be soon?  Yeah, it's dead dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're a Google Fi user, right?  Remember Google Fi users, Hangouts lasted longer than anywhere else.  It just stopped working.  I couldn't text my daughter anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still have Hangouts in my email program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but try to send a...  That's not the SMS though.  No, no, that's not SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the video call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they've replaced that with Google Chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so if I try...  So I can do it with...  I can send instant messages via Hangouts, but if I go to like do a voice or a video  call, it goes to Meet.  It's very strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's Chat and Meet is what they're hoping that you'll use instead of Hangouts.  And I think they must have turned off the Hangouts server because I kept typing in messages  and Hangouts and it said fail to send, fail to send, fail to send.  So I don't know.  I don't know what's going on.  It's disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about other interoperability?  Yeah.  Perhaps in the smart home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Are you talking about Chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why, yes I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So CCMI is dead, but Chip is alive and well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  What's the Chip news?  Project Connected Home Over IP was created by Google, Amazon, Apple, and Samsung back  in December 2019.  And the idea was to create an interoperable protocol for the smart home.  And we all were like, y'all were like, this is never going to work, boo.  And I was like, oh guys, it might.  And so optimistic.  Hold on, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We said this is never going to work.  But I personally said this is never going to work.  But I hope it does.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And was like, sure, Stacey.  I also hope it will.  But get your head out of the clouds.  Suck it up, Stacey.  It's not going to work.  So with the pandemic striking soon after that, they had said it was going to take a year.  It's actually what they did is this week they came out and said, all right, it'll be out  in December or late 2021 is when the certificate or the spec will be publicly available and  the certification will start.  So they're like two years, you know, or a year late, but the pandemic did change things.  This week, they also, but they finally talked about things like here's how it's going to  work.  It's going to use thread for low bandwidth applications in the home.  So Apple putting thread in their home pod mini.  I always have a hard time with this.  Like Eve, the way they do their thread with HomeKit sensors for Eve stuff.  All that's going to be probably moved right into chip.  Wi-Fi is going to be for high bandwidth applications.  They're going to support, oh, and it also supports ethernet.  And they're also going to support the following device classes.  Very exciting.  Let me find them so I don't tell you the wrong device classes.  Okay.  Lighting, blinds, HVAC, televisions, access controls like door locks, and then safety  and security products and access points, smart home controllers and bridges.  What they're not going to support though are things like cameras.  I was just about to ask.  Appliances and wearables.  Why not?  They're going to tell you it's because cameras are complicated.  Like a light bulb, you're like, it can only do a limited set number of things.  You're like turn on, dim, turn off, maybe change colors, and tune.  A camera, you can turn it off, you can turn it on.  There's motion.  There's certain types of motion.  There's a lot more happening there from a data model perspective is what they tell me.  I think though it's because a camera feed is a wonderful way to lock someone into your  ecosystem, but that's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The cynical Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the Aunt Pruitt version of Stacey.  That's me listening to my inner aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not cynical.  I'm just realistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  That's exactly what a cynical person would say.  So I went into all this stuff.  There's all the answers on backwards compatibility.  And we can expect these devices hopefully by the end of this year.  Oh, and this is really exciting.  They're integrating security into the standard.  So they're going to integrate encryption as part of the standard and software over there,  software updates.  And they've got a little blockchain component that everyone's excited about, but really  it's just a distributed ledger to track like the provenance of a device and how often it  gets updated.  But people are very excited because blockchain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there anybody left out of this alliance who should be there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's now 180 member companies.  So there are smaller companies that are not part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But all the big guys are there.  And that doesn't mean they're not going to support it.  They just don't want to pay the association fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they may not be there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can they support it without being a member of the alliance or the project?  That's just the working group, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So right now, if you want to see the spec and participate, you have to be part of the  alliance.  When it becomes public later this year, I believe you can implement it without, but  you're still going to have to pay for like testing and certification and all that fun  stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fascinating.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was so excited about this because for consumers, this means like these devices will just work  together.  Theoretically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is good.  It's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be nice to see this in action.  Maybe the carrier should pay attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, you know, I'm just did a little plug here.  The story on my site is, oh, it's good.  Thank you, Scooter X.  There's a ton of information in there.  And then this week in the newsletter, I'm totally y'all are getting like a sneak preview.  What?  There's going to be scoops on chip in the newsletter from different vendors on what  they're doing with it.  And then there's also my helium story, but y'all just heard it.  So don't tell anybody.  We now know y'all can skip that.  Y'all can skip the helium story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't need to talk about that.  Well, good.  Thank you.  We knew you were excited about chip and I'm glad to hear that there is actually some future

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can read about it, of course, as Stacey on IOT project chip embraces the timeline  and the blockchain.  And there's the there's the clear as mud pyramid.  The chip pyramid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So basically what this yeah, everyone hates this.  I hate it too.  Basically, they're just saying, you know what?  Y'all are all familiar standards at the radio level.  This isn't the application level.  So if that means something to you, I mean, I don't know.  It may or may not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does it mean to people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's what I mean.  I mean, basically it'll run over a bunch of different radios, Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We may finally get to, you know, a point where home automation is more universal and things  just interoperate with one another, which would be a huge step forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you could buy a light switch without going, does this work with home?  Does it work with echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So annoying.  And by the way, there is a perfect example, industry folk of why you want to do this.  I think you had to do it in home automation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why they had to do this.  That's why they and it took them for freaking ever, like five or six years of them pushing their siloed view  and consumers saying, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because really home automation never took off.  It's been around for more than a decade.  But the fact that it was a tower of babble just stopped people cold.  They buy some stuff and realize nothing interoperated and go, oh, screw it.  I want 18 hubs in my house.  And that was that.  And especially after the voice assistants came out, because then people want started to want scripts.  They wanted actions where they could say good night.  Hello, echo. Good night.  And everything would turn off and the garage door would close.  And none of that works if things don't interoperate.  And so I think that's really when it started to happen.  Do you agree, Stacey?  It was it was voice.  That is that is 100 percent why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And shortcuts on iOS.  And the you know, I can't remember what Google calls those home shortcuts.  But those things started to really become something people wanted.  I guess that's why Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint don't have to interoperate because nobody's saying they ought to be.  But there's not the drumbeat to get them to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so there's not actual consumer buying power.  You're either going to buy an iPhone. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't buy something because of that. That's exactly right.  Yeah.  And you know, by the way, who was it?  I was listening. Was it all about Android?  Where they were saying, yeah, I am still constantly discriminated against over being a green bubble.  Oh, yeah. That was Miss Florence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's I blame you, Apple.  Blame you.  Well, you could also blame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, discrimination.  I mean, like if your friends are really like, it's your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  True. They're the problem.  I agree.  You just need to sit down with them and have a real, you know, a real talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in a chat room when that conversation came up and I basically said, you know, in my tiny circle of plus over 40 people, that conversation never comes up.  Who cares?  Everybody's a green bubble.  Everybody's a person. Everybody's message is getting out.  I guess you're right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's a teenager thing.  Yes.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there are.  I remember my son when my son was in a frat at CU Boulder, I asked I was doing some research and I asked him, so iPhones, Android phones, we all have iPhones, except for one kid who has an Android phone.  And because he's a green bubble, he can't be in our group chats on messages.  So he misses out on all the events.  He never gets invited to the events.  And, and, and hence everybody in the frat has to have an iPhone.  It's things like that that give Apple that cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Download WhatsApp, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but then you have to talk to everybody at the frat and say, okay, now, folks, don't send a message.  You got to use WhatsApp.  And they're going to go, but no, that's the one paranoid person.  We figured that out real quick.  What do you use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, like the parents of my daughter's school, we were in a big WhatsApp group because exactly that issue.  And you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all got.  So everybody just got WhatsApp.  Yeah.  See, I'd be the guy that goes, but I don't want to use a Facebook product.  I'd be that.  You would be that guy.  I refuse to use it.  And I'd be the guy who say, what if we use Signal instead?  And everybody said, so WhatsApp is great.  Yeah, of course you could do everything on everything.  There's no, I'm the guy that says my email address is so-and-so.  There is, and I can't get anybody to use this either.  There is a really good end to end encryption chat program that uses email called DeltaChat.  Yes.  And so when somebody chats with you at DeltaChat, it's delta.chat.  It comes in as an email, except that your conversation in the DeltaChat app, Android, iOS, both and desktop shows up like this is email, but it shows up like a chat.  I think that's a really good way.  That's totally interoperable.  Don't you think?  Isn't that?  I think that's cool.  No, I can't get anybody to use that either.  No, you won't.  And it's end to end encrypted, by the way, uses PGP.  I really like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my next crime spree, I'll use that.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  That's the other thing is everybody talks about encryption like, oh, I got to have encryption.  But you know, nobody's, nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys.  Okay, this is big news, sort of.  Let me sell this, but this is actually worth talking about.  Can I talk about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Take a break and we will talk about it when we come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about that?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I got to I got to talk about Linode.  You know me in Linux.  Love the Linux.  You know me in the cloud.  Love the cloud.  Now the two great tastes have come together.  Actually, not now.  Linode's been around for ages.  I've been a Linode subscriber probably for 10 years.  Linode was one of the first cloud server systems to use SSDs, all Linux all the time.  It is a great solution for anybody who wants to host a website, build an app, store backup media.  Launch and enrich your developer applications.  It's great for DevOps, for CI, CD.  It's great for hosted services, AI even.  They have machine learning nodes, gaming services.  It's cloud computing developers not just trust, but love.  That's why 800,000 developers choose Linode, including little old me.  Simplify your cloud infrastructure with Linode's Linux virtual machines.  Develop, deploy and scale your modern applications faster and easier.  Of course, you can have a dedicated compute instance if you want or save money with a shared instance.  Or use your $100 credit, which I'm going to tell you about in a second, on an S3 compatible object storage or managed Kubernetes or whatever you need.  I love the cloud manager Linode.  So easy to use.  They have a full featured API as well.  So it works really anywhere, anytime.  Data centers all over the world.  And I love this about Linode.  They don't charge you more for certain locations.  Same simple, consistent pricing globally.  So just choose the data center closest to you because you're going to get the same great deal no matter where you are.  And the customer support is superb.  Even if you are like me, you have a small plan.  I find Linode very affordable.  Just a few bucks a month.  Gives me everything I need to do.  Development, to practice, to learn things, websites, all of that stuff.  And the support team doesn't say, oh, you're a $5 a month guy.  No, no, no.  They're there for me 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.  No tearing, no handoffs.  When you get that support rep on the line, she's going to get it working right the first time.  I just love that.  Check out Linode's great YouTube channel, by the way, for video tutorials, security tips, everything you need to know at youtube.com slash Linode.  It's L-I-N-O-D-E like Linux Node.  Get it?  Get it?  L-I-N-O-D-E.  Just some testimonials.  Bryce Adams, meteoric.  He says, quote, from the start, we were looking for a partner, not a provider.  Some of the large providers, some of the three letter providers.  See us only as a transaction.  Linode is the kind of partner that will be with us from the start today and beyond.  That's why people love Linode.  Multiple Stevie Award winners for their customer and sales service.  In fact, they've won it three years in a row now.  Simplify your infrastructure.

Or you could text Twit to 47 47 47 and the same thing will work.  Twit 47 47 47 is the short code.  Linode.com slash Twig.  If it runs on Linux, it runs on Linode.  More and more I'm a Linux fan and having Linux available in the cloud is so great.  So great.  Thank you, Linode.  Linode.com slash Twig.  Twig.  It was kind of what you were talking about earlier with operating systems in order to become secure,  locking you down more and more and more.  And I've just started to decide that I feel like Apple's nannying me.  I feel like Windows is nannying me.  And Linux just treats you like a grownup.  Like so does Chrome.  You know what you're doing.  Well, Chrome treats you like a grownup in a playpen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a fine playpen where I don't have to worry about all this crap.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no.  You know what?  Somebody like you, you want priority one is safe, secure, working.  Right.  For me, I like to mess around with my stuff.  I don't want anybody telling me what I can and cannot do.  And so Linux, I go to the command line and if I want to erase my hard drive, I can.  Gosh darn it.  I can erase my hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's funny to hear you say that.  But yet you are also an iOS proponent.  You love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I preferred Android for years because it was more flexible and configurable.  But I feel like it's getting janky in its old age.  There's that.  And I don't like janky.  Janky on a desktop is a little different than janky on a phone.  A phone needs to be an appliance.  I'm sorry, but it kind of does.  Yeah.  I'm with you.  Yeah.  I'm just jerking your chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gotta give you a hard time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, I got Linux pretty locked down.  It's running nice on my nice Ryzen 7.  5,800 or 5,900.  No, I guess I got 5,800 with the Nvidia GTX 3080.  Yes, sweet.  Although I still have to keep Windows on there because whenever I have to update the Alienware  firmware, I have to go into it.  Oh, you gotta go back.  Dang.  But I have a little Windows partition in there.  Great big Linux partition.  And my game that I play, Valheim, runs beautifully on it.  I'm loving it.  It's so much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You may need to check out some open source gaming, but actually just go watch last week.  There is some good open source gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Valheim is Linux first, which it's not open source, but the developer develops on Linux.  There's a Windows version.  It plays pretty much the same on Windows or Linux.  I've tried it on both.  Nice.  So at least Linux is a peer to Windows in this regard.  There are a few of them.  In fact, Father Robert was on Sunday.  I don't know if you heard.  He's got his big server.  He's got TF2 on it.  He's got TF2, which by the way, source code leaked to TF2.  Oh, really?  I see that.  And as a result, immediately malware, cheats, all sorts of stuff.  There is some funny stuff in the source code though.  Somebody that hears Tech Radar's story about it.  Remote code execution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was actually just trying to plug Sloth Weekly, a sneaky plug.  So yeah, today did they do open source gaming?  Yep.  Endless Sky.  Endless Sky.  Oh, it's open source?  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me show you my open source.  Smooth like butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't he good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at you.  Isn't he like butter?  Get the guys on from zero AD, okay?  Because this is also open source Linux gaming.  That's basically one of my favorite games, Age of Empires.  It is such a good implementation.  Even though they say they're completely beta, it's very, as is Valheim by the way, it's  very stable and so much fun to play.  And man, the graphics and everything.  It looks, it's just a...  If you liked Age of Empires, zero AD.  Now with improved Flora.  I wonder if they use Glender.  You know, they might well.  I mean, it's a very open sourcey kind of thing.  Yeah, make a note, because I'd love to hear you guys talk with the zero AD guys.  Yep.  I took a note.  It's a really neat project.  It's been going on for years and years and years.  But that is actually one of the open source games I play all the time, zero AD.  All right, Stacey.  I've been teasing you.  I've been mean.  I've been dragging this out.  What?  Oh, it's okay.  What was the big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to feel so bad when you find out what it is.  What happened?  Okay.  You know how hot car deaths are a big deal, right?  Like people leaving their kids, babies in cars.  The SEC just approved waivers for six different companies to build in-car radar that will  be able to detect passengers in the car and let people know.  So this is a huge deal.  What was a waiver needed?  Because it's...  It's radar.  Yeah, it's spectrum.  And they're like, okay, so they're going to operate.  It's 60 gigahertz spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't your car have a backseat warning though?  Both of our cars do.  They don't do it fancy with radar.  They just, if you open the back door and closed it again during the ride, they just...  My car beeped.  At least this car or Chevy Bolt and my Mustang Mach-E both beeped the horn and say, there's  something in the backseat.  You left something in the backseat.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, mine does not do that.  I think many modern cars do, but this would be a better word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought the horn beep was that you'd lock the car.  I never knew what the meaning of the horn beep was.  I don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you got two reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a beep when the car is locked as well.  Well, then how do you know the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Oh, the car's locked.  My kid's in the back.  It's a different beep.  How is it a different beep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a longer beep if there's somebody in the truck.  Oh, okay.  Slight more code.  It's not very good for anybody planning midnight shenanigans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nobody's in my truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I swear to God.  It's the lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, I just thought that was exciting because as someone who's been around IoT forever,  it seems like such an easy problem to solve.  Oh my God, we haven't solved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's good use of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm not sure if it's going to be in cars by 2025 as an industry mandate.  It could be earlier, obviously, in fancier cars.  It's not a good name, the hot car trigger alert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm hijacking all the green things.  I should just color all mine green.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they're green, they're golden, if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so if we're in the government section, do we want to talk about how stupid the White House is being about the chip shortage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, notice, by the way, I'm not saying to Stacey, it's not a democracy, Jeff.  I only say that to you.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's because I'll yell at him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll be like, finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey, it's a democracy.  He gets too and scares you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was on Monday.  Biden got all the chip companies to come to the White House.  Not that there was anything he could do short term, but so it was a flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's just nothing you can do.  It's basically this is like politics right here in the sense that you can't do there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's something you can do.  You can allocate federal funds.  I think they allocated $100 billion, right?  Or $50 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's not going to change anything for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because you got to build plants and stuff.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So and this is kind of like, I mean, this is Europe.  The government's in Germany and France, maybe.  Yeah, they're doing it.  They all sent email, letters to Taiwan and were like, hey, can you make chips again so we can get our automotive industry on the road?  It's a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a mess and it's not going to fix it in 2021 and it's not going to fix it in 2022.  But the point is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  2022 is actually when they're thinking most of the chip CEOs, TSMC and Intel and I can't remember the other one.  Qualcomm?  Said the middle of 2022, we should see is coming out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, TSMC is building a $12 billion Arizona plant this year that might be online next year.  So is Intel.  They've got two plants slated.  TSMC is spending $100 billion.  Biden's trying to get Congress to back a $50 billion fund for this.  And I think this is exactly what we should be doing.  Instead of tariffs and saying we hate you, China, start building fabs in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  I misspoke.  Pat Gelsinger, who is the CEO at Intel said it will go beyond 2022.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because it takes a while to do these things.  But it's definitely not this year anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The darned infrastructure bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Micron. That's who you're thinking of, right? Micron?  No.  That's another American chip manufacturer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was SM...  What is the TSMC of...  There's another fab.  It was another foundry that talked about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So companies at this event included TSMC, who originally wasn't going to send somebody, but they changed their mind.  GM CEO Mary Barra, Ford Motor Company CEO James Farley and Sundar Pichai, a company I think Google.  Is that the name of it? Seems like a childish name, but okay.  They were all there.  I'm not sure why Sundar was there, but anyway, they were all there.  But so were the manufacturing powers. Dell and Intel, Medtronic, Northrop Grumman, HP, Cummins, Micron, TSMC, AT&T, Samsung Electronics.  So I think this is a very positive...  Yes, you're not going to fix this tomorrow.  You've got to build plants and they're very expensive.  But I think it's a very positive move, don't you think?  We need to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it was...  We already knew that you needed to build plants.  The issues around building the plants isn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you want government support, you want government funding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the government has been fairly supportive.  I know they have pulled back in the last probably decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Under Trump, it was mostly tariffs.  And it was mostly tariffs that American citizens paid because that's how tariffs work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Outside of tariffing, we have had a lack of investment by chip firms because fabs are so expensive.  And you need to run them all the time.  And like Intel going to a foundry model is going to help them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not going to a foundry model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pat Gelsinger said that they were opening up their plants for foundry services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I see what you're saying. Yes, they are.  Yeah, but they're building a lot of new plants.  And you're right, they're going to make...  They hope to make those plants work by building them for other people.  Just six months ago, Intel had...  Sure, Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, just six months ago, Wall Street investors were coming after Intel for investing in plants.  So this isn't a lack of government support.  It's a lack of CEO cojones to stand up to Wall Street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Intel was going to let Gelsinger make the decision.  Everybody expected that they would become fabless like Nvidia or ARM.  I never expected it.  No, and I'm very, very...  I think it's very good for America that they said, no, we're going to in fact spend a lot of money to build two plants in Phoenix.  We're going to keep our Intel, our Oregon plant.  I think they're going to keep their Oregon plant going, although it's a little out of date.  The problem is Intel's process is still 14 nanometers.  And they're saying...  And Pat Gelsinger is saying, yeah, we're going to sell chips to Apple.  Oh, yeah, I bet.  Meanwhile, TSMC in Taiwan is cranking out five nanometers, next generation three nanometers.  I'm glad to see though that they're going to invest in the U.S.  And it's things like that.  It's diplomacy.  It's going to TSMC and saying, here, we're going to give you some money, some tax breaks, whatever.  Build a plant in Arizona, please.  That helps us in other ways too.  It's not only manufacturing in the U.S., but it helps us because we don't know what the situation is going to be with China, even with Taiwan.  Or look at shipping issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you don't ship you ship chips on an airplane in via armored car.  However, you I mean, if you think about building for resiliency in terms of like climate change, in terms of global, I mean, it does make sense.  I would also say, though, that even if Intel well, their new stuff won't be, but not everything has to be made at three nanometers.  Right.  I mean, oh gosh, no.  I mean, we still have, you know, if I look at like IOT chips, the chips in your router, car chips, those are like not coming from Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got bad news for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, those are those are Infineon and those companies.  But those are those are not way down the process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's optimistic of Intel to say we're going to become a foundry.  But good luck, guys.  I hope you do.  I mean, we need we need it's good.  Intel needs to succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Intel Reuters actually not Reuters Bloomberg had a great story on what went wrong at Intel and everyone should read it because it is a management case.  It's a case study in how to like screw up a innovative company, an old innovative company to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am so excited.  I'm so excited.  The creators of Bridget's Bridgerton, the musical on TikTok have signed a deal with creative artists associates.  I know I know this is going to make you so happy.  Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a very it's a very musical musical clip.  I think you should play.  Where's the clip?  Is it on this article?  Keep scrolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, here we go.  This is for you.  Ant Pruitt.  Oh, I got to fix this.  I apologize.  I'm having the Linux problem.  Linux.  All my audio.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I can fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you mind if I take a moment?  I got to go to terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll forgive that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, he's got to go to terminal.  What was that?  Linux admin.  I go to terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To be fair.  He knows what he's doing, Ant.  And that's how Linux.  At lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At lunch, I decided for no good reason to blow out my Linux install.  And in about half an hour, I installed a completely new Linux on here.  But one of the and I was concerned because one of the things we've done before is set  the default rate and pulse audio to 48,000 48.  And I was a little concerned.  But then I played a YouTube video for John and it was fine.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're just going to have to go with a TikTok musical every time for the testing.  Apparently TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it sounds like.  It's TikTok.  Every single time.  Yeah.  Now I have to remember where it is.  I think it's in.  Slash bin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here it is.  It's in slash Etsy slash pulse.  Slash.  There we go.  And then.  Oops.  And then inside Etsy pulse.  I need.  What do you say about Linux?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  All I do is right click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I do is right click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should I play it on my Chromebook?  It works every time.  Nano demon.  Conf.  Conf.  And then.  Oh, I have to sudo.  Wait a minute.  Sorry.  Wait a minute.  You had the right admin right.  No, I don't have to.  I have to sudo that.  Wait a minute.  Sudo first.  Okay.  Control A.  Sudo.  Okay.  And then here's my password.  Be patient.  Now it's very easy.  We're going to go down here in the demon.  We're going to go down here and find the default bit rate here.  You see the alternate sample rate.  The default sample rate is forty four one.  But I don't want that.  I want the default sample rate to be forty eight.  Forty eight K.  K.  You remember, right?  See, you know this.  You know this.  You know it's easy.  And the thing is, if you expect, if you expect, if you expect the operating system to do all  that, you never really understand how computers work.  I'm just saying.  Yes.  Save that.  Okay.  Now I have to restart pulse.  Sudo.  Sudo.  Pulse.  Can't remember how to do that.  Stop.  Let's see if that works.  No.  Pulse audio.  What is it?  Is it pulse audio?  Don't worry.  Oh yeah.  I should have written a set alias to fix that.  That's exactly right.  I don't remember the name of the demon.  Shoot.  Oh well, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we all get a look at Mr. Jarvis's face during this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't do this on a Chromebook.  You're not selling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wanted to use Signal on my Chromebook and to do that I have to have Linux.  And of course what happens, I go in and I can't do it from my, what are they called  this week?  Workplace account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that stupid workplace account.  Yep.  How do I restart the server is what I need to do.  Let's see.  I've got the demon conf.  Usually by now the chat room has helped me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the chat room is saying no, we're not going to tell you the command, Leo.  Here it is.  Kill and start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you.  Pulse audio.  That's what it was.  See, I can count on Keith 512.  Pseudo pulse audio.  That's what it was.  Audio, dash dash kill and then no demon process.  That's okay.  I'm going to start it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So good.  So you're starting it.  You had to put your tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I shouldn't have run it as root.  That's my problem.  There you go.  Right there.  Oh boy.  Okay.  Let's do a kill again.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Kill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now it'll say, Oh, I know that one.  Yeah.  Now I have to not pseudo pulse audio.  This is the best way ever.  And now let's go back to Bridgerton already in progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For helping you out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Holy cow.  Of course I closed that tab.  Wait a minute.  Let's go back.  Here we go.  Here we go.  One more time.  I fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it didn't fix it.  No, it didn't.  Can you play the clip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I probably should.  I probably should reboot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just might have to reboot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shut up.  Hey, so Spotify spent how much money to get Joe.  Trying to change the subject, are we?  I'm moving along to another rain story.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really didn't want to play that.  Was it two million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100, 100, 100 million.  But that's speculation.  We don't know.  And Joe says, yeah, part of the deal was that Spotify could kill any of my earlier episodes  they didn't like.  Well, it turns out that's 42 shows and counting.  So yeah, Spotify continues to remove Joe Rogan episodes.  They're only on Spotify.  So I hope you Joe Rogan fans downloaded that one.  And I'm going to go ahead and play that clip.  So I hope you Joe Rogan fans downloaded that one with the bullet cough bulletproof coffee  founder.  That's one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There were three of them, apparently.  He and Dave Asprey are tight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently something about Dave Asprey and bulletproof coffee doesn't Spotify didn't  like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's because it's pseudoscience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've spurred on my video now.  I like Dave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've known Dave.  He used to be in the cloud computing industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is wrong with your screen, sir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fixing the sound, I somehow screwed up the video as well.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what's happening.  Was it was it X server?  Yeah, I think I must have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I must have killed my ex server.  We have a technical.  It looks okay now.  It looks okay now.  Screen.  It looks okay now.  It was just you, John.  Look, see on the bottom screen is okay.  It's just you, John.  You see you throwing me.  I'm looking at it right now on the bottom screen.  Looks fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, anyway, it doesn't matter.  You don't have to.  He says, no, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think you should throw John under the bus.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't worry.  Calm down.  Bulletproof.  You don't need to see this.  This is all in your mind.  It's the theater of the mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine if you were awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an audio show.  Remember, imagine if you were, of course, his audio doesn't work, but never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Imagine if you will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go to terminal again and fix this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Prove you can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see you.  Imagine if you will.  You're in a studio with Joe Rogan sitting 10 feet away.  Lots of figurines in between.  You got Dave Asprey.  He's the founder of Bulletproof Coffee.  Stacey, what makes Bulletproof Coffee so delicious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're supposed to mix a bunch of butter in it.  Butter makes it better.  Special butter too.  Grass-fed cow butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was about to say, or yak butter.  So yeah, grass-fed cow butter.  Anyway, no one's at Spotify saying why these three episodes have been removed.  Apparently, Asprey also backs frequently controversial anti-aging and scientific theories, including  the claim that Bulletproof Coffee is extremely healthy while other coffee brands are not.  He really pushes that thing that they're molding.  He's got this whole thing about the mold in the coffee beans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got some crazy ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says he's going to live to 180, so we'll find out.  I will anyway, because I'm going to live to 190.  I was going to say, maybe my daughter will.  I'll tell her to keep an eye out.  Great granddaughter.  But I don't know why.  I would have thought they would delete it because there's anti-Semitic sentiments or  racist sentiments.  No, no.  It's because the coffee.  They don't like the coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, right now we're in a public health kind of crisis.  So maybe, I mean, we do see people clamping down on misinformation about public health.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also killed seven episodes with David Seaman, maybe because of his name Seaman.  I don't know.  They killed episode 276 featuring little Esther, Al Madrigal, Josh McDermott, Brenda Walsh,  Felicia Michaels, and Brian Redban because the jokes got racy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't, you know, Joe Rogan says, it is the Joe Rogan experience though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, if you're a hardcore Joe Rogan fan, this is going to piss you off to know it.  I would think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it were me, I would be pissed off.  If I were Joe, I'd be pissed off.  But Joe got a, he said, quote, there are a few episodes that didn't want, they didn't  want another platform.  And I was like, okay, I don't care.  I got a hundred mil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, he's kind of playing a character, right?  Right.  Right.  And so he's probably, you know, but this is what people, I'll be honest, is what people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  were afraid of when Spotify started to eat the podcast world is that these big corporate,  you know, agendas would intrude on what has been up to now a freewheeling and fun medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to go take a hundred million dollar payday.  And I mean, if they're bad, they should be mad at Joe Rogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If he was, you know, right, he did it to them.  He signed a check.  But nobody, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody gets mad at, you know, the back of the check.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where it matters.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't sign the front.  Then it comes out of your account.  Right.  You know, yeah, I'm not angry about this, but I could see why Joe Rogan fans might not  be thrilled about this.  Zoom has a zero day.  Uh oh.  It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Wait, I have a question.  Yes.  Because I read, and this is the, I've always called it a zero day.  I read in the New Yorker a review of Nicole Perloth, yeah, her book about hacking, which  is according to everyone, very good.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you pronounced Oday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they're wrong.  Okay.  Yeah.  I wasn't going to take the New Yorker's word for it, but then I was like, I've really been  saying zero day.  Oday.  Oday.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That is so helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just a little rascals, I think, isn't it?  Was that Buckwheat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buckwheat.  Oh, actually, yeah.  It was Eddie Murphy playing Buckwheat to be clear.  O-tay.  I call them zero days.  Steve Gibson calls them zero days.  Andrew Schneier calls them zero days.  Frank Krebs calls them zero days.  I think they're zero days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think maybe this writer got some, maybe a fact check with the New Yorker.  I think somebody was messing with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the New Yorker's famous for fact checking.  That's odd.  Well, maybe somebody, maybe fact checkers got it wrong.  She said specifically, oh, and by the way, this is pronounced O-days.  Yeah, it was in parentheses.  They like you have audio problems.  It was like pronounced O-days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was...  I heard that.  I heard that, Mrs. Jarvis.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think she got pungent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, here, let's see, on the digital version, maybe they changed it.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But in the print version, I was just like...  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is almost as bad as me going to the terminal.  Let's just move on.  Almost.  Not quite.  It ain't there yet.  Zoom zero day discover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the good news is, they're still going to use the same principles that they used for  Zoom zero day discover.  But the good news is, it was discovered and revealed at the Pwn to Own Conference, which  is a very well-known hacking conference where people bring their exploits and hack stuff.  It was done remotely this year.  And the reason this is important is because the companies pay bug bounties so that when  these...  So all year long, people were trying to make a living doing this, finding these exploits,  save them up.  And they hope to win money.  The companies pay the money so that Zoom, in this case, gets the bug and fixes it before  anybody else knows about it.  In this case, $200,000 for the Dutch white hat security specialists who discovered this.  Now, I don't know...  Malwarebytes is calling it a zero day.  What a zero day traditionally means is a newly discovered exploit that's already being used  in the wild by bad guys.  I don't know if there's evidence that this has been.  It's a remote code execution flaw in Zoom that would allow you to get into a browser  tab.  This works on Zoom in Windows and Linux and I believe Mac as well.  No, just Windows and Mac, sorry.  Not clear whether iOS and Android are vulnerable.  And I've heard that the web version of Zoom is not vulnerable.  Anyway, it's been patched already.  But what it would allow you to do is if somebody's in a Zoom call, is get in there and execute  a program.  And that's not good.  That's not good.  Here's the...  I can't show you the zip.  Oh, I can show you the GIF.  Here's the GIF that was posted.  It's pronounced, by the way, zero if, just so you would know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I went back and looked at the article and put it in the chat because I was like,  I swear, I'm not crazy.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really funny.  Now, I'm pretty sure it's a zero thing.  And thank y'all.  You were right, Stacey.  You knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I just, I was like, well, I always mispronounce things, so it's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We call them Zed days.  And then meanwhile, of course, Tuesday, yesterday was patched Tuesday for Microsoft.  A record.  Is it every Tuesday patched day for Microsoft?  Every second Tuesday of the month.  So once a month.  Patch Tuesday is a holiday among Windows users, right, Ant?  Yeah, because you can't use your computer.  My computer just got finished rebooting before we came on in.  Take the day off.  Yeah.  Real talk.  Lots of flaws.  I think 114 flaws, not all of them critical, but enough that, you know, this was one of the biggest patch Tuesdays in living memory.  And among them, oh my God, the NSA revealed and Microsoft fixed four new flaws in Exchange Server.  This is in addition to the previously discovered and patched flaws in Exchange Server that did have zero days that were being widely exploited.  In fact, so much so did I mention this already?  The FBI has been going around patching them.  So anyway, four new vulnerabilities in the Exchange Server.  Wow.  Thank you, NSA, though.  Your tax dollars at work, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When they're not hacking for their own benefit.  Yeah, right.  How can we patch and upgrade our own or our messed up stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There will be no union at Alabama's Amazon, Amazon's Alabama.  White C. Mergen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what do you think, panel?  Was it intimidation on the part of Amazon, which is what some claimed, or that people didn't really want a union?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the South in Alabama is probably a hard place to get a union going, is my hunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  The vote tally was, oh, I can't remember.  1700 versus 70%, I think.  It was a huge amount.  Not enough that probably intimidation would have had much to do with it, if you ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Amazon does pay $15 an hour minimum, right?  Yeah.  McDonald's average for managers is $12 an hour.  Wow.  Oh, man.  And so Amazon has a lot of problems.  They could be a lot smarter company trying to be just a little bit nicer to their employees and people.  It wouldn't be that hard.  It's not a good look to be so aggressively anti-union as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a good look.  But, but.  It's a little Robert Barry-ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All the focus on Amazon being, you know, there's a lot worse companies.  Walmart says they're going to get to an average of $15, which means they're going to be paid lower than $15.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's once again, let's go after the tech companies, the big bad.  But there's plenty of companies in this country that screw people.  Well, okay.  They really need federal legislation mandating $15 an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's not just a function of pay the way that Amazon.  I mean, there have been egregious things like no air conditioning in some of their warehouses.  Oh, God. Yeah.  Yeah, yeah. I agree.  I mean, in the way they treat their workers, I mean, they may pay them $15 an hour, but you are trapped like a freaking lab rat.  You are stipulated, Your Honor.  All agree.  But I mean, you're not treated like a human.  It ain't no fun to work the fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon's not the only company doing that.  Doing that type of stuff too.  Right.  Well, yeah.  Corporate America can be pretty freaking useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's why this was a good test.  Because I think it was actually interesting because Amazon is basically saying, yes, we're not going to treat you like a human, but we'll give you more money.  And apparently that's okay for some of these people.  And it's because they don't have great other options.  And that makes sense because capitalism.  Okay. I'm just being silly now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  None of you is are single, but would you use Facebook's video speed dating app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you know, Hopin offers this like a networking function and I would actually use it.  I'd be like, that is super efficient.  Yeah.  We're networking interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The single folks I know universally hate dating.  Mostly because they're older.  I was going to say, what's the age group, sir?  Yeah.  Well, here's what Facebook says.  Video speed dating with kind people.  Okay.  Maybe. But what if you don't want a data kind person?  Do you ever think of that?  No public profiles.  No swiping a little swipe at Tinder.  No endless DMS.  Also a swipe at Tinder.  Free to use.  And it's made by the company's NPE team.  That's their experimental apps team.  They call it.  I love the name.  Sparked.  Spark up a relationship.  Steve Gibson recently got married.  And I don't know if this is public.  It's public to say that.  I don't know if what I'm about to say is public.  So I won't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, don't let's not talk about it.  It's about dating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's about how horrible dating is.  It's an endless process.  I can tell you dating is terrible.  Yeah.  But mausoleum to Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mausoleum to Steve.  I didn't know that.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and his wife is wonderful.  We've at least and I have met her in Boston.  We did an event for LastPass.  She's great.  She's perfect for Steve.  Of course.  They're a fun couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve is such a gentleman.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did ask them after they got married.  I said, you want to go on a cruise?  And they said, no.  So do you get like a group discount?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that what it's like?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the way these things work, if we do it, I've done, I did like 15 geek cruises.  Oh yeah.  He did them in the day.  They were and they're free for the speakers and then people pay to be.  It's like a conference at sea.  So it's like a workshop.  Yeah.  It's like a workshop.  In fact, we went to Alaska and Holland America.  I did a chess cruise.  Oh yeah.  That was fun.  Man, there's people that are party.  Is there a Linux cruise we could go?  Oh, well let me tell you, if we, if we do one, we're thinking about, we're not sure.  If we do one, I'll promise I will have a session on terminal commands.  Just for anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I will have a Gutenberg drinking game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you'll get many more people.  Don't, don't, don't schedule at the same time as my Linux commands.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because up arrow and tab key are your friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, what was I saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, uh, dating Facebook, Facebook.  Anyway, four minutes speed dating.  Would we do it?  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's interesting.  Have you ever done your, you know, you, they didn't have speed dating when you were still  a child bride.  So no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When you were on the market, so to speak.  Um, uh, uh, what else?  I need to change log.  What?  Change log.  Oh God.  I almost forgot.  Thank you, Stacy.  It's time for time for women.  Wait for it.  No, he was waiting for me to throw it, but see, I don't like to say it's time for the  Google change log.  And then somebody plays a thing that says the Google change log.  That's redundant, John.  So I'm going to, from now on the ellipsis is your cue.  When you hear it's time for dot, dot, dot.  He'll put the ad in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's gold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, can you one day insert Higgs in space?  Just for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I weren't on Linux, I'd play that for you right now.  Uh, Google assistant can now find even ring silenced iPhones.  Wait a minute.  This is a very confusing headline.  Explain this.  Somebody's got to parse this headline.  Google assistant can now find and ring silenced iPhones as duplex expands to online food orders.  This makes no sense.  That's a bad headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an SEO optimized headline.  That's the only, that's an AI written headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  Okay.  So it's two different features.  Okay.  Um, you could say, Hey, you know who the lady with G O O G L E internet.  Hey, you know who find or ring my phone.  You've always been able to do that with Android, but apparently now, uh, on Apple's platform,  the assistant will place a phone call to your mobile number.  Apple of course is the one that owns the beep beep beep sound.  I can make my phone do that from my watch.  So it's probably easier if you have a, you know, a watch to beep your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It sounds like a car door opening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does.  Well, it's cause it's your kids inside, but this is a, this is, oh my God, I love my,  this is useful because it's a, it's just the right frequency to, to, to echo locate if you're a bat.  So you can know exactly where your phone is.  I gotta tell you, that is a sound that is a sound heard at least daily in the LaPorte household.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love, I love asking my assistant to find my phone.  I do it daily as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I updated that title to make it more SEO friendly for you.  Tell us what it, what's the new title?  Google assistant can now find slash ring, silence iPhones as duplex expands to online food orders via blockchain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In 5G.  In 5G.  Profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I think T-Mobile is better SEO than Verizon.  I'm just saying.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, these, you do have to enable it, uh, blah, blah, blah.  Um, but it does work even if the phone is silenced and, uh, do not disturb is enabled, which is, uh, kind of nice.  Actually that's going to be with the Google home app.  Then, then you could do that one.  Duplex on the web.  That's the duplex is that thing that was uncanny that they demonstrated two at two years ago, Google IO, where your phone, you call a rest, you say, hey, you know who call a restaurant and it'll make it a reservation for you.  It can also do that now.  With takeout.  My wife said that there was some story I didn't, I forgot to get the link from her that the majority of the calls are still made by human beings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure they are.  It's yeah.  They.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's Google for you.  That's Google in a nutshell.  Well, it also reminds me of that great Seinfeld episode in which Kramer was movie phone.  I love that.  You're right now makes me laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just thinking about it.  Hello.  This is movie phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please.  State your movie.  Meanwhile, duplex on the web can help with takeout.  You have to First of all, the restaurant is appear in the Google App.  You'll make menu selections in the Google app.  And then it should say Clear and Clear, and then you can get them on the special menu options for your menus.  First of all, the restaurant is appear in the Google app.  You'll make menu selections in the Google app.  And then at the very end in the final checkout process, there'll be a button to automatically navigate the site, fill out your contact or payment details.  Wow.  And synced chrome auto fill.  Then a sheet will slide up.  I'm just going to call the freaking restaurant.  Then a sheet will slide up to to walk you through the process.  Oh my God, it's very complicated.  This is for this is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No kids hate talking to people.  That's true.  That's true.  This is for people who hate to talk.  My daughter will do anything to avoid it.  Actually, I'm trying my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love her.  I think that's normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My daughter refuses to text.  She has to call and it's like, Abby, you're 28.  You should you're supposed to be texting.  So it hurts my thumbs.  I think it's probably because her phone's almost always the glass is almost always broken on the front.  But that's another story.  Don't you have a spare one you could load her?  I give her new phones regularly, Jeff.  But only after her fingers start getting cut.  She says, I need a new phone now.  Google is also making sunrise and sunset triggers in assistant routines available globally.  Those are nice.  OK.  So like, for instance, your lights, I like my lights to dim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Google was way late on the sunrise, sunset.  So this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I did that with my Hue lights five years ago.  Android has an this is this is April Fool's.  No, it's not.  No, no, no.  I put it in there.  Android has a new feature to save you future embarrassment called heads up.  It will stop you from walking into telephone poles and other pedestrians.  Oh, my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  Yes.  OK, I do that.  I do that.  Not even when I'm not on my phone.  I just do that because I'm looking at like I have I have a classic.  It can't help you with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to be.  It's only if you're looking at your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So let's say this thing does not work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Who's going to start selling Google?  Yeah.  We're going to be very careful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little bit of an embarrassing suit, don't you think?  I want to tell you.  Come on, really?  This is America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is America, the whole of the ridiculous litigation.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll never forget when I was a kid, I got my drops in my eyes.  So I saw blurry and my dilation.  Yeah, dilation.  So my sister was with me.  So she said, I'll walk you home.  Probably walked me right into a telephone pole.  Oh, siblings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It really hurt.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll never forget it.  Had I had this digital well-being feature, it still wouldn't have helped because all  the phone does is periodically reminds you to keep your head up when you're walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I thought it would do something like why can't you use solely to be like a pole?  It's a pole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, all it does is if it notices you're both walking and using your phone, which is a bad  behavior, stop it.  It will then say, hey, just don't walk in.  Cliff ahead.  Heads up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, equally bad as people who stop walking to use their phone when they're still.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or just walk slowly while using their phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you haven't yet watched the seven episode Fran Lebowitz series on Netflix, pretend it's  a city that is actually the source of that title.  Pretend it's a city.  She says, I'm walking and no, everybody people are stopped.  They're looking at their phones.  Pretend it's a city.  People are going somewhere and doing something.  Have you seen this yet, Jeff?  No, I haven't.  Oh my God.  It's hysterical.  You got Scorsese made it.  It's a Scorsese documentary with Fran Lebowitz.  She reminds me of like Lewis Black.  She is.  She's exactly that grumpy kind of, yeah.  She's grumpy, but she's right about everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Lewis Black reminds you of her.  She's been around forever.  That's probably what I'm talking about.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's not quite as hyped up angry as Lewis Black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, she's reasonably angry.  She reminds me of Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's kind of like Jeff.  Jeff, my mother, all of these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I may not be intended as one, but I'm going to take it as one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's saying to the tourists in Manhattan, he's on his way to work, pretend it's a city.  I'm walking here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will say when I worked at Businessweek, it was down in Times Square area and every  time I'd come out of the subway, I'd just be like, I hate you all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did they have the Elmos and the Das Nudas?  Yeah, this was 2000.  Times Square popper.  Yeah, yeah.  This was just the subway station that because I had to take the subway station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the suburbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I lived in Washington Square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had to avoid back in the day, Elmos every day.  I had to dodge them.  Oh, the Elmos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't know where the Elmos is.  Actually, you lived in Washington Square?  I'm jealous.  I love the village.  That is beautiful.  That's a great place.  It was nice.  I'm so jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I could ever afford to do so again, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man, if I could get Lisa to do it, I would do that in a minute.  I love it.  Google is shutting down both iOS and Android shopping apps.  Add another Google app to the graveyard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which has also a little importance here.  Even though the shopping will continue, Europe's first big antitrust effort against Google  was shopping.  I always made fun of it because Google's failed at shopping every time they tried it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is proof positive.  You still can go to shopping.google.com.  But yeah, the apps are bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  So are, as long as we're doing the Google graveyard.  We might have a new, we need a new bumper.  The Google graveyard.  Google's shutting down Play Movies and TV, the app on Roku and LG, Samsung and Vizio TVs in June.  I don't get this.  They were going to push it to YouTube instead.  I guess you could buy it on YouTube instead.  But it's not that Play Movies and TVs are going away.  They're just not going to have an app for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which kind of sucks.  But it's bizarre.  It's bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're also killing Feedburner, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it is.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't, don't quote me on that.  Wait, a few weeks ago we joked that we couldn't believe Feedburner was still around and Ruth  hadn't found it yet.  It's our fault.  We're sorry Feedburner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it's dead, it's because we let them know it still exists.  Here's what happens.  Google announced.  Google said it's moving Feedburner to new infrastructure, but it's also deprecating  its email subscription service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so it's got one foot in the grave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  So there you go.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google, the company that kills things.  The Google I.O. announcement, of course, as always is the case, was a great puzzle,  which you can still, I think you could still do.  Oh, maybe not.  Maybe they've taken it away.  They had a link on Sunday.  It was really fun.  Punch cards and all that stuff.  I hope you did it.  Click the dot though, because now there's a breakout game.  Oh, remember breakout?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  This was a good game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You used to be able to play that on our TI-82 calculators.  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's about the simplest game ever, which Google's demonstrating now.  Where's Mr. Wozniak?  Donk.  Yes, that's right.  Oh boy.  That's a memory.  And I'm impressed that you knew that.  That's when Steve Wozniak finally realized Steve Jobs was not his friend.  Steve Jobs was offered by Atari $5,000 to write a breakout game.  He couldn't code, so he went to his friend Steve Wozniak to write it and told him, yes,  Atari is going to pay us, I don't remember what it was, like $500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he kept the difference.  Yeah, and everybody loves this company.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because Woz for a long time would never say anything bad about Steve Jobs,  but then when he found that out, it was like, boy, I ought to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he didn't know for the longest.  You son of a gun.  You talk about a genuinely nice person.  That's a genuinely...  Woz.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a sweetheart.  He's still playing breakout.  Google Pay Spring Challenge offers you a $30 reward for using the new Google Pay app.  Now, how much would you pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I got that email and I'm like, what are they talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of complicated.  You got to get five stamps during the Spring Challenge to get $30 deposited into your Google  Pay balance.  In other words, to get these stamps, you have to do things like tap to pay at a business  or send payments to a friend, that kind of stuff.  Some actions can only earn stamps once a day.  Others can do it multiple times a day.  You may also see a trivia pop-up from time to time as a chance to earn stamps.  And of course, sharing invites to Google Pay can also...  If you've got to pay people to use your app.  That's pretty pathetic.  But if you want 30 bucks in Google credit, that's a way to do it.  Did you want those oh-so-orange pixel buds?  No, nobody did.  Wait a minute, why?  Nobody did.  They don't work.  Yeah.  A, they don't work.  B, they're ugly.  They're not ugly now.  Hold on.  You don't think that, oh, Clemson Orange.  Maybe I'm...  I did like the color.  It kind of matches with my skin tone.  Yeah, it's orange, Jeff.  Or you could get the lime green ones for when you're not feeling too well.  So, they've been discontinued.  So, I'm sorry if you wanted them.  And then somebody sneakily deleted whatever was the next...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was the next change log.  Somebody said this is the next one.  He actually sneakily promoted it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It got deleted, so that's the Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is that where it went?  Did Jason move?  Oh, I'm sorry, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Project Chip was in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He must have moved it from where I put it in the real section of the show.  But Jason was like, Stacey, your smart home love doesn't count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's good.  It was already in there.  Look at how he's making notes.  You promoted it through a green box.  It was a green box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before the show, Jeff Jarvis was telling us that the world famous philosopher, Stacombs,  had tweeted a little takedown of world famous physicist, Neil deGrasse Tyson.  You want to share the story with us, Mr. Stacombs?  No, you go ahead.  All right.  I'll show you the original tweet from Neil deGrasse Tyson.  The good thing, he said, about science is that it's true, whether or not you believe in it.  To which Stacombs, yes, I'm talking Stacombs, the frozen meat product sandwich,  to which Stacombs tweets,  The irony of Neil's tweet is that by framing science itself as true,  he's influencing people to be more skeptical of it in the time of unprecedented misinformation.  Science is an ever refining process to find truth, not a dogma.  No matter his intent, this message is not helpful.  Okay.  Wow.  By the way, epistemological Twitter, man.  Just to prove that Stacombs is a actual frozen meat product sandwich,  it didn't use punctuation or the caps key.  Well, it used a little punctuation, but not all of it.  It's weird.  Sometimes there's a period, sometimes not.  You decide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's quotations there.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand why they didn't bother with some stuff.  Not only are there quotes, there's smart quotes.  They're actually smart quotes.  It's not even just your shift key.  They got the any quote and the outy quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like, I've interviewed Stacombs, otherwise known as Nathan Alavak.  He's a very nice and very smart guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He also then said, log off, bro, to Neil deGrasse Tyson,  who is not as beloved as he used to be, let's face it.  Jaden C responded based and epistemologically sound.  And Jonathan said, thank you.  The scientific method, by the way, he doesn't use caps either.  The scientific method should never be afraid of challenger skepticism.  And then Seamus Blackley says, keep rolling, my brother.  Meanwhile, more tweets.  Twin sisters reunited at 92 after vaccinations.  Toast first dinner out with scotch and water.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why did Twitter think that was relevant?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, by the way, by the way, I had so so so to me, to you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just speaking for me, just speaking for steak, proper cheesesteak should have cheese and steak and grilled onions.  No peppers.  Wrong.  No mushrooms.  No mushrooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to have the mushrooms and peppers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to have the mushrooms.  And you know what?  I'll go one further.  One further.  Little bit of ranch dressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, that's definitely right.  You're done.  You're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Controversial.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where can you get ranch dressing in a cheesesteak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, come on, Miss Stacy.  I was with you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you are never making fun of my Cacio e Pepe again.  Never.  You have revealed yourself.  I never make fun of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just worry that you're going to die.  I love Cacio e Pepe.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just in moderation is what she's saying.  So you're right.  According to the stayathomechef.com, the Philly cheesesteak, traditional Philly cheesesteak,  is thinly sliced ribeye, cheese, onions, and a delicious hoagie roll.  Period.  Period.  Full stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now you can add your own mustard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you ever had a cheesesteak from Pat or Gino's?  Oh, yeah.  Which do you prefer?  Are you a Pat's guy or a Gino's guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I forget.  That's a fight.  I'm a New Yorker.  I don't care about Philly fights.  That's the conflation.  And of course it has to be an Amoroso roll or you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing.  I have had, I can't remember which I had, but when we were in Philly I said we got to  have, we're at whatever it was, Pat's, I think it was Pat's, we got to have a cheesesteak.  I love cheesesteaks, but I confess I might sometimes have peppers on my cheesesteak.  Not mushrooms.  Definitely not ranch.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  No, no, no.  Any other stories we want to talk about?  Coinbase, 102B valuation.  102 billion bitcoins.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now that would be something.  You buy the stock with bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you put this in from the intelligence or confessions of an overnight millionaire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of interesting because it's, as somebody said, it's a real white story.  Now we don't know who it is.  It's anonymous, but it's, oh, I just happened to make $6 million.  Oh gosh, I don't know what I'll do with this.  And what my response was that it's the best justification I've seen for taxation ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it really scares you that you made a lot of money in your IPO, give it to the government.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's not wrong.  They'll make good use of it.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I'm never going to read that article ever.  It irritated me.  They make me mad, those articles.  Yeah, it made me mad.  Yeah.  I'm really rich.  And man, it's just not as easy as you think it might be.  Screw you, buddy.  Yeah.  The heck with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's how they get clicks.  You could give it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm just going to devil's advocate here since I'm on a roll with my ranch.  There are notable issues with people who become wealthy overnight, like lottery winners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I recognize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But don't go complaining about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Stacey, the chat room has a question for you.  If you like ranch, do you like crunch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, I looked that up and that almost caused me to vomit into my mouth.  That is disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It combines, show this, John, the delicious taste of classic ketchup plus ranch.  This is why there's a ketchup shortage because they used it for that crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like cocktail sauce, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that is not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, cocktail sauce is horseradish and ketchup, but that is delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love horseradish and ketchup.  Yeah, horseradish, that's right.  That's right.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm like, hold on now.  We cannot be disparaging the cocktail sauce.  That's Thousand Island Dressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what happens.  Thousand Island Dressing is the two of them plus relish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  The thing about ranch is the ranch you buy in a bottle...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, there's this place here, this restaurant.  Yeah.  They make their own.  It's called Hitchcock and they make their own ranch.  Yeah.  And they actually sell it.  That's how good it is.  Like, I will buy their ranch to put on my cheese sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  There's a guy I know.  He's got this TikTok channel where he makes his own ranch dressing and homemade and shows  you how to make it.  It's fucking garbage.  I don't know why, but it always is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Restaurant ranch is way better.  So for this, it's equal parts mayonnaise.  Too bad his dad can't play the sound well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is he a sideline?  That's what he sounds like.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If dad still had his Chromebook there, it'd be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you talking about?  Oh man.  We're going to fit...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The editors will fix this in post.  ...and use canned artichoke hearts and dry them off and coat them with flour in a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bag.  For the batter, come on.  I think it's better if he sounds like that, to be honest with you.  This guy is cooking.  He made...  He belated...  This is a TikTok fried pickles and artichoke hearts with homemade ranch dressing.  He also says, I'm proclaiming Hidden Valley Ranch as my number one TikTok enemy.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like fried foods with ranch.  Oh, look at that.  That does look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did he just eat that entire...  He ate a fried pickle with ranch.  That's probably what gave him COVID.  I don't know, but...  So this takes us back to the story about...  See, I think you actually love TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacey, where should I look for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love this story.  I'm going to look for that.  I'm going to look for that.  I'm going to look for that.  I'm going to look for that.  I'm going to look for that.  I'm going to look for that.  I'm going to look for that.  Wait, what?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The TikTok thing?  I just think it's better when you say it.  Oh, the line number.  I'm sorry.  I didn't pay attention to the line.  I just ignore them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Am I spending too much time on TikTok?  Asks Vox.  It's the world's most delightful and powerful dissociation machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So she argues here, Rebecca Jennings, that it is a wellness app in and of itself because  it distracts you and takes you away and is full of delight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends on your algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All I know is if you scroll long enough on TikTok, they actually put up a TikTok that  says go to bed.  And I keep hitting that and I keep on scrolling.  Just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, if you do me a favor, look up Laufe, L-A-U-F-E-Y on TikTok.  This young woman amazes me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, in this article, I finally found out that you have to scroll for more than  an hour to get that to happen.  To get that.  L-A-U on TikTok?  Yeah, on TikTok.  L-A-U-F-E-Y.  You're just doing that to give me a hard time on my sound because now I can't listen.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  I forgot.  Oh, Jesus.  L-A-U-F-Y?  F-E-Y.  F-E-Y.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think she's a college student.  Her voice is like from 19 to the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll never know, will we?  Because Leo has...  We'll never know because you messed it up.  All right.  Let me just go on the command line real quick.  You made me do it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Poor Stacey is never going to eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to take Leo five hours to fix this.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to take a break while I edit my con files.  In a moment, we're going to have some pics.  What do you think?  How about that?  Pics of the week coming up.  I'm going to do Joe in the chat room saying, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if one of us played the audio and you just don't get the video with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can fix it.  Latency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now you're questioning his geek manhood, Stacey.  I can fix it.  I know, but you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, people get hungry, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  In fact, it's time for the pics of the week and let's kick it off with Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because this is not a democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see, I tried.  I will tell you, Jeff, that she does have a lovely voice.  She's an amazing voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's like a crooner.  I'll play it later.  I just have to do some editing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey.  Your pic of the week.  Your thing.  You showed us before the show some sort of boxy thing.  Wait, what?  It's you.  Pic of the week time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I know that.  I'm just like a boxy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was it?  Oh no, you showed us the stickers.  That's right.  Nevermind.  Oh, I was like, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's what it was.  I'm sorry.  My memory is going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's okay.  You had a COVID shot.  I had the COVID shot.  That's going to make you feel funny.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm giving you all a book of the week.  It's actually a book and audio book combined.  I love a woman named Amber Ruffin.  She cracks me up.  I think she is delightful.  I want to be her best friend.  This has nothing to do with tech.  She has a book out and I'm going to tell you the actual name of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She just got a new show too not too long ago.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  You'll never believe what happened to Lacey.  Crazy stories about racism.  She's a comedian.  She's on Seth Meyers show.  She has a segment called Amber Says What.  Just Google it.  You'll crack up or not.  Maybe you won't.  The book is basically her and her sister Lacey who lives in Omaha, Nebraska.  Lacey experiences racism all the time.  Some of these stories and Amber because she's a comedian, it's funny, but it's also freaking  tragic.  Just hearing this, it is like a constant drip drab.  If you're a person who is like, I make fun of microaggressions because I know lots of  people who are like, I don't understand this.  Just do us all a favor and just read the book or listen to it.  I have it on audio tape.  It's funny, but there are also images in the book.  If you want the book, do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where is the podcast?  Because I'd love to take a listen to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know what the name is?  The podcast.  No, it's not a podcast.  It's a show on Peacock.  Oh, it's a show on Peacock.  It's a late night show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you go to YouTube, you can see her.  What's her name again?  You can see bits from her show.  Amber Ruffin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  R-U-F-F-I-U.  I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amber says what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's her thing on Seth Meyers show and then she has her own show on Peacock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about Texas?  Just don't give a hoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We lifted the mask mandate and allowed businesses to reopen at 100% capacity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You might ask, why would they do such a thing when scientists are against it?  When doctors or nurses are begging us to hold on to the solution.  I think we're going to have to beep her answer.  Simple.  Because Texas rocks!  I took one red governor to decree.  He cares about Texas and he'll set us free.  And people have to die for my liberty.  Then my governor says so be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's been too long, I've had enough.  I won't wear a mask because I don't give a fuck.  You can think I'm wrong, you can kiss my butt.  It's time to celebrate our freedom.  I'm going to be a man.  I'm going to be a man.  I'm going to be a man.  I'm going to be a man.  I'm going to be a man.  I'm going to be a man.  I'm going to be a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm going to be a man.  I'm going to be a man.  I'm going to be a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So would you as a former resident of Texas endorse this philosophy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would.  No, I endorse her making fun of it, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was hoping the chorus would be sucking up.  That's awesome.  And who is the TikTok, because I want to try that again.  TikTok.com.  Because look, Amber said it normal, right?  L-A-U-F-E-Y?  Yes, L-A-U-F-E-Y.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  L-A-U-F-E-Y.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you've got it wrong.  L-A-U.  Google.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Use the thing called Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here it is.  I see it now.  Pronounced Lavey.  So go down.  No, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So go down.  Which one do you want to hear?  That one where your cursor is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This one?  It's really kind of sad.  I love my Monday moments.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to, one more thing I have to do.  I did fix it, but I've got a, oh no, it is coming out.  That's what it sounds like.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, we hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I told you she was a crooner.  Yes, she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you go through TikTok and you get these moments of joy like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see great stuff.  Okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's enough.  Stop.  That's all.  That's enough.  Jeff, your number of the week.  Oh, okay.  Oh right.  Oh shit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not.  Oh shoot.  Sorry, John.  Well, we could, first I want to plug Neerit, our friend Neerit Weisblatt who was on the  show and Stacey left us alone.  Yes, yes.  She did, because her book is so expensive, she did an essay summarizing it and it's in  tech dirt.  They were nice enough to run it.  So you can go to tech dirt and see her piece on how Donald Trump caused the tech lash.  But that's not my number.  Nor is it that one out of 11 stores are expected to close in the next five years.  Nor is it that Larry and Sergey have joined the hundred billion dollar club.  I want to get mad about how Americans rate states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can all go F yourselves, America.  Jersey is not 48.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is Washington number one?  Is this that survey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's rating the states?  Who's doing the reading?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know, but whoever they are, they're a bunch of dorks.  We should mention that's where Butz's name lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What?  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jersey 48.  Is there a link?  Is there a link?  It's more like 46, Mr. Jarvis.  Is there a link?  It's more like 46.  There are how many states?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yo, what?  There's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is some goat.  What's the number one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is from YouGov.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you're being a smart ass too, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouGov.com based...  The respondents, we don't know who, were asked to choose the better of two states from a  list of 50.  Oh, it was like a head to head matchup.  Yeah.  And Washington sees it.  Okay.  Hawaii number one, then Colorado, Virginia, Nevada, North Carolina.  That's where you're from, Ant.  North Cackalacki.  North Cack.  Florida, Arizona, New York.  Florida's number one.  What does that take?  Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Florida, Phil Williams.  Florida, Phil with Florida mans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Florida's quite a nice state.  It's a nice state.  I like Florida.  Georgia, Texas, Maine, California, Alaska, and then way down on the other side, the worst  place in the world, Washington DC, then Alabama, Mississippi, and 48, New Jersey.  New Jersey's worse than 47 other states, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What New Jersey has to say to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rhode Island smack dab in the middle, number 25.  That's where I grew up.  South Cackalacki strangely is much lower than North Cackalacki.  Why would that be, Ant?  You were born in South Cackalacki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to defend it?  Yeah, and they are definitely two different states.  I can attest to that.  That's why you moved north.  Definitely two different states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eh, not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  They're one and the same, but they're definitely two different states.  Two different states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  What do you, I'm sorry, TikTok keeps playing.  I'm trying to stop it.  Well, now that you finally got this working, I can't stop playing TikTok.  I'm actually trying to find my favorite TikTok singer, who is an Israeli woman who has an  amazing voice and I don't remember her handle, unfortunately.  So I'll see if I can find her.  Go ahead, Ant, with your pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I got a couple.  The first one is as I said, I wrote on the line there.  I'm not against guns, but Pat Barnes sums it up quite nicely.  Pat Barnes is a cartoonist or illustrator.  If you go to that link, kegel.com.  It's a pretty topical image Teddy Scott there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you say you are not against guns.  So why would you promote this anti-gun cartoon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, because of the context of what's recently happened.  Oh, yes.  This past Sunday with Dante, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not that you're against guns, it's you're against people getting shot by guns, which  I am against as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The police officer, in quotes, accidentally shot Dante, right?  Because he thought he was getting his taser and he killed him.  She has since resigned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, if you watch the video, she goes, oh my God, I shot him.  She clearly didn't expect it to have a bullet in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've since resigned.  I believe there is now charges of second degree manslaughter.  That's such a sad story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So close, of course, to where George Floyd was murdered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Which that trial was going on at the same time when this happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The cartoon shows an officer angry with his gun pulled on, of course, a black driver with  a little pine tree air freshener.  The officer is saying, I'm worried that air freshener might be obstructing your visibility.  Meanwhile, a guy with four guns in his rack trying to pick up drives on by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And being from South Cac and North Cac, I saw that image all the time.  These gun racks, it's just a normal kind of thing to see there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But to be fair, gun racks don't usually obstruct your visibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't obstruct your front, forward visibility.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't look over your shoulder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your rear view mirror is kind of occluded by guns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  That's how I like it.  But now I'm not against guns because I remember having a nice heated discussion with a bunch  of the people in the Twitterverse about taking my kids, the hardheads, to a gun range back  when they were really, really young.  People were calling me a horrible parent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what you should do.  Teach them about guns.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted them to see the power of a firearm and to be able to respect it.  They enjoyed it.  The whole family had a good time, but they learned this is real stuff.  This isn't Call of Duty.  They had spots and whatnot.  I did the same thing with Henry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We went to a rifle range with .22s.  They weren't big old guns.  We had a South African drill instructor who was great.  If you pointed your gun anywhere but where it was supposed to be pointed, you don't  want to hear about it.  He was fabulous.  A former South African commando.  You could tell how scary he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My kids will never, ever forget that.  They still talk about that.  Good.  I did something right there at least.  With all of that said, I also put in there that peaceful and hopeful.  It's just an image from the peaceful protest from last year.  Seeing the image from Mr. Barnes just made me think about the protest that the family  and I, we all attended last year.  There you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just how peaceful it was.  That's one of the hard heads to your left.  That's Ant in the middle with the backpack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember the experience in that.  We were all warm on hand side because we never assumed it would be such a peaceful event.  It's beautiful, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  People are on their knees, their hands up in many cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Had a police escort and everything.  It was great.  Welcome to Northern California.  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember your sign said, No Peace, KNOW Peace.  KNOW Justice.  That's right.  No Justice, No Peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No Justice, No Peace.  And lastly, this is for you Mr. Jarvis.  The reason I recently fired up TikTok.  I don't know if that was playable.  You got the bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You like musicals.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Real Houseplants of Sonoma County.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I got to listen to this.  Oh my gosh.  Are these?  Is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is Queen Pruitt.  I was going to say, is this Queen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does she make these?  Where does she get these?  These are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's been hand painting those.  She makes them?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  They're beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great.  I told her, launch a TikTok page.  I want them.  I will follow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's got a customer.  Lisa and I would love one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said I'll follow it and try to boost your signal.  And of course now I'm on TikTok and I absolutely hate it.  Oh, they are beautiful.  Yeah.  She's gotten a couple orders this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's been selling out right now.  Phoebs JP14.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's repeat that again so people get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Phoebs, P-H-E-E-B-S, JP14.  And I love The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills music to go along with it.  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great.  She's been working pretty hard on that.  It's been part of her, I guess you can say mental peace, you know, during all the craziness  going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I watched it, I was like, that's why he was so excited about the cheap grow light.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got it.  She's got to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is clearly, I love this because it's clearly art.  It's therapeutic for her.  But it's also therapeutic.  Yeah.  Painting like this.  And it's fun.  Yeah.  Where did she get the pots?  I want that.  Those pots are hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, she's ordering them from wherever.  I'm not sure where she's getting them from, but she strips them down and she's got all  of these paints everywhere.  How fun.  In the garage.  Well, Phoebe's a very talented nail artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's done my nails.  So she has already the fine hand and the line and all that stuff.  This is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I told her I'd give her some credit on that because I can't do that.  But talking about TikTok, I never liked it because when I go to it, this is the first  stuff I see is that and then whatever this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of women in bikinis dancing and that bothers me too.  I kind of agree.  I don't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It goes from that and then it goes from all of the racism stuff.  And it's just not a great experience.  You're getting racist stuff.  People arguing against racism and people going back and forth about racism.  One person saying that's not racist.  And I keep scrolling.  I remember when I set it up, I said that my interests are photography.  That's all that I tapped.  And I get all of this stuff.  I don't blame you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How the hell does that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I created my account and I put in some old videos that I've done just to try to see if  it helped the signal and not so much because that's still some stuff that I've done previously.  And it just ain't working.  I only jumped on there because of her just to try to help boost her signal.  I'm proud of her and she's doing her thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for you.  Good for you, Phoebe.  We love those.  I will buy some.  I will buy some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That will definitely excite her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really cool.  Oh, here's the...  Okay, I'll play one more since now I can get it working.  This is who you should follow, Jeff, if you like singing on TikTok.  Her name is Liel Barzi or Barzad.  And she just sings acapella.  And I think she's a very beautiful singer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I can look you in the eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't see the hook.  Just like an angel.  Your skin makes me...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this one's not acapella.  Somebody's playing the guitar in the background.  That's fun.  That's really good.  But most of her stuff is acapella and she's kind of incredible.  I don't think she's a professional.  Hey guys, it's raining.  Oh, you can't go wrong with a little Carpenter's music, can you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're dating ourselves, perhaps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Hey, it's a rainy day and a Wednesday.  And it's time for me to say goodbye to our beautiful panel here.  Thank you very much, Stacey Higginbotham.  Join her at stacey on iot.com and make sure you sign up for a free newsletter.  Check out the events.  There's always something going on at Stacey on iot.  And of course the fabulous podcast.  Oh, wow.  Now we're making candy.  I'm sorry.  The TikTok just never ends, does it?  Stacey on iot.com and of course the iot podcast with Kevin Toffle.  I can't stop watching this guy at Logan's Candies.  He just keeps making candy.  Oh, stop, stop, stop.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  You know who he is.  He is the director of the Townite Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Craig Newmark  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Frank Sinatra called him a bum, former TV guy critic.  Thank you, Mr. J. Buzzmachine.com for his blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're not going to tell us what this announcement is you teased everybody for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to be Sunday, I'll tell you.  Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Twit gets the announcement instead of Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The reason I was going to look, there's technical things we've got to figure out and solve.  There's been some delays and I don't want to launch it until it's really ready to go.  So it's my new TikTok sing-along channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not supposed to say it yet, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know what it is.  It's Twit the Musical starring Ant Pruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a host of Hands On Photography, twit.tv slash hop.  And he's just a smiling face around the studio.  We love having you here.  I saw you this morning.  It was great to see you.  I didn't say hi because COVID, man.  COVID, I kept moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do it distance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Six hundred something episodes are there going all the way back to the earliest days of this  week in Google more than 10 years ago.

There's also a plain old RSS feed or you can click on your favorite podcast client and  iTunes or Google podcasts or pocket cast etc etc.  If your favorite podcast client allows reviews please give us a five star review for all  the singing.  We would appreciate that.  If you are listening to a download or watching a download and you still want to interact  we have forums at www.twit.community.  They're great.  Love them.
