Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi.  Good to see you.  Good to be here.  Good to see you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yay.  Yay.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis, who is at the post office.  Believe it or not.  Well, he's a little more than the post office.  He's at the world headquarters of the post office.  At the office of the inspector general.  Wow.  I love, that's a great title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it great?  It sounds something like a...  I asked today, do they call him general?  They said no.  Hello Gilbert and Sullivan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am the very model of a modern inspector general.  Jeff is a blogger at blogmaschine.com, tenured professor of journalism at the City University  of New York.  Your tax dollars at work.  Not mine, just yours.  And the author of this fine book, What the Hell Would Google Do Now?  What...  Maybe you should do a sequel, What Should Google Do?  That'd be fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's actually working on a new book about public and private parts.  It's called Public Parts.  Also joining us, we always love having him on the show, Kevin Purdy.  Hello.  Who is a blogger at Lifehacker and also...  What's your title at Lifehacker?  I am a contributing editor.  So that's more than a blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Say more than a blogger.  That's what all those complex tax documents mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's also the author of The Complete Guide to Google Android at completeandroidguide.com.  It's a real book too though, not just a web book, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  Paper, ebook, ePub and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In every form.  But a true expert on Android, which is a good thing because we always talk a lot about Android.  We're Android fans here at the old show.  We are running a little late today because there was a big event at Facebook headquarters.  Their Facebook mobile event.  I'll summarize and then you guys can talk.  First of all, just a personal note.  Mark Zuckerberg let it off.  He's lately been taking the mic more and more with Facebook events and actually showed himself  really well.  I thought he was articulate.  He came off as smart, funny and actually got off a good one because at the end of the Q&A,  he said, how come you don't have a mobile app for the iPad?  And he said, iPad's not mobile.  Really kind of a dismissive tone.  It's not mobile.  I'm sorry.  No, it's not.  I thought he really came off very well.  He introduced, he talked a little bit about the fact that mobile has become bigger and  bigger for the Facebook platform.  200 million mobile users this year, up from 65 million a year ago.  He mentioned that they're going to be on every platform.  Of course, they're already on Android and iPhone, but Windows Mobile 7, Blackberry,  Nokia and he also really underscored the mobile web saying, you know, a lot of these phones  use browsers and we're there too.  I'm sure that's his solution for the iPad.  And announced new versions of the Facebook application, the official Facebook application  for both iPhone and Android.  The Android one is out now, 1.4 and has added places.  So it's got parity with the iPhone.  It's added groups.  And I imagine somewhere buried in there are some of the other features they announced.  They had three big initiatives they announced.  One is a single sign on.  They already have Facebook Connect on the web.  As you browse around, you want to log into many sites, you just press the Facebook Connect  button and use your Facebook credentials to log into the site to create an account.  Now that'll be available on mobile.  They're calling it a single sign on.  He also they also announced a change to the places API, the location API.  Previously I didn't know this.  It was only readable.  But now applications and everybody's apparently on board with this, including Foursquare,  Gowalla, Looped and Yelp, the big location players, all can write to the Facebook API.  So in the past, you know, you can I in fact, this is how I do it.  I log into Foursquare.  And because I use the Foursquare application on Facebook, it automatically adds that to  my stream.  But it doesn't update my location on Facebook.  It doesn't integrate very tightly.  Now it will.  Now they have parity with Facebook itself in terms of location logs, logins.  And that ties to a new Facebook platform, one which, by the way, Mark Zuckerberg says  we're not going to make any money on, which surprised me.  Phenomenal.  Called Deals.  And the idea of Deals is very much like Foursquare.  Yelp just added the same thing, which is when you check in to a location, the owner of the  location can offer you a deal.  And there's actually kind of a nice little side effect to the way Facebook does its places  where you could check in other people.  One of the deals could be, for instance, check in with three of your friends and you all  get a free cup of coffee.  So really some real potential to monetize this.  And yet Mark says, no, we just want to build a platform.  We're not going to make any money on that.  That surprised you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you're not getting a cut at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No cut at all, he said.  And now the Foursquare gets a cut?  Foursquare probably gets a cut.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Nobody said.  And yes, Jeff, to answer your question, they can make money on it because they are certainly  going to incur it.  You know, somebody said, well, how will you know if there's an offer?  And there's several ways.  One is the store can buy an ad that'll show up.  The other way is if your friend takes advantage of the offer, it shows up in their stream,  which could show up in your livestream.  And the third is the one you'd expect, which is if you check in or you're to that place,  it will then pop up.  They said they're very careful.  They do not want to start pushing ads at you due to the proximity of the place, which I  think that would be a concern for everybody if all of a sudden you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be neat to be able to say, oh, here I am with them all.  Any deals around me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you can do that, Jeff.  That was the implication.  So that you could say, I'm here.  What's around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you ask.  But you have to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can't push it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So isn't it true also, Leo, that they provided a tool so that if I'm Jeff's Cupcake Store,  I can just put a deal up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Now, right now it's only available to people who are their beta partners.  And they have a number of beta partners.  But the implication is...  Chipotle!  I'm going to get Chipotle deals!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, baby!  Woohoo!  Finally!  I can't wait for those Applebee deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And presumably eventually everybody can do it, as they can with Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Olive Garden!  Breadsticks for all!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Jeff is a known Chipotle lover, so his excitement is especially...  Oh, it's not specious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought he was mocking me.  Oh, no, no!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want three block, man.  He shows up early to avoid the line.  Wait a minute.  It should be Jarvis special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go to the Jeff Jarvis early bird special at Chipotle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm mad that I go to this one so often.  I'm not married yet.  I should at least be on the friggin' City Council.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they need.  They need a host of titles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could be the vice mayor.  I need to be parks and director at my nearby Chipotle.  That's what I want to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it about Chipotle...  I'm sorry, I hate to digress here, but what is it about Chipotle that you like so much?  I love Chipotle.  Oh, you too?  Yeah.  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could believe that because of Jeff, because he's in New York where you probably can't  get a good burrito.  But you're in freaking San Diego.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's true.  San Diego, which has some of the best burritos in the country, 20 minutes from the Mexican  border, I still do go to Chipotle.  There's the whole vibe.  The food's really good and it's affordable.  Yeah, it's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's popular here for sure.  I've never been to a Chipotle.  Oh, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to have to fix that.  Are you un-American?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we have Chipotles here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's one nearby.  Down in San Rafael I could go.  Maybe we'll do a field trip.  You got to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to go.  I get the vegetarian bowl, a little bit of rice.  A lot of black beans.  And then you pick which salsa you want and they get cheese and guac.  And I'm a very happy guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the salsa and the guac are really good.  Two best indicators of a good Mexican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Burritos are just delivery mechanisms for guacamole really.  Absolutely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And sour cream if you really want to get crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just an API to get a guacamole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a guacamole platform.  It is.  A guacamole platform.  And now to bring us back, that's what this is all about for Facebook.  And very clearly now they're saying we're the platform.  When you log in, you log in with Facebook.  When you check in, you check in with Facebook.  Wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Explain that to me.  So if I log into the Facebook app on my phone, I've now logged into other apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  And you see this already with Facebook Connect.  When you go to Yelp and it says you want to log in or press the button.  What's the difference?  It's exactly the same.  It's just never been available on mobile.  Mobile, remember mobile doesn't...  Oh, I see.  Yeah, mobile doesn't use the same...  It's not using, unless you're using the browser, it's not using a computer.  It's not using HTTP.  So these mobile apps communicate differently with Facebook and with each other.  So all it's...  I don't know.  Maybe you can help me with this, Gina or Kevin, because you guys might know better, but it  sounds like they've provided essentially an API for using Facebook Connect, but not over  HTTP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm a little confused too, because on Android, and maybe Gina can clarify, it sounds like  mostly because on Android, Twitter clients, Foursquare, whatever app you're using, usually  you set up your username and password once in the settings and then you're done until  you uninstall it.  So it sounds like maybe they're using Facebook Connect to let you log into web apps, I'm  assuming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  I think this is...  Well, it's functionally the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm honestly not sure.  I was also going to ask you guys about that.  Well, I think it's like...  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think it's like OpenID.  So if you go to use an app, you could log in with your native password and log in for  that app.  Or some apps will now start presenting.  I haven't seen any yet, but I'll look around tonight presenting just as they do on the  web or use Facebook.  And then if...  Now, this is the question.  If you've already authenticated with Facebook, is that sufficient?  Probably it is.  Maybe they renew it every few weeks, whatever.  The way they showed it on the screen at the event is it pulls up that kind of...  You've seen it all.  We've all seen it before.  Connect with Facebook and you have to press an allow, don't allow.  It shows you what permissions.  They say that the permission...  Now, this is very interesting and this is again, this is the platformization of Facebook.  Your Facebook permissions now apply to your transactions with this third party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that does make it into your kind of publicness tool.  Oh yeah.  So Facebook is not...  Facebook, I think from the beginning, should have branded itself as a sharing tool.  And so now you have the rules of your sharing.  That's very cool.  Isn't that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I think...  I can't find any real problems with this except maybe the potential security issue.  The problem with a single sign-on is potentially, if it's not implemented properly, I think  if you lose your password, you're screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, if you're signed in in a web browser on a desktop now to Facebook and you've also  connected to other accounts, if you open another tab and go to one of those other web apps that  you have connected, you're in.  Yeah, there's no extra step.  I think they're saying you just don't want to have to keep typing your passwords in on  your mobile phone, not packing away on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't and iPhone users don't either, do they?  I mean, the apps that you've installed keep your username and password.  I mean, unless you want to be logged out all the time or something.  Like for Mint.com, I don't stay logged in, but the apps are usually just preloaded and  that's why you use apps, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, typing in usernames and passwords on a mobile website is a pain in the rear  and they demonstrated that during the presentation.  But most apps usually just hold your login information until you need to enter it again  after X months or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We all install so many new apps.  Maybe it's just, you know, that's because of the pain in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, for you, Leo, it does make total sense.  Yeah.  And for anyone who's trying out a lot of apps.  Yeah, I guess if I...  For using an app for the first time, it would be pretty easy to just hit the blue Facebook  Connect and go from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I think...  If you're building an app, guys, Gina, developer lady, you build this into your app now because  it'd just be foolish not to, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just a super easy way to sign in, right?  You don't want people to have to sign in, go through the painful process of the email,  the name and that.  So it is a super easy way to sign in.  So yeah, if your audience is on Facebook, and most likely they are because who isn't,  then it makes sense to do this for an app developer for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  They do have, it turns out, a Facebook Connect for iPhone and Android.  So this is not that.  This is in addition to that.  So it is for, you know, the first time you log into an app, the partners that they announced  with were Zynga, Groupon, Looped, Scavenger, which is actually kind of a cool location-based  play that hasn't gotten a lot of attention but deserves it, Yelp, Flickster and Booyah.  I like the name.  What is Booyah?  I don't know.  No idea.  Yeah.  So I guess it's bringing Facebook Connect, the web style Facebook Connect, to standalone  apps.  And I imagine, of course, once you've got that connection between the app and Facebook,  there's all sorts of stuff going on now back and forth between it and Facebook.  You can now like and do other stuff.  And presumably, I guess the real question, and the thing that will really upset users  is if all of a sudden more and more of your activity outside of Facebook is streamed to  your Facebook activity stream.  I mean, my activity streams are already jammed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where the algorithm comes in though.  That's where it's going to not put stuff in there.  The essence of the newsfeed algorithm is that it's selective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I always watch the live algorithm, which is not selective.  It's just whatever's happening.  But I think increasingly people are going to say, no, I will watch the selected one.  And I guess that's based on the number of likes and comments.  So if you just get your newsfeed, you don't see everything.  You just see the things that people are interacting with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My selfish nightmare is that I'll tell my wife, you know, oh, having leftovers for lunch.  And then she sees, Kevin picked up a coupon at Chipotle.  And then she'll realize my sham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If that's all you're worried about, Kevin, I think you're going to be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I'm having lunch at the chicken ranch, that might be another problem entirely.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And like Justin, hopefully the algorithm will be smart enough to not show my friends that.  My friends shouldn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As Eric Schmidt so wisely said, if you're not doing anything you're ashamed of, there's  nothing to worry about, is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shame.  Shame.  Delicious shame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google kills shame.  There is no more shame.  It's dead now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a couple of things they didn't mention and in fact looked like they actively prevented  journalists and stream viewers from asking.  One was this fire sheep issue, which is this really significant security issue.  I installed it on my Firefox.  It's a plug-in from codebutler.com that you install on your Firefox.  And what it does is it traps these tokens, these cookies that Facebook sends.  When you go from page to page on Facebook, it has to authenticate you at each page because  a browser doesn't know that you're the same person or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Every web app does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So instead of saying, well, what's the login?  What's the login?  Which would be incredibly annoying.  The first time you log into Facebook, it sends you a cookie, which is an identifying token  that has a limited, has an expiration date, usually just the session.  And then from now on, from page to page, the page just says, well, what's the token?  And you say, swordfish.  And it says, okay, it's you.  It's always been possible using hacker tools like Kain and Able to capture that token in  an open access spot.  Fire Sheep just makes it really easy.  So I put it on my laptop.  I go to my local coffee shop.  I see a list and pictures even of everybody who's on Facebook, Yelp, even Google, not  Google Mail because it uses HTTPS, but the rest of Google.  I can see their pictures from those sites.  I can double click them.  So if I see Gina, oh, there's Gina Trapani.  Oh, she's cute.  I double click her.  And their Facebook page, I can leave stuff as her all without a password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I actually reached out to Fast Company directly to get their statement on this, because  I wrote a story about Fire Sheep for Fast Company.  And they this is exactly what they told me.  They said, we've been making progress testing SSL across Facebook and hope to provide it  as an option in the coming months.  As always, we advise people to use caution when sending or receiving information over  unsecured Wi-Fi networks.  Check out the Facebook security page.  FTC is on got online website, blah, blah.  Be careful about the information you access or send from a public wireless network to  be on the safe side.  Assume that other people can access any information you see or send over a wireless network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of missing the boat because that's not what's that's not merely what's happening  here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it is.  And then he says, you know, additional points, Facebook logins are always encrypted.  We knew that we offer session control feature that lets people view all their active Facebook  sessions.  But who looks, you know, who's looking at that every moment as they as they use it.  So, you know, yeah, this is a problem with every website, right?  Because each and every HTTP request is completely independent of the one before it or after.  Like it's stateless.  It doesn't know if you're logged in.  So it has every single request does have to include login information.  But that information should be encrypted.  And this is a this is a problem that lots of people have known for a really long time.  I mean, Google knew they just what they encrypted Gmail.  But, you know, they just did that pretty recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, they still haven't encrypted anything else.  So if somebody uses FireSheep, they can see I'm on Google.  They can go look at my Web history.  They could change my search settings.  They can do a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right. So Google wasn't totally immune either.  Gmail, yes, but not but not just a regular Google account.  So, you know, this is a good thing.  Websites are going to going to secure this.  They're going to start transmitting cookies over SSL.  It should have happened a really long time ago.  I'm actually glad that Eric did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it forces the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. Even even though there will be collateral collateral damage, for sure.  There's a lot of college campuses, college campuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly where it's happening right now.  So if you are in a coffee and open access coffee shop and you log into Facebook,  you I think you have a million people have downloaded this thing.  You can pretty much assume that somebody could log in as you.  I just did a demonstration at the cottage, log, you know, said,  log in Lisa's account and said, this is Leo.  I just hacked Lisa's account on her status message.  I mean, it's really it's not a good thing.  However, this is presumably something you would want to ask Facebook.  Yes. No, nobody in present asked about it.  And I'm told by one of our chatters who asked the question in the chat  that that question was immediately deleted from chat.  So I think this is something that Facebook did not want to deal with.  I talked to Steve Gibson, our security guy, and it's his opinion that the web apps,  this single sign on for web apps is not impacted by fire sheep  because web apps, rather mobile apps are not like web apps.  They do not use HTTP. They do not use HTTP tokens.  So it does not affect web apps.  And in fact, that was my experience just empirically.  I could not see people who were logged on to Facebook, for instance, through a web app.  I could see if they use Safari.  I'm the whole though, you see that, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there a fix that you can make to a browser that fix this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are some there's a there are a couple of Firefox plugins,  HTTPS Everywhere is the one that people recommend that will kind of fix it.  But really, and you can tell the open access spot owner,  as I did with my my local coffee shop, please turn on WPA2, which she did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That fix would be a lot easier if it were.  I mean, what I'm asking is, is it is it logically possible  is in the realm of possibility that you could make a change  in the architecture of Chrome or Firefox? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It ultimately requires SSL be offered by these sites.  Facebook has to turn on.  Now, Google did an interesting thing the day after FireSheep came out.  They posted on the Google blog, by the way, it was trivially easy  for us to turn on HTTPS on Gmail.  It uses very little server resources.  They said less than 10 K per log in less than one percent of CPU to turn on SSL.  Their message was to counter the kind of common misconception  that SSL is CPU intensive or resource intensive, that it isn't.  It costs us nothing.  Everybody should do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yet you can still see Google accounts and FireSheep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, yeah, they turn it on for Gmail only.  Well, that's the soft spot.  But if, for instance, I could probably log into your Wave account,  I could probably log into Google Groups.  I think Wave's each.  Oh, yeah, I guess I won't be logging into your Wave account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, because my Wave account won't be around much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Buzz is protected because Buzz is Gmail, essentially.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll do that.  On the whole, though, I'd say Mark Zuckerberg was much more prepared  for opening up to questions and then having the next five questions  immediately be privacy.  He was ready to answer the question.  And I think he handled it very well, don't you?  Yeah. And location, you know, right away someone asked about the  the privacy matters around, you know, the coupons and the local coupons.  And he said, you know, right away, this is opt in.  You have to be, like you said, like searching for the right  searching for those coupons locally that nobody can push them to you  unless you like Chipotle and want to be receptive to Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He did the little Mark Zuckerberg dismissive thing  where he goes, no, like, oh, you're so stupid.  No, of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it didn't catch him off guard.  I'm sorry. He was prepared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's just you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if he's gone through media training or what,  but he's much more you don't see the sweaty, sweaty Zuck anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, which wasn't that long ago.  You're right. But I remember when I first saw him at a public event,  I think it was the Foursquare Conference in New York, which is coming up,  which is closed and and he's the deer in the headlight things because he's scared.  Yeah. I think he's just he's gone through such hell now that, you know, what's the case?  What's going to happen to me?  And he's more like the Zuckerberg that I've seen when I've met him face to face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very confident, very smart.  Yeah. If anything, he has that little arrogance thing that Jobs has.  Bill Gates had where he's, you know, name a mogul who does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. That's who you need that you have to have that one mogul.  No. Or politician.  I'll stick with mobile who doesn't have that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if any politician has it, it's phony.  Actually, I can name one. I can name one. Who? You.  I'm not a mogul. That's why.  Wait till I get to be a mogul and then I'll treat you all like crap.  The crap.  No, it's really true.  You know, you've met far more of these people than I have, Jeff.  But you have to have a certain grandiosity and and courage of spirit to be  to be these guys. Right.  I'm not surprised. Nothing's wrong with it.  But they really do think they're the smartest guy in the room.  I mean, it's always apparent.  Of course, Gina, you think you know, you're the smartest woman in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, of course.  What? I wasn't even listening to you.  You walk into any room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Sorry. Didn't mean to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it start my deep thought?  I did. Apparently.  You know, I was going to say earlier, like Facebook had grown up.  It's a mature platform.  I think that Mark is growing up.  I think about that dorky picture of Bill Gates when he was like 19,  draped over that desk that was taken to like a cheat sheet or something.  Yeah. Like someday we're going to be, you know, 20, 30 years from now,  we're going to be watching those, you know, interviews in Zuckerberg  when he was sweating at 21.  And we're going to laugh.  I mean, he's growing up and it's maturing.  And I think about the way that Mark presents Facebook  and like the way that the Facebook staff kind of talks about the platform  and the way that the Twitter leaders kind of talk about Twitter.  And on the Twitter side, they all haven't seemed to.  It's like they're all kind of still in awe of, you know, how big it grew  and how fast it's going and what it does.  And it seems like it over that, guys.  Yeah, they need to they need to get over that.  And Facebook has a little bit more of a maturity about it.  And was Zuckerberg is winning me winning me over a little bit.  I have to say, yeah, the one change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if you play us back for what?  Six months ago, I was furious with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Eight weeks ago, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no. Yeah.  Recently. Now.  All right. Let me go back to that old disgruntled Leo.  I have to say that this is clearly I mean, Facebook's just saying  we want everything on the web to go through us and we and maybe  we won't get that on the web, but we're going to get it mobile.  You know, use our check in, use our use our location, you know, use our APIs.  Is there anything wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you switching costs becomes harder and harder and harder?  And the next time, Leo, you're going to think twice before you quit Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I can't. You know what?  I'm glad now that I'm a member just so I can try this stuff out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're insinuating.  Maybe that's the deal. Oh, sorry.  No, no, go ahead, Jeff. Quick question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you cleared out all your friends and you had to rebuild your friends.  What's the what's the overlap? How did that structure work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was I had misused Facebook from day one and I friended everybody.  Right. So I was at the maximum 5000.  I've deleted everybody.  I have a fan page, which I don't know what that's at now.  It's still not 5000.  And I have a friend page, which is a 200.  This is real. It's actual friends. You guys, it's actual friends.  Actually, it's not Kevin. I don't know you, but it's.  No, just kidding.  But it's but actually, Gina, you're not my friend.  I'm a fan, but I don't think you're my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we have to. I'm kind of hidden on Facebook.  Yeah, I'll I'll find you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the right way to be, though.  I think it's just use it that way, especially now.  But at the same time, I'm glad.  Now, I have to say there's scary stuff on Facebook.  Look at this. This is one of the things that Facebook just launched.  Is this view you and another person?  So here's Molly Woods, my friend Molly Woods page.  I click this link that says view you and Molly.  And then it shows all the interactions we've had.  I chose the whole.  Well, it's it's a little scary because everything new is scary.  But it kind of implies a relationship where maybe none exists.  You know, these are pictures.  That's true. You know, like, well,  I did it with Tom Merritt and Veronica Belmont.  Now, Tom's wife, Eileen, is my esteemed producer.  But if you looked at this, you might think that Tom and Veronica  had something going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the Internet never forgets, like the thing that happened in 2007  could look just as legitimate as the thing that happened yesterday.  Whereas the thing that happened yesterday is more important to you,  because as humans, things fade in our memory and relationships cool.  But on the Internet, they don't write you either are or aren't.  And Neil and I were talking about this just the other day.  I think it's really cool to have this sort of memory of of interactions  that you've had with someone.  But it also I agree with you, Leo.  It's this it's this, you know, permanent record of something  that happened forever ago that might not be as important as it seems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no contextualization at all.  Yes. And this this to me in a nutshell is exactly what.  I like and dislike about Facebook, because because on the one hand,  this is Mark Zuckerberg saying, well, your connections are important  and I can we can show you stuff you can't see in any other way.  We're showing this is the social graph.  Isn't that cool?  And his attitude personally is, isn't that cool?  And I think he's a little insensitive to the feelings that people might have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cool, but it's a little creepy, too.  But you keep suggesting my ex-wife to be my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My ex-wife, that was a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a horrible divorce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't have that in there. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to be able to opt out of a certain link.  But but then again, the logic is that if this person is already your friend,  you said they're your friends.  And did you mean this? Right. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have ex-girlfriends in there. I'm not sure I should.  Yeah, that's true, too.  Of course, I'm so old.  All of those relationships are pre-Facebook.  I it's not I'm not for me.  It's not a big deal.  But it but I guess for my kids, it might be a huge deal that every previous  relationship is documented on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it like news feed is basically there already.  You could I think you could find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. It's not that you couldn't.  It's that the computer and the abilities of Facebook to bring disparate data  together, this is the whole privacy issue.  You know, it's the same argument you could make about, you know,  I remember interviewing somebody 20 years ago  where you give them your zip code.  I can't remember the name of the company, but it was everybody bought their database  and they could tell you what magazines you were likely to subscribe to,  a car you were likely to drive.  They knew all sorts of information about you just from your zip code.  The difference is now because of all these big databases  and the ability of computers to instantly correlate data,  it's not that it wasn't there before, but now they can now  it's brought together in new and interesting ways.  And of course, that's what Zuckerberg loves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Alexis Magigal at the Atlantic Tech Channel,  the Atlantic's kind of tech face on the web has a great post  he just put up very recently, why Facebook Places will be better than Foursquare.  And it already is.  Yeah, and it really answers the question I've been asking about  which one of these, you know, check in services could really float above the others.  And he says, basically, if I'm, you know, hanging out in the Mission District  and I see that three of my friends are at a bar, I'd rather see that  at three of my Facebook connections often go there or are there right now.  I'd rather see that right on the top than, you know, just what happens  to be GPS location close to me.  And he says that just by the data mining that Facebook is going to be able to do,  I shouldn't use that phrase, but that's the phrase, the relational  data mining, the relational relationship  that's going to be able to mine through your Facebook check ins  and your friends and everything.  It's going to be a much it could be a much better Foursquare that knows better  what you're more likely to walk into the village beer merchants than I am to walk  into cats, critters and fuzzy things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't like better as a description of this.  Better is very subjective, but it could be much more effective.  Right.  More social.  Well, is it good, though? I don't know.  Here's Nick Bilton.  And thanks to Tom Baker for this link in our chat room to Nick Bilton  in the Bits blog in the New York Times.  He tells the story of a guy named David McCandless, who took  years worth of data from Facebook with the help of Facebook,  scanning 10,000 status updates over a year long period  to find out when people break up.  And the biggest times for breaks up breakups, two weeks before Christmas  and spring break.  Oh, Christmas Day is the low point.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.  You can't stand the thought of having to endure the holidays with this person.  You just take care of it beforehand.  It's like I don't have to buy gifts.  I don't have to deal with your family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two weeks before Christmas. You're out. You're out. You're out.  Party. I'm going to Cabo. Oh, sorry.  I shouldn't have said that.  No, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your wife is a show.  Two weeks ago. Sorry.  Go ahead. A scientist, two scientists,  found that the mood on Twitter is predictive of the stock market.  Yes, I did see that and very accurate.  I've I've quoted here before that Twitter, according to another study,  was 97 percent accurate in predicting box office success.  Have you ever seen Jonathan Harris's We Feel Fine? No.  He's a brilliant artist.  I worked with him at Daylife and he did all kinds of great stuff  like the whale hunt. I recommend looking him up.  Just Google We Feel Fine Jonathan Harris.  And he took the words feel and feeling.  And he has now 14 million data points and he plots it in incredible ways.  And so you can see the time of year when people feel best and worst  and connections and ethnicity and age and just all kinds of stuff.  And that that, you know, you're correct, Kevin.  It's data mining or it's data nudging or I don't know what it is.  But that's all there and it's going to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I guess we just have to get used to it.  Mark Zuckerberg is just ahead of us.  He's already he's already used he's already kind of seen this and likes the idea.  I think the problem is that he doesn't really get why we might not.  And maybe he's right.  Maybe he's just maybe he's like you, Jeff.  He's just saying, you know, you'll get you'll get there.  You want to live in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just haven't got what else happens though, Leo.  When we when he does go over, then we beat him up.  And he says, all right, all right, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, you know, he's thinking, you know, he's thinking, oh, they'll get it eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he said he said to me,  Beacon, I said Beacon was was too far ahead and he said, no, Beacon was a mistake.  Oh, good. That's great.  And he knew it.  He knew why the just the dynamics, the the motivations didn't work for that.  But places is Beacon gone smart. Right.  Yes, now I've checked in.  Point I want my burrito.  You I get the guac and I am and I can choose to tell my friends.  Jeff just had guac. He's happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You totally opted into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. I really hope she probably comes on as a sponsor.  They've gotten so many freebies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The the underwear of the month club after we plugged them here to come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see I tweeted that yesterday and they had like 800 new subscribers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, the power of Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I said, oh, my man packs is on the way now with free shave gel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, but Zuckerberg did an interview with Business Insider,  which was very good, where he talked about how one of the Facebook's core values  is to move fast and break things like he and he said that, you know, he feels like  I'm actually this is a good segue into some of the moves into Facebook.  Google engineers, one in particular, I love that, you know, engineers at Facebook  have the ability to make a big impact and are encouraged to deploy, push,  iterate quickly and fail and fix.  And I feel like really that's what we beacon was.  It was a mistake and they fixed it.  But move fast and break things. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the that's the Web ethos.  And there's two things that Facebook really embodies of the Web ethos.  One is that push it out and iterate, which is another way of saying, you know,  get it out and break it and then do it again and break it and do it again till  you get it right. And the second one is don't worry about making money.  And I think this deals thing is very interesting that they're more interested  in building the platform, building the audience and not monetizing it yet.  And this is how Facebook's operated all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what I really like about deals is that there's you can you can set up  donations to charity, too, which I really, really like.  That kind of spoke to me. That also softened me to Zuckerberg a little bit.  I was like, OK, this is interesting.  So they're creating a use case for donating to charity, for checking in or  for participating in and directing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what he's going to use it as a platform for that. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just what is this due to Groupon?  Well, Groupon was there on stage.  They obviously welcome this and they're going to use the Facebook single sign  sign on and they demonstrate.  I think the you know, look, this is what's happening.  You know, people would normally be natural enemies like looped face  four square  go walla.  I have no choice but to join the party because it's either Facebook's  going to push you out or you play in Facebook space.  That's what scares me a little bit about this, is that this is  they're so powerful now with half a billion users.  They're they're so almost unstoppable.  And so people who would normally say, no, we're going to compete.  Now say, we can't compete, so we're going to participate,  even if we end up getting engulfed and devoured.  Which I think a company like Foursquare, what chance does Foursquare  have against places?  Oh, none.  So so Facebook, in a way, is saying, you know, well, that's your right to the API.  Come on, we'll give you the single sign on.  It'll be good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it also just means a ton of data flows back to them. Right.  I don't know. I love Foursquare.  I mean, the the voting stuff that the Foursquare did this week was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't it? We're going to talk about that.  Places is not as good as Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think so. You think you could do stuff with places, for instance,  this multiple multiple check in, which at first we thought that's just creepy  where you could check other people into your place.  Now it makes sense with the deals thing,  because you can bring three friends and get a sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I told I told Dennis Crowley when I saw him, I said,  I said this on the show a while ago, I want the prospective Foursquare,  which that starts to become right. Right.  Not not where I am or where I was, where I'm going to be.  And let me use it as an organizing tool.  And he said, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's one of 100 things they got to work on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and here's the beauty, frankly, of what Facebook's doing, Gina.  You love Foursquare. Fine. Keep using it.  Yeah, you're right. But it's now in the Facebook universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I can choose to have hype into into into Facebook,  which I do actually do a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this will be even more intimate because right now you do it as an application,  which I do, too, as an app. I use Foursquare.  I don't use places as an application.  But now it's going to update your Facebook location.  It's going to add, you know, all of a sudden it'll have more and more Facebook in it.  Facebook gets the benefit of seeing all this data across its servers.  I have a feeling that  that it's not even it doesn't even have to be maligned.  It doesn't even have to be like Microsoft did.  Come here, let's see what you got.  Oh, that's nice. But we're not going to buy you.  We're just going to copy you.  It doesn't even have to be like that anymore.  Facebook's completely content to have Foursquare be a satellite and continue indefinitely.  You want to use Foursquare and please be our guest, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the other that's the other thing you're saying about about the ethos of the web.  You know, Google wants you to succeed with your blog. Right.  It's the same idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right. It's the same idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So opting into the possibility of seeing Jeff at Chipotle.  But what else am I opting into?  You know what I mean?  Like, where what else?  So I get my friends at the bar.  But like, what else happens then later?  You know what I mean? In 2013, when you know that I was somewhere in 2010,  like, what does that mean when Facebook has all that data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The health insurance company says your cardiac was caused by all that guacamole, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We certainly can think of a lot of bad things.  Can we think of some benefits?  You have a you know, it's interesting, remember Gordon, Gordon Bell  and his book about, you know, he was wearing a camera.  I may still be around his neck at Microsoft Researcher,  guy who found a digital equipment, and he was wearing a camera on his neck  that took a picture every 10 seconds.  And he said, eventually, my whole life will be recorded  and you'll be able to search this step.  Oh, you don't need a camera anymore. You just need Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I was fascinated by that project.  I have a terrible memory.  I forget conversations that I have with people.  You know, I lost my dad really young and I think about him a lot.  I try to remember things I talked to him about.  And I think, you know, what if I had had a camera, you know, on me  the whole time that I had had him or like if I could if I could search  all the conversations I've had in my life, like if I could see recurring  themes and sentiments.  I mean, this is kind of what I'm doing with Think Up.  I think there's a lot of important things happen in the conversations that we have.  You know, my Gmail archive the last five years is kind of gold.  I search Gmail all the time for some email about this, that or the other thing.  So I think that's really valuable.  I just really like having control of that stuff and having it on my hard drive  and my computer and me collecting it.  You know, my wear versus spyware.  I think Cory Doctorow calls it just freaks me out that Facebook has,  you know, all that information on their servers.  And I guess I could say the same thing about Google.  The difference is that I don't just trust Facebook as much as I trust Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know what? Your credit card company knows more about you than anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true. That's absolutely true, Jeff.  And at least at least Facebook, I'm worried about Facebook  because they're transparent about what they know.  I don't think about the credit card company, right?  It's the people. You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The people have information that we aren't telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, easy pass knows when I go through the toll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, people don't we want the ultimate wouldn't it be awesome to have  this is Mark Zuckerberg saying nobody wants to make lists,  but everybody wants the benefit of it.  So if you have automated systems that gather, correlate,  curate all of the information in your life,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  isn't that priority inbox, right?  That's the first piece of it.  It's a tiny piece of it.  Watch what we do.  And it's coming all kinds of signals.  And it will be no problem at all to put into priority inbox than other feeds,  which is Marissa's I haven't said this in months.  So I'm going to say it again.  Hyper personal news stream.  Yeah, that's where we had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever happened to the hyper person?  This is the sort of it's hyper personal life stream.  It's everything. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Let's take a break.  The values we need.  I was I was at this thing today with the the Postal Department  trying to rethink what their life is or isn't.  Wow. And as we were going through various,  you know, functions that you need, prioritization and filtering,  you know, kind of which is the equivalent of aggregating and curating.  It becomes very important because a very high value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we're in very interesting territory.  Very interesting territory.  Let's take a break. I want to come back with more.  We will talk about those transitions.  Google bleeding some very good engineers to Facebook.  And maybe you could see a little bit about what's going on.  People are saying, isn't this a show about Google?  I really should say this week in the cloud, we were going to call it that.  But we thought it would be people be more compelled if we're Google.  But the truth is, it's cloud and what Facebook's doing, what Google's doing.  It's all about what's happening out there.  And I think it's all related.  It's very interesting.  Before we go on, though, I would like to mention our friends at Citrix  and go to meeting a great way to use the cloud for your meetings.  You know, traveling to a meeting is a pain in the behind,  not to mention expensive and stressful.  And in fact, a lot of people say, well, you got to meet  face to face to get business done.  I think you can do very well with GoToMeeting.  A lot of people are replacing face to face meetings with conference calls.  But that's, you know, boy, it's not visual.  It's very can be very dull.  And you also kind of feel like you're losing your attendees.  A lot of times you could tell they're off answering email or something.  This is where GoToMeeting really comes in.  You could do it ahead of time.  It integrates with your email package to just say, send an invitation.  It sends out the information with a link and all they need to know to join your meeting,  by the way, includes free voice over the Internet and phone teleconferencing.  So that's kind of built in to GoToMeeting.  Or you can even while you're on a conference call with one or 15 people,  you could say, I got to show you something here.  Go to GoToMeeting.com. Here's the meeting ID.  Now, even if they've never used GoToMeeting before,  if they've never installed the software before, 30 seconds later,  they're seeing your computer on their screen, PC or Mac.  It's completely cross platform.  You can show them the keynote or the PowerPoint.  You can show them the websites.  It's great for training.  It's great for collaboration.  Of course, for sales.  It really is a breakthrough product because it took, you know, what we many companies do,  which is, you know, kind of remote access and online meetings and made it simple,  clean and elegant.  So it just gets the job done.  I want you to try it free.  You don't have to believe me. Just try it free for 30 days.  If you go to GoToMeeting.com slash twig  before I'm done talking, you'll have it installed.  I mean, it's really that quick.  You just go to meeting dot com slash twig, click, click, click, and then you're in.  And now you've got it.  And the next time you're on a conference call,  just put a post-it note on your screen saying, don't forget to use GoToMeeting.  Try it. You'll see your attendees will like it.  You'll like it.  It's easy to use at just forty nine dollars a month.  It's really affordable. I want you to try it absolutely free for 30 days.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  We thank the folks at Citrix for their continued long time support  of the entire network and this week in Google.  So, Gina, you said you knew some of these people who've transitioned out from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I was talking about Lars Rasmussen, who actually he wrote the forward to my book on Wave.  And, you know, he's he's a web hero.  He's someone he's an unsung web hero, but he's certainly one of my heroes.  He's the guy with his brother, Jens, who kind of saved us from the crappiness  that was MapQuest and launched Google Maps and and showed us what JavaScript  and Ajax could do Ajax could do in a browser.  And he was the creator of Wave.  And so he announced this week that he is moving to Facebook, which surprised me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On Facebook.  You know, it's not Facebook. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it was pretty surprising to me.  And he said he was pretty frank. I met him at Google.  Oh, he's a he's an interesting guy.  And he said that getting things done at Google is really hard.  It's a huge organization.  And the wave experience was was difficult for him and frustrating.  He's a really smart guy.  And I think he felt like he couldn't see his vision to fruition.  In fact, Marissa Meyer said this week on DigDialogue, actually, that the that the  wave is one of three mistakes she feels like Google made.  So that was interesting.  Anyway, you know, that's to the heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Is that a mistake in what way launching it, how they launched it,  what they did with it or killing it?  I mean, what was the mistake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All she said was we would have done it differently.  So, you know, Zuckerberg courted Lars personally and said to him,  hey, you know what, we're a small company.  You can come in, have huge impact.  His job description is like come into Facebook and hang out and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the equivalent of Steve Jobs saying to John Sculley,  you don't want to make sugar water any for the rest of your life, do you?  I mean, it really is that kind of a pitch, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  And, you know, Lars is moving from Sydney to San Francisco to take his job as wife.  Yeah, which which also surprised me because he faced the wave team out of Sydney  to work for Google. So it must be I believe it sounds like it's a very financially  compelling offer from Facebook, but also it really made me go like, you know, wow.  I'm I'm surprised.  Is Jen's going to?  I don't think so. I think it's just Lars right now.  That's I there was no mention of Jen's.  I wondered about that. His brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's impressive how he's hiring the best talent.  He also got Sam Lesson this week buying Drop.  I owe that killing him.  It's the hell out of me. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Sam's great. I'm happy for Sam, but that pisses me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I can't think of another service that's  instant 100 megs password protected open.  I mean, I tried my best on Lifehacker, but I still can't even quite find  the exact same service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was really disappointed.  I used drop a recommended drop by all the time.  And but I think the world is Sam and I I'm happy for him.  You know, Zuck said at one point in an interview, this is another case of he says,  we don't we don't buy companies for the intellectual property or the assets.  We buy it for the engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. He paid off the investors.  It's reported. So I mean, getting less than cost a lot of money.  So and getting Lars is an incredible get.  And he you know, you hire someone with that much talent and that much vision  and you entice them with that much freedom.  Great things have to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's yes, let's hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, by the way, I am going to have my suggestion for a drop  EO replacement as my pick of the week.  But it's not quite the same, but I'll be curious what you think.  You probably know about it, Kevin, but I'm going to I'm going to mention it.  So and so Sam Lesson is a great acquisition.  It really does look like is that Facebook doesn't have an agenda with these.  It's not like they're saying, oh, we're going to build something like drop EO  or we're going to build something like Wave or Maps.  They just want the best minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zuckerberg or Rasmussen was quoted as saying, I don't remember which way it went,  but I think either one of them quoted Zuckerberg as saying, like,  why don't you come here and hang out for a few years and see what happens?  Right. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, he's basically saying, you know, we've got this many users.  We've got a tendrils and all these different aspects of the Web.  You will have really high impact.  We do, you know, and every individual engineer can get a lot done.  That's always the pitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's what engineers like.  Admittedly, with Facebook, pre IPO and the potential of cash  and on millions of dollars, that might have something to do it.  But I have a feeling people like Lars, I'm sure has enough Google stock  to be comfortable.  It's not the money that that motivates them.  And he's motivated by the announcement today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He made a point of saying that we're a small, you know, the mobile team.  He said several times and then he got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, got a point to say that everybody stand up who was involved in this.  And then he said again to the journalists, see, we're a small team.  What is that all about, Kevin?  Is that he sounded like a selling point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's, you know, maybe he's maybe he's hunting for more people.  But also, it's just it's appealing to think that because you don't think  of small groups as being scheming, right?  Like you don't think of small groups as being, you know, you know,  unless they're planning to bomb something.  I mean, they're they're really it's hard to think of a small group of guys  hanging out together late night Mountain Dew, you know, ruining your life  somehow with privacy issues or anything else.  I think it's even more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's exactly against Google, right?  Exactly what Laura said.  You can't get things done at Google.  Well, look, you put a small team together.  Look what they built. Hello.  And it's his best competitive.  If he's going to be built on talent, that was his best competitive shot at Google.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also got the sense he said it with pride, like, see what we've done.  And it's just a couple of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he does that thing where he's like, well, you know,  the first iteration of Facebook was built in two weeks, you know,  just a little bit of the arrogance, like, oh, look, look at how much we've done  with just a couple of, you know, we just  years one weekend and it just kind of popped out this beautiful, you know.  So there's that, you know, he's got every right to be proud of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he does. He does. He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He is a huge accomplishment.  But yes, you know, I think it was own O'Malley wrote this  this post, Google's real problem, getting things done.  And it just talked about and actually quoted, quoted Lars saying that,  you know, some of the problem, the reason why Google's losing engineers  to Facebook is that it's, you know, it's a slow moving  you know, it's hard to get your your product to bubble up.  There's a huge company.  It's hard to get things done and feel like you're having a big impact.  And it kind of goes back to like Doug Bowman's post about how, you know,  he's he would have to make his case for three pictures, three pixel  or four pixel border designer. Right.  Similar thing is like, you know, I don't have to present data  to tell you whether or not I think it should have one more pixel, that kind of thing.  So maybe I should slow down. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We I talk a little bit about this on Macbreak because we were talking about Apple,  who has acquired a number of companies like Lala or done things like mobile media.  They've never transformed into viable products.  Google, you can point at a lot of products like dodgeball  that just died on the vine at Google Wave.  And I was wondering, is this endemic in Silicon Valley?  They just throw a lot of stuff on the wall and some of it sticks  and some of it doesn't.  Or is it really some sort of flaw in these big teams that they  they sometimes can't execute?  They can't bring a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, isn't it both Leo, isn't it?  If you don't give it the support, if you don't see ahead what support it needs.  I mean, I'm sure Gina will agree with this.  The tragedy of Wave was that it, you know, it was orphaned very soon.  Right. Too soon.  And yeah, exactly.  And I never had the chance to really find it what it was.  Forth Mark Zuckerberg, we don't know what it is yet.  We've sure as hell didn't know what it was yet.  And you can't go on with with huge losses on things.  I just see right now this minute, by the way, that Chase Carey, the head of  News Corp, says that the losses at MySpace are unacceptable and unsustainable.  Feels like the hands get near the plug, man.  Yeah. Didn't they just do a relaunch and redesign?  Yeah. So you're very well.  We're very excited. All that. But the paid content said this, you know.  So so, yeah, there's a limit to this.  But if Buzz didn't have the kind of support to think, you know, A and B  and Android and Chrome aren't thought together.  And, you know, I love Google.  But but this Eric has always said that their biggest challenge  is being as big as they are.  And it really is true and home to Roost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. You always want to think that these big companies could never,  you know, they're strategic people, they're the folks at the top  have gotten there by being smart.  And then you find out that AOL Time Warner was literally like a tapas dinner  that just went on too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This stuff up isn't going along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, really. It was really like a dinner they had together.  And then the next day they call each other on the phone,  like like after a date or something like, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's right. And that's how Murdoch bought MySpace.  Oh, right. You want to see about twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I need to I need to go Chipotle more often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Poor Kevin. He sounds like he's dying.  Are you starving, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a little bit, but no, I just I feel bad for your business department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who knows who you might meet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At some point, a company as big as Google with deep pockets  becomes kind of like a startup incubator, but within from within. Right.  So like the wave team, from what I understand, was sort of treated  like a startup that was kind of this other part of the world.  They'll do their own thing. They're in Australia. Right.  And it was like they had certain goals to me.  You know, Google was going to invest this much, you know,  this much staff and money into the development of this product.  And if it didn't reach its goals by year one or year two,  then they would cut it off.  You know, if the wave team had been a startup on their own, would,  you know, would they would they have made it?  I don't know. But part of part of it, you know, I think is that kind of  that small startups from within the big company kind of take on things.  But it does change things.  You know, we've had a million active users because they were a Google product.  But if they were a startup on their own and had a million active users,  they would absolutely be considered a success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  Let's take a break.  We have lots more to talk about, including some very good numbers  for the Android marketplace, a lawsuit Google's decided to take on  the Department of the Interior.  We'll find out why.  And yes, you may be getting a very big check from Google Buzz. No.  Oh, I saw somebody tweet,  if I've got this correct, I should be getting ten million dollars from Google.  No, no.  We'll talk about that in just a second right now, though.  I want to talk about our friends at the fine, mighty Ford plant  who have created the incredible Ford Sink every time I drive by  my Mustang around and listen to my audio books.  And then I just then a text message comes in in my Android phone.  And I hear it read to me over the sink or, you know, I get lost.  And I say, Sink, tell me where I am and how to get to where I'm going.  I just think, thank my lucky stars.  Fun. Somebody finally got this thing right.  I have driven plenty of cars that you try to talk to.  None of them feels like Kit Knight Rider.  My Mustang does. It's amazing.  It understands everything I'm saying.  Ford Sink is true hands free calling.  You press a button on your steering wheel, you say phone, you say  call Gina Trapani at work and boom, it just does it.  It's amazing. It's also turn by turn directions.  Even if you don't buy the full GPS package, all Ford Sink vehicles have GPS in them  and can walk and can tell you turn by turn without a big display.  But they tell you to turn how to go.  They even know what your route is and they'll warn you about traffic problems ahead.  They'll even reroute you if you need it.  They also have 911 assist.  And now this is optional, but I, you know, you could turn it off or on.  But I always turn it on on all my phones because when I get in the car,  it automatically pairs up.  And now if something bad happens and my airbags get deployed, the Ford Sink  calls 911, gives it my GPS coordinates because it knows exactly where I am,  plays a recorded message and turns on my phone and microphone and says,  you got anything you want to tell them? I'm OK.  Ford Sink is fantastic.  It's available exclusively on Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.  If you haven't tried it, there's a couple of things you could do.  You could go to the website, SinkMyRidePodcast.com.  Some great videos and demos there.  But really, there's nothing like trying it in person  and seeing how smart it is about recognizing your voice, all the things you can do.  You know, you could press the button and say it goes down and you say climate,  set temperature 74 degrees and it does it.  I mean, it's just it's kind of spooky.  It's like your car understands you.  Ford Sink, go get go go get it today at your local Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicle.  And believe me, if you're test driving cars, you're in the market for a car.  Try all the other guys to do try.  You know, we have some other manufacturers cars and I just you know,  you'll see immediately how much better the sink is.  SinkMyRidePodcast.com, we thank them for their support.  Android phones this past quarter,  44% of all smartphones sold in the US.  The headlines in most newspapers were Apple beats rim.  With 26%, not many papers said, I know, by the way.  Yeah, the iPhone was 26%.  Android was 44%.  Although I have to say in Apple's defense,  Apple's iPhone was the number one selling handset.  So if you take any one Android handset and compare the iPhone,  iPhones wins, but it's just because there's 20 plus Android headsets  and sets that 44% is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  And more devices coming.  Say again.  More devices coming.  What do we think about this Nexus 2?  Is that real?  Yeah, I think it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Samsung has a big event.  When is that event, Eileen?  November 8th, so a couple of days, five days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I suspect it doesn't.  I don't think the Nexus 2 is going to be just from what I've read.  It sounds like it's just kind of the next developer slash early adopter  handset and that they're I mean, they're obviously not going to be doing  the same kind of carrier independent launch like they did with the Nexus 1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's not I mean, Nexus 1 was HTC.  It was sold by Google.  Who's going to sell the Nexus to Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Gizmodo had someone who kind of sourced as like a friend of theirs,  got a hold of it and gave them their report and said it was basically like a Galaxy S  with some nice features, a front facing camera.  Yeah, you know, a little more styling maybe.  But it seems like it's really just going to be kind of the phone  for people like me, people like developers who want to have the stock Android  right away.  And, you know, but still, it's kind of neat that they're at the point now  where there are so many good phones, so many good Android phones out there  that they don't need to come out with the Nexus 1 and say like this.  This is your paradigm.  Like, you know, it's kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want that, like, you know, pure Google phone.  I love my Nexus 1 because because I have that.  So I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't like the add ons.  I really don't.  And it's nice to have the pure experience, at least to experience it.  Now, the most interesting product rumor came from Digitimes,  the Taiwanese electronics paper that said Google Chrome devices,  not Android devices, but Chrome operating system devices  may be out later this year.  You like that? You're looking for that?  I want that as much as I want a burrito.  I have to say, I am after, you know, and I'm supposedly going to get a review  unit of the Galaxy S tab.  And when I do, we'll talk about it.  But but I'm gathering that because, you know, Google itself says  don't use 2.2, don't use Froyo on a tablet.  The apps are not optimized for the screen size.  I'm having a feeling that that's not going to be an ideal experience.  Ooh.  But we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And speaking of not ideal experiences, go ahead, Jen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I was going to say, you know, the seven inch, the small,  right, smallness of it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whereas a Chrome device, maybe that's what we want.  It'll be built around an ARM processor  manufactured by Inventek.  This is all from Digitize, launching this month.  And Digitize says Google also plans to launch its own brand  Google Chrome netbook.  They did say didn't didn't they say, didn't Eric say, we're going to do one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he did.  So, Leo, I have to ask you, you said that the that the new MacBook Air  made you use your iPad less, right? Yeah.  Yeah, this is OK.  So now do you feel the same way about so to that?  I thought, well, yeah, I mean, I use my netbook more too,  because it's got a keyboard.  It's a real keyboard and you can create and do things.  So do you feel similarly about Chrome OS based netbook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think for me now, this is very personal.  So everybody's going to have a different opinion.  I think for me, the key to the iPad was  for the weight, you know, size, weight and battery life.  And this is very close in size and weight.  Battery life is five, not 10 hours.  But I'm talking about the MacBook Air.  But but it's good enough that I find I use this more.  And for the things that I do, like blogging,  bookmarking stories, you know, Google Reader, it's it's, I think, a better,  frankly, better tool, especially if you're doing any content creation,  even light duty content creation.  I think that the iPad is not really ideal for that.  It's great. Just saying all this to make me feel good.  Did you buy an air or no, you sent back the iPad?  I was with the iPad. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm held out to, you know, I mean, Jobs himself kind of admitted  that the touch interface isn't ideal, you know, down, you know, up,  you know, just vertically versus horizontally.  And that's why you don't want to reach out and do touch. Right. Right.  But but the iPad is unless it's in your lap and your knees are up.  Anyway, this is this is a conversation everyone's had a million times already.  But I was curious to know, I kind of lost interest in the Chrome OS a little bit  because I said, you know, I just really want a good Android tablet.  And I'm good. You know, I've got a netbook. I'm fine.  But my netbook's a little slow.  I might be interested in checking out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's an expensive netbook.  This the MacBook Air and I think Chrome OS, Chromium OS, Chrome OS  would be interesting.  Now, the thing that this digitized implies is that Google's going to do  this kind of Nexus one strategy only with a netbook or a Chromium notebook.  I'll buy one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope they have some good hardware engineers working on it.  Some really smart designers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, you're right. You're right.  But but but they have the specs out for already, don't they, Kevin?  You know, the tablet for the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Digitized says instant on.  Long lasting battery.  Also, HP and Acer will have units based on Chrome OS by December.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, but going to Kevin's point about about  the kind of the better we get hardware, but be other good things.  Google TV, did you install it?  Oh, I can give you my review.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hardware is good.  Nothing's wrong with the hardware.  Make it a little weird to have a your remote control be a keyboard.  But on the bright side, it's it's pretty usable.  I think it's way over complicated.  It doesn't give you enough value, really, to to justify either the cost  or the complexity. I mean, you know, it did an update before you can install.  It's a half hour update.  And then I just did last night.  I'm watching TV. It's a good thing.  It wasn't the World Series. I'm watching TV and it says  pops up a big thing on my screen saying I'd like to update myself now.  If you don't.  Oh, you could in its defense, you could say no, do it later.  But it's like annoying.  Like no one wants to have a good week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I would have been infuriated.  Get out of my way.  Where's the keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interrupting my queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it has problems with HD, has problems with Dolby audio.  You know, for me, I haven't had those problems, although occasionally  I get a weird HD effect where it feels like it's delayed or the frame rate is low.  And there's not a lot of functionality.  The Netflix that's in there is not the current version of Netflix  for the previous version.  So both Roku and Apple TV have a much more advanced  Netflix version in which you can subscribe to movies within it.  You can't do that on the on the Logitech review.  The apps that are there are very scant and there's no marketplace yet.  Now, if you add the Android market and down the road,  I start seeing a lot of apps for this thing.  I'm going to change my tune, perhaps.  But right now, there's nothing compelling about it.  It can't do really much of as much as say the ninety nine dollar Roku box.  And it's a lot more complicated to set up and use.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait for Rev to wait for the market.  Android market, you know, this is early days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. Don't don't buy the G1 of TVs.  It is the very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good one, Kevin. Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly what it is.  And I have this.  I had the same high hopes that I had for the G1  and the same disappointment when I started using it.  That's a very apt analogy.  You're you're on fire, Nick.  You're on fire.  I try. And you know, it's interesting because there's some real  Google's starting to get advocates in the same way that Apple has advocates.  There's some real Google advocates who kind of were mad at me  that I didn't like Google TV.  And I said, well, I just have to say, I just this is my experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody did. The reviews were awful.  How's the search interface?  That's the that's like the saving grace.  I've pretty much, you know, grabbed from all the reviews.  I've read that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't want to I don't really  I don't want to search for shows that often.  I kind of know where where the stuff I want to see is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't you? That's not a good sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, I mean, because there's an Android app in the Android  now as a remote control that it works with my TV.  It's a little weird, but it does work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was explaining to a friend that he said that it would it would be the weirdest.  It would be the greatest interface for your weird friends.  We're like, I wonder if there's anything with Willem Dafoe on at 4 p.m. Sunday.  Like, and so there you go.  But who does that? Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think it's not quite ready.  And things like, you know, somebody somebody I saw a picture on Twitter.  Oh, this is really cool.  Live TV and Twitter, just as it's supposed to be,  except that the live TV is this little tiny picture and picture.  And the Twitter is the whole screen.  You cannot resize the TV and downsize the Twitter.  The Twitter is the whole thing.  It's little things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I have difficulty in that.  I think everybody there's this holy grail of getting everything on the TV.  I can't imagine maybe I'm just because I'm getting old.  I can't imagine many apps that would really be great for TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Pandora's there, which is not TV app.  But I mean, at least you can listen to your music.  Hulu would have been nice had Hulu allowed it.  ABC, TV. Right.  I'd like a little secret. OK, I'll tell you one.  Angry Birds.  I can get a full screen,  six to one inch Angry Birds.  So gaming could be really awesome on this thing.  OK, that's it. Yep. You won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Angry Birds.  I would like a ticker tape of either all the tweets that mentioned Glee  or just my friend's tweets that mentioned Glee.  Just kind of streaming along the bottom while I watch Glee.  Like that. Not enough to get in the way of the show,  but enough for me to laugh at a joke that somebody cracked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's very good. And they were during the World Series game.  And that's an easy thing to implement.  But they haven't implemented it yet.  But that would be that's exactly what I would like.  I don't want to see the big Twitter and the little TV on the big TV.  Well, little crawl of Twitter. That'd be awesome.  Yeah. That maybe I could click and reply.  Mm hmm. A little bit like I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want to Facebook place this stream so I can feel bad about how active  all my friends are while I'm sitting at home watching TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My friends are outside and I'm at home watching the wire again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. The wire.  You know perfectly well, all your friends are also watching the wire.  So it'd be kind of fun.  You could all you could all say we're, you know, couch potatoes together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Indeed. We all check in at the wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The potential is there. I think that's really apt.  It's the G1. And I'm willing to I'm willing to stipulate that,  you know, the next generation might be well worth getting.  But don't but save your money on the two ninety nine logic tech review.  That's a lot of money for something that's not very good.  A ninety nine dollar Roku box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Roku box is great. It's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it works. And we're on it.  Actually, we're on this too. You can get it.  But, you know, you browse through the podcast and all that stuff.  You can get that.  Google's lobbyists, apparently.  Now, this comes from Breitbart. So.  Take it with a grain of salt.  I don't usually quote Andrew Breitbart,  but he I mean, I think the facts are there.  It's his interpretation I might disagree with yesterday, of course,  or a couple of days ago, the FTC decided to close its investigation  into the Google Wi-Fi incident.  Breitbart writer Ken Bain points out that this came one week  after Obama attended a thirty thousand dollar a plate fundraiser  at Marissa Meyer's house.  Also, Becky Burr, a Google lobbyist at Wilmer Hale  on September 28th, emailed White House officials  asking for a meeting, asking the White House to assist  in getting the FTC to back off the investigation.  So White House, I mean, that's what you hire lobbyists to do, right?  And I think the reason that I don't I mean, I think the facts are probably fine.  I think we all agree that the Wi-Fi thing really is is bogus.  And so the FTC should have dropped it.  So I can't get a head up about lobbying on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yesterday, Google Street View went up in Germany, the first bits of it.  And I went berserk because it was just I wrote a piece  that got translated into German on this asking, you know, Germany,  what have you done if you look at the pages?  It's like it's like pixel bombs.  They bombed their buildings digitally.  It's stupid. It's offensive.  It really is. And it's a diminishment of what's public.  I'm not going to go off on one of my Jarvis rants right now,  but but it's just ridiculous.  And the Germans are getting all mad at me.  And it's not all the Germans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had a guy on that at night yesterday who was a performer,  an artist, a really interesting artist, does installations.  And his artistic collective, FAT in Berlin,  built a fake Google Street View car to drive people crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just got a cardboard thing and they throw it around, you know, looking,  because they thought it was so stupid that Germans were so worried about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The hashtag for this is now called Blurmini.  Blurmini with a blur.  You blur the story.  I mean, somebody somebody put up a blurred German flag and, you know,  I like it. Blurmini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see. Google Buzz Settlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're rich. Not not.  So the settlement got preliminary approval,  class action lawsuit by Gmail users over privacy violations.  When Buzz launched, we all remember that the settlement calls for Google  to pay eight and a half million dollars, but not to you, not to me,  but toward a fund for organizations focusing on Internet privacy policy  or education.  Google said we're satisfied with the argument, glad to move forward.  Preliminary approval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can opt out of the settlement if you're a Gmail user, right?  But then then you get nothing.  Then you have to file another lawsuit, win that in order to get anything other.  Right. Yeah. Privately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How weird was it to get your second email ever from Gmail?  The first one was like, Gmail's different.  Here's how when you sign up.  And now this is the second time I really can't think of another time  they've emailed every Gmail user and said, hey, by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you get nothing.  Did you assume right off the bat that it was spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. What are they mailing me for?  Hey, one more YouTube one more Google transition.  YouTube CEO and founder is stepping down from Google.  I don't know if he's taking a new job or or what.  Chad Hurley, Chad Hurley. Yep.  Transitioning away from the chief executive role for the last two years,  seeding most day to day business decisions to Google VP of product  management, Salaar Kamangar.  I don't know where Steve Chen is.  He's he left his he went he left a while ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, to Google. He went to my mother's Google. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he's still working at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Chad stayed on in an aqua for him to have stayed on  a CEO of an acquired company for that long is actually pretty amazing.  Maybe he just didn't vest right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so Kalamangar is now Google employee number nine, by the way,  is now running YouTube.  YouTube actually streamed was a CBS coverage  was streaming on YouTube during the election.  Let's talk a little bit about the election and then we'll wrap it up  with our because we've got to get going here with our picks.  Four Square, I love that.  Didn't you love that, Gina?  I checked in and I got an I voted badge.  Loved it. Absolutely.  I love the map where you could see how many other people checked in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and you could you could play in real time watching people check in.  I mean, it was it was really this kind of sense of community.  Like we're all going out and doing this thing.  I mean, you heard a lot about voting on Twitter for sure.  If you're keeping up with that.  But it was definitely the sense of like group civic action.  You think more young people voted because of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I definitely think it added a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, I know people who are insane about getting four square badges.  And they were like, I will check in at a polling place.  I mean, I think it was a little bit of a surprise.  And at a polling place, I got the Halloween badge and the voting badge.  Yeah, me too.  I know it was a good week for badges.  That's true. Hey, we all get those I voted stickers on our shirts.  It's the same thing, but better stays with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there was a little Instagram meme where people took a picture  of their chest with their I voted sticker, which I thought was kind of a neat meme.  Actually, Facebook did an amazing thing.  If you logged on to Facebook on Election Day, not only would you see a link  that said, where's your polling place, but you could check in that you voted  and all your friends would see the badge you voted.  And they kept counting.  At last time I checked, it was 12 million people on Facebook voted.  That's fantastic. Power.  That's using power for good.  Yeah, I mean, now think about that.  I mean, I think that's got to have some get out the vote impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has to. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube, they keep testing YouTube live streaming.  I keep waiting. I'd love to use it, guys.  If you can't, but CBS did live streaming of their coverage on YouTube.  All the networks, of course, streamed on their own websites.  NBC was supposed to use Twitter and I didn't see it on Twitter,  but supposedly they were going to stream on Twitter.  Despite all this, of course,  60 percent of eligible voters did not vote in the midterm elections yesterday,  which is shameful.  But maybe we can get them next time.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Come back with your tip of the week, Gina.  Your number of the week, Jeff, if we haven't stepped on it, stomped on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you did one, but I got another one.  Gina, for a railroad killed mine, but I got another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got a tip of the week.  I was going to do Bleco, which I really like.  But Businessweek says it's doomed, so I guess not.  Have you used Bleco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I messed around with it to review it for Lifehacker.  Seems like a neat idea.  But any time you have to train people on how to search.  Yeah. I don't know how how much reach  and adoption it's going to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, I said I set up a couple of slash tags.  That's the idea is that it is.  Are they Google search results?  Where do the search results come from?  I don't think they are their own search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they seem like their own independent database of.  But it was very it was a very specifically narrow database  of like three million ish sites or something or three million ish,  you know, trusted, verified, well-linked sites or, you know, networks.  It seemed like. So the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. The idea is you would set up a slash tag.  I have two. One is a slash tag slash twit,  which constrains the search to official pages from twits.  You know, people like, you know, Gina and Jeff.  And then another one, which was taking my OPML  with all the tech news sources and using that.  So if you do a search on Bleco for Google with my slash tag tech news,  actually, you probably do slash report slash tech news,  then it would constrain the search to just the sources  that I had already set up ahead of time, which I think is pretty useful.  But you're absolutely right.  It's it's way too complicated. Nobody's ever going to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, ideally, that way you could search for YouTube slash plane.  So you could look up things about the spy plane as opposed to YouTube slash band.  But can't you already do that on on Google?  Yeah. On Google, you just have to do just you know, YouTube dash band,  you know, dash to show all the things you don't want included.  Gina's going to school me on this.  I was researching my tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll leave it at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is probably it is a far reach to get people to train people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in a new way to search. So good luck.  Yes. And Jeff, I didn't mention your blog post on why I was rooting for Cablevision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cablevision finally caved and gave Fox the extra money they wanted in the in the fight.  And by the way, as soon as Cablevision gave apparently Dish also caved  and Fox is now back on both.  But those companies are paying the higher subscriber fees that Fox demanded,  which is the first problem is what's going to go to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we get it. Sure.  Second problem is already noticeably, by the way, there is pandering to us now, Jeff.  You just pandering to me and Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love it. She's cute.  She's cute with the big. You don't even want to be a little bit of a bitch.  She's cute with the big. You don't even watch the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you? Do you watch the show?  I do now. Oh, my wife can't stand it.  Really? Yeah. First prostate loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now this, you know, you're turning into a girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just I just I thought you of all people would be like,  you know, just hate glee, just hate it with a passion.  You know, I'm wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to admit something right now.  I like show tunes. I do, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do, too. Any any time people burst into song, I don't care how crappy the show is.  If people burst in the song every 10 minutes, I'm happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're all a little gay.  If I could figure out how to do numbers on Twitter, I would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'd be bursting in the song every 10 minutes.  Put it on a hat. Finishing the hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  We're sawed. It's on. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What it does is, yes, I like Sondheim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do, too. I love Sondheim.  Hey, let's take a break.  We're going to come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think we have a bonus tip from from our guest, Kevin Purdy, as well.  Indeed. Coming up in just a little bit.  But first, I do want to I have a tip for you.  Here's a great tip. You got some old gadgets lying around.  Of course you do.  If you if you are a Twitter viewer or listener, you for sure have crap lying around.  That's just part of the game, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My tip this week is a kind of interesting new take on the mobile keyboard.  It's called 8PEN, and I'm not quite sold on it yet.  You have to spend some time with it to learn how to type with it.  But it's an Android app. It's in the Android market now.  I think it's like a buck ninety nine or maybe maybe a pound ninety nine.  But it lets you type by dragging your finger across a grid  and kind of an eight figure eight motion gesture.  And there's actually a YouTube video and I'm searching for it now.  That you can see kind of the 8PEN dot com.  You can you can watch a demonstration of how it works.  So if you don't like pecking away at regular Android keyboard,  Swipe didn't do it for you. 8PEN might be it.  The problem with 8PEN, though, is it's like the learning curve is pretty steep.  I only spent a few minutes with it and it definitely took me some time to get used to it.  But I've heard from people who took suck it out and learned the new way to type  that it was said that it was super, super fast.  So skip ahead in this video.  It does a kind of thing.  It says typing on your mobile phone is really slow.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  When it gets to the point, it looks like an X. Yeah.  So this is so this is how it works.  You start your finger starts in the middle and then kind of flows around  and chooses letters. We're it's really weird, but also really kind of kind of interesting.  So the letters are going to show up soon. They're going to fill it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you like this better than Swipe or just an alternative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just an alternative. I'm not sold on it yet.  I just started playing with it today before the show.  And it was weird.  I could see the potential.  It's got the steep learning curve.  And this one, that's what I'd worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how to type with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, that's that's the thing.  And actually on that demo, the letters should fill in.  If you skip ahead, you'll see where the letters, the letters will show up.  So it's kind of we.  Yeah. So keep going. Keep going.  The letters still aren't there.  They are. You can see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's just weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it just it would take some time to get used to it.  But once you get a sense of where the letters are and they've actually designed  the keyboard so that the the letters that we most use in English language  are closer to the middle, the letters that we use least on the outer outer edges.  So it's easier to type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good. And then they then they scramble up.  So they're in different order.  I guess you get your choice.  This is the equivalent of the Dvorak keyboard.  For sure. So, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is kind of like for the brave folks who really kind of want a whole new way  to type in your mobile phone.  I mean, the premise is good is that typing on your mobile phone is just painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have to go to the center after each letter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you start and you start at the center and you end at the center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so you're just kind of going.  You just kind of use it.  OK, OK. That's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's weird, but it's also how long have you been using it and have you learned it?  I literally just start playing with today.  I spent about I worked this tutorial.  I spent about 10 minutes today and I started to get it toward the end.  But then I then I had to get ready for the show.  But I think if you spend like a good 20 minutes with it, which is a lot to ask,  I know, for kind of the initial user experience,  you can start typing really fast and people people who have spent the time  say that they absolutely love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you think about it, why should the QWERTY keyboard make any sense  on a touch screen is completely sensible that we would want to reinvent it,  except that there's all this built up muscle memory and stuff that we've got to.  Right. I'm willing. I'll try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can you can program gestures to you.  What is it search for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  8PEN, the number 8PEN.  How much is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a pound ninety nine in the Android market.  You can also if there are certain things you type a lot, you can create a gesture.  So you can say like sideways eight is going to be like talk to you later.  Leo or something like that.  So you can program in things that you say often, like your email address  or something that's annoying to type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  All right. H-PEN, the number 8PEN, it's on the Android market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I had one more thing.  I'm sorry. I had some some geeks on Twitter saying that you have to mention this  for nerds who run their own web server.  Google released Mod Page Speed, which is an Apache module  which can speed up your web pages by 50 percent.  Check it out if you run your own web server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's better than some of the other caching solutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's on top of other.  Oh, I see. Yeah. Yeah.  So it's Apache module.  And there's a there's a demo of an AdSense site running it and not running it.  And it's almost almost a 50 percent increase. Wow.  Yeah. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Google's all about the fast web, as we know. Yes.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So another genius stole my three things Google made a mistake with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sorry, Jeff.  It's too small a number. You can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all right.  I was going to raise it and sacrifice it anyway, because it was it was relevant.  So Facebook said that the sheer number of fans alone,  imagine the extra data they have, but that alone  predicted more than 70 percent of key races.  Yes. Wow.  More fans equals 74 percent winning percentage in key house races.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I saw Randy Zuckerberg on CNN say that the top three  befriended people were GOP candidates.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't that interesting?  It is. And 80 percent of Senate wins foreshadowed on Facebook,  says their press release.  House Democrats incumbents lost on Facebook before losing on Election Day.  That's to say that 46 House Democratic incumbents lost their seats yesterday.  More than 78 percent of them had fewer Facebook fans than their challengers,  which I think in part was because they were the old farts. Right.  So it's just it's just really fascinating.  And again, that's that's a very simple, simple, quick layer  of the data that's there and friends.  But, you know, if you really start to analyze the discussion  about these candidates beforehand on Twitter and Facebook and back to the kind  of we feel fine thing, imagine what's there to predict races in more reliable ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is like Larry saying, we know what you want before you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kind of. Eric said, we know where you are.  We know what you want. That's Eric. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very interesting.  Kevin, you got a little tip for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do. I recently was in Florida and I got off the plane and I swear  I didn't plan this, but I got off the plane and my wife and I were starving.  And I Google Maps searched for Chipotle.  No. And I did. I'm sorry.  And so I looked for it and I was with my Nexus one and I was like, come on.  Come on. Welcome to TRIB.  This week in the windows.  And I kept looking for it and it didn't know where I was.  It just the GPS was all messed up.  And I kept trying to say, I'm not in Buffalo.  Come on. Can't you tell from the weather?  And it wouldn't respond.  And so I I moaned about it on my complete Android Twitter feed, like I tend to do.  And one reader gave me a really good recommendation  for an app called GPS status and toolbox.  And you just search for GPS status.  That'll usually bring it up in the market.  And it's it's a it's a data geek's dream  because you can use the share button and literally send your GPS coordinates to people.  Very specific, very specific type of stuff.  And you can see, you know, all kinds of crazy.  If you were to geocaching, this would be a great app.  But the main thing that I liked it for is that you can use it to reset  your GPS data in your phone.  And I guess sometimes I'm not an expert on how it works, but, you know, your GPS  location, your your pings get stored inside the phone kind of locally.  And you can set this to just wipe out your GPS and get it restarted  without having to actually restart your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you need to get rid of the Almanac Almanac files so it will reload.  There you go. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and a reader tell a Twitter follower tells me that you can also use it  to automatically wipe out your GPS every so often, which gives you a slightly shorter  react was a longer reacquisition time.  But still, it would have been just the first time, just the first time.  And it would have been a much nicer thing for me to have when I was in Florida,  trying to get to in a for mentioned Mexican themed fast food restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, every time I travel, that happens to me because you have to create  new Almanac pages, which tell it where the satellites are and all that stuff  before you can get a good a good fix. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good tip. So GPS, status and toolbox.  The GPS status should just bring it up. Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a couple of actually three tips for you.  Of course, there is a new Facebook app, one point four.  So go to your Android marketplace and get it has a lot of nice features.  If you're a Facebook user.  Also, Twitter has updated its app to give it the same basically  the same look and feel as the iPhone version of Twitter, which was basically Tweety.  So if you are old Tweety user, you'll be very happy about the new Twitter Android app,  which is a little bit more powerful.  And I don't know if they got rid of the clouds.  I hope they did the moving stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You never like those clouds.  I like those clouds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Kevin was mentioning, as we mentioned, that drop.  Yo is going away.  Sam Lesson is hired by Facebook and Facebook, unlike FriendFeed,  which they kind of continue to run, they said, you know, we're not creating any more  free drop. Yo accounts. We've got a paid account.  You better get out by December. That's it. It's over.  And December 15th. Yeah, I was looking for a replacement, too.  Now, this isn't exactly a one for one feature replacement,  but it's very intriguing.  And in fact, I found out about it because they tweeted.  They said, hey, folks, we're looking for a drop.  You know, replacement, you should think a little bit about Tonido.  Are you aware of this one, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seen it. I didn't I guess I didn't dig into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's two parts to this.  There's a hardware part and a software part.  You don't have to have the hardware.  I have ordered the hardware, which is basically Pogo Plug Plus.  It includes BitTorrent and other features.  But there's a software version that basically gives you a right click,  share this file and effectively creates on your own hard drive  a file shared much like a drop.  EO would be that's private and secure.  You send this special unique link to the person you want to share the file with.  I guess you have to leave your machine on.  But otherwise, it kind of does the work for you.  If you know, this might even be easier than drop.  EO since you don't have to upload anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a password protect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I have to play with it.  You do have a you know, it's secure by obscurity because it's an odd U.R.L.  Although you can create a public share as well with your user name.  Dot Tony Doide dot com.  So it's a very interesting.  And then if you add the hardware to it, you really have your own cloud storage,  you know, with your own hard drives and so forth.  So it's very interesting.  It's not exactly drop EO, but it is fully software based.  And it has some interesting features in some ways might make it better than drop.  There's no storage limit at all, for instance.  So well, well, we're looking at I signed up for it and I've ordered the hardware  and I'll give you a review of the hardware when it arrives.  I'm a big POGO plug fan. I love POGO plug.  But there's a free software service as well.  And that that might be something that drop EO refugees might want to look into.  All right. That's it. We're out of time.  Boy, are we out of time. Thank you, everybody.  Jeff's got to go catch a train.  Thank you, Jeff Jarvis, true true author.  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
