Joining us back in her home in San Diego right now, the wonderful Gina Tripati.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Good afternoon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Back from her travels to the Great Britain, the Great Britain.  The Great Britain.  As opposed to the not-so-Great Britain and the East Coast.  I'm doing that because people in Southern California call highways the 101, the 405.  Did you do that in San Diego?  Is that just a Los Angelino thing?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, that's a San Diego thing, and it's taken me a really long time.  I also, I want to say highway.  I don't want to say freeway.  So it's hard for me to get the five and the freeway, but yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a strange colloquialism that's unique to that area.  It is, it is.  Speaking of strange, Jeff Jarvis is also here, the author of What Would Google Do?  And he's a professor of journalism at CUNY.  C-U-N-Y.  If you say CUNY, I guess people on the East Coast know what CUNY is, but I don't know  if it's generally known.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  People know City College in New York.  That's part of the system.  We have 250,000 degree seeking students.  Wow.  500,000 total students.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We have an interesting fourth today.  Heather Gold is in studio with us.  Hi.  Heather is a comic and a tummeler.  Yep.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  What's a tummeler?  A tummeler is somebody who brings people together and actually-  A maven, a social maven.  In a way, the comics and the cat skills back in the day, in the Mel Brooks day, were hired  not just to perform, but also to get everybody at the resort together.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Like a cruise director, like Gopher.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, gosh.  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You put it that way.  No, Julie.  Julie, not Gopher.  Julie.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Julie McCoy.  I just had a crush on her.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, she was cute.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What was her name again?  Me too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She had a big coke problem later, I think.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I didn't have the best of taste until I got married.  Hey, chat room, who was Julie?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Who was Julie?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Lauren Tewes.  Lauren Tewes.  Whoa.  Did you know that?  Of course.  If there's random television questions from the 80s, I know them.  Whoa.  In the 70s.  That's easy for me.  That's some of the value I bring.  So I do, I've been performing for a while and actually done my share of internet.  Internet Time was part of a team at Apple years ago that helped start webcasting this  very thing we're doing.  No kidding.  A long time ago.  At Apple TV in Cupertino?  Yeah.  Early, it was QuickTime TV.  Very early, 95, 96.  Build the first sites for Apple.  Build Apple's first revenue producing site.  What was that?  It was called Music Fan.  It was an enhanced TV site.  Before Jobs came back when we were supposed to not be doing music.  So I was part of the music group but we were like underground.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because the Beatles would get pissed off so you couldn't do music.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah.  They didn't have the guts to sort of go big picture.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nothing scarier than a mad Yoko.  I'm telling you, you don't want to tangle with it.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah, I worked in the film business.  Anyway, I started performing and a lot of my early audience were geeks and they were funny.  So I started thinking what if I didn't write all the jokes and I ran it like open source,  the object oriented software.  So I started trying to figure out how to perform with the people who were the so-called audience  lives.  I've been doing that 10 years.  Now when I speak a lot at internet conferences, I talk about the stuff that I learned from  performing and I teach people presenting but mostly un-presenting.  How to kind of undo stuff in a way that connects people.  Because now the real time web and the social web is kind of around, caught up to, closer  to live performance, really the skills you have from live experiences connecting people.  I think you're right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's actually an interesting insight.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is kind of now you're, the internet is public.  You're doing a public performance.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  More and more people are doing a people, like I think everyone's a performance artist on  Twitter.  That idea that the private and public kind of being melded.  That's very interesting.  Also, the things that you can't automate so much online are the way you bring people together,  the kind of human skills.  And that's the stuff I'm particularly interested in.  And I think will matter more and more, especially when you want to create a conversation or  a site or an experience.  Like how do you make one that makes people really stick around?  How do you make a conversation that matters to people?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Heather's going to do a new show on our Twitter network starting January, did we say 14th?  I think it's 14th.  Tuesdays at 7pm Pacific, 10pm Eastern.  It's called?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Tamil Vision.  It's got the best in me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  She's hoping.  And I'll extend this invitation that one of the or the other of the guys from Foreigner  will donate the music to Double Vision to be the theme.  Yes.  We would love that.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Me and Kevin Marks and Deb Schultz.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good cast.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  We'll be regular and then we'll have all kinds of...  So there's the early...  There's a lot of stuff happening online right now around social business.  There's a lot of different phrases getting thrown around.  Social interaction design, IDOs playing with it, lots of different designers, lots of different  businesses trying to figure out...  People are trying to figure out how to Webify, Web 2.0ify their businesses, but there's things  moving from hierarchies to networks.  How do you actually manage experiences that way without being so locked down?  And tumbling is just a skill set that lots of people have, but some could use more of.  That's a little less telling everyone what to do, more creating conditions for good stuff  to happen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think starting now, we're going to start every show with a list of acquisitions at  Google.  Nice.  Because it just seems like they're really on a tear.  Jeff, what did Google acquire this week?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Besides the North Pole, which we just decided...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We decided they're getting the elves for the...  They're going to discontinue the whole Santa's Workshop thing, but they're looking at the  elves for their engineering expertise.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I like the idea of Sergei as Santa.  Etherpad is the big one.  What is Etherpad?  Gina, real questions I pass over to you.  It's a wonderful collaborative tool whose team is now going to go into wave, and they  killed Etherpad immediately and pissed off happy Etherpad customers.  Damn.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That sucks.  Exactly.  Yeah.  It's a collaborative text editor.  And actually, I wasn't a big user of Etherpad, but it seems to have a very strong geek following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it like sub-EtherEdit?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's like sub-EtherEdit.  From what I understand, I can't create a new pad now because it's closed.  But from what I understand, it was a sub-EtherEdit, but in the cloud, in the browser.  Actually, John Resig, who's the lead developer on jQuery, which is an excellent JavaScript  framework, he was saying that he was really disappointed because the jQuery team used  Etherpad to collaborate, which is pretty interesting.  So I think it's kind of same idea as wave, but better than wave.  You could simultaneously edit this workshop.  Better than wave?  Yeah.  Better than wave.  Can you believe that, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can't be.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love wave, as you know.  Wrote a book about it.  I love it so much.  Some of wave's editing capabilities, like the text editor really could be a lot better.  I mean, like, for simple things that you expect from a text editor, like you can't control  Z. You know, if you accidentally cut a paragraph and you hit control Z, nothing happens.  You can't undo.  So, from what I understand, Etherpad was much, much better about that kind of stuff.  And everybody who used it was saying, I was on wave and it wasn't nearly as good as Etherpad.  So this is why they acquired it, right?  I mean, it was for the technology.  I mean, this is good news for wave users.  I mean, eventually, assuming that they're going to roll the features in Etherpad into  wave, but right now it really sucks.  And they handled it terribly.  I mean, it was just like, OK, sold, done, no more pads.  Sold, done, closed.  Yeah.  I mean, some people had like embedded Etherpad into their blogging tools and, you know, they  went to go write a new blog post.  It was like, Google bought us, sorry.  So there was just no way to, you know, there was just no easing of the transition.  And the blog post was kind of like, didn't acknowledge its users and didn't really apologize  or give a reason.  I mean, it was just it was kind of weird.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  On Marshall Kirkpatrick complained, too, about the process that's happening now out there  that you're a smart engineer, you get a job at Google, you leave Google, you start a company,  your company gets acquired by Google, you come back, you work for Google, rinse, repeat,  rinse, repeat.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Right, right.  Sounds like Washington, D.C. in lobbyists.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a revolving door, isn't it?  Well, that's yeah.  How could Google have handled this better, Gina?  Could they have just kept Etherpad up for a little longer or?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They could have said, you know, we got bought.  Yay.  Thank you for all your support and for and for using the product.  And you have four weeks to migrate, you know, to you know, you can make new pads and edit  existing pads for another four weeks.  And then on that date, you know, then we're done.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And have they ever done that with another product before?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I can't think of a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They kept Jaiqu up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They kept Jaiqu up for a long time.  They went kind of the semi-private, but they kept it up.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did Grand Central stay up?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Grand Central was up for a couple of years.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, Grand Central was up for a while and they just closed it.  Yeah, they just closed it.  And Google Notebook, which was is basically essentially killed and they're not they're  not they're not developing it anymore, but they kept it up and running.  So, I mean, they just could have given users a few weeks.  I mean, you know, I saw in the comments, some people were saying, I was just telling  somebody yesterday how great Etherpad was and now I just look dumb.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, no, you don't look dumb.  You look like Google agreed.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  My God, it's like when you like the band, when they're really cool, nobody knows them.  But then they not only does everybody know them, they just disappear.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Don't you hate that when that happens?  And like you were there first, but now it's like everybody's there.  And my son says that he says, you know, he goes to Scott concerts.  He says people don't know how to skank anymore.  He's only 15.  He says kids today, they just don't know how to skank.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  We really need some help on skanking.  You can call Tiger.  He's pretty good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, I think I'm going to have to break out the rim shot for this one.  I remember seeing the first time it was a I can't remember who did it, but it was a  great demo of a guy writing an article.  Do you remember what that was?  Oh, I can't remember.  But it was just incredible because you could watch it was you could play it back in real  time. It was just him editing his article and watch as he developed his ideas.  And then they would they would fill out.  And it was a really fun demo.  And you're right. And I'm going to I'm going to side with you on this one, Gina.  I think it is a little bit better, at least certainly a little bit more transparent than

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Wave. How many people could write on it at once?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know what the question.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm not sure. OK, well, fumble.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm told all the people who are on it, they'll get automatic invitations to wave.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you should join every two point thing there is.  And that way, hope that Google acquires it so you get an invitation.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is kind of a big problem.  I mean, everyone's apprehension about using cloud apps for their data is like, what  happens if the company just goes away someday?  And I think that if you know, if companies could come up with could be good about making  these transitions a little easier and kind of announcing them a little bit ahead of  time, that people would feel less scared about moving into cloud apps.  I mean, this is a totally, you know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google's damaged cloud computing by this behavior in a little.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, in a way. I mean, now when people say to me, hey,  what if a company just goes away?  Why should I start using a product and it just goes away and I can't get my data out?  I mean, you can export your your your etherpads and you can't edit existing etherpads.  You just can't create new ones.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that would be an expense. But I think you're right, Gina, that that would be the  proper way to do this is to have a policy of saying that when we buy something, if at  all possible, we are going to migrate your data to the new thing that we bought it for.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We're going to get the guys from Data Liberation Front, the Google page that is kind of  designed to be the answer to this.  Their plan was, look, you know, we'll have this site where our goal is to make it easier  for you to get your data in and out of Google products.  Is that enough of a response?  No, because it's not merely the data, is it?  It's also. I have an investment in this in this tool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Your data, maybe the content, maybe your groups and community.  There you go. Maybe, you know, it's the functionality.  It's a lot of things. Your contacts.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I mean, if Twitter went down, it occurred to me, I'd be like, I couldn't even get in  touch with some people I really want to talk to.  I mean, I have fewer phone numbers than I used to have.  And I realized I'd be hosed.  I mean, I like trust Dev and stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, yeah, but there's nothing to say they're not going to just go out of business.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Google isn't going to just one day say, we bought Twitter yesterday.  Bye bye, everyone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There would be a howl if that happened.  Sure. But you know.  Ashton Kutcher alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because he's so in touch with people.  Oh, that's the reason to do it, Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Put a stake in A plus K.  Any other acquisitions besides Etherpad or is that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, I actually looked I just looked up on the on the Wiki list, and that's all there has been since November.  They're starting a dictionary.  They're starting DNS.  I'm sure we'll talk about soon.  But I don't see any other acquisitions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's the dictionary?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here it is.  Google launches its own dictionary.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, it's just it's just a new page.  So once. So right now, if you type define colon and a word into the Google search box, it would give you  dictionary definitions at the top of the search results page.  And now it's just kind of a dedicated page.  It's kind of like the movie times just a dedicated page with just definitions.  So it's kind of like, you know, the Google, you know, the Google's own content.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I see it's pushing me to Wikipedia.  It's Princeton.  Well, it's various things.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  It looks like it's very I think it's an aggregation of several looked up.  Define skank.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Any substance picture of Tiger Woods?  No, I love it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you just put in define in the search, the first suggestion is is love.  Oh, do you mean that's Tiger?  I mean, love?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When you say skank, do you mean love?  Sure, you do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But one difference is they used to send to answers.com and now they're sending to.  Looks like a variety.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, not just Princeton.  I see Wikipedia, World NetWeb, Wiktionary.  So it looks like it's a search.  You also you also see you could look in different languages like what I looked up.  Skank in French.  Skank is a Brazilian pop rock group.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, I think from the piece I read, it's a mixture of Princeton,  something at Princeton and.  Well, I'm just saying I'm saying Wikipedia also.  I have to go back to the piece.  They bought something from.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  General January Delos,  can you know me doing Bolo?  See, I don't think skank means the same in other languages.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  The guy from answers.com said, oh, I don't care.  We don't care because they only drove five percent of our traffic.  But I don't know that I buy that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you know that in Spanish, skank is a funny way of saying a skein of yarn?  Seriously? That's what Google says.  And Google wouldn't lie to us.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  It's an amount of yarn. OK.  So I think it's a new law for the show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm going to play Dvorak here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Moving on with the news, man.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Dvorak, I object because Jeff Dvorak would be all over this.  He would never leave the topic of skank for the entire time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He might. Well, Leslie, you know, makes even skanked them doll,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  which he just did. Thank you so much, Jeff.  Let's move along to an ad.  You're not excited enough.  Let me mention our friends at Citrix, who do the great product go to assist.  This is a fantastic tool for people who want to help their family and friends.  I know during the holidays, when you go home, the first thing that happens is,  honey, could you look at the computer?  It seems to be booting a little slow, like eight minutes to get started.  And you go look at it and you go, oh, see, with go to assist,  you could have been keeping that computer clean and fresh all the time.  For pros, it's there's nothing better.  It's using the great Citrix remote access back, you know, behind the scenes  that is there's none better. Easy to use.  It does not traversal. Very simple to configure your router.  You don't have to configure it. It just goes right by it.  It has some features for the IT pro that support pro things like eight  simultaneous sessions so you can start a cleanup on one, a scan on another,  install on a third, and you still have four, five, six, seven and eight to work on.  You never, you know, eight sessions, no waiting.  It allows you to check and find out what operating system is running,  what security system offers running in the background.  On attendant support too, but it's very easy to get a support session started.  I actually use go to assist a lot with my family.  You might want to take a look at it.  You could try it free for the next 30 days, get you right through the holidays.  Go to assist dot com slash twig.  I really I'm serious. This, you know, get this now.  Log in to the folks computer just to see how bad it is.  Then you'll know what tools to bring anything from, you know,  antivirus scan to a sledgehammer. Go to assist dot com slash twig.  We thank Citrix so much for their support of this week in Google.  There's a cloud product right there.  Eleven Chrome extensions. That's good news.  It was seemed like just yesterday last last week that Gina,  you were saying Chrome's going to have some extensions and now there's already  11 in the Chrome extensions directory. Are they, are they any good?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Um, I don't know. I haven't tried any, you know,  Chrome is totally my like stripped down really fast browser. Yeah. I mean,  I, I almost don't want them. It's like, it's like Firefox. The thing is,  I'm sure that some of these are pretty good and some of them really do look good,  but no one, no one's going to beat Firefox's, um, selection of extensions.  And if I want a browser tricked out with extensions,  I'm still going to go with Firefox. Um, and you know,  some of these look pretty good. Some of them look pretty useless. Yeah.  Some of them look kind of useless too. Um, yeah, I don't know.  I really want to see Google pull off a new browser that also is extensible,  right? Because Firefox, like Firefox is slow often because of leaky extensions.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Extensions. Yes, exactly right. Extensions can ruin your experience.  Yeah. Now is this, this isn't this chrome extensions.org is not a Google site.  We should say, um, it says we are, we are not affiliated or sponsored by Google.  We're only providing a place to Chrome extension developers to showcase their  work.  And you could tell because it has a belly fat ad on it. And I don't think,  although it is, it is a very modern, you know,  it's not your traditional belly fat ad. In fact,  I would say worth going just to see the unusual belly fat ad.  What is it with? Is it, is it presumed that anybody uses the internet either needs,  has belly fat or brown teeth and it's like just kind of, you know,  or you can drink a kai berry or a kai. What are you pronouncing? Is that a kai?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I don't know that. Does anybody really click on any of these ads?  I mean, do they? I hope not. It's got a torrent.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You should see the ads I get when I write about my prostate. Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay. I'm not going to do any of those jokes. You know what, Jeff,

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I can't afford my own keywords. You know,  you do any performing for lesbians and that's it.  Like you're priced out of your own world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I actually think lesbian is a pretty good keyword. You can't,

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I can't afford lesbian. I just happen to be one,  but I can't afford myself apparently.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think we have a show title.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The keyword liberation front. Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Free the lesbians. Free the keywords. Torrent downloader extension. No,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't want to put that on my Chrome.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I love that it's, I love that Chrome is so simple.  I stopped using every other browser. I love it. It's like Twitter.  Why they had lists. Like I loved,  I went to Twitter from email cause it was like simple and fast.  Everything flowed. That was the whole point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now you're going to lose it all. Well, I'm not going to add any extensions.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  What extension could they give me that I could possibly want?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google finance ads, real time news streams. Is this, um, I don't know.  What does this mean?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, I was thinking this,  I was going to launch into my hyper personal news stream. Oh no, shtick.  But I don't think it's that. I think it's just really no different from, you know,  um, friend feed. Yeah. Or, or, or, or, you know,  the early days of point cast. Oh,

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  oh, M G whatever happened to good old. You could say, oh my God,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I am allowed to say God. You can't say what the, yeah,  I can say God say Dick. Did I say you couldn't say?  Thanks Dick. I only mean it as a nickname for people named Richard, but, uh,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  so Mr Cheney point cast. Let's, let's just go back to my prostate again.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I let's just go back in time and remember the future of the internet.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  The future of the internet. I'm going,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  when I saw a point cast way back when I worked for the new houses,  cutting asked and there was some excitement. I said, no,  I can do that with a refreshing webpage.  And I went back to the office and the great developer we had,  woman named Janice Abrams created, um,  this news flash thing that just brought in six AP feeds on a page that were  fresh once a minute. It was wildly popular.  It was more popular than anything we ever did with AP packaging.  It was news in the raw. It was streaming. So yeah, I think,  I was going to get tempted to say this is a big deal from Google, but it's not,  I decree it's not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it's just, it's just Ajax, you know.  I remember though when point cast was big that you couldn't use the internet for  the first half hour of the morning because everybody would go into the office,  turn on their system and point cast would start downloading megabytes data all  at once.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I spent for a little while working for a startup named Zing.  All that it did was it was an app that pushed flash between page loads.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And built content for, although it decided to change what it did every five minutes,  which had no control over. But I mean, I still see that kind of stuff,  but you know where I see,  I see in elevators and I see it when I go to a corner store to buy something,  they're pushing the news. But I mean,  I still think that stuff will show up in kiosks and wherever else.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But point cast was silly because your demographic was in the restroom and wasn't  there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I went to their demo page, which is google.com slash finance,  since market news, I went there about a minute ago. It's still loading. I mean,  come on. Uh, that's not, that's not, uh, faster. Yeah, they need it.  They need a better, I like real time. I'm a big fan of real time.  I think that's great. I think friend feed is superb,  but if it doesn't load, it's not real time. It's kind of like, okay.  Uh, let's talk about Google public DNS.  I actually for a minute wanted to make this my tool of the week. It's,  is this Google doing the, uh, uh, oh, uh, what is it?  I use a, I use a open DNS. Is that basically what this is, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's, that's pretty much it. Right. So your DNS servers are the,  are the, um,  are the servers that figure out what domain name associates with what IP  address, right? So when you go to www.twit.tv,  that's actually, uh, an IP address of the twit servers. And,  but you don't have to remember the numbers. You just have to remember the name,  but your DNS server, um, resolves those two figures out which is which.  So Google public DNS and so an open DNS, which has been around a lot longer,  but Google public DNS launched this week is just a really fast cash servers,  a huge date,  Google hosted database of DNS names and IP addresses that go with them.  So, and they're saying that using Google, uh,  public DNS will make the lookups for websites a lot faster.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well,  and also as a security issue because a bind had a big security flaw and a lot of  people who were running DNS servers,  including probably your ISP were very slow to fix it.  And this was a huge problem. And, uh,  I immediately instructed everybody who listens to my shows to start using open  DNS cause they had, they were using a fixed version of bind. Um, and you know,  that the, the programs I had seen the test bind found, you know,  huge number of servers including Comcast and so forth weren't updated.  Now they most for the most part are, uh,  another advantage to using this is it's easy to remember 8888 or 8844.  Um, people normally use their ISP's DNS server, right?  Unless you've configured it otherwise.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, by default your computer is set to just, you know, use whatever DNS,  you know, you're just kind of plugged into, right? I mean,  normally people don't go in and set their DNS servers, you know,  to specific IP address.  But if you use open DNS or Google public DNS, you set it and it's 888 as you said,  which is pretty lucky, uh, IP address that they got. You know, I don't know.  It's interesting. I wonder if they approached Google,  approached open DNS to buy them. Um, and, uh,  because it seems like they would want to do that.  Open DNS has been around for a really long time and open DNS actually offers  more options than Google public DNS does. You can set filters, phishing filters,  you can set parental controls, you can make kind of changes, um, to,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I use it for parental controls and it's very effective.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And you can't do that stuff with Google public DNS.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And another thing is they're missing out on a revenue opportunity because one of  the things open DNS does, if you mistype a URL,  you get a special search page and some ISPs do this too. And it's, you know,  VeriSign tried to do it. People got upset by it that has, you know,  Oh, did you mean this? And some advertised links.  You'd think that'd be the reason Google wanted to do this,  but I just entered in a random address and it gave me the standard, uh, you know,  Firefox error message. It didn't replace it with a Google, a DNS page.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  David, uh, Ulovich.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  The bomb. I just want to say, I really like,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  he has a letter on open DNS about this, trying to be somewhat, um,  respectful, but he says that Google claims that it's better because it has no  ads or redirection. Then he says,  remember that the Google is also the largest advertising redirection company on  the internet. Right.  I think that Google's DNS services for the benefit of the internet would be  naive. Um, so you got a little pissing there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's, you know, it's kind of thing that end users don't really understand,  but when somebody owns your DNS server,  they do kind of own your experience of the internet.  I don't see anything going on with Google that would make me nervous about it at  this point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I agree Leo, but, but,  but is there kind of an end to end thing starting here where you have a Google  OS, a Google browser, Google DNS, Google search.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Trying to become like Apple of the internet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know, it's optional. As, as Eric Schmidt will always say,  there is always a very good competitor for every one of our services and you  can use it and we'll, we'll help you get your data out and you're not with us.  But if you go the Google way,

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  you get special extra prizes. That's what Steve Jobs says all the time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want some special extra prizes. Yeah. You know, I have to say,  I don't know David and I'm sure he's the bomb.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, he's a big supporter of the Heather Gold show. Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I recommend, but I have to say, I'm reading this article. Um,  and it's just kind of snotty. I mean,  it's like, well they're not us is basically his response,  but they're not us.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I mean,  anytime you're small and you've created something and somebody huge comes in

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to welcome to the real world, you know, NBC could start doing twit.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And I invite them to say they're not, I'll, you'll say the same thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe I would. Do you think I would? I would write an article saying,  let me tell you why NBC stock you are in an article.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You'll come on air or whatever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's not fifth.  It's not clear that internet users really want Google to keep control over so  much more of their internet experience than they do already from Chrome OS at  the bottom of the stack to Google search at the top.  This is exactly what you were talking about, Jeff and Heather from, uh,  it is, it is becoming an end to end infrastructure all run by Google,  the largest advertising company in the world.  I prefer a heterogeneous internet with lots of parties collaborating to make  this thing work. I'm with him on that. I mean, I guess.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the monoculture argument, right? Why would Google have felt this was a  necessity?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, this is, this is the question. Why are they doing this?  I mean, Jeff is right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's good. I don't know what you're referring to, but I'll take it.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You said end to end. I mean, why else? Why else?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  End to end. Ownage of the user's internet experience. I mean,  they're going to have a lot of data about where people go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pwnage. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a reason. Ownage rhymes with Pwnage. It's the same word.  That's what I have the crickets for.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Gina go there for a second. So no, but yeah,  then they in fact have, if they own DNS or a good portion of it,  they have much, much, much more data about traffic generally around the internet.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They know as much, they know as much as your eyes,  they know as much as your ISP knows. Right. Okay. Right. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So bingo, there's the value.  And if they motivate you to do it because they offer you free wifi,  we should only wish an OS, a browser.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Your number could be somewhere in here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Nope. I'm Leo. I'm thinking of a number between one and infinity.  I dare you to come up with it this week. I dare you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Very inside. You had to listen to last week's show.  Car Mac, the magician. Yeah.  Did you take the test your Google IQ quiz? Let's do that in a minute.  Test your, you guys know Google, right? CNBC. I did.  Did you watch the CNBC special? I meant to watch it. Cause you know,  I mean CNBC did a special on Google.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I saw a commercial for it in an airport at some point in my travels and was just  like, Oh, that looks so good. And I didn't get to see it. Did you see it?  Leo forgot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I forgot too. It's called inside the mind of Google.  I'm sure we can find the mind of Google right there. It sounds a little,  it's a bizarre. It's also like it's a guy.  It's Maria Barrett Bartiromo. So I don't know. I'm not Maria Bartiromo.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You really think she's the best teacher for this? Yeah. I'm not sure. I'm gonna,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  you know, I should have watched it, but

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  for some reason, my only reference derived from the word Google,  which means you're taking the quiz. Wait a minute.  German variation on nine pin bowling.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Everybody knows that. Yeah.  Is this Bay? This is for people who are not listening to this show.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I guess people who don't use Google. Yeah. Yeah. Come on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I tend to think that that special was probably for people who don't listen to  this show as well. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How much user generated data does Google process each hour? One gigabyte,  one petabyte, one terabyte, one infabyte.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Isn't Maria Bartiromo is the one who didn't get that you had to be 65 before  you could go on Medicare. So I don't know if I trust her reporting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sure she has people who write the content as I do.  As you do. As I do. So wait a minute. It's a mathematical term. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. Okay. Next question. Okay. Petabyte. I'm trying to catch up with you. Okay.  How much user generated petabyte an hour? Holy camole.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It'd have to be though. It'd have to be. Info, info bite. We like though.  I think I wish.  Infini bite.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Is it Infini bite? Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is Google's corporate model? All motto. All competition must be crushed.  Don't be evil. Property is theft. I like that.  I'm voting for property is theft because that's my motto.  We make money the old fashioned way we earn it. No, it's everybody.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Does anyone remember whose motto that is?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Because it was a John, it was John Housman who said,  we make money the old fashioned way.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Smith Barney. Smith Barney. We earn it. Smith Barney.  They still alive. I'm so confused. Smith Barney. Who knows?  We make it the old fashioned way. We steal it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We steal it like all good wasps.  Which religious figure received his own channel after Google bought  as I would say the video website YouTube. Was it Bishop Thomas Muti,  Pat Robertson, Pope Benedict the sixth or Rabbi Shmuley Boatek?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I bet all of them had it. I'm going to hope it's the Pope.  It's got to be the Pope. It is the Pope. But I bet all of them had it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is there a Rabbi Shmuley Boatek?  Oh, there has to be. Shmuley? Chat room?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Shmuley, Mr. I'm Michael Jackson's.  He is like he is really a problem for me as a Jew.  We don't have excommunication. Shmuley is?  But I have to tell you, I'm into open source religion.  I do know who he is and I think we should borrow from other religions.  And I think we should borrow from the Catholics and excommunicate Shmuley  and Woody Allen, by the way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's a badger. He's a self loathing.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  He's like a self appointed rabbi. He's the sister of Michael Jackson.  After Michael Jackson died, he came out the book.  It's like I have the inside scoop. I'm his spiritual teacher.  He's just there to put his face on any.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He's America's rabbi. Right.  It says so on his web page. That's right. He is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's a self promoting Jew. His name is Shmuley. He is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He wouldn't be the first. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He has a channel. He does.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Rabbi Shmuley. You're supposed to turn people away three times.  It's the way Apple used to be. You don't want to be a Jew.  Apple is like the Jews. It's a lot of work.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, there now. The elite clip is Rabbi Shmuley kosher sex lecture.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You have to go kosher.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  He's there to unify people with his very loving.  He's ecumenical.  He's he's pretty religious.  He's religious if you include, you know, PR as part of your religion.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Show you learn so much in this show. I just love it.  Question five. In 2006, Google entered into an agreement with Fox  Interactive Media for search and advertising.  This is stupid. On what social network?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You should say Google wished they hadn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, Google made a horrible error.  Obviously, MySpace Google acquired a software company called Keyhole.  That sounds it doesn't sound good.  And renamed things their 3D map.  I'm sorry. Keyhole makes me laugh.  And renamed their 3D map.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Who named their company Keyhole?  Can we figure that someone figured out I'm going to the RC room to see who figures that out?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  For six years, we worked at Tech TV to figure out  how we could do a show called Blowhole.  And we never did. We never could.  We couldn't figure out what.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  At least it wasn't Glory. OK.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want one named Smygma.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know why.  So sorry. John Hasman, by the way, passed away in 1988.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Well, if you know that, you're going to know who named a Keyhole.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Was it Google 3D map?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Keyhole is named after a satellite, says Ron Shot in the chat.  That's right. Ron Shot.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  If I could send cookies, someone please make me an application  I can do this with. I'd send you cookies now. Real ones.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is something you've been questing for for some time.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I really am jonesing for this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So they named their renamed Keyhole's 3D map to 3D map, Atlas Earth or Friendfinder.  Earth. Gurgle Earth. Earth.  A couple of Utes.  What was the first project undertaken by Google philanthropy?  Google.org. Google.org.  An endowment for the Democratic voice of Burma.  Somehow I doubt it.  An endowment for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.  Dude. Development of a plug-in hybrid car or.  Founding the one laptop.  Negroponte sounds to me.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I go with the MIT thank you gift.  Am I wrong? Oh, yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Totally wrong. Car plug-in hybrid.  Wow. I thought I was with you.  I go with the turtle wax. You guys knew that?  Gina, you knew that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  No, I went with the old PC first and then the hybrid second.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, no, no.  They installed their own solar panels and stuff.  There's a book about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I heard that something like what would.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What did they what did Google do?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I heard that 80 out of the first 100 or something.  Tesla's were sold to Google employees.  Is that true?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The first 20 were sold to Jason Calacanis.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I know. Does Jason have more than one or he just talks about it enough  that it sounds like he is 80 of them?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Talks about it so much it sounds like all right.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  He's helping you can run the car, not in electricity, but on tweets.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you've taken this quiz, Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I would assume that the author of What Would Google Do should know each and every answer to this.  Well, I can't understand the next question, so I'm going to whine about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How much does the I'm feeling lucky button on Google Search  cost the company every year? Cost? Why would it cost you?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Because you're missing ads.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you missed the ads.  You're missing ads.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  It's like this is a Craig Newmarkey question.  They're like saying more than 100 billion.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's got to be it's got to be China.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It has said that if they had an ad on the on the home page,  it would be worth billions and billions in Carl's second land.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So so we're going to guess D more than 100 million dollars.  Yes. Yeah.  And the answer is, is that your final answer?  Yes, that's correct.  Bypassing search results page, Heather, you win.  While only one percent of all searches actually use this feature,  the price for Google is still pretty steep.  One hundred ten million dollars.  The user misses all the advertising.  So why does the company bother?  According to Marissa Meyer,  it's possible to become too dry, too corporate, too much about making money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that's what's delightful about I'm feeling lucky.  We call it the delightful button at Google.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, you know, who doesn't want to feel lucky?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm feeling lucky. I like the I'm feeling like, you know,  if you type twit and press, I'm feeling lucky.  I am I you win. I win.  I'm the number one twit.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, that's nice. Isn't that good?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Twit. I feel like this is insurance against them being accused of being evil.  We're not evil. Look, we have an I'm feeling lucky button.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That makes you not evil.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Look, we're leaving so much money on the table.  I think you're right about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're trying not to be too greedy.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I just put in twit and press, I'm feeling lucky.  And I got this the I'm feeling lucky T.M.  button automatically takes you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's an explanation for the I'm feeling lucky.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yet it did not take me to it. That's bizarre.  Maybe it's just me for me, especially in August.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe they're watching us right now to use the I'm feeling lucky button.  You might want to try the I'm feeling delightful button instead.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Nice. I'm feeling excited.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And mine says, no, you're not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I should have an I'm feeling unlucky button that only pulls you to spam.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  That would be kind of just a rant.  It's a random age, just random.  You're going to explore. That's how we have discovery.  They won't just be a search company.  They'll be a discovery company with the I'm an unlucky button.  Do that discovery.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what they need. They need to.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, that's the whole competent right.  The Twitter Twitter Twitter.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Discovery versus search.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, but just I think the whole I like Ohm's phrase social OS.  And I do think the social operating system of the people I love it.  Use the web are definitely going to be the I wouldn't call it competition,  but the more relevant way to find stuff other than through an ad and a search.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In August, 2005, Google sold 14 plus million shares of its stock.  What is the significance? Oh, you have to give you the whole number.  And I can I actually if I give you the number, you'll know one for one five  nine two six five.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I don't know. But I'm all mathematicians would know some math.  It's a math. It's a pie.  It's pie without the pie.  Well, there's no three. It threw me.  I'm not as nerdy as you guys in that. Not fair.  Did you know, Jeff? No, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. So just just Jina and I knew.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, we knew it looked like a funny looking pie to me.  I was like, oh, pie, but weird.  Yeah. Three point one four one five nine is pie.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know how you remember that?  Oh, how I want to drink alcoholic, of course, after the  oh, how I want to drink alcoholic, of course, after the heavy chapters  on quantum mechanics.  Wow. Which of the five?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wow. I have a student who got a physics degree and he has pie  tattooed on his arm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, that's a good tattoo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that is that I would do.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I went to law school and people there tattooed their GPA in their arm.  Did you really go to law school? I did.  I'm embarrassed to say I took it.  Didn't pass it.  I did not. And I'm very proud of that now. Years later.  I'm feeling I'm feeling now.  Who's feeling lucky? I'm feeling lucky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This barred. You can't be.  You can't be this far.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Get when you pass the bar is that you can be worried about losing it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can't be disbarred if you have never been barred.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  That's right. It's a joy.  And you know what? Every startup I worked with loved everything about that.  I was like, yes, all right. A contract for you.  It'll be a page long and it will be practical.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was good. So in your early days, you got you got gigs as a unbarred lawyer.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I did biz dev. So I did deals. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you kind of knew what a contract looked like.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I would send a contract to the lawyer, but I would write it first  and try to make it short in English.  And then they tried to wear it up.  And then I'd, you know, revise it to make it English like again.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can't make you put you in the fraternity.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I'm not about joining the fraternities, really,  other than just the general geeky fraternity of the human race and love.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Shut up. Which of the following services was actually an April Fool's Day  hoax perpetrated by Google?  Was it Google Caffeine, Google Mail,  I mean, Google Toilet Internet Service Provider or TISP or iGoogle?  I think this is pretty obvious.  I'm going to have to say TISP.  And that's correct.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, Google Mail is on that list because Gmail launched on April 1st.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Oh, that's kind of a nice.  Yeah, no, that's fame. That's kind of a nice little.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, people were like, are they serious?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good little insight.  That's a great reveal.  I think Paul Buhay has said that a few times and that people he had to like say,  no, no, really, we're really doing it.  It's not a joke.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Inside the mind of Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank you for joining us for this special edition of

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Inside the Mind of Google Meets I Want to Be a Google Name.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I'm Maria Bartiromo and I use Google.  So I'm here to happily tell you about its mind.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you know if you put your search query in quotes, nothing will happen.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  I want to tell you a little bit about my car and then we will continue on  with more news and of course, Gina's tip of the week, my tool of the week  and Jeff's number of the week.  Before we do that, though, I want to mention Ford Sink.  Ford is, of course, the sponsor of the show.  Sink is their computer in a car that is mind boggling.  After the show, Heather, I'm going to take you out in my Mustang  and you can take a look at Ford Sink.  I was playing with it today.  You press the button and the whole idea is you don't take your eyes off the road,  your hands off the wheel, your safety first,  but you control everything with this button.  So you push the button.  You don't believe it either, do you?  It's pretty amazing.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  This is a pretend thing you're making.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm making this up.  If I were if let me put it this way, if Ford Sink didn't exist,  we would have had to invent it.  You push the button on the wheel, it goes,  because I have it in advanced mode, you can have voice prompts,  but I have I don't like to be told what to do.  It goes, and I say, I'll give you an example, I say audio sync  play this week in Google 19.  It starts playing.  I say play next to place 20.  I say play previous plays 18.  I say play similar.  It plays other podcasts.  I say play genre podcast.  It plays a podcast.  I say play NPR plays.  You show pressure.  I mean, it's it's like it knows what I want to say.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you say I'm feeling lucky,

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm a punk.  We'll do you punk.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can call of course, it works with your phone,  which would up to 25 different phones.  So if if you're like Gina and me and you collect cell phones,  works with my Android, works with my iPhone.  I'm getting the Nokia 900.  I say dial Gina.  I call Gina. Yeah. Call Gina Trapani.  I have to do the last thing because I know 15 Genas.  It has to be a favorite.  I hear you from East Coast. Yeah. Yeah.  Hey, Gina.  No, I think if I could say call Gina, I would call Gina.  Call Heather. You're the only one without a knee.  So I'd say call Heather without a knee and it would find you.  That's pretty. Yeah, it's really cool.  You can say, no, no, no.  OK, I'm exaggerating a little bit.  You can't say call Heather without an E.  It's not like there's a person in the computer.  There's a bunch of little elves in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going, Heather, without any.  Let's go through this Rolodex, see if we can find that.  It must be out here somewhere.  He would have said it if he had made it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got a 411 business search.  So you could say Navigation Starbucks.  It'll find it for you. You can call it.  Vehicle Health Report. This is cool.  You can say I want to what's my oil pressure?  What's my oil system? How's my drivetrain?  911 Assist. So if your airbags deploy, it calls 911, feeds in the GPS  coordinates and then lets you take over.  Do you have you had your airbags deployed ever?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Thankfully, no. It's a terrifying thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it hurt? You know what's worse?  And this happened to me.  You have a head on collision and your airbags don't deploy.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be bad. That's not good.  I wouldn't want that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It wasn't I was going five miles an hour.  So it wasn't like it was a death defying collision.  But I'm thinking, here I am. I'm sitting.  I just bashed into a car and my whole front end is crumpled.  And the airbags did not deploy all this time.  I've been driving this wasn't a Ford, I could tell you right now.  This piece of crap car.  And it was lying to me.  It has no airbags.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Stories about Tiger said that they only deploy over 33 miles.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, there's why.  So I did not.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So he was going slowly.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  He's doing it. We'll just talk to you.  Hi, Leo. It does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is a nice lady in there.  You can say, oh, yeah, actually, you know, you could do you could say,  I want personalized news sports weather, read your sports scores  and tell you the weather.  You could say five day forecast to give you the five day forecast.  It has GPS built into it, so you don't need to buy the GPS system.  I can go on and on.  And I think I have.  But I best thing to do, be a sink my ride podcast dot com.  Sink my ride podcast dot com.  You can learn more and how you can win a nano or Zune.  You know, Ford has a social media guy, a very high level guy, Scott Monty,  who runs their social media strategy.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  They were doing a thing where they were they were giving away a certain number,  because I know a bunch of bloggers who are doing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we're getting there.  We're giving away 15 nanos and zooms.  So if you go to sync my ride podcast, you can see how to tweet to win.  But it's only through December 9th.  So it's just a few more days left.  What you do is you say, hey, listening to Heather, Gina and Jeff on Twig.  And you put the hashtag pound sync my ride podcast.  And then you're automatically in the drawing.  They're giving away 15 nanos, 15 zooms  through December 9th.  There's your chance to win.  We thank Ford for their support.  And next time you're at a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury dealer,  just do yourself a favor.  By the way, and this is not part of the ad because the ads really for Ford sync.  Ford was the only US motor company, big one, one of the big three,  not to take money from the government.  They their car quality. Amazing.  I would say them for that five years ago, I would not have driven a Ford.  You get this Mustang. It's solid.  The reliability very high.  Yeah. Thank you, Ford, for running your business well.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Amazing stuff. And I just think I used to drive a Buick Regal a long time ago.  Someone told me it was the time the most popular American car.  I said, I haven't driven an American car in a long time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, the Buick is the doctor's car. Did you know that?  Really? Every badge, Jeff probably knows this, every badge has like a  personality that, you know, like, so that.  OK, so they have, you know, this GM or it's Ford, but then there's a badge  like Lincoln, Mercury, Buick product.  Back in the day, they would say, OK, we're going to make a car for doctors.  That's the Buick.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  That was their early grand research.  Yeah. Oldsmobile.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Heather, I cannot see you in a Buick.  I know. It was my grandmother's car. It was huge.  Or Tiger Woods, for that matter, too.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I drove this Buick Regal and it was humongous.  It was the size of this room.  And if you hit the car, you were in trouble.  Nothing would happen to you. It was a tank.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bench seats.  So you're like, you sit on your sofa.  If you turn too hard, you'll slide all the way to the left.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And the engine had like four parts in it.  It was a very old car, but it lasted a long time.  And when I used to take it in Boston to get it fixed, they'd be like, thank you.  There's no computer. It's just like, yeah.  Yeah. I mean, it lasted a long time.  A cab did once hit me in the front, fell off the cab.  Nothing happened.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's saying something. Those checker cabs, they're tough.  I know. Well, he was speeding.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  The front fell off.  The whole front is like...  And I barely felt it because this thing was so long.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did I just run over a bird? What happened?  There was a bump. Did you hear that?  Nah, keep going.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah, it's they're not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So wait a minute. Tiger was doing an endorsement for Buick.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  He was, I think, as a matter of.  Was, let's say was, because, you know, not so all American anymore.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's such a good driver anymore.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And his wife, we hear she can drive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wouldn't you really? Yeah, with a driver.  That's right.  Wait a minute. Well done.  If I had the instant rim shot, I could I could play it.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You need one of those. Can we get it?  Beautiful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Ask and you shall receive. The Internet is an amazing place.  All you have to do is say instant rim shot.  There it is. That's like the Fort Sink.  Oh, Jeff, why do you have that?  That's sad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the Craig Newmark game.  It got me to the.  Well, that's the rim shot app on my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm getting that.  What's the name of the app?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's what's.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  OK, this is now officially the worst version.  The worst twig.  The worst. We're having such a good time.  It's a fun twig.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  How many people are going to go download instant rim shot like a lot?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's the name of the app?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you're going to ask that. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.  Someone just put in your instant rim shot.  Well, it's rim. The name is too long. It's rim shot something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if you search, I think if you search iTunes for rim shot.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  This is the twig and trombone.  Yes, it kind of has.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Twig is not jump the shark. The shark has jumped twig.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I didn't know I could do this new version.  You can set your shake sound so you can just shake it.  And there it goes.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Nice.  I'm so happy.  Is there a Moroccan thing where you just go.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That would be handy.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Like you're just jumping into a concert.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina, you got to write something like this for Android quick.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yes, obviously.  Oh, my God. Can we talk about the droid ad?  Are we Google related?  Are we still too fluffy for you guys?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, we've talked about the droid app before.  It's a little scary.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  What? WTF? Can I say that?  Yes. Why?  What ad agency did they hire?  It's the whole droid positioning is very bizarre

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because when you turn it on, you get the red eye of Mordor,  which is I don't know.  It's not what I'm looking for in a cell phone.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I'm looking for not being on AT&T.  That's the number one thing I'm looking for.  You can get that.  That's all you have to do to sell me.  I'm almost there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They offer that.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Why isn't that the ad? Just start with that.  Here, play with this. Have you played with one?  Do you like it?  I saw it the other day and I was a little jealous.  I kind of like it.  I'm kind of almost.  I'm tempted, but you know what?  I don't like this number at the top.  I don't know if you can.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's the number at the top?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  A little number, meaning there's like 12 icons.  I'm already overwhelmed.  Oh, no, no, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's actually a good system.  Now you push it and you drag it down.  That's the notification system.  It shows you you've got stuff.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The window shade is the best.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  But why can't I just have that pull down thing?  I love the window shade without the little Scoobies at the top.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because that tells you you've got something.  That's just one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can just hit the clear notifications button.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Those all each means each of them means something.  They mean you've got a text, you've got an email, you've got so.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  The resolution, you know,  Kevin Marks was showing me in the resolution.  Spectacular screen.  So gorgeous.  That's really where it was.  But he wasn't happy with the keyboard.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it's a useless keyboard.  In fact, my recommendation, as soon as they start, they put a Clare 2.0 on the Eris,  which I'm told by my Verizon contacts, they are going to do imminently.  Once they put a Clare.  This is beautiful.  On the Eris, that's the one to get because that doesn't have a slide out keyboard.  So it's thinner and lighter, but it's otherwise comparable.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You know, I just saw an app by what's his name?  Visit Calc, Dan Brooklyn.  Did you guys see this?  It was Jeff.  You know, the tweet of this out.  It's a beautiful.  It's on the iPhone.  Maybe you can work on Android to visit Calc for the iPhone.  No, I mean, I just know that he wrote visit Calc.  It's his past.  You can write.  You can do note taking with your finger.  You can just write right on the screen.  Oh, I like that.  It's really cool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Dan's we've had Dan on.  He's really a neat guy.  Really.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  First time I met him, I was just so out.  Here's the man who changed the world.  Really.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And very humble.  And he's the real deal.  And a nerd.  I mean, just, you know, he's right.  You meet people like him or was and you go, this is what it was like.  In the proto days.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  And I just think of them when people are like, crush, I'm destroying the world.  I'm like the people I know that have met, like Dan, who really destroyed the world,  don't walk around going, I'm just sure that they just do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if that's as entrepreneurial as it changed something.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I don't understand what I still think there's people like that.  Andy Biles like that.  He just makes awesome stuff.  We can't do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But we need the entrepreneurs.  We that's how we're doing it.  I mean, other industries do that.  I teach a course in entrepreneurial journalism.  And this Wednesday is our jury.  And I have folks like Clay Shirky and Fred Wilson coming in to to judge the students  businesses.  And there's fifty thousand dollars of real money from the McCormick Foundation.  Nice.  On the hook here to start the business.  Three of my students last year running businesses as a result.  And it's great to see what happens with the students.  You know, grades are one thing, money is another.  Yeah. And they're working like crazy.  I was on the phone, you know, Skype calls this morning with board meetings with three  of them trying to work out their businesses.  It really has an impact.  So I don't want to smash entrepreneurship in that.  I think we need more of it.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Entrepreneurship just the way people just being a dick.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's that that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I think you need that.  You need that bloodthirsty.  I think you might need that kind of bloodthirstiness these days to succeed.  Don't you? I'm not a dick, though.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  No, I don't think I just think people confuse bloodthirstiness with execution.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think anybody I don't think you'd say anybody at Google is trying to  be master of the universe.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  No, but they're doing pretty well.  They're doing fine.  Is what I'm saying.  I'm just saying you don't.  I think sometimes people see people who naturally are that's there.  Maybe that's a personality.  It's their attitude.  And then they think, well, now for me to be successful, my startup or business, I have  to act that way.  One, I don't think you should ever act like someone who's not you.  It's a big mistake.  And two, I don't think you need to do that to be successful.  Like I was just saying, people like Dan or Andy make amazing stuff and are great  entrepreneurs and they don't necessarily.  We're like a no rider now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I was just going to play.  You got to have heart, but that's the.  This isn't exactly a Google story, not even really a cloud story.  It's kind of a social story and it's not on the links, but I kind of mention this  because it's today DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Products Projects,  somebody, the guys who invented the Internet.  Are celebrating the 40th anniversary of that invention with a new DARPA  challenge.  This is a DARPA Network Challenge, and I thought this was kind of interesting.  If you go to networkchallenge.darpad.mil today, this morning, as we do this show,  which is Saturday, December 5th, they.  Launched or raised 10 moored, eight foot red weather balloons at 10 fixed  locations in the continental United States.  They're very visible.  They've got a number on them.  They've got the DARPA logo on them.  They're more so they don't move around.  And the challenge is they say a competition to explore the roles, the  Internet and social networking play in the timely communication, wide area team  building and urgent mobilization required to solve broad scope time critical  problems like, you know, the end of the world or something.  So the challenge is, and I think there's a $40,000 cash prize.  Let's maybe think of it, Jeff, to the first entrant to submit the latitude and  longitude of all 10 balloons.  Now, obviously you can't do this by yourself.  You've got to put together a team.  And if you put together the right team using Twitter or Facebook or social  media or their website, you might be able to win $40,000 by pinpointing all.  The balloons.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The great thing, MIT is offering $2,000 a balloon and others are doing it openly.  And we'll see who wins the, uh, the greedy capitalists or the open hippies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, yeah, maybe that's a demonstration of, of this.  There's a open red balloon project at www.openredballoon.com that is  doing the hippie version of this.  And I just think this is really interesting.  I don't know.  They've, they've found a lot of balloons.  Uh, it looks like they're very close to finding all the  balloons with open red balloon.  There's a duplicate of a couple of.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  How long has it taken them?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Since this morning.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what I think fascinating.  I'm glad DARPA did this because it is, it's an example of, you know, kind of  virtual organization and cooperation.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Practice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kind of a neat idea.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, you really think Jeff people just do stuff.  I think some stuff money works and other stuff.  It doesn't like, who was the guy?  Which face he was it?  Well, someone from Draper Fisher who during one of the elections in  California decided he's going to pay people like to vote or something.  It didn't work at all.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that gets them in jail too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're not really allowed to do that.  That is illegal.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I, but I understand the notion there.  Malcolm Gladwell talks about this, um, in, I think it was outliers where, um, you,  you have, uh, you can, you can ask doctors to do something pro bono and they'll  gladly do it, but the minute you say, but we'll, we'll, we'll pay you $50 to do it.  They go, well, I'm worth a hell of a lot more than that.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  Right.  Exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, I just thought that was kind of interesting.  Yeah.  Now, if you give me a Buick, that's the doctor's card.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's get Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, can I throw one more story?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I should always give you a chance.  Yes.  Cause I often miss the good ones.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was at the, uh, the FTC hearings.  They called it a workshop on, uh, the future of journalism or survival  with journalism this week and Murdoch spoke and then Ariana Huffington spoke.  After that, I, I too spoke urging the FTC to stay off our lawn.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's an unholy trio.  Oh, Ariana Huffington, Rupert Murdoch and Jeff Jarvis on stage.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Add in Steve Brill in the form of a

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Oh, how did anyone really?  The overlap must have been outrageous.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was.  So I just wanted to give you this, that Ariana had a great speech.  It's up on Huffington Post, of course.  And, but she collected, she curated, she aggregated, pick your word.  Uh, the words that Murdoch and company had been using about Google  and aggregators lately, and I can't do it in the accent, but

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I'll do it for you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, either one, either Ariana's or Rupert's, but, um, I should, I should  tweet this so you can't Heather.  Um, they've called them parasites, content, club of maniacs, vampires,  tech tapeworm tapeworms in the intestines of the internet.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  We're referring to the entrepreneurs who are making our entire economy run as  parasites, blood sucking vampires, horrible little people full of pus.  And you're just jealous and sad about the old salad days of Rupert and we'd hang  out in your balls in the Mediterranean and drink wine and you have crazy ideas  of new business and we would have a wonderful time and it's just sad and old  with you and your trusty problems.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Heather, let's take it up a notch here.  Now do Rupert against Ariana.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  God, I don't know if I can do, I don't know mom.  Oh, I can do Rupert.  I'll do Rupert.  Okay, good.  Leo, Heather, go at it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Rupert said that what Rupert say.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  What would he say?  What would he say?  You're all pirate and infested pirates.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what you are.  Oh, it's a problem there with Ariana and Huffington.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I think you've just, you've lost your style.  You're dry up old bag.  What happened when you made new things?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When in my day, you know, we, we would, uh, we would make a newspaper.  We would print it on a, on a piece of paper.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  But your day has gone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you would pay for it.  It's gone.  Now you want to steal me blind.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  It's done.  It's too late.  You were stored from the people before you.  It's been done before we learned from Europe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And besides I knew Picasso.  Thank you, Jeff.  Cut this off before we kill again.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  My God.  So yeah.  Did you guys already cover the Rupert entirely?  Because I just want to say that Kara Swisher's piece is really, what did she say?  She wrote a really entertaining piece where she translates, uh, Eric  Schmidt's response on the wall street journal to Rupert Murdoch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I liked his response.  What did she say about it?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  It was hilarious.  Like you can call it addressed me as emperor at Palpatine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, exactly.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You know, we own everything.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There can be only one.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  I don't really understand.  I mean, I want, maybe you already addressed it, Jeff, but I'm wanting to  hear your take on the, the supposed D we're going to do.  It's almost too easy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really almost too easy.  It's like such a blatantly bad idea.  It's, it's, it's a, it's a sitting duck.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's getting, it's getting too close to reality.  We have Trinity mirror in London this week talked about how we have to give up SEO  and this is ridiculous and the content heads that he created a site that  purposely doesn't have any SEO and has ridiculous navigation just to fool that  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got you Google.  We don't have any site maps.  Where's my nose?  Where's my face?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  We have no one reading us, but screw you.  Screw you Google.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, literally they took off navigation.  That makes any sense.  Like movies and put up navigation, like, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But see, that's what I mean.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's just so boneheaded that all you have to do is just go wow.  And let them die.  I mean, there it is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I got it.  It's Matt Kelly who's going to, who now hate me.  Sounds entertaining.  It's the head of Trinity mirror.  And, uh, let me see if I can find this here.  Um, they started a site called daily.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's Matt Kelly puts SEO in its place.  This is in the guardians.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's very good.  Um, uh, you'll, he started 3am and he says, quote, you'll notice we  ignored the SEO brigade here.  I want somebody British accent is the best as I get, uh, it's the Southern  angle.  So instead of navigation that would perform well in Google, like music  news, celebrity news, and by the way, before well in the human brain, they  changed the navigation to emotional methodology, gasp, tee hee, swar.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And did anybody link and did anybody click on it?  I mean, is there, is there an example of the page?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would love to find the page.  Is the page up anywhere?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Uh, let's see mirror football has, uh, 3am.co.uk has 800,000 unique users.  Um, I think buzz machine will be rapidly approaching that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So this is a celebrity news, 3am gossip gone toxic.  Oh, look, ooh, gasp, gir, swar, tee hee, and diary.  Dear diary today, I screwed the SEO contingent.  That is interesting.  I don't, you know, I guess I'd click on, Ooh,

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  no, how often would you click on?  Oh, Leo.  I guess I click on the thread story there, the twine story.  Jeez.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But how do you find it?  Do they have a search?  Oh, they have search.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know.  He says it means not letting SEO wag the dog.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, yeah, wag the dog.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's just such.  So, so the point is, but they noticed they did it to a stupid

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  site that cost them nothing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They didn't.  For the point, but, but there's, there's talk of suing aggregators now.  Yeah.  Uh, it's getting really stupid, especially in Europe.  And Europe is of course a heavy regulation environment.  So I do fear what's going to happen here.  I think the Murdoch, uh, is what he's, it's stupid.  It's a matter of negotiation for MySpace, MySpace underperformed by  a hundred thousand, a hundred million dollars.  That's what that's about from there.  But there's damage to be caused here.  So people who say, Oh yeah, just let Rupert do it.  I hate him anyway.  It's a bad precedent.  I get very nervous and I'm very hinky about this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you really think there is a risk.  Good word.  Hinky.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Hinky.  Well, I mean, my, my impression, although mostly comes from reading  Julia Anguins, um, and talking to her.  She, I mean, I think her book stealing MySpace is really great, but my  impression was that Murdoch didn't totally get what he was doing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, that was always my impression.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  So why would he, that mean he'd know any bit, any more what he's doing now?  I mean, he's, he probably doesn't.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I don't think, I don't think Jeff or anybody asserts that he does.  Oh, definitely.  But really that he's dangerous.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Because he does it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes.  I tweeted something today about, about him.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Sarah Pail anything?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Uh, I tweeted media.  I had the financial times chronically in the fall of MySpace.  Yeah.  Let's follow Rupert.  He did a great job there.  What?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So anyway, sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, that's good.  Do you want to talk about the, uh, what the, uh, article, uh, in e-consultancy?  What a lot of rubbish everyone is talking about Google and paywalls.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  The problem there was that, uh, when Google extended the idea of one.  Yeah.  We didn't even mention this first click free.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We should talk about this.  Actually, this is a story.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Is this in response to Murdoch Jeff?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, that's the thing.  That's why they want that story.  Leo just showed get social.  They all got it wrong.  What they are doing is giving publishers more, um, control.  More control.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  So the idea is right now, right now you can have a closed site.  You Google the result, you click on it.  It gives you an excerpt as the wall street journal will, and say, now  you've got to pay for the rest.  What this gives the publisher now is the right to set a few pages a  day that you can look at.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So you can set one before.  And the problem was they said people were going in and doing it all the time.  So now you can set five, like a frequency cap.  It's just another control.  It's like robots.txt.  It just gives you one little bit more control over the use of, of your content.  And then the action that occurs from it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, e-consultancy says you can circumvent this and the  user can circumvent this.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, of course.  My, my, my argument was with, with Google, and I said this last week is that they're  trying to make friends and people want enemies.  And I think that's the issue here.  But I don't think they should be sucking up or making any attempt to suck up.  They should be supporting the future of journalism and the future of journalism,  by God is entrepreneurial.  Not.  I think Google's actually surprisingly strategic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think sometimes they do something like this, not to suck up, but to say,  look, we tried that knowing full well that these guys aren't going to have, have  no interest in working with them, that it's not enough.  And they say, but Hey, we, you know, we're not going to be able to do  you know, we, we made the effort.  And so that lets them off the hook.  I think that they do that all the time.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  It's like an Obama move.  It's smart.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's jujitsu.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  I think they are smart about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I raised my mom.  I beat up my sister, but then I apologized.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  See, see, I'm, I'm really a good person.  I do know evil.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Hunter Joe in the, in our CSA Murdoch's like hearse, the more  Zempire dwindles, the more reckless and dangerous he gets.  Do you think that's true of anybody running anything that's having trouble  that they start just going to start a war?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's gonna start the Spanish.  They don't know what else to do.  We need a war.  Rupert's going to say that we need a war.  All right.  Let's say anything else before we wrap this sucker up going, going.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I guess to say supernova was really great.  I'll put in a, a plug that it was a great conference this week and it's worth  it.  Yeah.  Kevin Warbach.  It's it.  A Wharton had a lot of great people there.  Esther Dyson had a really good panel.  There were a bunch of good conversations.  I think it's worth checking out if you're interested in, especially some policy  related conversations.  I think there were really full of Obama's people there and a lot about real time  data flow that Tontek, Chellick, I know there are hardcore geeks here, so I'm  telling you, I think you might be interested in that.  Yes, absolutely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I missed it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I keep wishing they do it in Philadelphia where the school actually is and I could

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  go, I had a lot of fun.  They asked me to do the closing entertainment and I luckily have to follow  Peter Goober, who is like this old time, old time.  He wouldn't think of himself that way, but he produced color purple flash dance.  He's been around Hollywood a long time.  He's a big deal producer.  And he was hilarious as he tried to convince all these tech thinkers and  entrepreneurs that the money he was talking about was really big money.  It was really kind of entertaining.  Anyway, I had a good time, but I think the Twig audience would really dig  the Tontek and Kevin's flow.  It is online.  It's archived.  So you go to supernovahub.com and you'll be able to access the Ustream of it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Excellent.  Look forward to that.  So time now for our tip of the week, starting with Gina Trapani, the tip goddess.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Cool.  This one's a really simple one.  It's for wave users who have too many things in their inbox.  And it's the shift key.  You can select a bunch of different waves and archive them in one shot to clean  out your kind of your wave inbox immediately.  So you don't have to go one by one.  Oh, I need this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I do too.  I love that all the Twig listeners are making waves and adding you and I and  Jeff to them, Leo, but it probably means you have a pretty like stacked up  inbox like I do.  Unusable inbox.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can't even figure out what's going on in my inbox.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you can do a search for whatever for Twig say in your inbox, and then you can  hold down the shift key and select a bunch of different waves.  Then you can do something with all of them.  You can move them to a folder.  You can archive them one shot.  You can follow, unfollow, whatever you want.  But the shift key is key and wave.  OK, so I so I go to the search thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I say in colon inbox and then I say, let's say Twig.  I put my search.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Twig.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you'll get a bunch of waves back.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then I shift click.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Just hold down the shift key.  I shift to click and then and then you can select a range of waves.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I see.  Just like a real computer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Just like, yeah, just like a desktop app.  Wow.  But you can't control click.  So it's just shift and arrange.  So you really have to search to figure out exactly what waves you want to you  want to find.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And now Jeff's kept it secret long enough.  He will never get here to it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was it was like the man, you know, it was like Groucho Marx and the duck was  going to fall in Eric Schmidt's Wall Street Journal op-ed in enemy territory.  I've often quoted the number of the Google news brings a billion clicks a month  to news publishers.  Google Eric Schmidt said that Google causes another three billion through  search and other features.  And there's this wonderful quote that is one hundred thousand opportunities a  minute.  Yeah, that was awesome readers and generate revenue for free.  And so it's not Google's fault.  It's your fault.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the big.  That was a great line.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Say that again.  Say the number again.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  One hundred thousand opportunities a minute.  And the failure here is the publishers.  It's not cool.  Yeah.  So if it's not working for you, dude, this idea that audience is worthless.  Yeah.  Um, um, I guess I can't quote it on Twitter, but there was a great line.  Um, uh, let's see, I'll, I'll, I'll clean it up.  Uh, Britt said, oh, so nice to think that editors think we're all worthless.  Uh, but hats.  Did he say the word but hats?  Oh, he didn't, Leo.  All right.  I mean, he had a different, a different term.  Like, can I say one more thing?  I want to, I'm, I am to podcasts as Tiger Woods is to, uh, wives.  Uh, I'm, I'm, I'm not, well, I have another podcast I do.  Yes.  Media talk USA, which is for the guardian, uh, guardian.co.uk slash media talk USA.  The reason I'm bringing this up is because this month I had on baratunde  Thurston and thanks to you introducing us on, on Twitter and he was just great.  I love baratunde.  Thank you for that introduction.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, he's going to be on Twitter again this Sunday.  He is a, yeah, he's very talented, very funny guy and, uh, smart about  tech like Heather gold is media too.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And all that.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Where the like, I know I was on a panel with baratunde and asked me to  scrub what I did and then baratunde was next.  He said, I'm basically Heather gold.  Cause we're separated at birth.  Me and baratunde.  I'm the lesbian, Heather gold.  That's right.  That's what he is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Uh, media talk USA, a new rival for the Washington post.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The new, the new episode with Bartlett should be up, I think Monday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay.  So it's not up yet.  All right.  There you go.  It's a guardian.co.uk.  That's Jeff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Unlike you, they edit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nice.  There are those who say I should, but I won't.  I refuse.  Are a tool of the week.  It's free from Google.  And I think in a way this might be a little, um, stocking horse for something  Google would like to do more generally free wifi for the holidays.  They, they, uh, we're doing it first with Virgin America.  They were providing free free wifi and Virgin America flights.  I think they're gonna do that through January.  Uh, and now through January 15th, they're offering free wifi at 54  us airports, as well as every Virgin America flight.  So if you've been going to your airport and having to buy a T mobile account  or, you know, wait, what do they call way way port account or whatever,  you can just use the Google.  And, uh, it's pretty much all the big airports as far as I can tell.  Except for SFO.  Bastards.  Is New York.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I thought San Diego this week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  San Diego's in there.  Uh, Newark is not LaGuardia is not.  Chicago.  Uh, Oh hair.  Let me see.  Let me see.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's my trip tomorrow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, see, this is a little, it's like, well, you know why I'm sure Google  went to all of these airports and they said, no, we make too much money off of this.  But look, this is how you put pressure on airports to start doing this kind of thing.  Uh, so free wifi, check it out at your airport and I'm going to fly a  Virgin America to CES.  So I'll let you know how that works in January.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just do us one favor Leo.  Don't get up in the air and say, wow, I'm tweeting from an airplane.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to send a 12 second post.  I'm going to send a tweet.  I'm going to do it all.  I'm going to do it all.  I'm going to play world of warcraft, man.  I'm going to make some gold.  I'm doing everything.  Speaking of gold, Heather gold, where is a, where can we catch your, your act?

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  You can catch me.  Uh, my dates are Heather gold.com.

I do also, and wherever they're Jews and they're stuck in lots of places, uh, not  just the lower East side of New York.  And, uh, I'm also doing a little, I'm also like Jeff, not totally  monogamous with the show.  So I do a little thing called morning Jew.  Uh, and morning Jews.com, some Katie helper of the Huffington post and  Rachel's car of media where we do the headlines and ask, is it good for the Jews?  I'm listening to that.  So that's going to be starting again in the new year, morning Jews with a Zed or  Z depending on what country you're in.  Dot com.  Uh, Heather gold show will hopefully be here later.  Uh, tumble vision will be here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Transcript:  I'm sure Barrett and it'll be, I Googled a morning Jews.  And I got, uh, the Jewish federations of North America.  Not for long.

Speaker: Heather Gold
Transcript:  Twitter army.  Can you fix that?  So basically like if it's a media story by a Jew, that that's something to talk about  or not.  We'll make, we'll find the angle.  We'll find the tiger woods.  I'm sure he's an accountant involved in this issue.
