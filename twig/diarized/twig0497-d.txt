Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week at Google. Jeff Jarvis is out of the country.  But we are fortunate to have Aunt Pruitt join us along with Stacy Higginbotham.  We'll talk about folding phones. We'll talk about 5G.  Stacy will explain all to us about 5G.  We need a little help. And we'll worry about how you pronounce  Amicus Curiae. It's all coming up next on Twig.

The show we talk about  the latest news in the Googleverse, which really doesn't mean  just Google, but Facebook, Twitter, the internet as a whole.  We also talk a lot about journalism and media. Jeff Jarvis,  our journalism guru, is taking the week off because he's in Oxford,  England. And he says I don't have good enough internet to do the  show. But Stacey Higginbotham is here in her and she apparently  has taken over Jeff's woodlined paneled study.  So hi Stacey from Stacey on IOT and at Giga Stacey on the Twitters.  She has a great podcast to on the Internet of Things with about  Chromebooks Kevin Toffle. There I got two plugs in one.  That was nice. And that other long tall drink of water there,  that's Ant Pruitt. He has contributed to Tech Republic and always  a welcome visitor to our shores. Hi Ant. Hey Mr. LaPorte. Great to  see you. Likewise. Thanks for having me. Yeah. Neither none of  us were in Barcelona over the weekend much as I would have  loved to. But that's what happened with Mobile World Congress.  Microsoft announced its new HoloLens 2 and finally just gave up  on the idea of making it a consumer product and said no,  it's all about business. And I had an insight earlier today on  Windows Weekly that I think I'm just thick. But as a tech guy,  I kind of think about the gadgets, the products, the shiny  stuff and less about the backbone. And what I realized is this  HoloLens 2 announcement was really put in high relief for me,  is Microsoft makes these things not because they want to sell  these things, Surface, HoloLens, even Xbox. It's not so much  about those products. Yeah, sure. They make some money on them.  But really what Microsoft is and they've never changed since  day one was a platform company. The platform used to be  Windows. When Sachin Adela, their new CEO came along five  years ago, he said, you know, this Windows is it desktop  operating systems don't have that much of a future. You know  what has a future? The cloud. And he said that our new platform  is the cloud is Azure. And now if I could textualize it there,  HoloLens makes a lot of sense because all throughout the demo  they're talking about the enterprise uses of it, which  require Azure and Dynamics 365, their enterprise business  platform. And then suddenly, oh, it all kind of makes sense to  me that that's really what HoloLens is all about. In fact,  they really established how open it is because they showed one  person wearing the HoloLens visor. It's an augmented reality  visor. He's working on an engine and somebody else is using  an iPad to see the same thing, which that would never Microsoft  would never have said that in the past, but it's really a  platform for them. So I think that's really an interesting to  me. That's an important insight because it tells us why

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft does what they do. And it's in addition to being  a platform for like, it's an AR platform. It's not just a  platform for like heads up displays, right? Right. So if  you think about it across a number of devices, they're just  trying to figure out what do people want to do with it? What  kind of software designs do we need to think about? How will

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  people interact with it? Absolutely. But they realize  that ultimately, whatever the design is, however people use  it, it will all hook up to their platform, which is Azure,  right? And they showed a conferencing thing that uses  Azure. They showed remote telemedicine. I mean, it's all  Azure based. It's all in the cloud. And that's really what  they're selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the difference between a company like Microsoft and the  other ones. It's not about viral. It's about legacy. It's  about who's going to be here 10 years from now, 20 years from  now. And that's the type of thinking you got to have and not  worry about the big hit right now. It's going to stick around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As we know, platform is kind of a nice play. Microsoft got  really big by creating a platform that other people used.  And somebody once asked Bill Gates, well, you didn't really  get all the, extract the maximum profit you could have out of  Windows. A lot of other people made money on Windows. He said,  actually, that's the measure of a platform that the partners  make more money than the platform creator. But the good  news is the platform creator gets a chunk of all of that.  Yep. And the reason I've been thinking about it is because  Apple, which was a device maker and made all its money in  devices, is faced with this issue going forward that their  sales are slowing down and they don't have the next big thing.  And they're doing the same thing. They're suddenly  pivoting to the cloud. They're saying the future, don't pay  attention to device sales anymore. The future is revenue  per customer based on their use of our services. And services  is really just another word for cloud. And that kind of all  makes sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With regards to Apple, I think it's more along the lines of  they're saying, you know what, we made our phones a little too  expensive and people are not going to buy them every other  year.  Right.  You know, every four years or so at the most. So let's find  a way to keep the shareholders from panicking and saying, hey,  we're focusing more on the ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft must have enjoyed the Samsung event a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  week ago and other announcements at Mobile World Congress  because suddenly the iPhone is no longer the most expensive  phone. By any means, Samsung's Galaxy Fold will start at almost  $2,000 and this is the Huawei Mate X and it's going to start  closer to $3,000.  And so I think that's good news for Apple. It establishes a  new kind of price point way out there. So Apple might not look  like the most expensive player.  What do you think of these foldable phones? Stacy, do you  want one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I want one so badly, but I can't justify the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think initially it'll be one of those products where people  will buy it either because they have more disposable income  than anybody or because they want to show everybody that they  have more disposable income because it'd be very obvious if  you took out a Mate X from your pocket and unfolded it.  Oh, that guy's loaded.  That's a status symbol.  How about you?  That's what they used to say about the iPhone.  Right.  It is, but it's no longer is it a status symbol to have an  iPhone because everybody's got one.  Not anybody has an iPhone.  So what do you think?  And are you a as a photographer you must be no, no, no, he's  shaking his head.  No, no.  You lost me at two grand.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You lost me at two grand.  If I'm going to spend two grand I can go out and get a Sony  A7R2 right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a camera.  A very nice camera by the way.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not even the newest model.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but on the other hand if you think of this as instead  of just an accessory your phone as as one of your primary if  not your primary computers, then is it too much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just bought a MacBook Pro which is a fancy expensive  computer for like 1800.  Oh, so that's even more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, yeah, but you can't fold your MacBook Pro up and put  it in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I also can't run Premiere Pro on that thing either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's going to be an interesting thing.  In fact, that's one of the things we talked about on  MacBreak Weekly yesterday.  Apple, the rumor mill says Apple's moving first to ARM chips  in the next couple of years and then second to a unified operating  system iOS and Mac OS and at that point Adobe will develop  for all three I would guess.  So you would be able to be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be cool.  You know, but I look at this is my opinion when it comes to  these these OEMs and these high-priced phones.  You put in all of these specs in there as if the mass market  is a bunch of power users, right?  I can't assume that the mass market is power users.  Everybody is out there just taking selfies and sending  Facebook messages and WhatsApp and all of that.  They don't really need that much horsepower.  They don't really need all of the extra pixels on the screen.  Now, if you want to be a content creator or what have you,  I get that but at the same time it's still a daggum phone  and it shouldn't cost me more than a thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but don't these companies I mean in order to move forward  that they're going to develop phones that are very expensive  initially and the price would come down if they if they said  the new anything new we do has to be affordable for the masses.  We wouldn't see a lot of new developments would we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's look at let's look at what makes a phone.  I mean, what are the components of a foldable screen?  Because that's what we've got to assess like are there economies  a scale that can be derived from that type of oh, yeah, I'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  any screen gets cheaper as you make more of them and as you  as you refine the process.  I mean remember the first LCD screens.  The problem was dead pixels and they got better and better  at making them and the price went down because more and more  of the the screens came out without defect.  They didn't have to reject as many so that had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What wasn't just a defecting is was a semiconductor or a wafer  kind of it's a process problem.  Yeah, so but our foldable screens that same God knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how they make them.  They're polymer.  We know that they're plastic.  They've got to be probably somewhat like OLED screens.  I think these OLED screens.  This is a Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and they have a little bit  of a curve don't they on the edge as they come down here.  So I'd be my guess that this OLED material is somewhat like  the material that will be used in these folding phones.  I do want I do wonder what the what the folds gonna  gonna how it's gonna handle all those bands.  Yeah, you don't have to ask.  There's only three of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, she said she would get one of those phones, you know,  but she couldn't justify the price.  My question is why?  And what do you like about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I like I like having a big screen, but I hate something  that doesn't fit in my pocket.  So this solves well theoretically this solves this problem  and I also I like playing with new interfaces.  I like because that's like when you can see the future is  when you see something that you can use it and you're like,  oh my gosh, this totally changes how I look at this type  of device or maybe this workflow and I have a I have  a feeling I could be wrong that this type of foldable  phone thing could actually do that for me.  So that that's why I would want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think it doesn't feel to me that this came out of  a lot of focus grouping and testing and research.  It feels like they just said what what can we do next?  Oh, I know foldable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No phones have had a very real constraint like as they  got bigger and bigger people started complaining more  about them not fitting in their pockets and all of these  other things, but people still bought the big screens because  they like the big screens.  So, I mean there there is an actual I don't know if it's  really a problem per se, but there is an actual need for  something that does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do appreciate the the innovation because I was getting  smartphone for tea because everything pretty much looks  the same for the last six seven years, you know, you go to  a store and show me your flagship phone.  It's going to look like the one that's right next to it is  not a flagship one glass slab is much like the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, I mean, I appreciate the innovation, but I don't I just  don't see the need for the fold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just don't we might be in this area of kind of wacky  interfaces wacky new designs.  There was what with the I can't think of the name of the  phone.  That's a watch.  Oh, yeah, bracelet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's there were a couple of I think of them  slap bracelets.  There are a couple of phones that you you wear around your  wrist.  Here's one from TCL.  This is a this is a concept.  So not available yet.  In fact, this was the year of goofy weird designs and I and  again, I don't feel like these were in response to demand.  These are more like let's throw spaghetti against the wall  and see what sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but no one demanded the no one demanded like  the Amazon Echo, for example, right?  And I feel like right now and especially when we think about  5G and not like super hyped 5G, but think about where we are  with we have really ubiquitous fast broadband connections  pretty much everywhere either mobile or fixed.  We've got computing that is incredibly powerful power  efficient both in the cloud and on the device.  And so if you start and now we're pulling all this contextual  data from applications and sensors around us and doing  things with it.  It feels like we're ripe for some sort of new innovation in  like a paradigm shift in computing and I hate that phrase  paradigm shift, but I think it could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you wear this look at this?  This is Nubia's Alpha watch.  It's it's a phone.  It's a watch.  It's it looks actually almost steampunk in its design.  I would not yeah, I think it's kind of bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would wear something like that if there was like a hearing  component like a in-ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the now now really like my wrist size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, now it really does look like some steampunky.  Wow.  Yeah, I maybe the wrist isn't the right place to put this  display.  I'm just I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I and it's tough and what about why do you need it?  I mean, you're trying you can put a display anywhere and  what becomes really exciting is when you have I think the  interface mostly in your ear and a display anywhere you'd  need one is personally what I'm excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about a heads-up display?  I mean the HoloLens right now is ridiculous.  You're not going to walk around wearing that but this is  early days.  What if they got it down to the size of something like maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some the North glasses?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always refer back to Daniel Suarez.  Yes, exactly and demon and freedom.  That's exactly right.  Yeah, I would take that any day because the way it's  described in the book is those those glasses look like just  regular high-end stylish glasses, you know, but I don't  think anybody's been able to do that just yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's early days HoloLens at least is fully.  You know encapsulate there's no tether there's three hour  battery life.  Okay, that's low but the full computer and everything's in  the band.  It is heavy.  I have worn HoloLens.  The new ones the new ones three times more comfortable Stacy.  That's three times.  So Microsoft says yeah three times more comfortable.  It's more like a hat now with all you remember when you put  on the original HoloLens.  Yo, it's a lot of knob twiddling and fiddling.  It's like Frankenstein.  They don't do that anymore.  He just goes on.  It's much more comfortable apparently and it's more balanced.  I think it's probably not much lighter, but it's balanced and  that's kind of that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a lot of weight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to pull on you forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I you know, I I see because I go to these industrial  user group conferences.  I actually see people using the HoloLens right get demos of  that and right I've changed out weird chess and like swapped  out things using HoloLens demos where they're like and it's  very effective and it is super cool and I can see why Microsoft  is investing here and there is demand for that sort of thing.  Especially industrial side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and Google we know Google Glass still sells in industrial  applications.  It's a little lot.  It's not a heads-up display as much as like a monitor over your  eye brow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember going to Mobile World Congress.  It was the only time I went.  I think it was 2016 and there was a big company.  I think it's Fujitsu that showed off just having some type of  little Google Glass looking device on and you basically a  line worker at a at a factory and you're able to do your  inventory and inspect the parts and things like that just from  looking at it and I thought it was pretty outstanding tech and  could be used everywhere with these big manufacturing companies,  but I don't know who's all buying into it.  And now it seems like that would be perfect for HoloLens  stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they use it for.  So like Emerson who else is like Emerson Honeywell trying to  think has not Xerox Tetra Pak actually, you know the people  who make the aseptic milk containers Tetra Pak actually  uses HoloLens and their factories for it.  A lot of times it's used for training or repair of machines  so understanding what's happening inside of machine.  It's all part of like Microsoft's digital twin product.  I don't know if you guys are familiar with that where they've  got a replica of a really big expensive machine and all the  sensor data comes into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what they showed people repairing learning how  to repair.  They showed surgeons learning how to do heart surgery in the  operating room just reviewing the procedure and then doing it.  I think there's a lot of I mean, there's huge amount of use  for this but I'll tell you where I feel like we are we're  in the maybe the 90s or even the 80s when we saw a lot of  technologies like the Newton in the palm and internet  technologies and of converging and it took 10 years but by  2007 they converged onto the iPhone and Blackberry and  and and they could for and now I mean that 10 years later.  It's completely changed computing how we use computing  how we think of computing.  It's a huge shift.  I think we're at that those early stages where you're  starting to see the convergence of new technologies coming in  when you have voice activated technologies that's going to  be critical for user interface because user interface on any  of these is very difficult.  You see voice activated coming in you see screens in a heads  up display or a variety of places experimentation with  where a screen would be because you do need a readout of some  kind my money's on a heads up display and you do see a lot  of those you see artificial intelligence to and that's I  think going to be very important because any any wearable  has to know a lot about the environment just like a self-driving  car has to know where it's going the wearable and I think  all the demos right now are in very constrained environments  just as all the speech demos are very constrained vocabularies  but once once you evolve these things imagine having the same  kind of heads up display you have now in a factory floor in  in the in the arbitrary real world and that's where AI and  things like time of flight sensors, which those are the 3D  sensors that are on the Holo lens and are very similar to  the lidar used on automobiles self-driving cars.  I think all of that is starting to come together.  It's got to get miniaturized.  It's got to get more effective, but I ultimately see the future  of computing and maybe it's 10 maybe it's 20 years out as  something like that at something that maybe they're not going  to look like they don't have to look like, you know, stylish  glasses spectacles.  They can look a little clunky not super not like Holo lens  clunky, but they can be a little clunkier because we'll get  used to it.  But I see people wearing those and using that as their primary  computing platform and using speech AI cameras heads up  displays that can turn into screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to argue with you a little bit.  Okay, I think you're close.  I think what is actually like I think the computing there will  be computing on your body some sort of computer that is a  smartphone or maybe we get to the point where it could be a  headset.  We're not there for a while, but I think what happens with  displays is actually anything around you will be a display  will get a standard that has it interact with you so you can  pull up your display in front of you on any screen.  So many surfaces will become screens either projected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right interface with us.  That's right.  And by your proximity, you'll make it yours.  Right.  I completely agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's my hunch because I don't I think the Holo lens  and those kind of heads up displays are good in industrial.  They're very expensive.  You do need a lot of computing power to do that and they solve  a really real problem, but it's not a real problem that we all  have every day.  I don't think today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So well, it's not that it's solving a problem.  It's the it's ubiquitous computing, right?  We're moving in that direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's why I was talking about that whole paradigm.  Shit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's you ubiquitous computing.  I to me though that there is a data point with these foldable  screens, which is we do want better screens wherever we are.  I think you're right.  That maybe that whatever screen is near you is the one that  you use and if screens are everywhere that it won't matter  if you carry one with you, but you will carry a personal  computing device of some kind that knows your preference.  Maybe not.  Maybe maybe it'll be that'll be a mesh that's everywhere.  And when I know no no because privacy right you want to keep  it to yourself privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lack of standards that we're not going to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lack of standards would be a real hardship because you and  that might even be the hardship with the screen thing.  That is the hardship with the screens.  Yeah, but I bet it's one of the ships.  We know computing is moving to the edges.  We know ubiquitous computing is power is the trend and I think  looking at new interfaces is really what's going on right  now.  And I think I think wearable glasses makes a lot of sense  earpieces.  Certainly it's the stuff of science fiction.  You see this in science fiction all the time just as you saw  the iPad in 2001.  Not the year the movie the movie the year was 1977 or so.  Yeah.  All right.  I've just that was our speculative section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was Leo goes off on a speculative tangent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are also camera phones now.  And some photographer like the Nokia pureview, which is I'm  calling it the spider phone because it looks the cameras  look like a spider's eye.  There are it looks like there's seven cameras.  There's only five but there's a flash and there's some some  other sensor in it, but it's really I mean, it's kind of  creepy looking the Nokia 9 and I presume because Nokia's  pureview that was the one that was 41 megapixels in the  Windows phone, right?  That was their brand for that's correct that they're they're  probably each of these five cameras is a 12 megapixel  sensor two of the five shooting color.  The other three are monochrome.  And the idea is you can then merge these shots into one  ultra detailed shot.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love the idea.  I wonder how efficient it is because essentially that's what  Apple and Google are already doing right now with their  camera technology.  So I'm guessing having that additional hardware supposedly  makes it easier to do that stuff.  But I don't know.  I'd like to see it in action.  I hope it doesn't go by the wayside the way that Lumia did,  you know years ago.  I want you.  Yeah, that's right.  Did you ever have a Lumia?  What?  One person had had it.  I tried it for you know, when it was time to switch phones  and I remember playing around with it in the store, but  Windows phone just didn't do anything for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So look at these images.  Now, of course you're looking at them over a Skype connection  and this is a web view of it.  This is the verge.  I I thought what's interesting about these is the color is  very neutral.  It's probably super accurate.  The details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good thing when it comes to processing images, you want  that that leeway, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That you know the colors on most camera phones today Samsung  is a particular violator.  These are ultra bright popped over sharpened.  Yeah, because it makes people happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, but Samsung knows who it's who it's market is to  they're going after the people that lights all the the bubbly  stuff, right gimmicky stuff.  This is really interesting and gimmicky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just it looks good.  Even if you're a sucky photographer, which that's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's Instagram right there in a nutshell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you said it not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm like as as a person who is not a great photographer.  I'm like, yeah, you know, I like being able to take photos  that look good like neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say this was a good Mobile World Congress.  If you like different if you like innovation slash

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  crazy, I should have done this instead of CES which was  snoozeville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well a lot of tech conferences have been snoozeville over  the last few years because we're jaded and old word peak.  Now, we're kind of a peak phone peak computer.  Here's Oppo's version of the foldable phone.  They've gone the Huawei direction of having the screen  on the outside not the inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oppo I just think these are so neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I yeah, thickness is what I question though, because I can  remember at one time when everybody wanted a thinner  device, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, yeah, no, and they are thick but again, they're  thick and they fit in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, what's more important to you a big screen or thinness?  To me, it's pocket.  I know what you don't want is this phone.  This is from Energizer.  It has an 1800 milliamp hour battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man, I got a press release about that thing.  I'm thinking who in their right mind wants that?  That's oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Vlad Savov from the Verge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my trade show phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's a phone if you had to go to the Antarctic or  something and we're unsure about where you'd be able to  charge next.  You know, it's so weird though when you look at this picture  is it looks like they've kind of just glued a regular smartphone  on top of a big battery charger.  And I bet you that's what it is.  You can even use this as a battery charger.  Isn't that so weird looking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Energizer has surprised me because at CES they were showing  off.  Oh, it's a company that does monster cables.  They have the licensing deal for Energizer for smart home  products.  So they were showing off, you know, connected outlets,  connected doorbell cams, connected light strips for like  very cheap and I was just like Energizer, what are you doing?  Yeah, maybe they're apparently all in on this.  Yeah.  Well, or they license their names to be all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't sure who's because they're not making any  of this.  No.  So maybe they're just licensing their name.  Then there's companies like LG which really didn't do anything  new or different and then they are not just don't get the  coverage, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got, you know, this has the this has a time of flight  sunsernet the thin queue, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that required for face for true good face ID?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe yes, because it gives you depth, right?  So he can't be fooled by like a flat photo of the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I have to say, you know, as I said, I ordered the Samsung  Galaxy s10 plus and I'd be very interested that you're using  an ultrasonic fingerprint reader as opposed to an optical  fingerprint reader and they do it through the screen and  everybody who tried it said it really works as fast and you  don't have it's not super picky about where you put your  finger.  I think that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, able to get your grooves, get your grooves on through  the ultrasound and ultrasonic sensors are cheap.  Oh, are they interesting?  I don't know about theirs theirs in particular, but in  general, they've been around for a long time and they're  pretty cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's take a break because I think the real story at Mobile  World Congress is all about 5g and Stacey Higginbotham is  our our 5g guru at least she knows more than I do which is  not saying that much but and me there's a lot of announcements  including some steps back.  We'll talk about that in just a second as we continue this  week in Google the Jarvis list version.  It's a it's a whole different show and Jeff's not here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no media discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't say that in a bad way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just it's just a different show but he'll be better article

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  13 and 12 or 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I checked I checked just to see and this is the the new  European Copyright Act, which is really going to be devastating  if it goes through to content creators people even like us  because article 13 will require a license.  There won't be any fair use or license to use any copyrighted  material and anything you do including news and commentary  and no more memes no more.  You know, we'd have to we have to shut off our feed to Europe  that it's the good news is that there is a mounting drumbeat  against it.  Some people are already starting to because there's an  election coming up for members of the EU Parliament.  There are people saying hey, this is going to be a litmus  test.  If you vote for article 11 and 13, then we're not going to  vote for you.  That's the kind of pressure we need to exert because it would  be disastrous.  But so far last I checked and I just visit Julia Raida's blog  nothing more since last week our show today brought to you  by thousand eyes.  I love thousand eyes.  I had never heard of them.  That's just because I'm ignorant.  But I went to an event of theirs where they talked about  how their sensors which are all over the internet were able  to learn all sorts of interesting things about cloud  providers and pros and cons to consider when you choose a  cloud provider.  But thousand eyes can provide that same kind of immediate  and unmatched view of all the networks all the dependencies  that impact you and your users digital experience.  That is a may they shouldn't really call it a thousand eyes  because more like a million eyes.  There are sensors everywhere from the inner internet all the  way out to the edge.  Look, we know many of you are going to the cloud.  You do gain agility, but you increase risk and and this is  scary for a lot of IT teams and and companies you lose a  little bit of control your stuff sitting out there and it's  hard when I went in a cloud app or a service goes down.  How do you know what went wrong?  And I liken this to you're trying to peer through a dirty  window trying to figure out what's going on out there.  Meanwhile, you're losing revenue employee productivity is  shot.  You're damaging your brand in some cases and you and that's  why they have it as a puffy little cloud, right?  Because who knows what's going on in there thousand eyes knows  is like taking a squeegee to that dirty window and suddenly  you can see instant visibility into the entire service delivery  path from the cloud to your end user and that that's not your  these aren't your little sensors.  These are thousand eyes.  So it includes portions you need their own or control.  Look at these are the kinds of things thousand eyes sees.  It's not like anything you've ever seen before the story of  thousand eyes is great.  This was originally a research project at UCLA the founder of  thousand eyes would realize that they could find this great  information this valuable information to any company  that's operating in the cloud and and they created thousand  eyes.  Moheep was great.  By the way, I met him at they launched at the giga ohm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  structure event.  Did they?  The day.  Yes, they were they were one of my favorite companies ever  and it was so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See you're smart.  So you got it when you when when they came up on stage you  understood what they were doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, even before that's why I put him on stage.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh you you put him on stage.  Yeah, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, these guys are I mean these guys are legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I completely agree.  Well, thank you for that unsolicited testimonial moheat  lad and Ricardo Olivera.  They were at the UCLA internet research lab.  They were working on technologies to visualize autonomous  system topologies.  They got a half million dollar National Science Foundation  grant because NSF knew that we needed to understand DNS  infrastructure issues.  They decided to start thousand eyes in 2013 and man in that  time.  They have really done well and I'm very proud to have a  partnership with them right now.  I'm just so impressed old-school IT monitoring does not work  as you probably know it's passive.  It's siloed right?  It's in your silo.  You can you know, or you use somebody's that can only see  the data center.  That's no use in the cloud thousand eyes is cloud-based  software built to help organizations do the cloud right a  massive array of vantage points spanning the entire global  internet cloud providers right down to the Wi-Fi in your local  coffee shop thousand eyes unique path visualization technology  extends beyond any boundaries allowing you to see understand  and improve the experience for all your app services and  websites.  It took me a while to really get what they're doing.  But now that I do I don't know how you could operate in a  cloud environment without thousand eyes join the top banks  the enterprises the SAS companies the world's largest and  fastest growing brands that rely on thousand eyes to do the  cloud and do it right.  You want to find out more go to thousand eyes all spelled out  thousand EYES.com slash twit and and find out what you've  been missing.  They do have a great ebook file that this would be good to  give to the boss five cloud migration challenges.  You shouldn't ignore great stuff in there, but also browse  around the site because as you there's some really good  information there thousand eyes.com slash twit and I'm very  pleased to say you should be to Stacy since you saw it at  the very beginning.  They're doing great.  They're really yeah, yeah thrive in a connected world with  thousand eyes thousand eyes.com slash twit.  I had no idea you had that relationship with them.  That's awesome.  Yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always forget that you're doing ads and I try to interrupt  him.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no as long as when you interrupt you interrupt that  way you interrupt all you want the this does I'm not in a  and I'm not in a sound.  I'm not in the bubble the lower the count cone of silence.  You're always allowed to speak so and especially if it's  something positive like that.  That's always interesting.  Yeah, I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ta-da.  I'm I'm a old no B.  That was seven formerly a deep cloud computing person.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cool.  Okay.  Well you okay.  So you you know, Stacy is kind of one of those nerds who  really we used to call him wonks like really loves the  nuts and bolts gets into the details reads the white papers  and stuff like that and so we're very grateful to her  because that way I can ask her question Jeff and I will say  what is that Stacy and she'll say well, let me explain it  to you.  You're actually you're Hermione isn't she she's Hermione  Jeff's Harry and and I'm that Weasley kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was wondering who is going to be her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's Hermione and she's just like wow you go.  Okay.  Yes ma'am.  So now we're going to 5g and 5g was probably the big banner  topic at Mobile World Congress and when you see things  like HoloLens and you see Microsoft talking about cloud  and clearly everybody's kind of correct me if I'm wrong Stacy  thinking about 5g like planning for the future.  Yes, the future though.  The road to the future is always bumpy for instance team  mobile has announced that they're going to delay the  launch of their 5g technology till later this year not  because their networks aren't ready.  There's a there's a glowering John Legere but because the  phones aren't out there right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes sense.  Yeah, I mean they're doing they're doing a millimeter wave  network and that's the real thing right.  Well, no, yes, no.  So 5g when we talk about like the FCC when they talk about  5g, they're talking about millimeter wave when a carrier  is talking about 5g.  They might be talking about millimeter wave, but they might  also be talking about the 3GPP standard for 5g.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the difference between a technology and a marketing  term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean is the FCC using a marketing term?  No, they're just allocating spectrum.  That's what they're in and the 3GPP standard which in the  3GPP is the organization that governs all of your cellular  standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's technology too.  I mean, that's a real spec, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a radio.  I mean, it's their radio spec.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the really the problem is people like AT&T and Verizon  who call things 5g that aren't millimeter wave 5g.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're 4g enhanced or AT&T is messing this up.  Verizon is actually deploying over the millimeter wave  spectrum.  They're deploying fixed broadband or for business fixed  mobile broadband, but it's not the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not the 3GPP standard though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it's not cellular and that's why but are they using  millimeter wave spectrum?  Yes.  Okay.  And so that's why in you know, you'll get people the qualcomm  every time I talk about this the qualcomm guys call me and  they're like Stacy there is a standard and it's the 3GPP  standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's because they're making the chips for it, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that is a standard.  So with T-Mobile they're talking about both things.  They're talking about using millimeter wave.  They're also talking about phones that use the true cellular  5G radios.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So T-Mobile had initially said that they would have 30 cities  with 5g by the end of last year.  That didn't happen.  Phones they thought would launch early this year like now  there are phones still can't buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say there are there's there's the full the Galaxy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fold which will be available for April 26th is 5g Samsung  also has a 5g s10.  They haven't announced availability for that there you  could buy a Moto X that has the promise of a 5g back but  there's no 5g back yet and some of these phones announced a  mobile World Congress.  I guess will be 5g.  Are you saying that we don't know is the technology the  technology is is settled right?  It's not that they're not do they lack the chips?  Is that the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no the technology is settled.  They just they're deploying the network.  So you have to I mean you have to get the networks out there.  Chicken and egg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understand and you need a phone and you need a network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You also need a business case and for a while the carriers  were kind of like.  We're going to do this but nobody really wanted it.  No one wanted to upgrade.  Look at the upgrade cycles on handsets now are like at three

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  years slowed it down hasn't it?  Yeah, so yeah, although you could make the case that that's  one thing that will get people back in.  If you're suddenly if you have a phone that can go five times

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  faster, but it's unclear how much this is going to affect  your overall performance because we don't have a huge use case  like remember when we went to LTE that was in the midst of  the iPhone sucking up everybody's day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when the when the when the FCC or the 3GPP talk about  nominal speeds for 5g, that's if no one else is competing for  that bandwidth at the head end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, it depends on it depends on a couple things.  If you're talking about millimeter wave band you can.  There's a lot of capacity available.  So because these bands are really fat you're looking at  like a hundred megahertz of spectrum all in one chunk that  you could use to like just gigabits of data, right?  So that's one thing the radio the 3GPP radio spec talks  about using those bands, but it also works in other bands  and you're going to see like AT&T deploy over non millimeter  wave bands.  You're going to see Verizon actually do that too because  millimeter wave bands perform horribly when going through  buildings and that sort of thing.  So you're going to be so high frequency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They get stopped by anything and they don't and they don't  propagate very far either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So what you're going to see is kind of a blend of all of these  technologies and they're going to be organized and optimized  on the carrier side, but they are going to be you're only  going to have.  You're only going to have what you need when you need it.  If that makes sense.  It's not going to not everyone's going to have this massive  gigabit connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that explains so the Verge is quoting Sprint CTO John Saw  who's was talking about this at Mobile World Congress.  He said in one demo video they ran somebody was shown getting  430 megabits per second, which is nice right 430 mega but saw  said we don't really want to focus too much on speeds, but  the experience.  I don't know what that means.  What how is the experience of 5G different if you're not talking  about it's faster latency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I wanted to ask is I'm thinking about just just  enough lanes on the highway.  If you will if I'm out at a football game or what have you  in this LTE area and there's 200,000 people within a five-mile  radius my phone is just going to struggle when it comes to  getting data.  Is this the benefit of having 5G is this is the bigger highway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or or what so if you if you stick with the highway analogy  capacity, which is what we're talking about when we talk about  things like 438 megabits per second down.  So that's capacity.  So that means everybody can you know, you've got that much data  can flow through that particular imaginary pipe because it's  wireless.  All right.  And so if you have lots of people it's a fat highway lots  of cars can still have a whole megabit to themselves right now  5G where it really excels in where we're seeing a lot of  emphasis from the carriers is on latency.  So not only is the highway bigger but I guess your car can  speed faster is maybe the way to think about that but it's  lower latency which will give you a better experience in  some things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, so we're so data calls database calls right for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your car getting back and forth to the cloud need low latency

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you're using the cloud during yourself driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think even like speech recognition.  That's look at me in my phone.  This is my phone hand.  I did this with a small child like a four-year-old and I'm  like, hey ring ring and she's looking at me and I'm like,  it's a phone and she's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hello.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This no longer she's doing for those of you just listening  that, you know, the hang loose bra Hawaiian thing with the  pinky and the thumb is the universal gesture for holding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it to my my thumbs by my ear my pinkies by my hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What you're pointing out is that no kid would recognize  that as a phone call because that's not that doesn't look  like anything they've got.  Wow.  Now we're going to be going will be going call me with the  hands folding call me call me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, sorry.  That was a total total digression from latency, but and  think about it.  Like we always talk about it in like gaming but your your  ADAS systems also things like industrial IOT.  They're looking at that.  They're one of the things at Mobile World Congress was  Qualcomm and Bosch got together and they're like we're going  to do research on not this generation of 5G but 5G NR  for the industrial IOT and that is like super focused on  low latency and uses something called deterministic  networking.  So there's a there's a lot of flavors here with 5G and one  of the reasons is because so many industries need better  broadband.  So you're going to have 5G for industrial you're going to  have 5G for cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to have yeah, and I think there are a lot of  somebody in our chat room said a lot of people looking at  it and saying maybe I can replace my internet service my  landline based internet service with 5G if it's fast and  that's what Verizon's doing right Sprint says they will  launch their 5G network this May just took a few months off  in Atlanta, Chicago Dallas and Kansas City.  Now when this happens, right?  It's not the whole it's not all of Dallas is parts of it's  whatever you have to be in the right area Dallas is a huge  area.  You know this Stacey because you were promised a lot in  Austin and got none of it.  Google Fiber didn't reach your curb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still sad about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  5G will come to Houston, LA, New York, Phoenix and Washington  by the first half of the year here.  Here where Charlotte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well not 5G but the Google Fiber discussion they  were supposed to be here in Charlotte and yeah, that hasn't  been working out so well.  They got a lot of red tape.  You don't have it now you ain't getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got bad news for you.  Right.  Google's pretty much given up on that.  So Sprint will have 5G this year in a lot of markets again.  You'll have to have a phone.  You have to find a phone that works with 5G.  Here's a good new at least for me as a Google Fi subscriber  and maybe some of you are Sprint said it's 5G network will  be part of Google Fi.  So you'd need a Fi phone that's 5G compatible not clear if  that's going to that's going to happen.  Sprint's marketing chief also said early Sprint 5G phones  this might be a reason not to rush to get a 5G phone early  Sprint 5G phones may not be compatible across networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's because there's not like a unified like we're not  sure what like Timo is doing.  I think 600 megahertz and something else spectrum for  their 5G network AT&T.  Everybody is doing different Sprint doesn't have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  spectrum doesn't have that super high-frequency spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They weren't they don't need it.  They can deploy it over they're going to put it on their

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mid-band spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, is that CDMA stuff still out there in the wild?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, CDMA is still out in the wild.  My Verizon phone still will fail over to CDMA every now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and then I think so sometimes like Verizon did but I wasn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a hundred percent sure sprinting Verizon were CDMA networks,  but it's kind of like when you when you get in a bad area  and you just go down to 3G you go to have an LTE to 3G to  2G to no 2G.  I don't know maybe not but they slowly start there is this  kind of lagging tail that they slowly get rid of over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that a couple carriers have gotten rid of  their 2G or have announced sunsets for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah Sprint says they will launch on this mid-band  spectrum, which is faster than LTE waves doesn't travel as  far slow, which by the way, it's slower than millimeter  wave but travels farther and Sprint also says it'll  rely on massive MIMO to improve its network capacity.  Multi in multi out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's another issue because you can massive MIMO is  basically the number of antennas you have in your handset.  You have to have it on your handset and you have to have  it on the tower or wherever your base station is in phones  today.  We're at 2, 4 by 2 maybe 4 by 4 and I don't see a lot of  devices, especially handsets getting like 16 by 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's not a lot of room for that.  You've seen these massively MIMO, you know the MIMO Wi-Fi  routers.  They look like spiders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're crazy big and I mean it's cool for a gateway  for example, if you want to stick something out in the  middle of a field or you know, maybe on top of a car or  an ambulance but not I mean this is like satellite all over  again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sprint says it will launch the 5G hotspots.  You're going to see I think everybody do that.  That's what Verizon is doing right now and that's for home  and office not for mobile.  So really this is a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a mess.  It's just we're called we're using the phrase 5G to mean  like three different things, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  It's confusing to consumers.  That's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is but you know consumers we're not all Hermione.  Well, no, then consumers, you know, I wouldn't buy so here's  here's my take for your consumer take.  I wouldn't buy a 5G phone expecting anything awesome nor  would you need it anytime this year and probably well into  next at the end of 2020 if you wanted to upgrade you're going  to get something out of it, but I don't think this year  you're going to get a lot out of having a quote-unquote  5G phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And see I was thinking earlier with my whole power user  discussion.  It was it seems like the 5G talk is still marketing speak  and marketing towards people being able to quote-unquote  do more, you know as if whatever phones do everything and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no, I think if you were buying 5G for fixed wireless, I  think that's something you could buy today and within the  next year like if you hate your cable provider, it's going  to provide another option for cable basically good.  Okay, but it'll be from someone like Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here like still be somebody you hate but it just different  someone you hate different someone you hate.  All right.  So there's the 5G explainer.  It was it, you know, it was all over Mobile World Congress.  But again, this is you know, it's up in the air as to how  this is going to come out and how it's going to be.  Stacey.  Yes.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop calling me miss Stacy Hermione Higginbotham throwing  me out there man.  What I married to miss Stacy, Miss Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every new flagship will have a 5G variant of the phones  showed at Mobile World Congress like the Galaxy S10 5G  the V 50 the LG V 50 5G the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 5G.  Whoa.  So but don't try your advice.  I think is is right unless you unless you're you know planning  to keep this phone for five years.  You probably shouldn't buy it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's not worth the cost if the two years from now  premium comes from 5G and then just say buy a folding phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  instead and then and this is from Tom's guide where they  had a great article on on 5G stuff.  Caitlin McGarry and Adam Ismail a 5G takeaways of Mobile  World Congress and one of them was expect weird and wonderful  devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I liked that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the HTC Hub.  This is the one that I think Sprint said it would be offering  later this year.  It's a hotspot, but it's got a big 5-inch display on it.  So it can stand on its own.  It's got Android Pie can stream media play games even run  apps.  There's an Ethernet cable.  You can plug into other devices if you want to get even  faster speed Bluetooth Bluetooth connectivity for controllers.  I'm glad HTC has found something to do.  I wonder if there's a microphone on it.  Oh, there's definitely a mic.  It's a Snapdragon 855.  It's a hotspot with heart.  That's what I'm going to call it.  Hotspot with heart.  Oh, yeah, Google's getting in trouble with the microphone  thing.  Stacey just added a little article to our rundown.  I guess Congress we talked about this last week that people  found out that the Google Home was it?  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The microphone on the nest guard box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's part of the nest security system.  The nest that was it's like the base unit right of the nest  and now Congress is calling.  There's a letter the United States Senate.  Congress is calling on Google to explain to me Google what  else you got microphones on.  And we gave them a pass last week as you may remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did.  Oh, but oh, this is actually a good point.  If you should like to do it, you should go to the Stacey  and IOT because I did a consumer Bill of Rights for connected  devices.  And one of the things we talked about I think we may have  talked about this last week was that you should disclose that  you have a microphone on there and there's some other things  that you should do.  But the and that's what the this is the Commerce Committee of  the US Senate is asking them.  Hey, have you always had this right?  Why what what happened?  How did you not list it right?  What changed?  Yeah, these are and my favorite is is Google aware of similar  omissions of the technical specs for other Google products?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What else has got a mic Google and has Google been aware of  any third party using the Nesseqer microphone for any unauthorized  purchase or purpose not purchase the senators have asked

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guler respond by March 12th and they are asking for an in-person  briefing to committee staff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This be so awesome to be a congressperson and say I would  love to just be able to be like Sundar.  Come here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get here.  Get over here.  So now I have some questions over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're in trouble.  You're in trouble, buddy.  Get over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sundar.  Most of the time they don't know an iPhone from a pixel.  So I don't know if I want to be a kind of I think Congress is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  getting a little smarter.  This is the the Commerce Committee and the Subcommittee on  communications technology innovation the internet John Thune  Roger wicker Jerry Moran.  I yeah, they're getting better.  I think they're not as not as dumb as they used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could this be a situation where Google just please please the  Fifth Amendment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I don't think you're allowed.  They're allowed to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not a lawyer.  So yeah, interesting.  Google is also facing the Supremes.  You remember that Google lost in an Oracle Google lawsuit Oracle.  There was this one went on for on forever forever ever.  Right.  Yeah, basically the question boiled down to something really  off-target, but this is the best that Oracle could do which was  is it is it a copyright violation to use a published API?  And of course if you know that the thanks to the ruling which  said yeah, it is that violates copyright.  You can copyright an API that kind of breaks the notion of  API's because API's like we have a public API for our podcasts.  We want people to write software that uses the public API.  That's the poor purpose of an API.  But Oracle is saying because they couldn't get Google just on  you know copying Java that didn't work out.  They lost on that.  So they said well, okay, but Java's API is copyright and Google  emulated it writing a completely compatible language that uses  the Java API and the courts upheld Oracle's rights there.  So now it's in front of the Supreme Court and  dozens of briefs are coming in from the tech community in  Google's favor Mozilla Microsoft Python Red Hat Electronic  Frontier Foundation 65 intellectual property scholars among  others because everybody understands that API's and the use  of API's is kind of critical to the entire way the software  industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The lingua franca of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Perfect.  Perfect.  Damages we don't know the damages are one point Oracle was  asking for 8.8 billion dollars.  The lower court has not yet ruled on damages, but I don't  think it's the money from at this point for Google Oracle  General Council said despite Google and it's a me cheese.  Those are the people the amicus curiae briefs that are coming  in in its favor despite how you say that well amicus curiae.  Yes.  Okay.  I don't know if it's a me cheese or amici when I was learning  Latin so church in Church Latin.  It would be a me cheese a soft sea.  When I was learning Latin the whole new thing and this was  like a hundred years ago, but the whole new thing was oh no  Caesar hard.  So it's not Cicero.  It's kicker row.  Which nobody liked so amici and unless something's changed  and if you're a Latin scholar, please contact me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had no idea how to say the words.  I only know how to spell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, amicus is friend curiae is of the court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So those are the fact Latin has a gift jiff discussion  happening.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  So instead of Caesar, it's Kaiser Kaiser.  Okay, like the roll like the Kaiser roll.  I don't think that's  anyway, I'm gonna I said amici because that's the Italian  or the Church Latin pronunciation.  But I think actually is probably amici.  Anyway, this I will read it again.  I don't even know if Oracle's General Counsel knows how to  pronounce it despite Google and it's amicis overheated  rhetoric predicting the end of the software industry.  It is continued to thrive.  Well, that's true with increased R&D spending higher  investment in innovation and hiring demand outpacing  supply.  In other words, he says there's no issue.  The arguments are without merit and we want our billions.  The court will decide now.  There's an example of a Supreme Court that I think is  woefully inadequate to decide this one.  But we'll find out.  Pretty smart.  They're smart.  Oh, I'm not saying they're smart, but do they know from  an API?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope they have someone in the chat room said, you know,  we're talking about API is like web services and this is  about web APIs as just I don't remember what they said.  Well,  you know, I didn't know there was a difference.  So I'm sitting here thinking about this.  I'm like, oh, so like just the language of the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As you know, Android was originally Java and what Google  when Google got in, you know, Oracle said, yeah, we let  Java's license for free and you can use it for free, but  we don't intend for you to make this massively successful  commercial product.  And so we want some they lost and that then they said, well,  okay, but and then Google in the meantime started to rewrite  it in a create a Java like thing was that was it Dalvik a  Java like language that stuff could be written in that would  have compatible API's because otherwise everything breaks  and then Oracle said no, you can't use even if you're not  using Java anymore.  We still got you because you're using our copyrighted API in  your in your new Java clone.  So I mean on the one hand, I kind of understand.  Yeah, I mean what is an API it merely says when you when  when a program sends you this message you respond with this  message.  That's really fundamentally all it is.  Should that be could you copyright how you respond to a  message and what the message how the message is formed the  query how the query and answer form.  Can you copyright that seems to me not?  I don't know.  It's complicated.  So the reporter checked in with Professor William McCarthy of  the Greek and Latin Department of Catholic University.  See never ask a Catholic the professor said amicus.  So it's that's how I thought it was amici.  So the K is the C is hard, but the emphasis is on the first  syllable.  I'm like so I don't I don't think anybody from that Roman  era is here to tell us how they pronounced it but presumably  they've got clerks who know what's going on and some of  these guys may understand.  You know, you're right.  I mean it can be explained to them in a way that they  understand it and then they can they can rule on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So maybe maybe they are holy cow someone in the chat room  just threw up a William Sapphire column all about this  from 1997.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's called when a justice needs a friend you got a friend.  There are two kinds of legal kibitzers those who pronounce  amicus amicus and nobody pronounces amicus which is how  I initially and those who pronounce it amicus each submits  a brief as an outsider ostensibly not with an interest  in the outcome of the case, but as a friend of the court in  Latin amicus curiae.  You know, this is why I miss William Sapphire.  Justice Breyer had his own pronunciation.  He said a micas.  Okay.  We'll see now.  I don't feel bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel bushy because I always said amicus apparently William

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  McCarthy is oh, this is the one who agreed Breyer pronunciation  was nonstandard professor preferred amicus amicus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is totally derailed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, this is exactly what twig is all about.  Brian Garner editor of the dictionary of modern legal  usage and editor of the seventh edition of Black's Law  dictionary.  Says it sounds like a micas cure cure e I what?  Oh Lord.  Justice Breyer adopted an Anglo Latin pronunciation.  It will make any Latin teacher apoplectic, but it has English  and American history behind it.  And in the end that matters more than how Cicero or kicker  Oh might have mouthed the phrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So glad I have no use for this word in my vocabulary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If this thing goes on, there's a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if he really comes to a conclusion.  I used to love those articles about things like that as you  words.  As you words.  I love words.  You love words.  You're a writer.  You got to love words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a reporter.  I never call myself a writer.  Really never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And why is that you don't like to write so you like to report  them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  I love learning.  Yeah, I'm a wonk man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hermione I've never heard that phrase until today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  And she's a wonk.  It's a good thing being a wonk in my mind is right up there  with being a geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Outstanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, what if I'm a wonk who plays D&D?  What does that make me then you're a wonky geek or a geeky  wonk?  Okay.  I was just curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you can be both a geek in my opinion is anybody who has  an outsized enthusiasm for a narrow slice of stuff usually  technology, but it could be comic books.  5G 5G  anything.  Yeah, and a wonk in my opinion if William Sapphire were here  we'd ask him but in my opinion a wonk is somebody who really  loves the nitty-gritty details of everything and studies it  and will be glad to tell you.  So you're a geeky wonk.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what should we talk about next?  Have we killed I mean do we want to talk about the Huawei  thing that was overshadowing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I've gotten people writing to me saying  shame on you Leo for falling for you know, the US government's  propaganda against Huawei, but I think it's hard to turn your  back on numerous convictions or arrests anyway now on spying  and accusations of spying and I think there's a lot of evidence  that Huawei isn't maybe the  upstanding global citizen one would hope but is much more  likely the thrall of the Chinese government.  I still don't know if the calls to you know abandon Huawei  5G gear is a political move.  I tell you how we'll know though where it looks like the  president has now indicated he wants to sign a trade agreement  with China.  He's backing down considerably and if he does and all of a  sudden the calls to get rid of Huawei disappear well then  you'll know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, or if Huawei just tells him he had they have 6G then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, yeah, he's anxious to get 6G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He can have it Wi-Fi baby new name new name just to screw

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  everything up and Huawei says there's no evidence of the  claims against us.  Somebody in the chat room says just because it's propaganda  doesn't mean it's not true.  All of that is true and the problem is just very hard to  know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  While ways I know the Chinese government had funded Huawei  there are close ties in China is not a transparent country and  it does have a pretty good stranglehold on its corporate  leaders.  So it's really hard to assess these claims and I think you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  could safely say that even if today while way is not spying  that the nature of being a Chinese company with investment  from the Chinese government is if they were asked to spy down  the road.  They wouldn't really even be able to say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although AT&T did the same thing so spying on us right at

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the NSA into the AT&T wire closet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean, yes, it's different but it's also not unprecedented  that a government would come to its companies and be like,  hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we're talking speaking at Mobile World Congress.  Guo Ping who I guess is the chairman of Huawei said we don't  do bad things.  I think that was Google's motto for some time.  He's the rotating.  He's the yeah, according to the CNBC.  He's the rotating chairman.  I can do that too.  I have a rotating chair, but he's the rotating chairman of  the world's largest provider of telecommunications equipment  that is Huawei where most 5G equipment comes from.  Although the US has been pressuring allies not to use Huawei's  technology and its 5G networks.  Guo Ping said to build a system that we can all trust we need  aligned responsibility, unified standards and clear regulations.  We could proudly say 5G is safer than 4G and as a vendor,  we don't operate carriers networks and we don't own carrier  data. In a way, he's pointing to the fact that at least one  carrier in the US was handing over your information not to  the Chinese government, but to our government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well in there are like Ericsson, for example, does deals with  carriers where they will operate their network for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there is a difference there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a distinction to be made between AT&T which  owns and operates its network and buys the gear from them  and somebody who doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a precedent for Huawei executives getting hot under  the collar.  I remember at CES last year, not this most recent one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, well that was legit man.  They like just suddenly pulled his big announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he was about to get on stage and say the Huawei P20  phone, which is a great phone, which I have Paul Therotte  uses. I didn't realize that.  Was about to announce that they were going to have a carrier  deal in the US with Verizon and AT&T under pressure from the  administration. Verizon and AT&T pulled out and Huawei's  chairman got up on stage furious, livid because instead  of making a great announcement, he had to say you're not going  to be able to get this phone in the US.  You're not going to be able to get the Huawei folding phone  either because they don't sell phones in the US because of  that. They say without a carrier, there's no point in us  trying to market a phone in the US.  We need a carrier partnership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's true.  I mean remember there was a smartphone before the iPhone.  It was the Nokia phones and nobody in the US had them  because the carriers wouldn't subsidize them and this was  back in that day.  So it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's by the way, your consumer rights bill, Bill of Rights.  And do you have on there probably should have on there  something about and it won't let the Chinese government  spy on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I didn't do that because this was a little bit  more generic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is things to look for like you should know you should  be there should be disclosure.  What sensors are in there especially if oh hi Stacy,  sorry, especially no, no every site does that every site does  little pop-up saying sign up for my newsletter even though  I'm already signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the ones that like yes disclose all of your sensors  but things like an expiration date for devices.  So when are you going to stop patching them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really good.  More than expiration date a commitment to continue to patch  them to that point, you know a commitment.  That's what I want.  I want to know when you're going to stop supporting it,  but I want your commitment that you will support it right  up to that day the bitter end and Microsoft does that with  their operating systems.  You know, they actually know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the IOT devices are like they're coming in and they do  it for enterprise.  So Microsoft and Google and even Qualcomm will support  enterprise chips for seven to ten years, but they don't do  it for consumer devices, which I feel is so we had a really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  good sponsor.  I really like them lighthouse was that it had time of flight  sensor in it.  It had a camera in it had a night vision.  It had a lot of AI and I used it and they just went out of  business.  I'm sad to say they did the right thing though.  They refunded every owner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had the CEO on my podcast.  We talked about time of light sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's a you know, that's an example of a company  with all the right ideas with a great product and what he said  was I think it was too expensive because it was like over  300 bucks and I think it was it was competing against, you  know, I mean for crying out loud you're competing now  against the wisecam for $20 and people just couldn't see  their way to spending that much money and then subscribing  to a service as well.  Yeah, but if you were a lighthouse, if you did buy a  lighthouse, especially if you bought it because I said how  good it was which it was Alex has written a post at light  dot house and they did commit to refunding everybody some  money.  So I presume that I hope they've contacted you and said  something about it.  Now I have this great lighthouse which I'm going to put  in my Museum of dead defunct technology.  Yeah, I wish there were some way to keep it working but without  the back-end service.  It just there's nothing.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you say the other the other thing I put in there that I  want to make a plug for is two-factor authentication for  connected devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely wish they would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ness does it Chamberlain for the my Q does it.  I'm looking for other devices that do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we'll see if that's what you're saying when you're saying  do it.  It means when you log into your nest, you know, my nest home  website, you need a password and a second factor, which is  it through an authenticator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, and you link your devices to an account and this actually  like there was a rash of stories recently about nest cameras  getting hacked, but they weren't hacked.  It's just that someone's password on the nest camera.  They used it in multiple places and someone then got into  exactly is that hacking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and had they had two-factor wouldn't even have mattered.  So you use a different password all the time and use two-factor,  you know, I can't think of a single router manufacturer that  is two-factor and there are a lot of routers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey Nick Weaver.  Yeah, get on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think probably shouldn't write a letter to Jeff Bezos  now that he owns a company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has a deal closed yet.  It was announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It takes a while.  These things take a while.  Yeah, that's a perfect example.  Eero should because Eero is managed over the network.  So that's really important that you have that kind of security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I can do things with Eero such as block devices on my  network.  I can see all kinds of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a lot of routers that don't have that or don't you  turn off that remote administration, the WAN administration,  but Eero kind of requires it and many mesh routers do require  Plume does that.  Warby does not do that.  Warby is more like a traditional router.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not a real mesh system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they're well, they are.  Wow, you have a dog there too?  That's my dog.  The dog was a fan of Warby's.  It travels with me.  He loves those.  He loves his Warby's.  Yeah, but I do think routers if they at least if they require  wide area network administration should have two-factor.  I agree with you a hundred percent on that Stacey.  They also if they have data how long you know who gets access  to the data and how long it's kept very very important.  That should be in the privacy policy obviously.  I love the expiration date.  I think that's really good.  Do you anticipate that as time goes by you'll add new clauses  to this agreement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope so.  I think there are lots of things that I'm hoping people will  say, hey we should totally have this too.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yes demanded of them.  Hermione says so.  I don't care barking dog.  Well, I'll tell you what while you while Stacey feeds the  visitors to the dog.  I'll tell you a little bit about our sponsor for today.  Captera.  This week in Google brought to you by Captera.  Captera is a great company if you are looking for software  for your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I shut the doors against the beast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So YouTube's would go through a weird thing for a long time on  YouTube.  I think we were somehow white listed.  They thought we were a news organization and we are I think  and they and we didn't get content strikes against us and  then something changed in the content ID system last week and  it wasn't just us.  There are a lot of weird content strikes.  We got we got Mac break weekly got pulled down because we  showed and talked about an Apple ad in the middle of the  show and but then Linus on techs podcast took down his  own podcast for content ID.  I don't even know how that works.  So I think there's something weird going on if you are at  YouTube.  Can you white list us so that we don't because we got another  one.  We got another ding that didn't even make sense.  It was completely out of nowhere.  I feel like the content ID system probably because YouTube  has been going under such heat.  Here's a here's a new one.  This is from the Washington Post a pediatrician a Florida  doctor.  Who's got the great name free Hess.  Found instructions for suicide in videos on YouTube kids.  Holy crap.  She says minutes into the clip from a children's video game  a man appeared on the screen offering instructions on how  to kill yourself.  I was shocked.  Has said noting that since then the scenes been spliced that  scene has been spliced into several more videos from the  popular Nintendo game Splatoon on YouTube and YouTube kids  YouTube kids is specifically aimed at children supposedly  safe for children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's not great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I won't I don't want to trigger anybody so I won't talk about  what the clip has but is extremely detailed and totally  inappropriate.  She says I think it's extremely dangerous for our kids.  Yeah, and I telling the Washington Post.  I think our kids are facing a whole new world with social  media and internet access.  It's changing the way they're growing and it's changing the  way they're developing and I think videos like this put them  at risk.  It's not clear why this YouTube personality Filthy Frank is  his name.  Did this but his fans have been known to put him in memes and  other videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could just be just for the lulz, you know, it is probably  that I mean that's that's the sad people out there because I  I've got my daughter is she downloaded some I can't think  of the name of it right now.  It's a it's a character building app and that is fine.  There's censored chat that we talked about but the YouTube  videos which when she plays any game she's constantly on the  YouTube videos for that game are crazy disturbing.  It's like someone was like, oh kids love this.  Let's use it to really screw with their heads.  So we did a deal where she does not watch those YouTube videos  and she can have the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's and you know as we gave you to pass last week because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no, no, we didn't on the pedophiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not that it's just this it's hard.  Well, we gave him a half a pass.  I think they I looked it's hard to police YouTube.  It's just so massive.  I mean clearly we want them to do a better job and they want  to do a better job.  I mean they don't want this stuff showing up in YouTube kids  any more than they want the pedophile comments to show up  on innocent videos of children.  That's not something I mean you can't accuse them of wanting  that maybe they need to work harder on stopping it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hire some more people to train these algorithms that are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, but you saw the you know, this is the problem we call  for that and then you saw the the article from oh my god  Casey Newton writing in the verge on the horrific lives  led by these Facebook moderators the trauma floor the secret  lies of Facebook moderators in America just horrific.  It's a job.  Nobody wants nobody should have to do there are a thousand  people doing this for Facebook in Phoenix 15,000 around the  world and they see the worst.  I mean it's worse than being a cop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They see the worse you feel for those people because they  end up.  I mean they could potentially end up being desensitized to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's just well and he he start Casey starts with talking  about a specific worker who was having panic attacks because  because of what she saw.  I don't want to again.  It's too graphic.  I don't want to talk about it, but the stuff she saw made  her nuts made her just.  I mean people being murdered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People are awful people are awful.  Again that that those those that team of a thousand people  are needed.  They are desperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but think about how many hours of content it's like 36  hours for every hour of content is uploaded or 36 hours of  content is uploaded to YouTube like for every every hour every  hour every minute.  I don't remember minutes every minute.  It keeps going on obviously people can't keep up with that.  So how do we how do we figure this out because it is a  problem and it's running away from us and we can figure this  out.  We just maybe maybe it results in more legit takedowns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know Casey also points out that moderators make at  least the Phoenix moderators make $28,800 a year while the  average while the average Facebook employee has a total  compensation of 240,000 you you got to be kidding me.  Yeah, and and I think there's a high level of PTSD as you might  imagine and once they leave the company there's no support for  that from anybody.  There is a counselor on duty.  But only for part of the day.  It doesn't sound like a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's on Facebook in my opinion.  I'm a sad maybe maybe how she makes that yeah, you're making

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a lot of money.  You could pay them better.  You can help them you can support them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think I was I was on this week in Google.  I discussed talking about Apple and how you have the executives  that make a gazillion dollars.  You have the sales team that makes a gazillion dollars far as  trying to sell services and whatnot.  But then you go to the Apple Store and those folks are not  making a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But well look at Amazon where it's even there's an even greater  Gulf, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, and but all of those people at the bottom of that  food chain, they have some serious value there and they  should be compensated for it.  Now you guys I mean, this is America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I understand people have college degrees and experience  and education and all of that can can warrant having extra  wages.  I get that.  So I went to college but at the same time it shouldn't be such  a huge gap when you got people staring at a screen of just  disgusting content and trying to protect the eyeballs of my  hard-headed kids from seeing it out there accidentally.  You know, those people should should leaderships should look  at that and fix that from a compensated compensation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It seems unfair, but this is this is life and you know,  capitalist society.  On the other hand, I would submit to Facebook that it's  important to do a better job of this because the upshot of this  and YouTube too is that you will lose customers because people  won't let their kids look at Facebook.  They don't want to I'm not on Facebook.  I don't want to near a Facebook.  I very rarely go to YouTube and whatever I do.  I never read YouTube comments.  So this hurts your business.  Yeah, and they really if you can't get to the matter of  humanity and you know, I'm a business owner.  I pay my employees terribly but that's business.  No, I don't.  I actually what I do is I don't have I don't know anything  about what they get paid.  My my my CEO my business partner my wife does that and she  won't she doesn't tell me so I can say when I when I'm brought  up in court or for in front of Congress.  I just say well, I don't know you'll have to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to ask you so much anything quite as bad as it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  almost as bad and you may have PTSD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have us arguing over Latin pronunciations of words.  I mean, he's a Harvard man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He loves that kind of stuff.  I've heard he's like no as you know, I'll tell you because  I spent my whole life until very recently till I started my  own business as an employee.  I think I am try to be a fair a better employer.  I want to be the employer that I wanted when I was an employee  but honestly, it's America.  I mean, you know business you got to pay minimum wage, but  that's about it.  So I think the way to appeal to Facebook and YouTube and  other companies and Twitter.  I would guess you throw them in there too is just appeal to  their greed appeal to their bottom line and say look this  is going to hurt you.  It is going to hurt them.  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, this is why we need metrics above and beyond profits to  measure how corporations are we have to measure the  externalities and the costs associated.  You're just a socialist.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't have to be socialism for me to call you a socialist  you understand that right?  Right, right, right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just can I call you a Nazi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know how it works.  Is that is that the next level socialist Nazi?  Yeah, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Perfect.  Perfect.  Fascist socialist fascist socialist.  What are we live in a terrible world?  I wish we could fix this.  I do.  I really do.  Most people are good.  Aren't they?  Yes, they are.  And I know, you know that and I know you believe that I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not going to say most.  Oh really?  You don't think it's more than 51%?  I can't say that.  I see a whole lot of see a whole lot of stuff brother.  I'm just fortunate that I deal with, you know more than 51%  is trying to stick around the stick with the good ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know.  Well, that's even more depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, let's let's let's take some cheery news.  I could I like to believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how about how about this Wall Street Journal article  that talks about an app called flow that women use to monitor  their menstrual cycles in order to get pregnant and things  like that turns out flow has code in it from Facebook that  even if you're not a Facebook subscriber, even if you don't  have the Facebook app, if you're even if you're not logged  in it tells Facebook when you're menstruating among other  things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Bloomberg did this story like two or three weeks ago,  but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, let's get credit to Bloomberg then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bloomberg had a period tracking apps or fertility tracking  apps share more data than you think and the Times has been

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doing articles like that as well.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, this is this is part of that.  Hey before you, you know, having a clear and easy way to  share what data goes out to what people is I mean it really  that's that should be a minimal standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Journal hired somebody to test this.  They found for instance instant heart rate, which is a heart  the most popular heart rate app on iOS sends a user's heart  rate to Facebook immediately after it's recorded.  Realtor.com which is a real estate app, which by the way is  owned by a subsidiary of the Wall Street Journal or actually  the parent Corp News Corp sends the location and price of  listings that you view noting which ones were marked as  favorites to Facebook.  Facebook's got a lot of data on there.  And the thing is there's no way to stop that because if you're  using it doesn't say it explicitly.  There's the it's just you can't you won't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's crazy.  I read a EULA the other day from a product that was sent to  me to review and I'm glad I read the EULA first because it  confused me.  So I've just put the product down.  Yeah, do you mind if I read two lines?  Yeah, let's hear it.  All right.  So it says and I changed the company's name in there.  It says you own personally identifiable user-generated  data.  ABC Company can't use it without your consent.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  Then it says you grant ABC Company a revocable non-exclusive  worldwide royalty-free license to reproduce, distribute,  transmit, publicly perform, publicly display, digitally  perform, modify, create derivative works of and otherwise  use personally identifiable user-generated data.  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they start by saying, you know, without your consent,  we can't do anything.  Can we have your consent?  The next sentence.  The next sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't know.  At least it's right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, they know nobody reads it.  Yeah, at least it's right there.  But why even bother to say we can't without your consent  and then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why aren't you telling us what the product name is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess I could but no, it's just not my style.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know, Instagram got a lot of heat because Instagram  wanted some similar rights to your photos, right?  I mean, this is an uncommon and I think, you know, in  defense of this, lawyers write these because you always,  when you write a contract, take the broadest rights you  can because you never know.  You know, maybe we'll make a billboard ad out of your photo  and then, you know, we don't want any problem with that  afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We wouldn't want to have to ask your permission first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got your permission.  Don't you remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You clicked okay.  Otherwise, it's not scalable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook did kill that Onavo app that we were talking about,  the Android VPN app.  It was the VPN, right?  Yeah, they killed that.  But you know, honestly, and maybe this is cynical of me,  but my reaction to this is, oh yeah, as soon as they get  caught, they kill it, but that doesn't stop them from doing  something different.  In fact, that's exactly what happened with Onavo when Apple  said you can't do that.  They made a new app, just put the Onavo code into that and  sold that on the iPhone or gave that away on the iPhone.  So it doesn't encourage me when companies say, oh gosh,  oh, I'm so sorry.  We won't, we'll never do that again because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And again, I'm not one that's going to just totally balk at  some of these companies having my data because I love what  Google does for me and my day-to-day life as far as keeping  me squared away, knowing my habits and things of that  nature and you know, hey, you got an appointment to go to  here in a little while.  You need to leave now.  You'll pick up your son because he's got to be there on time  and you know, just I love that stuff.  It really does help me out when they can feed in and pull  useful information like that.  The whole ad standpoint that people at these tech companies  claim that they're doing it for, I never really see it.  I never see targeted ads or anything like that nine times  out of 10, I guess it's because of my VPN.  But when it comes to some of the other stuff as far as, you  know, Google reading my email that knows that, you know, my  monthly bill for whatever service is due on such a such day,  make sure your bank account is ready for that automatic  draft, you know.  I dig that to an extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's not it's not all bad.  It's it's not all right.  Yeah, it's not all bad.  We just have to keep an eye on it and call them call them out  like you just did and that's good.  Yeah, he didn't call them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did not tell us who it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't call him out publicly, but I did email them back with  the screenshot of the EULA because it is it was for a device  that's going to be measuring things medically.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And so of course I wanted to read it a little closer and I  took a screenshot of it and I sent it to them and I said,  hey, so what's the deal with this this this EULA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for you for reading it.  I mean most people they know most people don't read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whose side was that?  That was that's little Jack's somebody downstairs rung the  doorbell.  So the biggest quote unquote my smallest dog is decided to  bark.  He's not that small.  I bet no, he's small.  Oh, he's a teacup Chihuahua.  Oh, it's small.  Yeah, the big dog doesn't bark unless he needs to.  It's always that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't it big dogs never bark big big dogs don't need to bark.  It's true for humans too.  I think true.  Here's an IOT story Ray Ozzie, you know that name.  He helped create Lotus Notes worked at Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he is creating a new company called Blues.  What is it Blues Wireless?  The idea is that you might have an IOT device, but it does  not have to connect to your Wi-Fi.  It has its own connectivity built in on 3G or 4G.  And so you could add the Blues Wireless module to your IOT  device and it would be more secure because everything's  encrypted secure credentials stored on the device itself.  It's set up to connect wirelessly at the factory.  So it's easier for users.  I have a scale.  I'm on this medically supervised diet, you know program  lose weight loss program and they sent me a scale.  And it just and I said well do I have to pair this to my  phone or set it up on the internet?  This no, no, it just sends it to us.  Whenever I weigh myself.  It just boom they get it.  And I guess it's using it's got to be using, you know cell  connectivity somehow.  It has a serial number I guess a serial number and they  just connect that to my account and since I weigh myself  it shows up in the app.  It's like, oh that was weird.  So that's what this would do.  Like a Kindle, right?  Kindle has WhisperSync.  They plan to sell the modules at enough of a profit to cover  the cost of the device and the wireless data.  IOT devices unless their cameras don't use a lot of data  right that scale.  It's not using a lot of data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Send now usually usually it's like a kilobyte less than a  kilobyte of data data wouldn't be for cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously that wouldn't that would not that would not be  cost prohibitive.  Let's do the thing with the drums and trumpet.  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New stuff from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And has been here since we started doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, my favorite segment.  I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you love the change log pace.  Apparently Stacey does not.  Either that she's wearing her invisibility cloak building  the Google Assistant on phones for everyone everywhere.  Google Assistant is now coming to the Android messages app.  It will do the kinds of things that alo I guess did assistant  is in Maps.  You might have noticed that assistant everywhere.  I think this makes a lot of sense and of course it makes  it easier for Google to collect information, but we won't  mention that if you're chatting with your friends in the  Android messages app and you need to quickly look something  up your assistant will help at any point just press the home  button long press the home button and it will pop up and  you can even see what you're saying.  I gather and show you stuff then that's how alo worked and  that was really cool.  Yeah, you would say hey, let's go to dinner at what restaurant  you want to go to.  I don't know.  How about tellies and then it would just pop up.  You can make a reservation right in the messenger.  That's good.  Now that they've killed alo.  It's good to have convenient.  Yeah, really convenient.  I wish they'd fix their messaging platform because I'm a  Google Fi user.  I want to have a cross message cross platform messaging that  I can use on my iOS and Mac as well as Android and Android  messages does not do that but Hangouts does but that's really  some.  Also I use Hangouts.  I said what that's still there.  It's still around.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just barely hanging on by a thread.  I'm a Google verse Google voice person.  Yeah, same problem, right?  Fairly convenient being able to access it over the web or  whatever like that, but it still has its quirks from a  messaging standpoint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now thanks to Google Play services Android devices running  version 7 or later will use Fido 2 to let you use a  fingerprint or pin to log into various services.  I think that's a great thing because of course on many phones  now you are doing biometric logins and it would be really  nice if those logins was extend to apps websites and other  places and apparently Fido 2 that standard does have that  and that maybe soon you'll be able just to do that everywhere  you go.  Fido 2 supports a variety of authentication methods and  it's also supported in Chrome Edge and Firefox.  Developers do have to adopt the Fido API to support the  feature.  Let's see what else Google says Android one.  That's the inexpensive version of Android Android one  Activations grew very popular 250% year over year.  So people like that.  Awesome.  Isn't that good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean everybody can afford a thousand dollar phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  50% of the new entry-level Android devices are Android  Go digital well-being tools also coming to more phones.  Google Docs AI powered grammar checker is coming to everyone  on G Suite.  G Suite is the paid business version.  It's Grammarly it ain't Grammarly's are our advertiser,  but it's also the case Grammarly it ain't but it does have  some nice features.  So for instance, if you write something is more likely not to  do something else suggest maybe you should say more likely to  not.  I would ask Stacey about it, but she's not a writer.  She's a reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's right.  I have an editor for those kind of questions.  I pay I pay her lots of money.  So she handles those kind of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you watch the the Oscars?  Did you see the new Google Assistant commercials?  Well good.  Let's play them.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this going to get you probably on YouTube?

Mom's talking to her daughter and driving her nuts.  Eventually her daughter hurls herself out of the moving car.  She's going so crazy.  But in this version, she instead asked Google Assistant to book her  a lift ride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Your lift has arrived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it just doesn't work.  In what was that scream?  Scream just doesn't work.  If you've got a nest camera, right?  Here's here's a Jerry Jerry McGuire.  Remember that great scene?  Show me the money.  Oh, Cuba.  Cuba Gooding Jr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Show me the money.  Here you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, I tried that immediately after that commercial and it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can tell your assistant show me the money.  I'll show you the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  I love that.  Of course it does.  So the theme of this is make Google do it.  Home Hub.  Home Mini.  And Pixel 3.  I'm glad the Ramones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was and then it's nice to do an ad that ties in with the movies when  you're doing an ad on the Oscars.  And just for the record.  Spike Lee was robbed.  As was Alfonso Cuaron.  I really thought and I think we talked about last week.  I really thought Roma would win Best Picture and it would have been a  big deal for the technology world because it would be a Netflix movie  winning an Academy Award.  It was a streaming first movie and I actually think that might be why  it didn't win because oh, well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no there's no way the the Academy is going to allow

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that to happen.  Right.  But Black Panther could have won Black Clansmen could have won  Green Book is a it's you know, driving Miss Daisy for the 21st century.  It was so trickly.  Trickily is a good word.  Trickily is a good word.  I enjoyed it.  That's saying I didn't enjoy it.  But it was a little trickily kind of glossed over maybe some significant  race issues in the 60s in the South.  Maybe I don't know.  Just maybe maybe just a little bit.  Living the multi dream.  By blending coding with a rap career.  What Brandon Tory is a Googler.  He works in the LA office on artificial intelligence training computer  models to better understand how humans use language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a FedEx same day bot.  It's an innovation designed to change the face of local  delivery and help retailers efficiently address their  customers rising expectations.  So AutoZone, Lowe's, Pizza Hut, Target, Walgreens and Walmart  and they hope to test the bot in this summer in markets like  notice summer not winter or not winter or during rain in  markets like Memphis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was a plot point on the Americans.  It can bring the medicine to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you notice that they have taped off with caution tape the  entire studio to make sure the bot doesn't accidentally  wander.  Oh, it can go over sand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rocks.  Through the water.  Through the water.  Come on.  Get up to the top buddy.  Up some steps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, people will beat it up before it gets anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing.  I mean, it's only going to work in certain areas, obviously.  Yeah.  Elon Musk is a little bit of trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I heard he was but I didn't hear what he did or I didn't  really get a chance to go and look and see what he did or  said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He maintains that the information he tweeted was already  part of their earnings, but the SEC was like, oh, we told  you not to tweet anything about financials anymore.  You're being held in contempt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He tweeted 24 million people.  See, this is it.  I've been telling the Elon to get off Twitter for years.  Yeah.  Now the SEC is asking a judge to hold Elon Musk in contempt  of because he violated the deal.  He has till March 11 to explain why he should not be held  in contempt.  Does that mean jail time?  Does it mean a fine?  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you all think it was okay for him to tweet what he tweeted  when he tweeted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
