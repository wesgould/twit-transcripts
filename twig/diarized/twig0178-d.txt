Transcript:  This is Twig.  This is Twig This Week in Google, Episode 178, recorded  the day after Christmas 2012, the best of 2012.  This Week in Google is brought to you by Ford, featuring  Bliss, the blind spot information system, with  cross traffic alert and active park assist.  Check out these available features on the 2013 Ford  Fusion and 2013 Ford Taurus.  And learn more at ford.com slash technology.  Hello, everybody, and welcome to a special edition of  This Week in Google.  You'll notice Jeff's not here.  Gina's with her family.  It is after all the Christmas week.  So we thought it'd be fun to do with Twig what we've done  with other shows in the past, and do a year-ender best of,  some of the best segments from this year's This Week in  Google.  We've got some good stuff for you coming up.  Let's start with the fun that we all had thinking about all  the things we didn't get, and some of us did get, at  Google I.O. early in the year.  I'll tell you what, I plus one'd.  Wow.  So Vic Gundotra's talking on, a little droning on about  events.  This is a new feature in Google+.  And all of a sudden, Sergey Brin, one of the founders of  Google, says, wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm going to let you talk in a minute.  But first, Beyonce.  No, no, it wasn't that.  It was, but first, let's show.  This is a time-critical demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that was great.  I mean, you ran on stage breathless, wearing the Google  Glasses, and just like, hey, I hate to interrupt you.  But just got something going on.  It's a little time-sensitive.  And up on the screen, you see kind of an air balloon, or  like a zeppelin kind of hanging.  And we're like, my first thought was, oh, it's a Google  Maps flyover.  They're doing something crazy.  It looks like that 3D thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But it was actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Skydiving wearing Google Glass, Project Glass.  It was amazing.  Now, some people were saying, well, that must have been  scripted, right?  I don't think so.  I think that the Hindenburg, or whatever it was called, the  zeppelin, that's probably not the right name.  The zeppelin was right over the Moscone Center, and it had  to be when it was there, right?  I don't know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can steer it a bit.  They're not blown by the wind.  It's not like a high balloon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, why do you think it was so critical, then, that  they do this at the exact time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, they do it at the exact time?  I mean, yeah, maybe they had to have gotten some sort of  airspace regulatory kind of permission for these guys to  drop onto the.  So they.  That's the other thing.  They were in a plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they get permission to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They had to.  So the four skydivers in a plane wearing Google Glasses  jump out of the plane and land on the roof of Moscone.  Which was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While doing a hangout, by the way, there's five divers.  And they're in a hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This was one of the most incredible live demos.  Gutsiest.  Gutsiest.  I mean, just ambitious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, Sergey said this might go all.  Here's the interrupt.  You can take it from my screen, if you can see my screen.  Can you see my screen?  Wait a minute.  Let me go back a little bit.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sergey.  I've got a really cool event for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Sergey Brin wanders out in the middle of Vic's speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Guys.  And he's not seen in public without the glasses now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty magical here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we have a special surprise for you.  We've got something pretty special for you.  It's a little bit time sensitive,  so I apologize for interrupting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The good news is that Vic is very poised,  and he can handle this kind of thing.  I don't know.  There's a lot of presenters who have been completely thrown  by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was actually really neat to see the difference  between the two of them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And one of the reasons I like Google's keynotes,  they're very real.  They know they're talking to developers.  They're real.  They're genuine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the developers, I think, appreciate that.  They don't want to be marketed to so much.  So they had these guys up in this zeppelin.  I'm told it's a zeppelin because it's a rigid frame, not a blimp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, we can see that on screen, but they actually  jumped out of a plane.  I think the zeppelin must have just been there.  No, no, no.  It was a zeppelin.  Oh, they.  Because I thought you could see the wing when they were coming  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they jumped out of the zeppelin.  OK.  It's the gondola underneath.  They were hovering.  OK.  See, the wing is probably that little fin there.  So they have a couple of guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  You're right.  You're right.  We just saw the shot up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the zeppelin.  And they had a hangout.  And they have squirrel suits.  They have those flight suits.  I know.  Those flights.  Those are so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, those are so cool.  They must have been able to steer that way a little bit.  He said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said, we can steer a little bit.  We've got to be over the top.  They did a perfect landing on the roof.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then they biked and rappelled and ran into the main hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got it on my screen here, if you want to chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is great for their landing.  I let you down here.  And I thought maybe you guys could show us  a fun time on the way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They missed the foot of it, because they  took a while to actually jump.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looks like a long way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Somebody in the chat room was saying,  the quality looked too good for it to be Google Glasses.  But they had someone with a camera on as well.  You could see that they were cutting back and forth.  They do cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When they cut, they cut to a much better quality picture.  The glasses do not have 3G.  They're Wi-Fi only right now.  And so this is clearly not Wi-Fi.  I would guess that the glasses were connected to a pack  that had 3 or 4G built into it.  Here he is.  They had to.  Coming down.  We speculated that it was maybe a live view, which we've used.  They have a very small unit.  It could have been.  There's other companies making something similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought I saw some wires kind of coming  off the back of the ear that went down to about our face.  It's a very good image, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is from the glasses.  And then when they go to the ground, they cut to...  Then they have, you can see, that's a camera guy.  And you can actually see the camera operators running around a little bit.  Here are the people landing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At this point, Esconi, the whole hall was just like...  Losing it.  Everyone was losing it.  But it was this like tense silence.  I mean, it was just...  The energy was ranked up.  Yeah, they didn't.  Well, it was clear, Sergey, it was clear that he was not sure that this was going to work.  And he was amped and kind of breathless and excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is why you should do stuff like this.  Take some chances.  Absolutely.  And then they hand off the glasses to some acrobatic bicyclists on the roof who actually  took my breath away because they ride to the edge of the roof to a ramp.  This was crazy, too.  And they jumped to the next building.  Wait a minute.  No, no, no, no, no, no!  And you could tell the audience is kind of going, whoa!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At this point, we were all just like, holy cow.  This is the best...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's never been...  And now they're handing off the glasses.  Now, it's funny because as it turned out, this was a non-working prototype.  Sergey pulled it out of the pouch and nothing happened.  It was like, music, this isn't...  That's not the point.  Nobody's paying any attention.  So now this guy's going to rappel down the side of Moscone Center.  How did they get permission to do this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How did they rehearse this?  I mean...  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it seems they rehearsed it at Google.  No, I don't know.  They might have rehearsed it at...  They showed a video at the end of them doing it.  Yeah, doing some rehearsals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could have done it at Moscone because it would have stopped traffic.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, look at that angle.  The guy running down the side of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sergey's telling the guy, oh no, we're not on the first floor.  He ran all the way to the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then he gets on a bike on the balcony and rides in on a bike and he runs people over  in the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They aren't going slowly into the hall either.  It's pretty clear that...  So this is not the glasses.  This is...  That's the glasses.  This is another stunt bike rider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  He now goes through...  A lot of hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Akin to the Olympic torch being handed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, yeah.  And look, and they're riding through right outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm amazed nobody got clipped, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, this was kind of like me running up 4th Street on the way to the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And into the hall where you guys are.  That must have been very exciting.  It was exciting.  It was just ridiculously silly.  That's showmanship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I have a press pass.  I'm sitting in the press section.  I'm trying to kind of keep my applause.  You know, I'm trying to be cool, right?  It was difficult though not to applaud for these people.  Pro tip.  Not the corporate tactics.  The human effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's okay to applaud this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you gotta applaud these people.  This is not a product.  I mean, they just... yeah.  These are amazing.  It was an athletic feat.  And then this like, you know, crowd of glass wearing athletes kind of like strutted in  all badass and everyone was taking pictures and there were lights.  It was crazy.  It was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long before they do the slow motion walk video of this?  Because watch as they come in the hall.  They look very studly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they do.  All of them look very studly wearing the glasses.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's like, oh, right.  That's pointing to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sergey handled this, I think, pretty well too.  He made it a little more exciting by being somewhat uncertain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he was uncertain.  He was excited.  He was...  I mean, he's...  He's like, I don't believe this is going to work.  He's a pilot, right?  He's really into flying.  So, not that I've ever met a pilot that was ever in support of skydiving.  Why would you ever jump out of a perfect plane?  We need the slow motion.  Yeah, but check this out.  This is...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the right stuff, isn't it?  Yeah, people are going nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was pretty jaw dropping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a really good demo.  It really was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man.  All right.  Absent that, we actually learned nothing.  No, no, we learned that you can take pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we knew you could take pictures.  We've been seeing pictures from people.  We've been seeing pictures for months.  You can take pictures.  It's like from your point of view.  From your point of view.  Did they mention that you can also take pictures?  Because you could just take pictures.  With your... from your...  Look, here's a baby.  And that picture is being taken by the mother.  So, okay.  So the question is, how do you take pictures?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you do?  Do you just...  Well, right, I know.  Do you press a button?  Are you shrugging?  Are you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said that it is just your wear.  So you can go like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You could blink.  I don't know.  They said it's paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's his own.  It's his own.  It's his own.  It's his own.  You could blink.  I don't know.  They said it's paying attention.  It's his watching your gaze.  There was a picture of a runner's knees.  It's scarcely hard, people.  See, a lot of the pictures from your point of view aren't actually that interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I have to say that the baby video...  That was cute.  You know, so the skydiving thing was great and exciting, but not all of us are going  to be skydiving, rappelling, and jumping across buildings every day.  But looking at your newborn who won't give a big bulky camera a smile...  Priceless.  Yeah.  I mean, that was pretty powerful.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the newborn looks back into your eyes because he's his mom.  Yeah, and smiles because he sees his mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty powerful stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I thought this might get the biggest roar from the crowd at the very end.  We're jumping ahead a little bit.  Vic comes back on stage and says, oh, and by the way, we're going to let those of you  here buy these.  Did you get excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was pretty excited.  I want to put those glasses on.  I was less excited when I heard $15 to $100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you heard the price, I was like, we're buying it.  And then $15 to $100, it was like...  Yeah.  And he said, it's not going to work very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Not going to work very well.  We only want people who really care enough about this or as you said in the car up here  or who are really rich to try them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even want to buy...  I'm thinking, can I expense that?  And then it's next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And then it ships next year.  So you order today.  You can only order at I.O. and then it ships early.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have a text from Jason Howell of All About Android in TNT.  He's there right now.  He says, should I get the glasses?  Should you take a vote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that what he meant to ask was, can I use the credit card?  He says, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says, you want me to sign up for Project Glass?  You could have mine if you want.  Yeah, with my money.  Should I say yes?  Everybody in the chat room says yes.  Do they keep your money or no, they probably don't bill you until later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My favorite tweet of the entire morning was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Order one pair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tom tweeted Eileen in all caps, order the glasses!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then they told us the price and as I remember Tom said, stop it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What it reminds me of is way back when I used to do video game development and they would  bring out a new console and you had to pay for the development machine.  Prototypes are expensive and one of things.  This is not an early manufacturing one.  This is like, we got a bunch of these that, you know, the ones they're wearing, they probably  were handmade.  This batch will be an early manufacturing run and it'll be flaky and they want to make  sure that, I think it's deliberately to deter, they've really set that price deliberately  to deter people from going, oh yeah, sure.  And it's like, oh, that's like a whole new laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Delta 9 is pointing out that I could probably sell it for $3,000.  Yeah, I mean that was right.  You could make a little money on the side there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to try to use that argument with my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When we're done, we'll sell it on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll make a profit honey, really.  It's cool.  I probably will actually.  It looks like a complete dork, but really, we'll make some money from it.  I know they're not attractive at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's going to say, okay, but you cannot wear these outside the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, you can't wear these with, right, anywhere where we're supposed to look nice.  Right, not outside the house.  We're missing the press conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People trying on Sergey's glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the only thing, I mean, we still don't know even, is it Android?  Is it tied to a phone?  Does it, how do you control it?  We don't know anything about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Besides the fact that it takes pictures from your point of view and video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It takes pictures and video.  That's all we got.  And it's a decent camera.  Although, you take the sensor out of any Android phone and it's not that big.  I mean, I could fit that sensor in all the supporting hardware and a small battery, I  guess, into something that would fit over my ears, right?  I believe there are things like this already.  If all you're talking about is cameras, isn't there a company that makes something that  is basically glasses that you wear that take pictures?  It doesn't do anything else.  Right.  So I don't think that that's particularly innovative.  We'll have to wait and see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, we'll get there.  Well, I think the assumption is that it's talking to a phone in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my assumption, but I don't think they've even said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think, well, yeah, I think they've shown that, but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it Android in here?  Or is it a peripheral for your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or is it an Android accessory?  The designer said they wear way less than sunglasses.  They said the battery isn't in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they said the battery's in them.  Huh.  They said it, I think I remember reading that the battery is in them.  It's very confusing.  If the battery's not in it, then you're having a wire leading from your glasses to your pocket?  Tell me that ain't so.  They had wires on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hang on.  I just put the picture up.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Sergey with a thing plugged into a wire going into the glasses, and Liz Ganz is  wearing glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the pickup so that you can see the output.  You know what?  Let's call Liz.  Liz, what's going on with that?  All right.  There's more to talk about.  There's lots more to talk about.  This was a long keynote.  We've now kind of shown you the really most exciting thing, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's two other devices we haven't talked about yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm waiting, and we're going to talk about that in just a second.  Also, Google Play has encryption now.  Okay, developer, explain to me why the developers would...  Does that mean there's effort for security?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not any piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they said it was signed for that one so that basically you could only decrypt it  on that device that bought it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The device ID is actually...  It's DRM.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was what they...  They went over it quickly.  They did go over it quickly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it was a way to embed the device ID into the APK, which is the application package,  to say you purchased this on this device.  It's only going to be installed on this device.  Personally, I don't care about this.  I turned this off when I uploaded my app.  I'm sure Game EA wants to know.  Yeah, right.  The incremental app updates I really like.  Huge.  That I was excited about.  So only the parts of the APK which have changed get downloaded, which is great for everybody.  Less bandwidth, less installation time.  It's just great for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm assuming they're using that smart compress they developed for Chrome that's really good  at compressing code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I hadn't thought about that, but yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a good technical about it, but basically they looked at code and said, oh, right, code  is really compressible if you understand code.  And you can compress it by...  If you understand what the address offsets are or all the pieces where the jumps are,  you can actually compress it really easily because then you can move it about.  If you don't understand that, all the address offsets don't work very well, so you have  to turn the absolute jumps to relative jumps, stuff like that.  So there's a bunch of kind of stuff that they built for that, which is deployed in the Chrome  update cycle, which is how they can do those updates so quickly.  So I think they've moved that brains into this as well, which would be really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really nice to see these things converge and to see different technologies  kind of benefit one another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Darren Murph writing for Engadget says, here's what we know about Google Glass.  They were able to talk to people at Google I.O.  Engineers are experimenting with connectivity options, existing prototypes, including those  worn in the skydiving stunt do not have 3G or 4G connectivity.  Although it is possible such a module could end up in production devices.  The general idea is latching on to nearby Wi-Fi hotspots or relying on a wireless tether  with your smartphone.  So there you go with a smartphone.  Controlling Glass will rely on a mixture of inputs.  It'll recognize voice commands while also taking cues from the right sidebar.  We've seen Sergey do that to swipe his temple to do things.  The touch sensitive pad on there, they'll understand gestures.  It's also probable Glass will be able to be controlled by a via one smartphone, but physical  inputs would be the preferred ones.  There's an accelerometer and a gyroscope so you could nod or shake your head.  The internal battery sits just behind the ear on the right side.  There's the battery.  Nice, nice.  Good looking.  Capacity and longevity not confirmed.  Glass will be able to record locally, but the idea is to have most everything streamed  live to the web.  Great.  Take them off before you go to the bathroom.  Video where wireless data is not available, storing video locally would be possible for  uploading later.  So that's kind of inside stuff that they confirm.  Now they mentioned when they were talking about Play Cloud messaging.  Now I was really interested in that.  Is that sending intents through the cloud?  Would that mean that I could control an app?  I mean they're close because Play will install.  I can go on the web, say install it, and my phone starts installing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It wasn't clear what they meant by that.  They said go to the session and they didn't explain it.  Assuming it's an iMessage competitor, that was my take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They did it really quickly.  It was C to DM.  C to DM, so cloud messaging.  They just said free for all developers, no quota limitations.  But I still wasn't clear on what exactly it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's an interesting thing that lets you send update notifications to the device, but I think they meant that.  I think they meant individual ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android Cloud to Device Messaging Framework, C to DM.  C to DM is a service that helps developers send data from servers to their applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, so like push messages from the server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a lightweight mechanism servers can use to tell mobile apps to contact the server directly to fetch updated applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, the app doesn't have to wake up and poll, so it should be good for battery life.  Instead of polling push.  Yeah, your server-side app can say...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  C to DM has been officially deprecated as of June 26, 2012.  It's now replaced by GCM.  Google Cloud Messaging for Android.  Right, so this supersedes that.  This is the thing that I was talking about.  It does the same thing.  This could be lightweight messaging telling the Android application there's new data to be fetched.  So, hey, I got something for you.  Or it could be a message containing up to 4 kilobytes of payload.  So you could use it for instant messaging.  Or tweeting.  Or tweeting.  4K is quite a bit, actually.  Quite a bit of text, not so much for images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A very short piece of audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It handles all aspects of queuing of messages and delivery to the target Android app.  That's cool.  I don't know if there's an analog in the Apple world, but I think there is.  I think when they introduce notifications, they introduce some lightweight push.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, any app that was going to update with new content could benefit from that.  And then magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was the deadest audience response in the whole thing.  And we've got magazines.  And he paused.  Everyone was like, huh.  Okay.  Magazines.  I vaguely remember those.  What are those?  You print something.  Yes.  Magazines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Movies for sale.  Movies for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not just rental.  TV as well on the Play Store.  This was all sort of built up to the Nexus 7.  So you're both going to get one later today.  I'm going up to the Brick House.  I need to get one.  I need to get one.  I need to get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I need to get one.  I need to get one.  I need to get one.  I need to get one.  I need to get one.  I want one.  I'm going up to the Brick House.  I need to bring it for the...  But you didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is a sea of very elderly backpack laden nerds down there.  And they said they were going to start at 4 p.m.  So that line at 4...  In fact, I'm probably going to wait until tomorrow.  Right.  Well, I don't know if I'll be able to wait until tomorrow.  I'm going to wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Tegra 3.  It's the first Tegra 3 device.  That is a very, very fast system on a chip.  They mentioned quad core CPU.  And what did they say?  16 GPU threads or something?  Some huge...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  The specs sounded very nice.  And when they demoed it, it looked fantastic.  Video games looked really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really amazing.  Real-time 3D stuff.  12 core GPU.  Gyroscope.  Accelerometer.  Nine hours amended, by the way, later to eight hours of video playback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it amended?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if you go to play.google.com right now, it's on the front page.  I ordered one.  It's for sale right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you did.  You pre-ordered.  You keep yours.  You keep mine that's yours.  You keep yours, yes, sir.  And I ordered one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is Google's Kindle Fire for the Play Store.  This is not an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But more responsive, I think, than the Fire.  I think Google looked at the Fire and said, that's crap.  We can do better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We want people buying stuff from our store.  So how often have YouTube rented movies from the Google Play Store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do it from Apple all the time.  Every day, almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From Apple?  From the Apple Store.  Right.  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've used the Amazon one.  I use Amazon quite a bit, actually.  I use the free ones on Amazon quite a lot because I've got Prime.  Why not use Play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you'd have to watch it on your phone.  We're going to get to the solution to that in a second.  $199, that is a shocking price.  That's aimed right at Amazon, available next month.  $250, $249 for 16 gigs.  Targets straight at Fire.  And obviously, unless you feel like the connection to Amazon is important for you, it's going  to be a Fire killer, I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would agree.  It has all the Google productivity apps built in as well.  The Fire is very much a media consumption device, an e-reader watching.  But with this, you get Google Calendar, you get Gmail, you get all the Google goodness  maps, you get all that.  Well, that's the with Google Fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Kindle Fire is not a with Google Android.  It's an open source Android, which means that they don't get all those pieces that you get  by signing a deal with Google.  So they were making a thing about that.  You get the full set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get the full set.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it will be ice cream sandwich.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  Jelly bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, four jelly beans.  Four one jelly beans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And presumably, the Kindle app will still run on it.  Has Amazon done a video playback app for Android, for Android Android, or only for Kindle Fire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think just the Kindle Fire.  I was wondering about that.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  I cannot watch Amazon movies on here.  I cannot watch Amazon movies on this.  I don't think you can.  I have to try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  Can you watch Amazon movies on your Android phone?  I don't think so.  Or on your iOS device, either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I suppose you can, but you've got to do it through the web and with Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Certainly, you can do it on the web with Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can do it on Google TV, and it's Flash.  And it crashes a lot.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  You get the awesnap.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot of awesnaps.  Yeah.  A lot of awesnaps on that.  to TiVo and then you have to wait for it to download.  So I'm willing to switch to Google Play Store if I can get it on my TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, get ready because for a mere $300, I don't know why $199 seems like such a good  deal for the Nexus 7 and $299 seems such a bad deal for this cube, but it does.  They're the cube, I should say.  Cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's anything but a cube.  Well, it seems like a bad deal because that's three Apple TVs.  Yes.  And the other thing that's two-thirds the price has a screen.  Yeah.  So it's like, what did you put in there?  And apparently, people are saying the cost is they put a really good audio amplifier  in there.  Now, that's an interesting point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's a 25-watt...  If I care about that, I've got one.  Right.  Even Sonos, which is probably the most direct competitor for this, sells a Kinect, it's  $350, it's a little more expensive, that lets you connect to the internet.  Sonos uses a proprietary network, not your Wi-Fi.  It uses a mesh network.  And it doesn't have an amplifier in the Sonos Kinect, but I have one of those and I like  it because I'm into the Sonos ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Apple sells two things here.  Apple sells the Apple TV, which is $99, does this, does the TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you can't hook it up to your own speakers.  You can be HDMI.  You have to use an HDMI cable and go into your TV or TV screen, which is all they said

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this did.  Which is how I do it.  But Apple also sells the little Wi-Fi extender thingy that has an audio socket on it that  they've sold for years.  Apple Airport Express.  Apple Airport Express that you can plug any headphone jack into and plug into speakers  or anything else.  And that's analog, yeah.  That's analog out.  And that's cheaper than...  That's still...  That's a hundred bucks or something, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the reasons it's so expensive, it's made in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes it is.  Made in the USA.  They made a point to kind of zoom in on that label kind of on the inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it was great.  That made me really happy.  And they're pushing the social aspect of this.  Okay, that drove me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who...  Okay, you come over to my house, I'm playing some music, you take over my playlist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That sucks!  No, but I come over to your house and say, Leo, did you see this kitten video?  Then you can add to it.  You gotta see this.  You gotta see this YouTube video.  That happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually what I don't want you to do.  Did you see this kitten video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you don't do that with your friends?  You don't go like, oh, and pass around the little screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do with Airplay, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, have you seen this thing?  Okay, use it.  And then you send it to Airplay.  Apple already has a solution.  They're saying this is a playlist.  You can see the playlist on the screen.  You can manipulate it.  So it's kind of a turntable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dave MacDee in our chat room says, great idea.  I have music listening parties with my friends all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and also movies.  Like, oh, hey, I bought this movie on the Google Play store.  It's awesome.  Let's watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I would guess that's not going to work because I would guess, but I don't know, that  the queue is logged into your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they said that it worked.  It does work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if you show up at your friend's house with your Android device and you say, hey,  let's watch this movie, it pulls it from the cloud.  On my account.  Yeah, it pulls it from the cloud.  It just says, yeah, it detects the account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the queue's not registered to the home user's account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the queue is registered to the home user's account, but when you log into it on the Wi-Fi,  it inherits the accounts of all the people who are there.  Yeah, like it recognizes the devices.  That's cool.  Yeah.  So that was the neat part.  And that's the piece.  So I could bring a movie over in a fit.  Right.  I could pay for the movie.  It's doing...  Okay, I'm going to...  Back in my day.  When we did...  Did you bring Cassette over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here, I brought a Vita.  Cassette.  Cassette.  No, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The analogy for me is the thing we did with iTunes when I was at Apple, which was you  can see all the machines in the room and everyone's connection and play that.  Right.  Right?  And that was very cool.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even if you weren't attached, you brought a laptop in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that actually did work over the net.  Right.  But Apple had to turn that off because the labels got grumpy.  So I was somewhat involved with that.  The version we shipped would play anything over any URL.  So you could actually subscribe to anyone's music anywhere, but it would find the local  ones easily.  And then that gradually got turned off as the labels go, you can play music from other  people's houses?  What the hell is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not going to allow that.  Now, you can buy multiple $300 cues and put them around the house and plug in your own  speakers.  So it could have a Sonos-like...  So if you...  If you live it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it is Sonos this is up against, clearly.  It's dead on arrival.  It's just bizarre compared to the Apple TV.  That's the piece that I didn't get.  I don't understand it in any respect.  Apple is selling something in every retail mall in America for a third the price.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does the same thing.  If they made this $99, it might have a chance.  At $300, I think it has zero chance.  Am I off base on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to play with it a little bit.  It doesn't have the screen sharing AirPlay thing.  They explicitly said it doesn't do that.  That is the other...  Apple TV is worth buying just for that.  Right.  Wait, what's the screen sharing AirPlay thing?  So, Apple TV, from your iPad or your iPod or your phone, you can go to the bottom and  say share my screen to that and it goes onto the TV.  Oh, and so then whatever you're doing can be...  Yeah, that's nice.  That's become the way we do presentations at work.  Everyone has an iPad and we just have one of those and you just push into that and stuff  gets shared around like that.  Right.  They just announced at the Apple thing last week or the week before that the next version  of Mac OS will be able to send to that as well.  Yeah, that's nice.  So, it doesn't do the sharing.  It doesn't do the screen sharing.  The nice thing it does is you're not having to push.  The problem with the Apple Airport Express one is that you have to have your Mac open  and iTunes running to send sound to it, whereas this one is going to just queue them up and  it'll pull them and play them.  So, that is actually a better decision.  I can see that making more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But wait, for $400 you could buy a pair of bookshelf speakers on the Google Play Store  that will then turn your Google queue into a stereo.  Right.  To me the differentiator is the amp, right?  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but amps are not magical things.  They're not expensive either.  If I am the kind of person who cares about amps, I've already got a separate preamp and  a separate power system and a whole bunch of expensive hi-fi kit from the expensive  hi-fi kit store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Logitech is just saying, thank God we didn't license this.  That's all I'm thinking when I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm assuming that at some point they'll go, okay, we'll license this and you'll get third  party ones that don't have an amp in them.  They just have an HDMI cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is there technology in here that you could like?  It's Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said it was Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little Android device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said it's running the same chip as the tablet.  Yeah.  Also, it's micro HDMI.  What kind of...  It's not a standard...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, the connectors in general are a little odd.  You have to have banana plugs for your speaker wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're banana plugs.  They're not cable clamps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  So, that means there's going to be a sudden run on banana plugs.  I happen to have banana plugs at home if anybody wants to borrow them.  It's micro HDMI, which is a type D HDMI.  It's not a standard.  Which is wide.  There's space for a full-size one there.  There's plenty of space.  It has ethernet.  I presume it has Wi-Fi.  Yes.  Then it has a TOS link.  It has optical out.  I don't think this is particularly competitive.  I think Sonos was here first.  I think Apple TV, if you're price sensitive.  I just don't see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not quite sure where it fits.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Especially with Google TV.  Right.  Which we will see presumably tomorrow, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, presumably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's another piece that's kind of a bit weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  At least they said that Google has designed completely from the ground up.  You know what?  It is pretty.  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got 39 LEDs that you can program to do anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do we say it looks like?  The training device?  The Jedi training device?  Yeah, who said that?  That was a good line.  Yeah, that was a good line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like the ball that Luke Skywalker used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or the Death Star, depending on how you want to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Use your mind, Luke.  There, it looks even better with the banana plugs in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have it.  That looks like an Ood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a little scary looking.  It looks like something's going to...  Do you remember the Ood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you watched Doctor Who?  Yeah.  I don't watch Doctor Who.  They squid-like things like this.  Have you ever watched Glee?  Because that's a great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope you're enjoying our Best of 2012 on This Week in Google, our show today brought  to you as so many of our shows this year have been by the Ford Motor Company.  I'm a big Ford fan.  I don't have to tell you that.  You've seen me driving around.  If you're in Petaluma, you know I'm a Ford fan.  I don't have to tell you that.  You've seen me driving around.  If you're in Petaluma, you know that Santa drives a red Ford Mustang with twit license  plates.  Let me tell you, I love my Mustang.  I'm going to be sad to see it go, but yes, I'm trading it in because frankly I want the  2013 Ford Fusion.  I'm going to get the energy, the plug-in hybrid fusion.  But the other thing I want is some of the hot new technologies Ford's putting in its  vehicles like the Bliss blind spot information system with cross traffic alert.  It lets me know if there's people in the lanes in my blind spot so I don't pull into them  with a little light, a little tone.  It also lets me know as I'm backing out of a parking spot if there's car oncoming traffic.  It's so cool.  These are little sensors in the rear of the car, probably radar or something like it.  There's active park assist which uses cameras.  That's amazing.  You press the button on the dashboard, say I want to park somewhere around here.  You look for a space.  The cameras spot a space that fits your car.  They'll notify you.  Then you go, okay, and you'll lean back and you let the car park itself.  24 seconds, perfect parallel parking every time.  If you've never experienced it, it's truly amazing.  Frankly, I think it gives me high hope for the future of autonomous vehicles.  It just works perfectly.  I want you to try it.  Go to a Ford dealer near you and say I want to test drive the Bliss system or the active  park assist.  Of course, if you're in the market for a new vehicle, the 2013 Ford Fusion and the 2013  Ford Taurus both have available Bliss and active park assist.  You can also go to the website, ford.com slash technology to learn more.  Thank you, Ford.  We really appreciate your support on This Week in Google.  Now, back we go to the best of 2012.  Fortunately, I think one of the benefits of This Week in Google is we've got such a smart  team.  We've got Jeff Jarvis, who's an expert in new media and journalism.  And we've got Gina Trapani, who's a programmer and an Android developer and understands,  you know, things like APIs and SDKs.  And certainly her program, Think Up, which is a program designed to analyze tweets, is  very much impacted by the Twitter API.  Gina was there to explain what the new Twitter API means to people like her.  Watch.  All right, let's talk.  Let's talk Twitter.  Has it been, was it this, is it, it feels like I've been talking about this API change for  a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It happened right after the last show when we had the discussion about App.net.  Right after that is when all this stuff broke.  Isn't that funny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dalton's timing is pretty darn good with App.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was Thursday last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Marco, I first became aware with Marco Arment's post.  He's the creator of Instapaper interpreting some of Twitter's API changes.  And this what I would say is arguably the gloomiest interpretation.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are those, including the guy at TapBots, which is the one of the top iOS Twitter clients  who said, oh, no, it's fine.  Don't worry about it.  But here's this.  This all comes from a post on the Twitter blog by Michael Sippy titled, Changes Are Coming  in version 1.1 of the Twitter API.  It gets weird after that.  For instance, you can't detach photos in a Twitter stream and put them on another window.  No other third party or social actions could be attached to a tweet.  In effect, tweets have to be published exactly as Twitter specifies, no matter where you're  publishing them.  Tweets that are grouped together into a timeline may not be rendered with non-Twitter content,  comments, updates from other networks, or presumably circles, arrows, or...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoa, but they said Spotify was fine.  I mean, not Spotify.  Storify was fine, but that's exactly what you can do in Storify is annotate.  Right.  How could they do it?  It's not your content, Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's really what the battle is, isn't it?  Whose tweets are these anyway?  Flipboard's Mike McHugh left Twitter's board apparently recently, and Marco assumes because  of these APIs, because I imagine it's going to affect Flipboard.  This is quoting from the post.  One of the key things we've learned over the past few years, this is from Twitter, Michael  Sippy, is that when developers begin to demand an increasingly high volume of API calls,  we can guide them towards area of value for users and their businesses.  To that end, and similar to some other companies, we will require you to work with us directly  if you believe your application will need more than 1 million individual user tokens.  And if 1 million sounds like a small number, you'll need our permission if your application  will require more than 100,000 individual user tokens if you're using our user streams  product, 100,000.  However, you could be grandfathered in.  That's why the tap-box guy is not upset.  He says, well, you get double what you've got now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this is specific to traditional Twitter clients, not other kinds of Twitter products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like Flipboard.  Oh, it's just clients?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, traditional Twitter clients.  The 100,000 user token permission kind of ceiling applies to clients that make large  amounts of calls to certain endpoints that map to traditional clients.  Does that make sense?  So only Twitter clients, like traditional Twitter clients, are going to get hit by this  100,000 user token ceiling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's significant because that means without Twitter's permission, you can't have  more than 100,000 users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, if you need a traditional Twitter client.  So something like Starify isn't a traditional Twitter client.  It's a curation site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the earlier things that Leo listed about how you can't intersperse other content, you  must display the tweet is the full tweet.  You may not put any other social action upon it.  That's not just for Twitter clients.  That's for any use of the API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's for the Huffington Post or Storify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Display requirements do apply to all apps.  But yeah, the user cap is targeted toward traditional Twitter clients.  I mean, Twitter's been telling us for 18 months that they are discouraging developers from  making new traditional clients.  They're saying this area is saturated and we want you to build on Twitter, but we want  you to make products that are not traditional Twitter clients because we've got those already.  That's basically what they've been saying for the past 18 months.  And these guidelines changes are just kind of like, and this is how we're going to provide  that guidance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Paul had added TapBot's response.  Don't panic.  There's been a lot of fear, uncertainty and doubt generated by Twitter's latest announcement.  I wanted everyone to know the world isn't ending.  Tweetbot for the Mac is still coming out.  They're in beta now.  Tweetbot for iOS isn't going anywhere.  He says the changes to the API won't affect Tweetbot.  All current API calls are made using Authentica.  That's the authentication requirement.  That's appropriate, by the way, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, this is the thing.  As I'm a developer, I build Twitter product.  I'm building.  Twitter API is part of its primary function along with lots of other APIs, Facebook and Bitly and Google+, et cetera.  And I read these changes.  There are about five major bullet points.  Three of them are great.  Awesome.  The endpoint rate limiting, awesome.  Verifying pre-installed clients, awesome.  OAuth across the board, awesome.  There's one that's like, meh, because it really depends on how they enforce it.  That's the display requirements.  And then there's one that's pretty yucky for traditional client developers, which is the user token ceiling.  But I got to tell you, as a developer, I was really frustrated with what I thought was wildly sensationalized and oversimplified headline,  which is that Twitter hates developers.  Twitter's turning its back on the people who made it what it is, and they've turned evil.  I just thought that was a mischaracterization of what's going on.  I definitely think that there are troubling parts to this announcement, but the majority of it is actually really great for developers.  And I felt like there was just a lot of misunderstanding there.  And I thought, you know, Marco has a section in his post about how there's a lot of subjectivity and uncertainty here,  because Twitter very, you know, specifically, you know, very purposefully made a lot of these guidelines broad and open to interpretation.  So we really have to see how they're going to interpret it.  Do we really think that Twitter is going to ban any app that has an email, this tweet link on it, you know, like just through, say, Android share menu?  I don't think they will.  If they do, that's awful.  And I think we have a right to go crazy.  But I think for the most part, these aren't, I don't know, I read these and I thought like, not that bad, you know, and I'm building a company on Twitter API.  So you could say that it's in my best interest to be on their good side.  But you would never do that. If you were pissed off, you would say so.  I absolutely would. That's absolutely true. I absolutely would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Gina is not mealy-mouthed. She's many things, but mealy-mouthed, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you know, we've had this conversation before and Jeff and I have disagreed.  Like, you know, I've been pretty, you know, I haven't been outraged about anything that Twitter's done.  I'm concerned. And there are bits of these guidelines that trouble me because they could be enforced in really bad and onerous ways.  But Twitter hasn't done that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You agree with your colleague who suggests that you should interpret these changes like you would say an app store, Apple's app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This was the irony of Marco's post. Like Marco's a guy who has built an entire business on the iOS platform.  You know, he's subject to Apple's whims.  How is this any different? Yeah.  Yeah, really, how is this different?  I mean, I think what's interesting about Twitter is that because they built such an incredibly easy API and developers took to it so well and how they're so good to developers,  through Bootstrap and the patent agreement and the MySQL open source, that they were really good to developers and now they're turning bad.  So I feel, you know, they're turning bad, quote unquote.  So I think there's a sense of betrayal.  You know, like they used to be good to us and now they're not.  You know, Apple was always sort of jerks, right?  So you don't get as outraged about them or, you know, Google+, which hasn't even provided an API yet or Facebook, you know, some of their terms of use in their API are insane.  So it's just interesting to me to watch the reaction.  And I think, you know, Twitter really has to prove.  I mean, Twitter's communications about this were not needed.  That's the key. That's the key.  I was going to ask you that, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So would you agree that the communications just leave a lot to be desired?  Yeah, they really did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you know, I know Sippy and I, you know, he's a really good writer.  And it surprised me that it came across so kind of kind of the tone was slightly doomsday from their point of view, like, oh, we're about to lower the hammer.  You're not going to like this.  I mean, it kind of came across that way.  And so, you know, I love that Anil, you know, my co-founder wrote, rewrote the announcement and kind of with a positive spin, I was like, oh, we could rewrite this announcement this way.  And I thought that was an interesting sort of intellectual exercise.  But yeah, I agree with communications was not could have been a lot better.  And I think that there are just parts of that announcement that were very developer specific.  I think there are a lot of people saying Twitter's turning their backs on developers who don't really understand what per endpoint rate limiting really is.  And why it really is superior to what they offer now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, when they say per endpoint, they don't mean perhaps they mean per user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They mean per API endpoint.  So the Twitter API provides a set of endpoints.  So an endpoint would be like a kind of question you'd ask an API.  So so an endpoint might be the home timeline.  The endpoint might be your direct messages or your profile.  These are all different like questions that you can ask the API.  So right now you get 350 calls per hour across all endpoints per user.  This change, you get 60 calls per endpoint per hour.  So if you use more than six endpoints, right, because 6, 9, 60 is 360 and 360 is greater than 350.  I know I'm doing this quickly.  You're basically what Twitter's doing is they're saying you get more API calls per hour across a lot of endpoints with this change,  which puts the squeeze on traditional client apps, traditional Twitter clients,  which are constantly querying the home timeline endpoint, right, primarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're using one endpoint over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're using one endpoint a lot over and over.  Exactly. Versus products that use lots of different endpoints that do something interesting with favorites or do something interesting with pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ThinkUp does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ThinkUp does do that. Yeah.  So I mean, I mean, I think it's good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bad for Tweetbot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. Right.  I mean, just off the top of my head, ThinkUp uses over nine endpoints, right?  So that already that ups our API call allocation from 315 hour to 540 an hour.  So that's like that's great news.  That's great news for us.  And Tweetbot doesn't seem too concerned about it.  Honestly, even if you're a traditional Twitter client and you're being conservative,  you're being smart and conservative about your API calls, 60 per hour per endpoint is totally reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because so Tweetbot could make one call and then feed all of its clients with that one call.  So they're saying every second or every minute you make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's per user per endpoint, right?  So like a user per endpoint.  So you authenticated, you have tokens and your timeline is different than is that, you know, if you hit the timeline endpoint,  the response is going to be the payload is going to be different than if I hit it, right?  Because my timeline looks different than yours.  So it's per user per endpoint, right?  60 per hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in the in a Neal's blog, he said, our biggest Twitter API upgrade ever.  More API calls for almost every kind of app.  Better security by extending OAuth to all APIs.  A clear roadmap for Twitter app developers to know what's encouraged.  A few new restrictions for people making traditional Twitter clients.  And when official 1.1 is released, you'll have six months to migrate.  Some have posited as like Dan Fromer and ReadWriteWeb.  This is this is Twitter saying we want to survive.  They have to do this.  Does that seem reasonable, Gina?  It's not a not a land, not a money grab.  They need to they need to monetize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  But that's that seems to be right.  I mean, it seems to be why they're doing this is where this is one area where I think their communications could have been different.  I mean, you want to assume that they have they want to restrict the display of tweets because they want to be able to insert advertising or insert links back to Twitter wherever they can.  Right.  Because they need the eyeballs and they have to keep they want to keep Twitter users using the that their tools for the primary use of Twitter, which is your timeline, your applies direct messages.  So, yeah, this seems like this is about their business model.  I don't think that I agree that this isn't a money grab.  I think this is Twitter figuring out that it needs it needs a business model and figuring out how it's going to do that.  And they're taking the long, the long view and saying we're going to start this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they did anything wrong, it's that they didn't think of this ahead of time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look, they've been giving us this guy.  For 18 months, they've been saying, hey, like we got we got the client area covered.  You know, make other things.  Stop doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And in fairness, Google said the founders of Google said we don't like advertising.  We don't want advertising.  Right.  You know, I said that when I started this network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boy, that was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I'll give them all that.  I think what probably disturbs people is two things.  One is the cultural attitude of it.  People do feel as if they really contributed to Twitter's success by creating conventions, by distributing Twitter, by helping make it popular.  And so the attitude was not let me be fully open here and explain what we need to do and why we need to do it.  And yes, we're grateful for what you did, but this is the reality of what we have to deal with.  People would deal with that, I think.  They should probably have said it that way.  Instead, it was a little bit dictatorial.  The second part of this, I think, and this is from my ignorant, non-developing view, I'm grappling with this in a lot of context, is what's the responsibility of a platform and what's the, thus the reliability and trust you can have in a platform to build your future on it.  I'm reminded of, and I think I've told this story before, when I took Daylife originally to Fred Wilson, he said to the founder, you pen a Chardonnade, can I build a profitable company on your platform?  And let me tell you before you answer that the right answer is yes.  Really?  And when I complained about some features that were not existent in Twitter, Fred responded publicly, well, that's what the clients are supposed to make, the outside developers are supposed to make.  So there's a compact there, there's a relationship there, a covenant that can change and perhaps has to change.  I'm not denying that at all.  But I just think it does come down to communication to say, okay, folks, we've tried a lot of things, here's where we are, and here's the reality of that.  And we want to bring you along, but you've got to play by these rules to come along.  And then I think it would be a little bit different.  And Neil has a real good point then, but it's not just about gloss over what exists.  It's also about being transparent about the rationale of what's going on, A, and B, about trying to maintain ongoing trust.  Because what Marco's post says at the end, I believe it was his post, said, I ain't building on Twitter.  Yeah.  Well, that's the issue at the end.  Yeah.  Is if there's no trust there, then are they really willing to go alone?  And the irony of this is then Twitter does become a media company, it becomes a very old fashioned media company.  Well, just as I'm telling media companies to make themselves embeddable and spread their stuff out on the web, Twitter's saying, no, no, no, you all have to come to our website.  We want our page views.  That's so 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, if developers interpret this announcement as a giant FU, which many have, obviously Marco did and said that he might not, you know, he might just rip all the Twitter related features out of Instapaper because he can't bear to develop against Twitter's ever changing rules anymore.  Which again, I thought his reaction was extreme.  You know, if he interpreted that way, the risk is that you're not going to have a Twitter developer come along and say, you know what I want to do?  I want to build a business making a really awesome Twitter client that does all the things that none of the official clients do.  Right.  I mean, that's that's how Tweety happened.  That's how TweetDeck happened, all which got acquired by Twitter.  Right.  That innovation is not going to happen now because a developer, no developer in a right mind is going to is going to build, going to try to build a product, a company and a product with a cap of one hundred thousand user tokens, at which point you have to kind of apply for permission from Twitter to continue.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Howard Linson and StockTwits and Twitter took over the convention.  I would I would include Bitly on this.  The funny thing is that various these people who still work with Twitter and somewhere or another, I sense are being so cautious.  But, you know, I'm cautious in becoming hypercritical Twitter here because I've made mistakes before when it comes to Twitter.  I didn't understand some of the good work they were doing internationally when they came up with rules.  And I thought, well, that's a bad rule.  But in fact, you know, the idea that they would censor something in one country, but leave it in other countries and make it transparent.  I didn't get by that.  What they were doing was exposing censorship.  You know, it was a good thing.  So but I'm also a little gun shy with Twitter now after the Olympics and what they did with Guy Adams account.  That was a cultural problem of not understanding their responsibility as a platform.  And when I argue that media companies now to become platforms, that's why I'm grappling with this.  What does it mean to be a platform?  Son, Jake says, you know, you build your business on someone else's platform, you get what you deserve when they pull out the rug.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I kind of agree.  It's funny.  I was saying I was saying on Twitter that we have to wait to see how Twitter actually enforces a lot of this stuff before we can truly criticize.  And and much from Pin Board and Jason Cocky, who does stellar.  They both said to me like, what do you mean?  You're not supposed to protest a law until someone gets arrested for it.  And I was like, but Twitter isn't a democracy.  We're not voting about whether or not this is OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Twitter is nothing.  The first rule I wrote a post about about about kind of trying to explore these notions of a platform.  Simply put, without users, a platform is nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's absolutely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it may not be a democracy, but it is a collaboration.  And if it's not collaborative two ways, then then it doesn't work as a platform because there's not two way trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Absolutely.  Absolutely. That's true.  Yeah. My point was like, if I'm going to be outraged if Twitter indeed bans an app for having an email, this tweet link in it, you know, that no social actions bit, which could be interpreted very broadly.  Like I'll just I'll feel more outraged and I'll feel like they're truly evil if they really don't want us to email tweets, you know, for example, or or share a link to instapaper from a tweet, which is what Marco brought up in his post.  And so but you know, but people were saying that we should protest these changes now before we actually start to see enforcement.  I mean, I'm going to learn a lot about enforcement because I'm building a Twitter product.  So I'll let you know if we get if we get pulled over for something.  But but I think you're a larger question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, Gene, is there a weird thing you're saying?  You're you're you're saying that you are not going to build it to the letter of the law because you're assuming they don't mean the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I know. I mean, I'm going to comply.  I'm going to comply with the display requirements.  I'm going to comply with the with the changes.  What Twitter is asking me to do, whatever terms I've accepted when I said I want to use this API, I'm going to comply with.  But like, for example, the Android example, I think is a good one.  Android, you have a sort of a built in share menu, right?  You can tap something and say, share this to email, share this to messaging.  That's a social action.  If you if you interpret that very broadly, you know, is Twitter really going to am I going to take that, for example, menu, might disable that menu on tweets?  Because if you interpret this guideline very, very strictly, you know, Twitter might ban the app.  No, of course not.  I'm going to leave it in there.  And if Twitter calls me out on it, then I'm going to pound my fist and say that they've gone evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm going to go back to your point about democracy.  I it's not a democracy.  You're absolutely right.  But Twitter has to acknowledge publicly that it depends upon you developers.  And I think that they did at the beginning.  I was at a conference where Biz Stone was asked, along with Chad Hurley and Reid Hoffman from by Wall Street guy.  Well, you know, what big company do you want to do a deal with?  They looked at them like they were confused German shepherds with their their heads cocks.  Why would we do that?  No, our users and our developers distribute us.  We rely on our ecosystem as a member of an ecosystem.  And let me just do this real fast.  But but when I wrote the post, I tried to come up with some rules for platforms.  Right. The first I think is that users come first.  If you don't believe in that, then you're creating a walled garden.  You're creating a service.  Hey, use it or lose it.  We don't care.  It's like a telephone company.  Second, a platform is defined by its users.  If it's truly a platform, you don't necessarily know how everyone will use it.  Only through its use do you learn what it is.  The platforms collaborate.  If you don't collaborate, it's a dead thing.  A platform changes.  And the platforms need principles that a platform I think should be transparent.  It should enable portability.  These are principles.  And that it has to be reliable.  If you can't rely on it, if you cannot trust it to be what you think it is going to be,  if you can't rely on it to at least be transparent about its changes,  then is it really a platform?  Now, is Twitter a platform then?  Or is it becoming AOL?  People always say, oh, Facebook is the next walled garden, the next AOL.  Is Twitter trying to become the next AOL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you be a platform for people but not a platform for developers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if this is because I think people are developers.  Even if you don't write code, right?  People who put in hashtag or at sign in Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  But they're not disenfranchised.  People would use it.  So in other words, people argue, I would say, I would submit that these API changes affect developers.  And so Twitter might be saying, we don't want to be a platform for developers.  We want to be a platform for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For users. For people. For Justin Bieber fans. Yeah.  And it's less about power users and developers and more about regular people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not unreasonable, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. In fact, a lot of these changes empower regular users.  So getting your apps certified, apps that come pre-installed, devices must be certified,  the display requirements, those things are going to reduce confusion and make a consistent experience,  which is what Sippy's last blog post headline was, creating a consistent user experience for regular people.  I think this is just the tech community reckoning with the fact that Twitter isn't for the elites anymore.  We've got app.net. Pay $100 and join app.net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have $50.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the mockery?  Yeah, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean, seriously, if the tech community wants, there's plenty of places the tech community can go.  Twitter is pretty much saying, we want to be for real people.  We want a business model.  And I don't think real people know or care about APIs, 50 bucks, stewardship platforms or anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think regular people are seeking out non-Twitter clients?  I mean, regular people are typing Twitter into the app store search box, right?  They're not typing in boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they don't even have to because it comes with the iPhone.  Oh, right.  So that's what Twitter wants, by the way, right?  Yes, they do now. But Twitter built itself on the back of those developers.  Yeah, that was a mistake. And that was my question is, should Twitter have thought of this earlier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could Twitter be what Twitter is without those developers? I would argue absolutely not.  No, I agree too.  Twitter without the at sign would be useless.  Twitter without the hashtag would not allow people to organize revolutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And all of that came from third parties, not from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely. Twitter is smart, but it's not smart enough to have built Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But putting myself in Twitter's shoes, I would say, well, that's true.  But now we need to survive. We need to monetize.  And we need to be a less confusing, more consistent platform for the real people who are using us.  That was then, this is now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And don't develop on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And don't develop on it. We'll take it from here.  Yeah.  Is it immoral or dishonorable to have built a company on developers' backs and five years later to say,  hey, you know, that's nice. Thanks. We've got enough clients.  They're not saying to tap bots, don't make a tweet bot anymore.  They're just saying no more new ones.  Although they'd like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're saying you can make it, but at 100,000 user tokens, you're going to have to talk to us if you want to go beyond that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not defending Twitter by any means, but I think I understand what they're saying.  Now, my question is, is it wrong? Is it bad? Should they not be doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hubristic. It's thinking that they can go it alone now.  And it's a bit weasely in that it rejects a community that made them what they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're saying we got this. Right.  So the reason why Twitter was built on the backs of developers, really, it was users making up new conventions like at replies and retweets and independent developers being faster than Twitter proper to make clients to support those things because Twitter proper was so small and unproven and was just dealing with stopping the fail whale every day.  Right.  But now Twitter's got the infrastructure and the team and the clients and they're basically saying we got this.  Any new traditional client features we can handle.  We're building cards. We're innovating kind of internally.  So we got this. You guys do the other stuff.  So it is a little bit of hubris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the analog.  OS 10 is built on an open source kernel, mock kernel and BSD.  So they built up.  Now they never made it.  Apple never made a promise to that community and they made a little bit of a promise.  We'll give back Darwin, blah, blah, blah.  But they're built on IMDB, CDDB.  Many there are many, many CDDB is actually the most most accurate analog, which was a database of CD information was created by users at which went basically private.  And they said, OK, we got it from here.  It's happens a lot, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it is it a moral? Is it unethical for us to grow and change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Especially especially if you accept the premise that they couldn't survive.  That's I think that's the crux of it.  Do they have to do this?  Is it greed or was it necessity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We don't know because they have they really haven't told us.  And Dan Fromer says it was necessity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the downside of so I guess the downside is we must put ads and tweets and if those ads don't appear.  Right.  Yeah.  I mean, I wrote another post this last week trying to rethink copyright.  Not that this is hardly the first one doing that.  There's millions of people trying to rethink it.  But but but it occurs to me that there's a notion of what I call credit, right?  The right to credit, right to move things on and that that creates new models.  And so I saw a company I might have mentioned last week called Repost.us.  I mentioned them that enables an article to become embeddable so that I wanted to build this because no one would build it.  But luckily along came a company that did it.  And it's really very cool that an article could travel and be embedded like a YouTube video with brand advertising, your own advertising, the creators advertising, the creators analytics and the creators links associated with it.  So rather than trying to get everybody to come to your site, which is the old media model, now you can go to where the readers are.  And what that has embedded in it is the business model that says, yeah, you need advertising and analytics to travel with your content.  If it's going to travel anyway, let's take advantage of that leap on top of it.  So, you know, I argue that, yes, the creator has some rights to create those rules by which this can happen.  So is Twitter right to say we think these buttons have to travel with the stuff that we've created?  OK.  The only thing to leave is, but there is not one shred of content was on Twitter was made by Twitter.  It was made by its users.  And so we asked you, is it a democracy or not?  No, it's not.  But should I act a little bit more like one with an acknowledgement that if we left tomorrow and this is why Google says don't be evil, not because they're virtuous, but because being evil is really bad business now.  Is this evil?  No, I think it weasel is as high as I'll go.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Evil would be saying to Justin Bieber, hey, we can't afford you because we have to do it five extra servers just for your content.  So could you rate limit your tweets or evil might be saying you can only have one point five million followers or will charge you from.  Well, I don't know if that's evil, actually.  That might make more sense.  Maybe that's what's next.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's what happened.  I would argue.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Crappy is saying you can only retrieve thirty two hundred of your your own tweets from the service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But has that slowed down growth of Twitter?  And that's been this case all along since almost the beginning.  Has that slowed down the growth of Twitter at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, if a platform doesn't adhere to certain principles, it does not necessarily slow down growth.  Right.  If you make a great product, which Twitter has, you get huge adoption, which they have.  You know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter.  Twitter is looking at the number of people they have on Twitter and they're saying we're doing everything right.  Now we just need to figure out a way to make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the question of how tweets are displayed, you know, it's interesting, Jeff, like you're saying this is our content.  So Twitter shouldn't dictate the way that tweets are displayed.  But if apps, I mean, who should decide how to use are displayed at makers?  I mean, exactly the right question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  All I'm saying is that, yes, Twitter does have a right to say this, but it's not an exclusive right.  It's not a right that goes beyond the interests of its users.  And so if there are apps that come down the pike that I as a user would like to exist, we users would like to exist, but they now can't because Twitter exclusively said, no, you can't do that for reasons that they have.  That's Weasley behavior to its users.  See rule number one, a platform is its users.  And the end of the day, a platform without users is not a platform.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.  It's a platform for users now.  Thank you.  App developers is not a platform for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The user for the but what is Twitter become?  Twitter became what Twitter became because developers.  Yeah, but it's done.  And it's the real question.  Is it done?  Is Twitter is Twitter baked now?  It's baked.  Yes, it's baked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see it's hash.  You see Twitter hashtags on every television show.  It's done.  Thank you.  We'll take it from here.  I admit, you know, it's I believe in you dance with the one that brung you.  But I can understand why they might say, hey, you know, we've got investors.  The ones that brung them are the people that put $150 million into Twitter's infrastructure.  That's what made Yahoo thought it was baked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google never interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll tell you the couple of apps that I'm really concerned about given these guidelines.  Time hop.  You guys have used time hop.  I think we've talked about it.  Time hop.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they email you a year ago tweets.  They're not going to be able to do it.  Yeah.  I mean, well, they just they even if they comply with the display requirements, they just add  a new feature where you can comment on and ask somebody like, so if I get your year ago  tweet, I can ask for an explanation.  I can be like, hey, hey, Leo, like, what did this mean?  But that's that's a comment on another service, you know, a third party service.  So I'm worried about that one.  And I'm worried about Stellar, Stellar that I owe, which which Jason cocky makes, which  is kind of like a list of all your friends, all your friends' favorite tweets.  It's awesome.  There's always great content there and it's favorites across several networks, Flickr,  YouTube, et cetera.  But Jason, Jason's a designer and he put a lot of thought and work into making tweets,  you know, to making the reading experience really nice and being really minimal about  what meta information it shows.  You know, he shows in every tweet and for him to comply with the display requirements,  it's going to add all the little the Twitter glitter, you know, the the the retweet button,  the reply button, the favorite button, the avatar and all that.  So so I'm concerned.  I want to be clear with everyone that I am concerned about these changes.  And I think it's going to affect some apps that are even not traditional Twitter clients  badly.  And I'm really hoping that Twitter is going to take that Facebook approach of like break  things and then kind of, you know, break things fast and then and then fix them later.  I'm hoping that Twitter is going to iterate on these changes and maybe clarify some of  the guidelines or requirements and maybe be a little a little more lenient than the worst  interpretation.  And that's just a hope.  And we're going to see this this these changes roll out in the next few weeks, the coming  weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I, Regina, I've made a mistake before.  Emphasize this again.  I've made a mistake before thinking that Twitter took a wrong turn when it took right turns.  And and I'm not saying that these are absolutely wrong terms.  I may not understand.  So so the problem here may be a problem of communication and transparency or it may be  a problem of culture and substance.  I don't know yet, but I but I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I do, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just sad because besides using ThinkUp to archive my tweets, I've been using a WordPress  plugin for years that automatically archives my tweets.  And I put up there's a blog post every week.  I don't think anybody ever reads it because there's never any comments on it.  But on my blog, there's a post every Sunday night of my Twitter updates for the week.  And it's as much for me to be able to look back at that week, you know, 10 years from  now, because Twitter is not going to let me do that.  So these are all archived.  I mean, I don't think Twitter is going to notice this plugin.  But if they do, this is clearly a violation of their right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that definitely those don't don't comply.  There's no reply.  There's no tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, this is a pure case of this being your content.  It's my content being archived from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  You should be able to display your tweets on your blog however you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In any way you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wrote it.  So I guess if there were a lot of people like me who really thought that was important,  that could hurt Twitter.  But I suspect that that's not that that's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just that goes into reading Twitter's TOS because are you granting Twitter a non-exclusive  license of that content, in which case you're just exercising your own use of that of your  content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and this is what I've always said is that for years, and it's why I keep quitting  Twitter.  I am the number one Twitter quitter, as I have been for years.  In fact, we were going over on App.net all of the places that I have left Twitter for,  starting with Jaiku.  Remember that?  And Pounce and Plurk and Buzz.  And I can go on and on.  I keep because I want somewhere that will treat my end status net or identical.  I want somewhere that will tweet my content as my content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Someone who's simple panda says don't forget spoloink.  Is that actually?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think there's a sploink.  There could be.  I don't know.  I like Jaiku.  You know, I really, really Google bottom put them out of their misery.  I guess you can open source the code though.  The code's open source.  You could make your own Jaiku server because it had threaded.  It was everything Twitter wasn't.  But it didn't make it.  And that's really the bottom line.  Now, was it the developers that made, I guess it was.  It was developer ecosystem that made Twitter Twitter.  Why didn't Pounce succeed?  Pounce was great.  Why didn't Jaiku succeed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was it because they came after Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe the network effect, right?  It's all critical mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when you hit critical mass, then the rules change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter, something changed on Twitter when Ashton Kutcher and Lady Gaga and Justin Bieber,  when the celebrities discovered it, that was when they turned the corner, right?  Britney Spears.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, that was a big part of it, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that to me was the first reason to get the hell out of there.  As soon as Ashton Kutcher was there, it's like, I don't want to be here.  Unfortunately, that's where everybody is.  I don't know.  It's fascinating.  And I like app.net.  I don't think app.net is going to make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I really like where Jeff is getting, what Jeff is poking at right now, which is like,  what makes a platform a platform?  What should the principles of a platform be?  What things out there really are platforms or what are just kind of media companies?  I know you don't know, but that's what I like about this is that you're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what this show is kind of about, really, right?  Right.  Right.  And the cloud is really possible because platforms is a platform, networks.  The way I draw the world now on the whiteboard is that you had vertically integrated industries  that are now replaced by three levels.  Platforms, entrepreneurial efforts that can start now because those platforms exist,  and then networks that are necessary oftentimes to bring those entrepreneurial efforts to critical mass  for things like purchasing or audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the network really is just a special case of platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That's true.  The value today falls to the platforms because that's who adds it together.  So Google and Twitter and so on.  I think it starts to shift over time.  So I've been arguing that newspapers should think of themselves as platforms for their communities.  Universities should think of themselves as platforms for students' futures and education.  Governments should be platforms.  Tim O'Reilly, if he shows up, will probably talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what he... what Government 2.0 is all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So in that case, it means...  And people like Yochai Benkler who do brilliant work about networks and what networks are.  But I think the network kind of exists in an ecosystem on its own.  They form like atoms into molecules.  A platform is an explicit act to create something that people use and thus depend upon to build something.  Benefits come from that.  Huge benefits flow.  If you become a platform that makes critical mass, you get huge benefit once you figure out your business model.  But responsibilities also flow.  So that's what I'm trying to get at, Gina, is I'm trying to understand  what we should expect those responsibilities to be and can we ever depend upon them or, you know,  Siva, but nothing and I will argue about whether Google has to be evil because it's a company.  I don't think all companies have to be evil.  I think today, you know, it's bad business to be evil.  But maybe platform... maybe we can't depend on platforms.  Maybe it's fools, Aaron, to ever depend on platforms because they must be what they must be, which is companies, and they will change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless they're open source, which is why I like open source.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is... okay, so if you can build...  So then the other question that came about Twitter, could you really...  And I forget who wrote about this, so I apologize for not citing, but someone, not me, wrote that, okay, smartasses,  you think you want a Twitter to be federated, but what if the tweets ended up coming, you know, 10 minutes or 10 days later?  You know, you have a high...  Worthless.  You have a low tolerance for...  Worthless, yeah.  Yeah, and so you witness the fail well.  So you want a company to run this.  Once a company runs it, folks, then the rules change again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think some of this comes down to your definition of platform, and this is what I was trying to get at was the traditional definition of platform is an operating system as a platform.  Microsoft created...  In fact, you could really say that Microsoft created the platform that powered the personal computer industry for many, many years because it provided a reliable, stable API and service platform for developers to use.  It was those apps on top of Microsoft Windows that made it all work.  That's, to my mind, that's one kind of platform, but I think we're seeing the emergence of a second kind of platform.  That's kind of the point I was making, which is Twitter was originally like Windows, that kind of a platform, a developer platform, but they quickly realized that really what they are is a platform for users, a content platform, and that's...  I don't think the rules are the same for a newspaper as platform as they are for an operating system as platform.  I think the rules are different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I go back to that notion of...  Gina brought it up, the RT, that the fact that it was users were not developers, but they acted like developers.  They created a function through a...  They added the API.  They added a convention.  Yeah.  Gina, what do you think a platform is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, a platform enables users, enables people to get things done, right?  So, you know, it's interesting.  I mean, I think that question that you and Siva talked about is whether or not if a company is in charge of a platform, do the rules change?  I mean, is Twitter's goal to be a platform?  Is Twitter's goal to stick around and provide a great service?  You know, I mean, I think about the iOS App Store, right, is a platform.  That's a platform for developers to sell their apps, and it's all...  And it's Apple's rules.  It's not an open deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is the point, Marco, Mates.  For a platform to be successful for developers, it has to be consistent.  Yes.  And that's what Twitter's not been.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You need...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Microsoft succeeds as a platform, particularly Microsoft, because it never changed the API.  It never changed the rules.  It was really consistent.  And you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It controlled the rules, but you didn't have to get approval.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you didn't have to get approval to come out with a product.  And I don't know if approval is a disadvantage or not.  As long as the environment is known and stable, as it is with the app platform on iOS, I don't think it's a matter of...  Control is really the issue.  It's that we want to be...  It has to be consistent.  That's what Marco was saying.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That he felt like, if these changes are being launched now, what happens next year or the year after?  Do we really think that the App Store has been totally consistent?  I mean, haven't there been enough sort of App Store snafus this whole time?  And also, it's just Apple's nature to be very controlling.  They're the whole widget company, right?  Right.  I mean, Apple's never going to build something on top of an open platform.  They want to control the whole experience top to bottom, and they've been very successful doing that.  And when they launched the iOS platform, they were also a multi-billion dollar company.  Twitter was a tiny little startup and would have done anything to get anybody to use it, including developers in the beginning.  And that's why they made an API that was totally insecure.  I mean, remember when you could pass your username and password along the URLs?  Yes.  Access the API.  I mean, they made it just so easy for anybody.  And that's why some developers loved it.  I mean, I think tons of web developers really cut their teeth on API development on the Twitter API because it was so easy.  And so they went from very, very liberal to more restrictive, and people don't respond well to that, right?  But if you're Apple and you start very restrictive and you set the tone, this is what it is, then you feel more secure.  Marco obviously feels that Apple's been very consistent this whole time.  I don't know.  I mean, things change.  I feel like things have changed in the App Store as well.  I mean, there's uncertainty about everything.  Whenever you're building something on someone else's business that relies on someone else's business, there's risk.  I mean, there's risk when you cross the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's, again, this is why consistency is so important.  You have to make, you know, it's so, I don't think it's a problem.  Jeff, you seem to think it was a problem if a platform is owned by a company.  No, I don't.  I actually don't think it's a problem.  I agree with Siva that it has to be because it has to be a dictate.  A platform is ultimately a dictatorship because otherwise it's inconsistent.  And so it has to be absolutely consistent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's a collaborative.  Well, it's a mix, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to be, you have to provide, a platform means stable.  I can build on this.  If it's a moving, shifting sand, it's not stable.  It's not a platform.  A platform doesn't move.  That means it's a dictatorship.  Now you can do all sorts of loopy things on top of it.  But that platform.  Linux is a dictatorship.  Well, that's the, yeah, I mean, that's why I think Microsoft is probably better at making  platforms than Linux was.  And Apple too.  But even Linux is somewhat of a dictatorship.  And Melinus was smart enough to say it's not Linux unless I say it's Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, open source.  The key part of successful open source projects is a benevolent dictator, but dictator indeed.  And, you know, Apple introduced the Mac App Store.  I mean, I have to buy my apps through the Mac App Store a certain way.  And now they're building into OS X ways to say, oh, this app hasn't been verified.  I haven't installed the latest update yet, but, you know, it's differentiating between official  Apple apps and then Apple app, you know, apps that you just download off the web.  I mean, they've gotten more restrictive over time as well.  I mean, I think there's just a lot of uncertainty around Twitter in general because people still  don't understand how they're going to make money and what they really are.  And they don't make, they're sort of indicating that they're not really sure what they are.  And their communications, as we said, haven't been clear.  Which is OK.  Which is OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, again, Google shifted.  I don't have any objection to that at all.  People have joked about, and I've joked about, to Fred Wilson's face about, you know, oh,  Twitter now has a business model ten times.  I think everybody would understand that.  Everyone would say, listen, this is the reality.  This is the path we're taking.  You may not like it.  You may think advertising is corrupt, you know, whatever, but it's the way we're going to go.  And I'm cool with that.  I just think there's a cultural issue there of communication.  And it's all the worse when you hit that point of critical mass when you think you don't  need your developers anymore.  That's what's weasely about it.  And if you say, no, we still do, or we still do in some extent, but in some cases we don't  because we can't afford to.  And here's why.  Here's the reality we have.  I'd respect it a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a great conversation.  We're going to move on.  But that was fun.  I think this is kind of really key.  It's not about Twitter at all.  This is what this show was really about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When Gina said, the rule day one is, it's not a...  Gina, as I understood, said to you, I'll be on it if it's not really a show about...  It's never been a show about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a show about the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what it really is about is platforms and networks and all that.  The cloud is just one substantiation of...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that the conversation about what a platform is, what the rights and responsibilities  are of a platform maker is fundamental to everything we love in technology.  I don't care if it's an operating system or a semiconductor or any of that stuff.  Instagram.  We haven't talked about that since we convened last week.  Are we in a bubble?  $1 billion.  Jeff Jarvis, why would Facebook pay $1 billion for an iPhone app, basically?  They've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got the money.  The arguments are many.  The arguments are many.  That they needed mobile.  They needed better photo.  That they needed the audience.  That they were scared of it because they see themselves...  Facebook sees itself, I think, perhaps too much as a photo service, but so much of their  usage is photo and Instagram is better.  As someone said in one of the clips today, $1 billion for crappy filters.  Yeah.  I'm not an Instagram fanatic at all.  I hardly use it ever.  See, I love Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they used it a lot.  When it first came out, I was a big early supporter of Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what they purchased for $1 billion.  They purchased...  30 million me's.  Yes, exactly.  And I just wrote a column about this, which is going to go live any second now.  There are basically three things that Facebook got out of this that they didn't already have.  Don't tell me about users because most Instagram users also use Facebook and it's only 30,  35 million people versus 800, 900 million.  So they didn't buy users.  They didn't really buy technology.  There's no technology in Instagram that's worth the damn...  You can steal it all.  It's pretty good design, but it's a free app.  It's a free app with cheesy filters that's really easy to use and clean.  But people love it.  They love, love Instagram.  And people don't love Facebook.  People love to use Facebook because the people that they love are on Facebook.  But you'll never hear the phrase Facebook fanboy.  Nobody's a fan of Facebook.  No, that's true.  And big companies can't engineer affection unless you're Apple.  And so I think this is the beginning of a trend where companies will be purchased and  highly valued because they've been able to engender super high user affinity.  And that's what Instagram is.  They're buying the love of...  They're not only buying the love of 30, 35 million people, but they're buying the ability  to be lovable.  And I think a lot of the Instagram pixie dust is going to end up in their hands.  It's going to end up in their mobile apps.  And the hope is that it will make people love Facebook more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they're buying a soul.  This is from Paul's New Yorker piece.  He said that basically Facebook is buying soul.  The soul of a startup, a thing that people just love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you really buy that though?  Don't you kill it when you buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question, Leo.  I tend to think no.  I mean, I saw a lot of people write a lot of pieces about how to export all your photos  from Instagram and close your account once they heard about the Facebook acquisition.  But you know what, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what got me pissed off.  There's this Digisnob movement that as soon as Facebook touches it, well, I'm going to kill it.  845 million people against you.  I mean, how out of touch are you with what's going on?  How uncurious are you about what the world is using?  Kill it, kill it. I don't care.  But to make this announcement that I'm going to unsubscribe to you or I'm going to kill this account,  I'm going to do that, I don't care.  The business is still growing.  It doesn't frankly need you.  If there's too many of you, that's true.  But this idea that Facebook has cooties, I think it's kind of ridiculous.  Facebook may well ruin it.  Everything that AOL bought, everything that Yahoo bought got ruined.  But Zuckerberg does do things differently.  And he said in his message, it was very important, that he plans to keep this running independently.  He still wants it to be part of an ability of the ecosystem to send to other services.  I don't think this is the creation of a unified social network.  I think it's the creation of the first social conglomerate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, note that he said that he would keep it running separately,  but he didn't say that we're not going to make Facebook more like this also.  That's okay.  But back to the point, I think that you can actually purchase love like this.  Because the reason people love Instagram is because of how it makes them feel.  Instagram, people love their lives.  They love their cat, their friends, they see a sunset, they're inspired by it, they want to share it.  It's a human impulse to want to share the things that you're inspired by.  And Instagram lets you go snap, make it a little arty.  So I feel like I'm being expressive and creative, even though I'm not.  And then click a button and everybody sees it.  It feels really good to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But okay, but I think that love is hard to earn and easy to lose.  And I don't say that because of the cootie aspect.  Facebook touched it.  But look at Flickr. I think people love Flickr.  Yahoo bought it. I still use Flickr. I use Flickr a lot.  But Yahoo abandoned it.  So my love for Yahoo was diminished.  Not that I ever had any.  Any possible respect I had for Yahoo, put it that way, was diminished by their abandonment of Flickr.  And delicious, worse.  So you can't buy it. You can at most borrow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. The other thing I think that I haven't heard very many people mention is that one reason to purchase Instagram is to prevent them from supporting Google+.  Because right now it supports everything but Google+, like a lot of things.  So buy them before there's a right API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Because you know, I mean, when you take a picture here, we'll do this real quickly.  We'll take a picture of Gina because I think that's the best thing to take a picture of.  And then I will make it Artie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I read somebody say that these filters make everything look like it was taken in the 70s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And now I can share Twitter, Facebook, email, Flickr, Foursquare, Tumblr, Postras.  Everything but.  Where's the Google? Where's the Google? Yeah.  And yet, a couple of things come to mind.  First of all, I don't think that the naysayers are really important.  I mean, after all, when Android, when there was an Android version of Instagram, it was probably the same people who said,  Ew, you got Android in my iPhone.  So those people are probably just, you know, they're not going to make a big difference.  But I wonder, can you inject, you know, in some, now when they're making biogenetically enhanced products, they inject DNA.  Can you inject DNA from Instagram into Facebook?  Or I think Facebook's a juggernaut.  I think there's only 30 people work at this or 20 people that work at this company.  How is that going to change the monster that is Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, to your point, how did how did the acquisition of FriendFeed change Facebook?  I mean, does anybody remember FriendFeed?  It was like the remember it was the flavor of the month and then Facebook bought it and just kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Brett Taylor, who came from FriendFeed, became Facebook's CTO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, wasn't FriendFeed bought? I thought FriendFeed was bought because FriendFeed was the walking dead at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they were bought for the people. And this is in fact up till now, everything Facebook's done is an aqua, aqua hire.  That doesn't work in audio. It only works when you write it.  A-Q-H-I-R-E, where they would get, I'm thinking Sam Lesson of Dropio, which was a great product, and they killed it because all they really wanted was Sam.  FriendFeed was a dying product, but they really just wanted Paul and Mike.  Obviously, they mostly wanted Brett. This is going to be different, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is more like Maps, isn't it? This is more like Google buying the folks who made and making it a big part of Facebook.  Because you look what they did with Sam. So I think Sam's a good example, right?  So by hiring Sam, by buying his company, he became key to the timeline.  He did Timeline.  And the best thing that can happen here is that yes, Instagram can exist on its own, but I think you're right, Mike.  The point is that Facebook becomes more like Instagram rather than Instagram becomes like Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If those 20 people, and it's really not 20, it's really probably Kevin Systrom and nobody else, if he can go in, I guess Sam did, Brett did, I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sam did. They're open to that kind of culture. And they hired those other guys who were involved in Timeline.  They went and hired the brightest they could. I think that's part of what Zuckerberg tries to do.  He walks them through the woods to convince them to come there because it's part of the cult of Zuck.  And I think that that means something. That's part of what they pride themselves on Facebook is that they're not the behemoth that Google has become.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cult or not, if anybody offered me a billion dollars for anything, including my firstborn, I'd really consider it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Check cleared three days before this announcement. Who got a piece of that billion dollars, who doubled their money in three days.  That's what's really absurd. Who's the lottery man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just kind of know where you're investing. That's all. Systrom, the founder, got 400 million.  The investors, of course, made off, made out like bandits. And in fact, they had a hundred million dollar pool.  It's divided among the remaining employees. So each of them is going to be a millionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the thing about the acquisition announcement that made me kind of crazy.  Or this is the thing that fascinated me or maybe galled me a little bit.  It's like a 20-year-old guy gets a one billion dollar exit.  It has such a huge impact on the technology community, the tech media, and then I think the startup community, because suddenly the whole conversation becomes about who had the most spectacular exit.  There's all this weird jealousy and there's kind of the Facebook backlash.  And then I just think you have a lot of young people who are trying to make good products on the web, which is what we're all supposed to be trying to do, not trying to have the most spectacular billion dollar exit possible.  Kind of get distracted. It is distracting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, I think you're way right. I think you're way right. And I think that this creates a 1% of the technology world.  Yes, it does.  Right. And that's part of the problem where we are now.  And it skews the ethical view. If it skewed banking, it's going to skew geeks too.  And it's worrisome that that's where we are.  Now, I don't begrudge them getting the money they can get. God bless them.  But you're right. What does it do to the rest of the world around them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, there's this very small contingent of young men, young white men who have a lot of money because they won this lottery.  And like you said, good for them. It makes me sad that the conversation about web product development becomes about the exit and not about making something really good.  This has been going on since 1994 and Netscape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I mean, this is frankly always the undercurrent in Silicon Valley is, are you going to make the big score?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like this trend because essentially years ago, if you're a young entrepreneur, you wanted to go for that big payoff either by becoming a company with a lot of revenue or by selling to a larger company.  That's always been the case. But in the past, you had to always demonstrate.  Well, not in the past. Since the crash of 2000, you had to demonstrate that you had a business plan.  This is the revenue model. This is how we can make money. And these guys never got around to that part of it.  They just created a free app that everybody loved.  And I would love to see everybody focused on creating things that everybody loves and stop trying to figure out how we can make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think sustainability matters. I see that disease in journalism and news and media where people say, I just want to do what's cool and neat.  And they don't put any thought in sustainability.  And so then what happens is where the true bubble comes in.  Then they say, well, OK, I'll get bought.  They don't give any thought to it, which is really just a bad way to create a feature.  Isn't that what it is?  Yeah, it is. But here's the issue.  What we should be critical of is not the makers of, I think, Instagram.  We should be critical of Facebook, that they have a structure that meant that rather than developing something cool and nice in-house, they had to go buy for a billion dollars.  The other thing is, I really want to go back to what Gene said, because I think it's important that we have to look at the future financial structure of our world.  And I've argued, and I argued this in a post about the jobs bill, not jobs, but J-O-B-S, the investment, which I'll talk about in a second, that we're moving from a world of vertical industries,  fully owned, where you control product creation, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution, to a world of ecosystems.  In the ecosystem, as I say, there are three layers.  There's a platform layer. There's an entrepreneurial layer now made possible by the platform layer existing.  And there's a network layer that is often necessary to get those small entrepreneurial ventures to critical mass.  What's happening in our world today is all the value is falling to the platform.  That's why Google is worth so much, and Facebook, and so on, and Zynga.  The entrepreneurial layer is possible to do because those platforms exist, but you're small.  You're never really small until maybe you get in a network like Glam.  What I like about the jobs bill, apart from taking away regulation that we probably still do need on companies, because companies and Wall Street are all screwed up,  but the idea of being able to get funding to new ventures on their own now, easier than going through venture capital from crowdfunding,  and the idea of being able to exit without having to sell out for a billion dollars or go IPO,  and you can get earlier exits and get some value out of this, I hope, drives some value back up to the entrepreneurial layer,  which is the one that Zynga really loves, and I love, and that we want to encourage.  If the only way we encourage that is the absolute long shot blockbuster economy, it becomes like Hollywood.  A few people will make the movie to succeed, and the rest will starve.  We don't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Instagram did it.  I'm sorry to interrupt you, Jeff.  Instagram did everything right, and it's great that they're being rewarded.  They have a very lean operation.  I understand that.  But neither is Gina, I think, Gina, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not criticizing them.  You're criticizing the structure that this is leading to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the billion dollar, the unusual billion dollar purchase price, the radically unexpected,  is a reward for having done everything right.  If this had never happened, Instagram would have still been very, very successful.  There's ten ways they could have been very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't think that's the only gauge.  You can also be Mark Cuban, who basically did nothing and got a huge amount of money from a very stupid company  that in turn then turned around what they bought for five billion dollars.  And the fact that you got a lot of money is not necessarily the reward or quality.  What Gina, I think, is going to, and I want to hear back from Gina, is that I think that there's an ethic that you want to see rewarded, right, Gina?  Yes.  And it's got to be more than just, oh, I made something nice.  It's got to be that I can have a sustainable business out of this.  I can raise funds to do it.  I can take some money off the table to buy my house.  I can make something good and be good and have a business.  And we want lots of that happening rather than a few blockbusters.  Gina, I'm sorry.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, my last trip to New York, I visited a startup.  I won't say which one, but it's been in business for almost ten years.  It's profitable, doing great.  And the founder said to me, well, you know, I feel just so old and slow.  Like when you look at things like Zynga and I bet now, you know, or OMG Pop and I bet now he'd say Instagram.  And it was like, wait a second.  Ten years in business, you know, with a profitable Internet business, media company on the Internet, that's something to be proud of.  That's something to celebrate.  I only hope that, you know, ten years my company will still be around and I'll still be passionate about it.  I'll still be doing meaningful, interesting things on the Web.  And I will have made something that people love.  You know, I listen.  Instagram is an awesome app.  I loved it.  They made an incredible product experience.  Those guys did a great job and good for them and their billion dollars.  It just it makes me sad that it kind of sets up this goal or this standard, you know, that people are like, well, if I don't, you know, if I'm not, I don't build this blockbuster product in two years by the time I'm 26 and sell out for a billion dollars, then I failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they should.  Good.  Listen to Gina entrepreneurs.  You haven't failed.  Yeah.  You know, you haven't failed.  You built something good.  Most people like 99.9% will never have a big payday like Kevin Sister Mad.  This is really an outlier.  That's the goal.  You know, that's the problem.  It can be the goal.  And you know why it's good?  Because what it does is it gets everybody on Page Mill Road to start putting money into lots of little startups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, but that but yeah, but that's that's part of the issue is that they expect that kind of their definition of failure is not the definition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They know they know that there it's a long shot, but it means there's more money to invest because there's more money to be made.  Most of most entrepreneurs are like me where I'm just going to be happy if I could survive a year or two and make a profitable business.  That's the way most people think.  I don't think it's going to change how people feel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to go wonky for a second.  I read a read a great book I just blogged about called The Institutional Revolution.  That's pretty wonky.  No Gutenberg in it.  But it tries from an economics perspective to explain why there were these ridiculous institutions in pre modern England of the aristocracy and bought army commissions and dueling and private roads.  Right.  And really interesting analysis said before you could measure performance, you had to get trust in other means.  You got means and things like he calls a hostage capital.  You you sent your daughter to the court.  And if you screw up, you couldn't see her again.  You you bought a huge you made a huge estate because you invested in that point is then other means came along to measure people could find lot latitude and longitude.  We had clocks that work.  We had measurements.  You could measure success in new ways.  And so the institutions changed.  What Jean is talking about here really I think is that we are creating the new institutions of society.  The technology industry is creating new institutions and how they operate and under one under what ethics and mores and with what goals.  We have to stand back and say if a billion dollars becomes the goal, get God bless Facebook and God bless Instagram.  Not complaining about them.  What are we building?  What's the society?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We want it.  We want it to build a society where all of the above is celebrated and possible and common.  And in fact, that's exactly what we have.  Lots and lots of small entrepreneurs in technology are building companies and making going concerns of it and doing very well.  And it's it's fantastic.  The thing that excites me about these big splashy billion dollar payoffs is it's something that inspires high school students to want to become entrepreneurs because starting a little company and making a nice profit off in the corner doing something is is awesome.  And there's something that everybody should try to do.  That's like saying that's like saying it doesn't matter if there's how many how many it's the lottery people buy lottery tickets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who bought mega millions tickets?  Everybody even even my smart employees.  That is a terrible, terrible society.  But but but look, I think both entrepreneurs and investors know that this is an outlier.  It's the outlier that makes people feel good and say, gee, we could buy it, you know, like win the lottery ticket.  And I don't think I don't see any real harm done here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's you're making the basketball in the ghetto argument, which is that very few can make the pro teams.  But if many hope to that, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, well, in fact, the reality is that a lot of young people think the only way to make it in the world that they either have to become a superstar singer rap rap singer or Beyonce or something like that, or they have to become a major sports person or they have to be famous or nothing.  It doesn't take no, but we're dealing with a smart class of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  The tech community is smart.  They're not stupid.  They know that this is an outlier.  They're not.  They understand what Gene is saying.  You should build a company should build value.  You should do.  You're giving them no credit.  They're not.  They're smart.  They know this is they're not going to get a billion dollars.  That might happen.  It gives them a little hope, a little something to dream about.  But almost everybody who starts a company, I would guarantee you, is just trying to make something good and make something that last, make something profitable.  Yes, we all think about our big exit, but that doesn't change how you do things, does it?  I mean, I think you still try to add value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope so.  I hope that young entrepreneurs are not aiming for the hockey stick big exit, you know, crazy.  I hope that people want to build businesses that last.  I just think that stories like this, they get the amount of hack that they do and it's a billion dollars.  It's a big number.  I understand.  I'm not blaming the media.  I just it seemed like a really big distraction.  I mean, at one point I had to close Twitter because I just couldn't, you know, the joking, the snarking, the commentary, the opinions, the Facebook.  It sure gets a lot of attention.  It gets a lot of attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, if it had been 900 million, it wouldn't have gotten that much attention.  It would not.  It's one billion that makes such a big deal.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, in my fantasy, and I have no idea how this actually happened, but my fantasy is this, that Facebook went to Instagram and said, OK, we want to buy you for this much.  Instagram said, no way.  And they said, we want to buy you for this much.  Instagram said, no way.  You cannot afford us.  We care about our product too much.  And it got up to a billion dollars, right?  Like everybody has their price.  And it makes you really happy that Instagram's price is a billion dollars.  That's great.  That's exactly what happened.  That's the price for selling out.  You think that's what happened?  That makes me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because, you know, their last round, they were valued at 100 million.  Some wild, crazy people a few months ago said 500 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Based on the last round, I think the last round was valued at that.  It's clearly more than you would normally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not going to say, I'll take a billion dollars.  You might say it in jest.  And then when Mark Zuckerberg says, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And who's going to go home then and say, honey, I'm proud of myself.  I turned down a billion dollars today.  Do you want to the moon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's grounds for divorce.  And now I'm going to get Jeff wired up, round up here, because at a billion dollars,  it's worth 50 million dollars more than the New York Times.  Yes.  The New York Times market cap is 950 million dollars.  A 551 day old company is worth more than 100 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But who has the best more users?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you're right.  30 million is more than whatever, than one or two million that read the New York Times.  I would argue...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they have a large online audience.  That's true. Online's bigger.  They actually do have, they probably have about, they probably have more than 30 million.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what we don't know?  This could be a broadcast.com moment.  We could be watching Kevin Systrom and the Portland, you know,  jumping onto the floor at the Portland Trail Blazers game,  making an ass of himself, spending his money like Mark Cuban in 10 years,  and everybody will go, remember when Facebook bought,  what was the name of his company for like all that money?  Whatever happened to that?  No, I'm talking about Instagram.  I'm saying 10 years from now.  Oh, right, right, right.  Remember Facebook bought, what was that?  It was a...  Polaroid? Polaroid?  You'll be on Dancing with the Stars.  I'll tell you who's really feeling bad right now.  Do you remember a company called Text America?  It was a mo-blogging company, had a lot of attention about eight years ago.  We were all doing it.  We were all taking pictures on our cell phones and putting them on text.  It was Instagram.  It just was a little too early and they couldn't make it.  How do you think Histomatic feels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, a lot of this is timing, right?  Timing, connections.  It's talent, but then there's a lot of other factors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they tried to monetize.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was their mistake.  Oh, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too early, too early.  Nothing wrong with monetization, but they clearly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Build quality first, worry about monetization later.  That's actually okay, Gina, because that fits your model because they're not trying to say,  let's make money right away.  Let's build a great product first.  Let's build a great community first.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As long as we can survive, let's build a great community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they were frugal about it.  That's the thing that's underappreciated.  For a long time, Instagram was just those two guys.  Very frugal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I remember we interviewed them.  We interviewed Kevin and we said, where's the Android product?  This was a year ago.  And he said, it's just the two of us.  We don't have time.  It's just two of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Jake thought that actually, among some of his friends, my son Jake, that people were  upset about the Android coming out because part of the allure of Instagram was that you  had to have an iPhone to have it.  And that was part of what made it limited in special.  That's why it was sexy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Patty Power, who is apparently a very well-known Irish bookie, is taking odds on  Facebook's next acquisition.  And Foursquare is leading with four to one odds.  The long odds, Myspace.  YouTube is 40 to one.  Friends Reunited.  It's in English.  That's English.  Yeah.  So, same thing with a couple of these.  That's their classmates.com.  Yeah.  Tumblr 25 to one.  Spotify 701.  I think Spotify should be higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I disagree with Evernote being on that list.  I don't think they're going to go for Evernote.  Nine to two for Evernote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  Hey, Jeff, tell us the name of that book because you just held it up so people on video saw  it, but we didn't hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  It's called The Institutional Revolution by Douglas Allen.  It's pretty wonky, folks.  And no Gutenberg.  Do you know of any good Gutenberg books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what would be a good book about Gutenberg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The best Gutenberg, the authoritative one that's out of print is by Albert Kapper, KAPR.  You tried, Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You tried.  You did your best.  It's called Gutenberg the Geek and it's only 99 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, 99 cents.  You tried, Mike.  I walked out.  But while we're at it, if you're really into Gutenberg, after having read my thing, you  want to read something really good, John Mann's Gutenberg biography is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will read that.  I will read that.  I love it.  Facebook is never going to buy you.  No, this is why we love Jeff.  Well, actually the best Gutenberg book would be, I'm glad you asked.  All right, busted.  The only people I want on Twitter, on any of our shows are people like that.  No, nothing about promotion or marketing.  We just want to inform.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're just here to inform.  Santa Claus.  Go to Gimbals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Also here, Jeff Jarvis, journalism professor from the City University of New York and the  author of Public Parts, his newest book.  Good to see you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And with my hair, I'm always appearing in black and white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you look good in black and white, actually.  Also, Matt Cutts is here from Google, one of Google's earliest employees.  He works in the spam fighting division at Google and a good person to have on today.  Hello, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, good to be here.  Thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks for joining us.  Besides turning off the logo, do they turn off your lights, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a dark day today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fine.  Those of you who are just tuning in or downloading the video might be slapping your computer  or your television set.  No, there's nothing wrong with your set.  We are in black and white today because we're recording this on January 18th, which is the  day the Internet fought back.  And with some success, I might add, we just learned, we just talked to an activist at  the Electronic Frontier Foundation that today alone, 29 members of Congress have reversed  their position on the Internet.  I'm Kevin Purdy and I thank you for joining us.  Thank you.  I wasn't quite there yet.  I just rolled with it.  I like the black and white, actually.  I think it looks kind of good.  Yeah.  There's something about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Classy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you go to Google.com, there's a nice big, it looks like a piece of duct tape over  the logo and a link.  Tell Congress, please don't censor the web.  And look at this.  Nearly four million people today signing that petition.  Let me just do that right now so that I can make it four million and one.  And I encourage everybody while you're watching the show to do that.  Matt Cutts, why doesn't Google want to stop piracy?  Are you pro-piracy, Matt Cutts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course not.  No, we hate piracy and we actually spend, you know, like $60 million a year trying to  get bad ads and other things out of our system.  So nobody wants piracy, but it's pretty crazy when you're trying to solve a business model  problem with a technological solution that just won't even work.  And I think that's one of the big things is people don't realize that pirates will just  quickly get around this.  And in the meantime, it will absolutely, of course, hurt jobs, but basically put a chilling  effect on the Internet where a lot of people, a lot of sites that rely on user-generated  content will be incredibly affected by it.  My wife, I sent her an email and I was like, hey, would you mind calling a senator?  And she's like, oh, yeah, yeah, I should.  And then she went to Craftzine, which is an O'Reilly site, and it was shut down for the  day.  And she's like, oh, no, that's right.  Regular sites are going to be affected.  And that was the tipping point for her to call her senator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I care a lot about this.  You know, our news program, Tech News Today, I mean, we get pulled down from YouTube all  the time.  Our news program, Tech News Today, ran that Mega Download.com video, even though that  video itself was not an infringing video, but Universal Music Group decided it was.  Universal Music Group also asked Tech News Today to be pulled down.  We appealed it.  They pulled it down again.  We appealed it again.  You know, finally, it was put back up on YouTube.  It's funny, Matt, because you do work for the company that owns YouTube, and YouTube  has in many cases been hand in glove with the music and the recording and the motion  picture industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting to me is I went to DC last year and did a Q&A, and it was just  for staffers.  And most places, if you, you know, say, ask me anything about Google, they'll say, how  does Google work?  You know, how do I rank higher?  How do I get my word out to constituents?  And I was pretty shocked at how many questions were about YouTube and DMCA and copyright  enforcement.  Oh, isn't that interesting?  Wow.  Yeah.  And what I realized is a lot of people have this conception that YouTube is still this,  you know, like it was in the very early days where you could find all these shows.  And Google has done a very good job of trying to make sure that, you know, if you're the  copyright owner, you can make sure the copies are down or you can, you know, monetize it.  You've got a lot of different options.  We've worked hard, but at the same time, you're absolutely right.  Like with TNT, it's totally the case that you sometimes see overly broad takedowns.  You can see mistaken takedowns.  You can see takedowns that end up almost looking capricious because it turns out the person  didn't have the copyright.  We've seen all kinds of fake DMCA requests where people are just trying to hurt either  competitors or trying to basically do some prank or something like that.  So the notion that this process won't be abused when we already see it abused under DMCA is just crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess that's the point of that.  One of the points of that video that we just aired and we didn't air it on.  I'll tell you what.  I'll play it at the end of Twig so you can see it.  But it explains why SOPA is bad.  And one of the things the video points out is, well, there's a lot of things the video points out.  But one of the things the video points out is that there are laws like DMCA and ProIP that are already in place.  There are anti-counterfeiting laws that are more than adequate and have problems already.  We don't need to go a step farther.  Tim O'Reilly, we're trying to get Tim on.  He's in a plane.  And when he makes his connection, we're trying to get him on by phone.  But he's been really great on Google+.  A lot of posts on Google+.  But one of the posts he put up a couple of days ago that I thought was great, before solving a problem, make sure you've got the right problem,  he talks about the unfortunately the people who framed this debate often frame it around, is it about piracy?  But in fact, he says, really, that's a misframed argument.  The losses due to piracy are far outweighed by the benefits of the Internet, by the free flow of information.  History shows us again and again, frontiers are lawless places.  But as they get richer and more settled, they join in the rule of law.  American publishing, listen carefully, American publishing, now the largest publishing industry in the world, began with piracy, began by stealing others' works.  He says we've got to reframe this conversation.  Piracy isn't the problem.  And even if you thought it was, these bills won't make a difference.  Because pirates just go ahead and go around anything like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just earlier this month, where digital sales are now higher than physical sales of music.  And early on, you definitely saw a sort of antagonism towards digital sales by a lot of people in the content industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just as they hated VCRs, cassettes, MP3 players, freaking piano player roles.  At the turn of the last century, they tried to stop.  Player pianos, they're going to put the music industry out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I think one of the things that Tim makes so he, of all people, can make this argument, because he is a publisher, he sees the benefits, is that we haven't proven the harm here.  How many of those, and it's proving a negative, how many of those people who did pirate the work would have bought it, had they not pirated it?  Probably very few.  How many people instead, however, did discover the work because it was pirated?  Could be very high.  And Paulo Coelho, the author, I wrote about this in the last book, he has sold more than 100 million books, yet he pirates his own works.  Right.  Because he discovered that when he put up, when people did pirate his works in other languages like Russian before the book was out, his sales in those countries went up.  And he pirated his own works and his publisher caught him, and Jane Freeman caught him because he said, oh no, somebody pirated it.  And it turned out it was the, you know, the internet.  He put it up on Pirate Bay, Paulo Coelho did it himself.  Yeah, and it was the wrong version, but he said, okay, it caught me, but let's look at the business opportunities here.  And Paulo yelled at me, I was giving away books at an event, and he said, don't give away books, sell books.  So he's very much a salesman, very much believes in it, but he sees the benefit of things being spread in this way.  And I think it's the lack of harm too.  And I'm going to start the drinking game early, but you go back to Tim's point about early publishing and Gutenberg.  You know, this notion of owning intellectual property is fairly recent in history.  And I think that what's happening too is we're going through a phase in society where we're going back to the idea that I just wrote about David Weinberger's magnificent new book,  Too Big to Know, and knowledge becomes the network.  It doesn't become the property of individuals in it.  And that's our old model.  And that's the way we used to do this.  And I think that this is really about trying to rethink the shape of our world.  And that's why the institutions are having such trouble with this.  That's why the Rupert Murdochs are belching everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at this tweet from MC Hammer.  He says, stop SOPA.  And there is Hammer with two guys from Firefox standing in front of the Capitol building.  I love it.  He says, need we say more?  So even artists, I think not all artists, but many artists understand that the Internet has given them far more opportunities than it has taken away from them.  And you say an interesting thing, Jeff, and Tim O'Reilly says this as well.  We often conflate the way the argument is misshapen is we conflate intellectual property with real property.  And we think that you steal my phone, that's real property.  But steal my idea is not real property and is not protected in the Constitution or by the founders never intended to protect intellectual property.  In fact, they said very clearly that the copyright laws and the patent laws were designed to protect the inventor for a limited time, a very limited time, just 14 years.  And that ultimately that intellectual property was the property of society and belonged to society to promote the arts and sciences.  And so this whole idea that somehow something is like that it's real property that's being stolen, even that is fallacious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And especially in a digital era, especially in a digital era, not only because it's not a consumable anymore, but also because the models change.  And I go through this all the time.  But in media, we've been brought up to think that all the value is encased in the product.  That's why we sell it.  And I've said this, I think, on the show before, but Mark Zuckerberg realizes differently.  Content has value, but its value is to get people to generate signals about themselves.  Why the hell do you think Google invented Google Plus?  Because we're why is it an Android?  Because we're using these things to generate signals about ourselves that allow those services to give us more targeted and relevant content services and advertising and extract more value from their relationships with us.  So content does have value, but it's only one value in a chain.  And the way media was structured for the 550 years of Gutenberg's era was that content media were encased as a product and could be sold that way.  That's just over.  So what we're seeing is more than just old companies trying to protect their copyrights.  We're seeing right here two important things happening.  One is the other shift of a business model around media.  But second, and I'm very, very happy about this and very proud of our Internet, we're seeing the beginnings of, I think for the first time, the creation of a public called the Net.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it's very, very exciting that this is the first political movement that I believe has started out of the net for the Nets concerns.  And it's up to this point working.  It hasn't won, but it's impressive in what the people of the net can do.  So let's remember this, folks, and let's keep fighting for other principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I was going to say that.  I mean, what's going on today is just absolutely historical.  What I was going to say earlier, though, I mean, I think that we need to be realistic, though, and accept that we're never going to convince the NPA and the RIA that piracy is not a problem.  So while I agree with you guys, I just think that they're spending a lot of money convincing the powers that be that piracy is a problem.  And this is why we need legislation this way.  So what we need to do with the tech community is to educate the government about how the Internet works with as much effort and time and human hours as they're spending educating them about how much piracy is a problem.  You know, I was at the White House last Monday, which is the reason why I missed the show.  I was invited there for a meeting about an event that's happening in the spring, which I'll talk about then.  But after the meeting, I had a few moments to speak with Anish Chopra, who's the CTO of the United States.  And we were talking about, you know, how does government reach out to its constituents and engage with citizens online?  And Anish said, what's the issue of the moment?  And I said, absolutely so.  And I used, you know, I very strongly advised him to that the administration has to put a statement out there.  And they did three days later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  And he gave him what I was very proud of, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He gave the hat tip to you in Twitter, which was really so cool.  He did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I told him that I would boost his follower count by mentioning him on Twitter, which I did, and then said, oh, hey, hours.  You're welcome.  And he said, OK.  And then he went to the White House responded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina, say that again, because we lost we broke up a little bit.  We lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, sorry about that.  Well, I had I had mentioned on him on Twitter saying that, you know, tech community should follow him.  And I think kind of in return, he gave me that hat tip for the White House's response.  But the White House was working on that response when I was at the White House.  So I certainly don't take credit for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's his Twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to follow him.  Anish Topra.  Anish Topra is his name and his Twitter handles just his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A-N-I-S-H?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A-N-E-E-S-H.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CHOPRA.  All right.  I'll follow him right there.  There we go.  Chief Technology Officer.  So follow.  There you go.  See?  See?  But I do think this is it makes an important point.  And read, write web.  Scott Fulton writing a rewritable also makes this point.  All right.  So we've shown we can be negative Nellies and say don't pass it.  But then the challenge is, okay, come up with a solution.  But what's the problem, though, Leila?  Well, I agree with you.  And that's as Neela, and you go back to Twitter about a month ago, Neela Patel and I had a big debate over this.  And Neela, who is a lawyer by training, said, you can't just say no.  You have to offer a compromise position.  My position was digital technologies.  There is no technology that effectively prevents piracy.  The solution is to reinvent your business model.  Yes.  Not to break the Internet and computers.  And I do believe that the people who control content today wish computers and the Internet would just go away.  The reason we chose to go black and white today instead of black entirely is I want to talk it back to the 50s where there was no Internet.  There was no computer.  And of course, at that time, people, those guys hated other things.  There were other technologies they hated.  But they would love computers and the Internet to go away.  And failing that, they know that's not going to happen.  Let's modify them in such a way that we don't have to fear them instead of reinventing their business model.  There's plenty of money to be made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the problem as they perceive it is that there's piracy going on on foreign websites and the United States needs a way to address that.  Well, is there a way, though?  I don't know.  I don't have a better way.  I mean, this bill, this is an attempt to give the United States a way to address.  There's a foreign website, non-U.S. website offering copyrighted material, which is illegal.  And how do we address that?  This is not the solution.  But what is the solution?  I mean, when I brought this up with Anish, she said to me, do you know why this bill even started?  It's because we need a way to address, you know, criminal activity on foreign websites.  And it is, listen, offering copyrighted material is a crime right now.  Right. So what is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How could we?  Well, Gina, hold on there.  It's not what happens in China is not a crime in the U.S.  It's a crime in China if China has the right laws.  And in fact, it's not a crime in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's what this is trying to do is to fill in laws and enforcement in lands where it doesn't exist.  But we don't have unless we want to do some extradition and we've done things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've got no way of stopping the Chinese.  So we do what the Chinese did, which is create a great firewall of the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree with Leo here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I was going to say, obviously, that's a terrible idea.  Right. But that's what this read, write web article is saying that the administration is saying, like, OK, if this is a terrible idea,  then what then what can and what can we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's here's the idea.  Leo is absolutely right.  I think. And you start to encourage and teach industries new models.  Now, will various of those companies succeed?  Not necessarily.  You know, the thing that I've been talking about, and I think I just decided today that we're going to try to build a demo of this at CUNY is to build embeddable units of content.  So I'm going to come back to Google Plus and and Richard Gingras and folks and try to get a Guardian article, let's say, off their API embedded not only in my blog, but also on Google Plus with their brand, with their revenue, with their analytics, with links.  You change the model.  A movie that passes around, maybe it should pass around with advertising in it.  And if you want the clean version, you buy it.  Otherwise, you get some monetization with it.  I don't know.  But but but trying to preserve the old model in a new reality is not the solution.  And it is a misstatement.  This is where Tim Riley is really so right.  It's a complete misstatement of the problem.  There's not a proof of harm here.  So before we get demanded by the White House or we write web that well, OK, then you come up with something better.  No, absolutely not.  You come up and show us the harm.  You show us the real facts that make it worthwhile to ruin the friggin Internet.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and it's interesting because I try to I try to think about how to step into the minds of the people who are facing these problems, because I understand if you're a movie producer or someone who writes music, you don't want pirated content to take away from your your living.  Right. So there's there's two different cases.  There's collateral damage, you know, really legit businesses that could be taken down by mistaken sort of practices.  And then there's the egregious sort of stuff.  And on the egregious sort of stuff, my spam fighting instinct kicks in a little bit.  So to be a good spammer, you need reputation like links.  You need content, something that the search engine can key off of.  But most importantly, you need a way to monetize.  And there's been a study where people looked at email spam and they basically figured out that most of the credit card processing went through something like three banks based in Eastern Europe.  And so a lot of the times if you actually follow the money to either the credit card processors or the other payment processors, you'll find that there's some very small points where you could actually have a big impact there.  And so there is an act called Open where people are talking about following the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But Matt, but Matt, how well has that worked in stopping email spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the interesting thing on email spam is I think Gmail has been a huge technological improvement over what was previously working with email spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you're filtering it, not because you're stopping it.  Because we're...  What is it? 95% of all traffic on the Internet is still spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But for an average user, they don't have to see spam in their inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's my point. There are technological solutions, but you cannot stop piracy.  You cannot stop spam. If black holes, if blacklists worked like they're proposing in SOPA and PIPA, we wouldn't have any spam.  They don't work.  Oh, I'm totally familiar with that.  Yeah. We haven't stopped spam. We just don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, and what's interesting is the very first thing I worked on at Google was SafeSearch, which is our family filter.  And there was a Dilbert that came out that basically said, so you're going to try to keep every 14-year-old boy from getting to porn?  Did you know that a snowball lasts longer in hell if you put a little hat on it?  You know, you can't keep people who really are going to go to, you know, they'll go all over to find stuff.  But you can try to make it easier so that people don't run across it on a daily basis.  But what doesn't work, because I've seen, you know, how the brittle aspect of blacklists dealing with trying to mark explicit porn sites and not the idea of outsourcing that through a private right of action to other companies who don't necessarily aren't necessarily as tech savvy.  That just seems like a recipe for disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room is saying, well, what about physical goods? What about Chanel handbags and Rolex watches?  I would submit that anybody who would buy a fake Chanel handbag or Rolex wristwatch would not buy the original under any circumstances anyway.  So what you cannot say is that Rolex loses money to fake low Rolex wristwatches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and in fact, Leo, I went to a meeting by Richemont in South Africa last year, and they talked about what they're going to offer is the danger there really is that someone thinks they're buying a real one and get ripped off.  OK, a phony gets passed off. So what they see the need to do is to create new verification mechanisms.  So before you buy it, you can verify that this is real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's not the overseas website problem, because if you're buying Chanel handbags from an overseas website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you should just know better. And you're right, Leo, you're not going to buy a real one anyway.  Here's another way to look at it. There were more cases today. Zappos are looking at so many things the wrong way.  And I wish I'd been on with Steve before this to ask him this question.  Slightly off topic, but but all the security breaches and oh my God, people have my credit card number and my address and my my social security number.  Shouldn't we set up transactional methods so that it doesn't matter if anybody has my credit card, my social security number or whatever?  Right. We're doing this wrong way. We're trying to play the whack-a-mole that Matt's talking about of getting rid of the bad guys rather than creating new and better systems and models.  If we had some means that was biometric and informational that let me and only me do transactions under my name, then I wouldn't care if anybody has my social security number.  It's not the secret to my universe. We're doing it the wrong way. So same here.  I think that Matt's quite right is to pray is to try to stop that thing from happening isn't going to work.  So you create better systems that bring the good stuff up, make it easier to buy things.  Steve Jobs proved that that worked in music is the is the is the revenue the same as the as the monopoly price?  The monopoly pricing the same? Well, no, but welcome to a new world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody have a chance to speak along to the these lines. Matt, you have anything else you want to say before we move along?  I think we're preaching to the converted here.  I think anybody who's watching this show knows exactly why they hate SOPA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it is very cool when you were talking to the EFF guy to hear that 29 Congress people have reversed their position today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty wild. And as you say, this is much larger than PIPA and SOPA.  This is I think you could look you'll be we'll be able to look back on this day and say this is the day the Internet showed its power.  And we the people of the Internet maybe do have a little bit of clout.  And we're not just a bunch of, you know, bearded neck bearded guys in their underwear sitting in their basements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus one thing that made me very happy about the discussion, the White House statement was that it rose to the level of principle.  And, you know, that's what I talk about in my book is the need for discussion of principles because we get down in the nitty gritty of trying to recreate an old model or protect one little thing.  We've got to deal with the full principles, the precedents that occur here and the why and the wherefore.  And at some point, the White House has to decide and Congress has to decide, is it more important to protect an entertainment company or free speech?  And where are they going to put their capital and effort in doing this?  And we have to have this discussion at the level of principles and protecting these principles for a future.  And that's what I'm so delighted about is that we're having here is we're saying that SOPA is one of many bad things going on in trying to screw the Internet.  But this is the one that went too far. And this is the one we're going to stop.  And we're going to have this discussion on the basis of principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I hope this strengthens our muscle and our protest muscle.  And we and now that we understand that we have we have some say in the matter that we all stay involved and active.  We vote. We pay attention to these issues.  But now, you know, I think it's really important that we have a balance, a descending viewpoint.  So, ladies and gentlemen, we take you to Rupert Murdoch, who says,  Obama has thrown in his lot with Silicon Valley pay masters who threaten all software creators with piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you do that with an Australian accent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, plain thievery. Piracy later is Google, who streams movies, free sells advertisements around them.  No wonder pouring millions into the lobbying.  So as you point out in your this is from Jeff's blog post saying Rupert Murdoch doesn't understand links.  He really doesn't.  It's all your fault that cuts. I blame you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what to say about this. He thinks to link to things is to steal.  Rather than sending them audience, he does not understand that basic basic structure.  So he's always thought that aggregators were content kleptomaniacs in the words of one of his recently ousted lieutenants.  And now he thinks that for Google to just link to bad stuff is is is Google doing it.  And he thinks the whole Internet is on by Google. I saw here's the here's the here's the here's the smoking gun post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've just been to Google search for Mission Impossible.  Wow. Several sites offering free links. I rest my case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Dirkovich, he says that happened at CES when he got a demo of Google TV and was shown how to search for TV.  And he asked if I search for Mission Impossible, will these bad things come up, too?  And the answer was, yes, search. And he went berserk.  He says in his latest post, 19 hours ago, don't care about people not buying movies, programs or newspapers, just stealing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry. So OK, so if we don't buy anything from him ever again, he won't he doesn't care about that.  No problem. Just don't steal. Yeah.  Well, actually, you know that that there is some internal consistency to that, because the presumption being that if once stolen, that was a purchase that we've lost.  But he accuses Google of being the thief. Right.  You stole it instead of buying it.  Oh, it says AFL, CIO supports SOPA.  Well, we better talk to those union leaders. How about that?  I have to say, though, I'm not I don't want to make too much fun of Rupert because at least he's tweeting.  I mean, this is him, obviously.  And how many CEOs only only a guy like Rupert Murdoch with huge amounts of power within his company would get the permission to tweet.  He doesn't ask permission. He just does. Yeah, he gives it. Yeah.  I'm going to say what I want. All right.  But now it's Matt's turn to get on the hot seat.  And we're going to do that in just a little bit, because Google made some big changes.  I don't know, Matt, if you saw Twitter this week, but we went into great detail with Danny Sullivan about this search plus my world and some of the real interesting conflict of interest issues that it raises.  And I want I'm going to give you every chance to respond to that.  So we'll do that in just a little bit.  This is, of course, the day the Internet fought back.  That's why we're in black and white.  We invite you to go to blackout.eff.org or American censorship.org or reddit.com or one of WordPress.com or wired.com and learn more wikipedia.org and learn more about this and what you can do, primarily chief of which is a call your member of Congress.  Now, of course, we're a global show.  More than a third of our audience is outside the US.  Don't think this doesn't affect you.  These laws are being passed all over the world.  Most recently, Spain, France, the World Intellectual Property Organization, the running dog of the US content industry is working on passing bills exactly like this all over the world.  So the fight goes on everywhere.  You're just as much at risk as we are.  Well, I hope you've enjoyed this best of this week in Google as much as we've enjoyed doing Google this week and Google all year long.  Such a great show.  And we like want to thank all the people who join us on a regular basis like Google's own Matt cuts Kevin Marks, Kevin Purdy.  There's so many great people to do the show with us.  Aaron Newcomb is so much fun.  And remember, it's not just about Google.  It's about the cloud.  It's about Facebook.  It's about Twitter.  It's about these new technologies that are really changing how we interact, how we communicate, impact things like privacy and security.  So I think we're going to have a lot to talk about with Gina, Jeff and me in 2013.  I hope you'll join us.  We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific.  That's about 4 p.m. Eastern Time.  Twenty one hundred UTC on Twitter.  Live is great if you can watch because I love the interaction we get from the chat room.  But if you can't watch live, please download audio or video of the show after the fact.  In fact, do me a favor, subscribe.  That way you'll get every episode.  You will appreciate that.  Have a safe, happy and healthy New Year.  And we'll see you right back here in 2013.  I'm Leo Laporte.  Take care.
