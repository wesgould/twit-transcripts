Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello. I missed you guys. We had a great panel.  I was sad to miss it, but very happy to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We installed the internet last week.  That was exciting.  We showed everybody how to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I missed one week.  One week you miss a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if that internet stuff was worth the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's Danny Sullivan, Search Engine Land fame.  Hey, Danny.  Hey.  You should know, when did you start Search Engine Land?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I started the site in 2007, and then the previous site dated back to 95, middle of 95.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was the original site about? Was it about Alta Vista?  Alta Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The original site was called a Webmaster's Guide to Search Engines,  because I wrote it to try to explain to Webmasters how search engines interact with their websites.  Brilliant. Pre-Google.  Pre-Google. It was all pre-Omni-esty.  It was all Magellan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Magellan. I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was all when Yahoo was big, and everybody thought Yahoo was the big thing that needed to be worried about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Jeff Jarvis is here. How's your shoulder, Jeff?  You fell down the stairs?  Yeah.  That's horrible.  No, but I'm glad you're all right, or I hope you're all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just in pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you won't be playing Wimbledon next year, but that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, good. I'm glad to have you all here.  Actually, Danny told us just as we were starting the show, breaking news.  Yahoo for the first time in five years, number one on the net.  Number one on the net? Is that right?  Crazy.  Yeah.  Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they've, you know, every year, CompScore comes out when they say these are the top sites or the top networks in the United States.  And every year, the list is always the same.  There's hardly ever any changes that kind of go on with it.  But this month, it came out, and it turns out in July that Yahoo popped above Google to be the number one site network in the United States  since the first time, since at least early 2008, since they've been there.  God, that's amazing.  196 million unique users to Google's 192 million unique users.  And that's not even counting Tumblr.  CompScore hasn't integrated all the Tumblr numbers, so those are separate.  And if you put those in there as well, then that would take Yahoo up to like about 235,000 users.  A big, big, big gap between them and Google at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's always been back and forth, though, Yahoo, Google, Yahoo, Google, hasn't it?  I mean, Yahoo's not like coming up for number 12.  They've always been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been like number two for a really long time.  So it's not like they're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the other truth is people don't go to Google for Google.  You know, Google doesn't emphasize having Google.com as a major site.  True.  It has maps and it has other things.  Yahoo has been a content site, a destination site since the beginning, a portal.  Well, a portal-turned destination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're about content, aren't they?  I mean, really.  Yes.  So what does that include?  Mail?  So would Gmail be a Google site?  Would Yahoo Mail be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That should include any Google property and any Yahoo property.  It doesn't matter that it's on Google.com versus YouTube.  Like YouTube isn't broken out from the Google numbers.  YouTube is included in it.  Well, that's content.  Wow.  If you watch.  In like a day or two, Google will probably like say, well, you know, if you factored  in this thing over here or that thing over there, and so it'll be interesting to see.  Because Google really doesn't like it.  What about mobile, Danny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What, you know, with people, supposedly, mobile's, everything I'm seeing with the sites I work  with, mobile's going nuts in the numbers.  Is Yahoo doing anything in particular?  They have a new weather app everybody's talking about, but is mobile a factor in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  In fact, we're still trying to figure out what it is that might have popped it up.  The first thought was, well, maybe this is all the Tumblr numbers that have come in.  But like I said, Tumblr's broken out on its own.  So the gap has always been very close, but something happened that maybe moved Yahoo  up.  And it may be also that, you know, what happens in the summer is that you get the people who  aren't searching on Google as much as students go back to school or are out of school and  everything.  So it could be that they were so close and Yahoo's had just enough of a gain that Google's  just enough of a drop might have had an impact.  So, you know, yeah.  Good on Marissa Mayer.  That's huge.  I know there'll be some celebrations over at Yahoo.  You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And she looks damn fine in a gown.  Can you believe all the attention?  Let me ask Gina.  She's a woman.  Can you believe all the attention?  I feel kind of bad.  So Vogue did an article on Marissa Mayer.  It's Vogue.  Marissa Mayer has always loved fashion.  We know that.  That doesn't make her less of a brilliant person or an engineer or a CEO.  They did, I think, a great looking picture of her in a designer dress with fabulous heels  upside down.  And people say, oh, it overshadows the story.  And I don't think so.  Can't we live in a world where somebody can be interested in fashion and still be brilliant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, we can.  I do think that too much is made of her looks, but it's kind of like it's a unicorn thing.  It's like you're just not used to seeing young female CEOs in the position that she's in.  And look, I think Mayer has a lot of control and a lot of say in the way that she's presented in the media.  And I think that she accepts these interviews and photo shoots and does so full well knowing what they're going to turn out to be.  And I think that she probably...  She thought it was a good idea.  She thought it was a good idea.  I wouldn't be surprised if she had final say on what photographs they finally publish.  And I feel like if she's comfortable with that presentation, then that's cool.  But I do think that a lot is made of her appearance.  But I think it's human nature to react to something that looks different.  It is kind of like the unicorn principle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think if you read the article, what is very impressive and by the way, look at the other pictures.  What is very impressive is that she held her own in a boys club.  Actually, this is CEOs go wild.  This is the wrong slideshow.  Although, did they make a lot about Richard Branson dressed in drag as a stewardess?  I don't know.  Was that a big story?  Larry Ellison drinking the largest bottle of champagne I've ever seen.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I read the Vogue article, I think on Friday, and the link I had...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not a phrase I ever thought I'd hear on this show.  Danny Sullivan says, I read the Vogue article.  I know you buy it for the articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's funny because I read so much on the Internet.  I don't tend to think of this publication that public.  I know Vogue and everything.  But I clicked on the link and I read the article and it was only the article.  There were no pictures or anything.  So I actually had this weird experience where I went in, I read the article critically.  That's it, right?  So I read the article critically and I'm actually going through the article.  Is that right there? What do I think about this? What about that?  And I thought overall it was a good piece or whatever.  I didn't see the couch thing at all until yesterday.  Which by the way, I recreated on Twitter myself because I have that couch.  Oh wow.  Not exactly, but I have a couch with that kind of thing.  So it's a few tweets back I did yesterday.  And that is a really hard pose to hold.  So somebody took Rupert Murdoch.  I don't know how she did it because...  Yeah, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Danny, they have trained professional photographers, lighting technicians, makeup artists.  You can't duplicate that at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and that's it. Let me tell you. My wife's like, no, you've got to hold it.  I did it this way and I'm like, oh.  So, you know, first of all, I thought it was a great picture and it went with a great article.  And who cares what you want to pose it with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. So who said this? Danny Sullivan and Marissa Meyer.  I really like even numbers and I like heavily divisible numbers.  Twelve is my lucky number. I just love how divisible it is.  I don't like odd numbers and I really don't like primes.  When I turned 37, I put on a strong face, but I was not looking forward to 37.  But 37 turned out to be a pretty amazing year, especially considering that 36 is divisible by 12.  Wow.  That's the lead in the Vogue piece.  Wow.  She may have regretted that particular quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's not regretting anything today, man.  Je ne regrette rien.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She is Coco Chanel for a day.  No, I think it's, I bet you it's intentional that Marissa Meyer is saying,  just as she had her baby and took the job at CEO, that you can have everything  and that women shouldn't be kept out of the boardroom or out of the fashion week.  You can have it all.  And I'm wearing heels from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there are many women in leadership positions.  I think that there are women who play it kind of like one of the guys,  and I think there are women who are like being sort of conventional,  like have conventional female interests, you know, fashion, whatever.  I think it's great that she is, you know, that she's being who she is,  and that she's one representation, one way that you can be a woman in a leadership position.  Exactly.  I'm not into fashion, but rock on, Marissa.  That's what I say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's, I think, postmodern feminism, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think, you know, role models for women in both technology and corporate leadership is important.  And, you know, however you,  what would the story we quoted about a month ago of the woman who's high up in Google,  who dressed like a geek, she finally decided enough, right?  Perfect, yes.  And I salute that, right?  You can be yourself.  You can be in technology, you can be in leadership, and you can also be yourself, whatever that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I just want everyone to know I don't like sports.  I don't drink beer.  And I don't like cars.  So there.  Because you're a queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We just, we just have a queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love some blue suede pumps.  Let's take a look.  What?  Anyway, congratulations.  I think you could pretty clearly point to Marissa Meyer and say that the strategy is working at Yahoo with these numbers.  I really think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, those numbers are incredible.  It's a little hard for me to believe that.  I just don't spend a lot of time at Yahoo, but I don't think that, and I don't think any of us do, but I don't think that we're representative.  Real people do.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Real people do.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use Flickr.  I lock into Flickr pretty often.  So I'm probably on one of those numbers.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  All right.  Well, that's fair.  All right.  Let's let's play some drums.  Let's play some trumpets because ladies and gentlemen, the time has come for the Google Change Log.  Jada Tripani has the latest new stuff at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  YouTube for Android got a major update, a really nice kind of redesign in that card design that we're getting used to with Google Now and some of the more modern apps.  The big feature that the YouTube update for Android got was this picture in picture feature where you can watch a video and you can minimize it to the bottom of the bottom corner of the screen and continue searching for other videos while that video is still playing.  Yeah, really cool.  So in-app kind of multitasking.  I would have been really excited about that feature if the video played over any app, but it only works inside the YouTube app.  So so there you go.  But definitely worth taking a look at.  Really nice redesign there.  Google Plus for Android also got a big update.  First, the Messenger app that used to be in your app drawer alongside with Hangouts.  That's gone.  So it's just Hangouts now, which was so we're seeing that unification continuing toward that unification in Hangouts.  But there's a new app in your app drawer called G Plus Photos.  If you tap on that, it will bring you directly to your photos on Google Plus.  The ones that are getting kind of the awesome treatment, the ones that Google's automatic automatically picking out highlights and creating creating the you know, like that's the word I'm looking for the the collages of best photos.  Also Google Drive Google Plus for Android added drive integration.  So when you when you get the update, when you lot when you launch the app, it will prompt you and say, do you want to add all your photos all your photos and videos from Drive into Google Plus automatically?  If you opt in and say yes, then all photos that are in Drive will also get the same treatment, the same kind of awesome treatment that your Google Plus photos get as well.  So they'll get highlighted and auto awesome as well.  Let's see.  Oh, and other Google Plus news on the desktop.  Google has added native translations to Google Plus.  So if you post something to Google Plus and then someone posts a comment, which is not in your native language, there will be a little translate link right there.  So you click on the translate link and it will automatically translate it into your native language.  It's great. It really works well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's everywhere.  It's they've kind of took it away for a while and it's back and I'm delighted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks it looks really nice.  It's nice enough to add another extension.  That's just the desktop right now.  But it's going to come to the mobile app soon soon as well.  We were talking about this before the show.  Google added a little reminder feature to Google Keep, which is the Android app that is a little reminder note taking app.  So if you add a note into Keep now, you can add a reminder to that note that is location specific.  So yeah, this is cool.  This is cool.  For example, if you create a note that's your grocery list, you can say you can set a reminder to for that note to alert you when you walk into your grocery store.  Or you can say by time as well.  You can you can add a note that's you know, take out the garbage and have it notify you Google Now styles like say on Thursday night when your garbage is going out to use the new reminder feature.  Tap on the remind me button at the bottom of any note and you choose a type of reminder for a time based or or location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I presume it works with Google Now.  You can you know, in Google Now, you could say remind me to I wonder if you can add a location tag like remind me to buy eggs at Petaluma Market and it would know that off to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll have to try it.  I don't think it's I don't think it's doing that yet.  I think you can do remind me to and I'll enter the note.  But then I think you still have to go into the note and to add the location tags.  It looks like it is.  It looks like it is because this isn't I just dictated that to now remind me to buy eggs at Petaluma Market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got to Petaluma Market address.  It says set reminder.  I think it does in fact add location data to that, which is yeah.  No kidding.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  We'll find out.  I'll go to the market if it reminds me to buy eggs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll know.  That's really useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I think I was going to say that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's really useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I think I want to say iPhone's done that.  It does, I believe, do that.  But that's a nice feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See a series reminder series on.  Yeah, I believe Siri does do that.  And finally, Google Maps and Waze are starting to swap data in Google Maps.  If there's been an incident reported through the Waze app, which Google recently required, I guess it was three months ago, you will see a little a little card that says, you know, incident accident happened here.  And there's a line that says reported via the Waze app, which Chad's got up on screen right now.  Likewise, Waze users are now seeing Google Street View images inside of Waze, which makes it easier for them to to verify and report incidents.  So really nice to see Google and Waze swapping data, making use of each other instead of shutting one down or one cannibalizing features from the other.  Just really nice, really nice to see them folding in data from both from both products into the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How long is it going to take for the antitrust investigation to be done?  Because they're not they haven't bought them yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  Oh, so they bought them, but it hasn't been approved.  No, it hasn't.  So this is just merely data sharing.  And I wonder if there'll be tighter relationship once they do acquire it.  In other words, maybe they'll even eliminate Waze and just put that capability into the.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the ability to report from maps.  That's a good question, Jeff.  I don't know.  Good one.  That's all I got today for the change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the change log.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it's time to for our weekly bitch fest.  And we have two bitches today.  You're such you're such a bitch.  Jeff Jarvis and Danny Sullivan, both a little perturbed about the Moto X.  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Danny, you want to start that all take it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so wind him up, Danny, and then we'll let him go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, so I don't have one of the review units, but I want to see how it works.  They've got all this this Google Now integration that apparently is there and you can speak to whatever.  So I'm like, wow, this is a serious search stuff or whatever.  So I better get out there and order one.  So I go to order it.  And the first thing I wanted to do and just buy it just plain.  I don't want to call.  I don't need a contract.  I've got like three different lines of AT&T.  I need another line with every phone's in on it.  So I'm reading up and it's like, so first of all, the full price, what is like seven hundred dollars?  I'm still kind of staggered.  Like, why is it seven hundred dollars on the Nexus four is like three hundred?  But OK, you know, it's a work thing.  Whatever. Suck it up.  I just don't want the contract.  And then it's like, even if you buy it off contract with AT&T, it's still sim locked.  It's like this is this revolutionary phone that I can have in wood with with with this thing that unlocks it and all this other stuff or whatever.  And you're still only going to sell it to me with a sim lock or whatever.  So I was kind of like blown away by that.  I just I was really annoyed.  Wow. I feel paralyzed.  I'm going to get you. I know you're coming.  I'm feeling like paralyzed because I'm like, well, why is there not a developer edition that I can at least get out now?  Or, you know, why?  Why can't I just buy it direct and have it unlocked with with same or whatever?  Why can't I buy it directly from Motorola?  What what the hell is wrong?  And then after I post this out on Google+, people start going, oh, yeah, and you should see what Jeff has to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same same complaint, Jeff, or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no. Now, here's here's what I did.  So I signed up so that I could get, you know, I could win the gold ticket to go spend seven hundred dollars, six hundred seventy four dollars, to be exact, on the phone.  And I got to order early.  So nine a.m. Monday, I could go into the Moto maker and make my phone.  Like Danny, I didn't necessarily come out the color, but OK, navy blue with a nice little silver accent.  I was there. It looked all right.  So I go ahead and go through the whole thing.  You know, you're either AT&T customer, not an AT&T customer or one I got by an off contract, off contract click on that.  Guess what it says? Asterisk to your contract.  I'm saying this is nuts.  Come on.  And so I let it go for a few minutes.  I'm thinking, Jeff, you do this every time you order something and then you get buyer's remorse and you go through this whole thing and they're going to make fun of you on Twig.  And but it said to your contract.  So I don't want to get stuck with that.  I want to deal with all this stuff.  So I call Motorola.  Hold, hold, hold, hold.  Hey, like any old telephone company, I wait on hold for 20 minutes.  Don't they know how to answer the phone?  And well, the nice guy with the whatever accent says, I'm going to escalate this.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to point out you're not buying it.  It's not available for normal people yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this was not.  This was not a Twig special guy.  This was, hey, if you'd like a chance on Google Plus, I signed up.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is a prompt.  This is still I mean, you can't just want people to know you can't go and buy it now.  No, no, no.  And it may be that when you get Motorola support, they have no idea what this is.  Well, no, they made a whole point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you calling about the Moto X press one?  Right.  Right.  This is Moto X support.  This is a person that devoted to Moto X.  So it pulls up my account, pulls up everything.  So they escalated.  You're going to hear back.  OK, fine.  That's step one.  Step two.  I'm thinking I'm going to get this thing.  What's going to be?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So meanwhile, I go on a Twitter, of course, you know, bitch fest and AT&T comes out.  AT&T comes back and says, oh, can we help you?  Thank you very much.  Very nice.  They haven't they haven't called back there yet either.  So then I look at the terms of sale, which I snapshot it and put up online.  You might want to go to the terms of sale or you can go to my Twitter feed or my Google  Plus feed, Chad, and find this.  It says that you mean you are not as you're verifying you're not a store.  OK, cool there.  And then it says you may not resell the phone.  And we're really serious about this, says Google.  Well, I can't resell it.  I bought it.  You can, of course, resell it.  There's a first sale doctrine.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  But I think what they're trying to do is discourage scalping.  But remember, this may not be what you see on the site when it's open to the public.  You have you have early access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but I have early access as a member of the public, not as a geek guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but you understand that what they don't want is scalpers who have early access to  get in there and buy a bunch of them and sell them on eBay.  This may change.  I don't know if it will, but it might change.  You're not talking about a normal experience at this point.  We don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's because I'm involved.  It's not normal.  You're doing well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why, by the way, I just want to say I never ever do these kinds of press promotions.  You wait till it's for sale.  You're not listening to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not listening to me.  It's not a press release.  No, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's quote open to the public.  It's early adopters.  This is there.  But it is not really open to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anybody can sign up for it.  They may have looked at me and said, oh, he's on Twig.  Yes, but no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you go to AT&T, it says send me an email when it's available.  It's not available yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually, you know, this is I mean, this is the thing that gets me wrapped up  too.  I left on vacation the day all the stuff happened on the first, right?  So I've gone for two weeks, kind of come back.  Now I'm catching up.  And so the first thing I go to is this site called Google.  And I type in Moto X, right?  And I get to the Moto X site and I'm looking at it now and it's not very clear about when  it's coming out, what's happening, how do I get it, what are the options?  I mean, I got all these glossy colors and design.  I did the notify me thing, which I'm pretty sure I did when it first came out.  I never got notified and never got into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not out yet, guys.  But I don't know.  It's not out to the 23rd.  It's Friday.  How do I know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they put on the page available on the 23rd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You scroll down, you get down here, you keep going and it's like, it's going to be available.  I don't understand, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what happens whenever there's a new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it shouldn't happen that way.  You know what?  But this is what irritates me the most.  It shouldn't happen that way.  And it shouldn't happen that way from Google.  From Google.  But that's the point.  I agree with you.  Google is not Google.  They want to make it sound like they're Google, but they're still really old school in a lot  of ways.  They're acting like an old school handset maker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would wait until Friday before you start bitching about this, to be honest with you.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, on Friday it's not like it's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, by Friday they'll probably fix these things.  On Friday I'm not going to be able to buy them.  Yes, because that's when the mass public buys the damn thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  This was a public thing.  It was a public promotion.  And just like you, I feel like I was getting used by Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was an early adopter promotion.  Maybe they weren't clear, but what you're doing is you're buying it from AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was an open post on Google Plus to the world.  I follow it on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You follow Moto X or do you follow?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I think it's Moto X.  I can't remember what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I follow Motorola.  So here's what they didn't do right, which is make it very clear that if you want to  buy it, you have to buy it from AT&T.  That they're not selling it without AT&T at this point.  You're buying an AT&T phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know that, but not with a two year contract when you pay $674.  That's how it works.  No, no, it's off contract, on contract.  How could you be an off contract phone on contract?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously you've not bought a lot of phones, Jeff.  So here's the deal.  If you're due for an upgrade, it's 200 bucks.  Are you due for an upgrade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  That was an option.  I did not do that option.  I chose, one specific option was off contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That means you pay the full price.  Fine.  And all of the carriers, no, but all of the, you know, I understand, but all the carriers  do this, that extends your contract.  That's how it works, Jeff.  No, no, I can take a phone.  I agree, it sucks, but that's how carriers do it.  That's why mobile phones are the most hated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I've taken phones to AT&T and said, put a SIM in this.  There's no contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Put a SIM in this is different from buying it from AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you don't have any choice of buying it from anybody other than AT&T.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what you could say is why didn't Google offer a Google Edition first?  But I can tell you why.  Same reason they didn't offer a customization for Verizon.  They have promotional deals with the companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You contrast it with, when I want to go buy the next iPhone, I can buy the full iPhone  from AT&T and it's not going to be locked.  I'm pretty sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not going to be locked if you get it from Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's locked if you get it from AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but if I pay full price for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's no magic full price.  The full price is what you pay unless you are due for an upgrade on your phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, I could have gotten $200 deal.  No, I'm due, but I chose.  I said the choice was off contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they should.  The choice shouldn't have been less than.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you're buying it through AT&T.  What you think you're buying is like the Nexus 4, but it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why would you?  We're not communicating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But and that I guess you're buying it from AT&T, not Motorola.  But it says off contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite takeaway really was they're coming out with this.  Hey, this is this new phone.  This is this new way.  This is a new revolution.  It blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And it's all blah.  It's all same old, same old.  Yeah, I agree.  I mean, what was revolutionary was actually the Nexus 4.  I've really come to appreciate that phone because which I'm going to hold on.  Yeah, you know, there's no LTE, whatever.  And I look at it, I think, wow, a $300 smartphone that's not locked that you can buy direct.  And yeah, so you're only going to go between AT&T and T-Mobile, whatever.  But still, and the rest of the world.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there.  Yeah, I understand the confusion here.  If you buy a phone from Google like the Nexus 4 that is not locked to a carrier, it's not  a carrier phone.  There's, of course, no extension of your contract.  It's truly off contract because it's off carrier.  But if you buy a phone from AT&T, even if you pay the full price, it's under contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You cannot call it an off contract phone.  Well, that put me on a contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That might have been an error in nomenclature because it's confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, the error is the error.  Off contract is the proper thing.  The error.  So the long term, the story is I just said to heck with this.  I've got a bad taste for my mouth and I don't want to get stuck having it go through eight  layers of Dante's hell with AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The issue really would be, am I going to get a phone that has AT&T on logo on the back  or not?  Currently, I was going to.  Currently, you are going to get a phone with a carrier logo.  If it's if it's Friday, it'll be AT&T.  If it's the following week, it could be Verizon or AT&T.  But that's what you're getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't get the end of the story.  So so but I decide I'm not going to risk all this.  So I'm just going to cancel this thing and then I'll go to the store and get a black  one. And who cares?  Right. So then I see the email that came afterwards.  Oh, you have to cancel within an hour.  Well, they didn't give me the answer within an hour.  So I go another half hour on hold and then that gets me nowhere.  And then finally, I get an email from a nice guy, nice Glenn.  And Glenn does say, no, it shouldn't say on contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because that's confusing.  The carriers, the carriers understand what that means.  No, no, no. It's like unlimited bandwidth, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not listening.  It should say off contract.  It should not have the asterisk that says on a two year contract.  That was a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there is no two year contract extension if you buy it.  Yes. Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what the guy told me. Good.  I had to go through all this. Right.  So now I don't know if I'm getting it or not getting it or whatever.  But I agree with Danny.  What it really made me do again was appreciate my Nexus four and say, you know what?  Yeah, I say I want LTE, but do I really notice the difference in my phone?  I use that more on my machine and other things.  This is a great thing.  I think that I should be loyal and wait for the Nexus five if there is one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that rumors are that there may be one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. In October.  Yeah, this fall. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, that was my Google plus commenters when I said, I don't know, last  but you know, usual indecisive that I am.  What should I do? And they almost all said,  Nexus five, wait, just wait for the Nexus five.  And I didn't listen to him because I had gadget addiction.  And I went and did it.  And then I knew you'd make fun of me on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You got a hardcore Google fans and on Google plus following you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad you so  are you getting it or not? You don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know.  What I'm going to do is I want to go to the store on Friday  and see whether I fall in love with it or not.  Now to back to Danny's question, it's SIM locked.  But if you have paid out your contract, AT&T will unlock AT&T's policy is to unlock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say their policy is to unlock it, even if you haven't paid out your contract,  as long as you're in good standing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's standing right.  I just because you need to be able to take it to Europe or something.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you say, hey, I'm going to Europe.  Could you unlock this? And they look at your bill.  Yeah, you paid up. Good. Well, unlock it.  They don't have to do that.  But I think it's good that they do do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I couldn't buy an off contract one from AT&T not having AT&T contract at all.  And then not yet unlock the SIM.  And I couldn't bring it to T-Mobile then. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you yeah, you'd have to have a contract.  That's why it's confusing.  You can't buy a phone unless you have a contract with AT&T.  Yeah. And and it's good that AT&T didn't extend your contract.  Carriers frequently will for any.  That's why any excuse.  I wouldn't be surprised if they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, my problem is that if I if they muck with my contract, that was an M, not a M.  You didn't want that. I understand that.  Yeah. Well, the problem is I have I have a grandfather unlimited data.  So I never want to mess with the contract. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I'll give you an example of the crazy loopholes.  If you go to Verizon and you're due for an upgrade, if you pay the full price,  they'll keep your unlimited data.  If you use the upgrade price, they'll use as an excuse to kill your unlimited data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So there's a wonderful man named Hugo in the audience who just got his Moto  5 is very excited, who works for AT&T.  And when I had this problem once, he was nice enough to go into the store.  It's very confusing. My unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that is good.  So the idea, I mean, and you can do and you will be able to do this.  The problem is everybody's in a hurry.  But you will be able to do everything you want.  They plan to put it on not only on every carrier, but to offer unlocked  on carrier locked version.  Is that on Friday as well?  Do we know that? I don't think so.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know. But my guess is no, because the carriers announce the dates,  you know, that wasn't announced by Motorola or Google.  That's up to the carriers when they're going to announce it.  That's why there isn't one date.  And at some point, I'm sure in the next month or two, depending.  See, there's such there's this interlocking dependency  between Motorola and the carriers.  They wanted it on every carrier.  They actually didn't get T-Mobile.  Sprint still hasn't announced a date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Apple announced their dates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple hasn't even announced that there's a new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I guess I can have announced there's a there's a new phone.  I mean, doesn't it?  Don't they doesn't come out in the Apple store and the carrier stores  at the same time? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or is that is Apple so unusual because they have so much leverage?  Apple tells you what's going to be.  They tell the carriers and that's never that's unheard of.  And in fact, I think Motorola did a lot of strong  arming with the carriers because there's so little.  There's only two AT&T apps on this phone, for instance.  But I think that they obviously they had in order to do that.  They had to say, OK, you'll have the exclusive on the Moto maker  and blah, blah, blah.  Now, when does the wood?  I don't get what would not announced yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they sold it to you direct, what do I care?  I'll just buy it direct from you without the discount.  I'll put it on my AT&T account if I want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would have to come from Motorola or Google.  But why not? Why?  Because AT&T said, I'm sure we want a window of exclusivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I was buying it.  There's the deal is right there.  I was buying it myself, Danny, through the Moto maker.  And the Moto maker is exclusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's AT&T right now.  And we'll be they haven't said also haven't said how long.  But I would bet you will be not for very long.  A few months at most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but so you must move on to the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I know. And that's the problem is you and I and Jeff and all.  We all want the you know, we're in a hurry.  But this is going to take a few months to play out.  I think by next by early next year, you'll be able to get on any store.  You'll be able to customize it on any once one speculation,  which is probably true, is that they didn't want all these millions of phones  to come to Moto maker.  They wanted to trickle it out.  It may not even be an AT&T thing.  It might have been, you know, we can only do so much.  At first, we'll make sure that we've got the production line.  They've already pulled back on engraving.  Yes, the same way.  We're not happy with how it's looking.  Andy and Ako got one and they said, you know, we're not happy with how it's looking.  Can't belay that.  They pulled back on the smart the snaps.  They weren't going to ship those.  And then they said, oh, I guess we got it working.  So, you know, the smart thing probably would have been just delay this all longer.  But I think they wanted to get it.  I think they wanted to get into the market and get the attention before iPhone 5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they might be if there is, if there is, in fact, the Nexus 5,  they also need some gap between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So then so what's the speculation that it'll be from LG?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's there's LG and Motorola speculation, both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it'll be LG because LG just did the last one.  They usually rotate them around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I think the Moto X is the closest thing to a Nexus,  Nexus 4 that's on the market. It's very simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a no brainer to take the Moto X and say this is the Nexus 5  Google Edition, whatever, whatever. Right. Right.  They've told me they're not going to do a Google Edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes sense. Or. Yeah.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How are you liking your phone, Gina?  She likes the one she likes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like the one a lot. I like the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's nice and calm, Gina.  She waits. She patiently thinks it through.  And all we girly boys over here are just going to the store to buy the new  the new shoes when they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, see what I'm struggling with, because I've been using I like the S4.  I have a review unit they sent me and that it's been awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? I loathe it.  I've gotten really to loathe it mostly because of all the crap on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have that much crap on it.  And actually, I mean, there's just not that much that gets in my way.  What what I miss the most is there's no photos here on it.  Really miss that. Yeah.  But I actually and I'm going to try to write a column on it.  But one of the things I appreciate is  there's a lot of camera settings that I get in it that I actually use.  Like the burst mode was awesome.  I might someone doing karate and I'm like,  yeah, you put it in the birth mode, you hold it down.  It shot like 30 things in like two seconds,  which is pretty cool because then Google turned it into an animated GIF.  And he's really scary.  But so I I've really appreciated that.  But I've been thinking about the the one as well.  I I just like to see how the different manufacturers do it.  And then I have this weird thing where I struggle with.  I want to have the Galaxy S4 and I want the Galaxy S4 is pure Android.  So I want to buy the Google Edition, but I want to switch on the sides.  I can just flip it and see it with see what the Samsung stuff if I want it.  And I have very unique needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We all do. Yeah, we all we all.  That's why I don't have a lot of sympathy for Jeff, because I buy everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I never have full price and my contracts are infinite at this point.  And it's just the way it is.  And with all four carriers, how many of your AT&T

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is one of Bradley Manning's in jail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. When Bradley gets out of the one thing I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  has really changed me over the years now is I've always had an Android phone  on Verizon and when the next iPhone comes out, that's going to.  Because when I go out, you like it's an adventure, whatever.  You should like to have a Verizon phone and at least an AT&T phone.  So I've got back on hot spots and everything.  And Verizon has just been so pissy with the Android stuff.  I never know if the phone is going to get updated.  It's been such a nightmare with the Galaxy Nexus that I'm done.  It's like I will get an iPhone with Verizon and that's it with Verizon  because I know they can't mess with Apple and but Android,  they'll do whatever they want with.  So it's like, yeah, well, I'm done with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I also think it's interesting to address what you brought up, Jeff,  this resale issue.  And I will be interested to see if they do that on Friday  or if that's just pre-release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go, no, I think if you go to their  they've got all we're all folksy and they're worried.  They spent a lot of time and I salute them for this.  They wrote the terms of sale in.  Sorry, I'm at shoulder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, too.  What they don't want to see is people buying these and selling them for  twelve hundred bucks on eBay, which happens often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they can't control that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think they can legally say no.  I don't think they can legally prevent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm trying to sign in here that they did a very folksy job of doing this,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is to convince you, frankly, since they don't.  I don't think they have the legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, someone spent time writing a very clever, fun, easy to read.  We're going to try to explain it to you.  Then it's like, you're not a store.  OK, yeah, I'm not a store.  You're also not the boss of me about what I'm going to do.  I think I buy from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so here's here's here's an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not the boss of me, Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is this like it was like it's not your show.  OK, that's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, but I think the I think that  it's I think the first sale doctrine, it completely eliminates any legal rights  they have to say you can't resell it. Yeah.  But they can they can assert that trying to discourage.  Oh, yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody pointed out that what they can do potentially is, you know, wipe the phone.  Wipe it. That's that's like the thing with Google Glass, right?  That potentially they could take your glass unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't they go into eBay and stop somebody from selling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But see, that's why I think it's very similar to the terms for Google Glass,  which is you can you can gift it, but you can't resell.  But my here's the wording. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It says purchase payment terms colon.  Show us the money!  Right. You're not a store.  You're buying this phone for yourself or to give as a gift.  We can't let you resell it.  And we take that very seriously.  Now, how do you think you are the NSA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's the question.  I mean, they said that with glass because it's developer program.  And that's why I don't if that's still there on Friday.  We'll see. Then that's then that's that is a big question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Other people got objective because it's just so kind of childish.  So it's you know, one heading is shippity doodah shippity a we use FedEx.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say that. Yes, they do.  I bet you that's toned down to glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, glass was an invite only white listed, you know, the Explorer program  where glass was paired to your Google account, which was white listed as a glass  explorer. It was it was a different thing. Right.  This is a this is a consumer product that anybody can buy.  It seems crazy. But no, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only people who are not very similar.  So I'm saying these might be Explorer equivalent of Explorer terms.  If it's still there on Friday, then it's yeah.  Yeah. Well, yeah.  Well, Huckie, but it may not be there on Friday.  It may be early to Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Coming up next week. Do we still hate Moto or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So clearly, by the time we can get the Moto X on the terms in which we want it,  we'll the Nexus five will be out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The point is the unlocked version that I want by the Nexus five.  So, you know, the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  by the way, you can buy the Moto X on eBay right now.  It's unlockable for nine hundred fifty dollars.  So get on out there and get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But does it have wood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, this does. This is black or white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why does it have a carrier logo on it?  It didn't look like, you know, in a month, it doesn't look like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, nobody cares. Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, I can't wait to get a gold iPhone.  That's going to make this whole thing moot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. That's like getting bling on your teeth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. A grill. I want a grill.  Yeah. Here's a phone for you can get for a mere what was it?  Six hundred ninety five dollars.  We should give them a little plug.  Ten hours left to buy the Ubuntu edge.  They're raising money on Indiegogo to make a phone that is dual boot  Android or Ubuntu and can run a computer for gigs of RAM,  one hundred twenty eight gigs storage.  However, they say that they can only make this  if they can raise thirty two million dollars on Indiegogo.  They've raised twelve point four million to date.  They only have ten hours left.  I'm thinking they're not going to make it.  But maybe if every one of you, each and every one of you,  listening to this show claps your hands three times and say,  I do believe in Ubuntu, I do believe in Ubuntu.  It'll happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think most successful crowdfunding campaigns,  one of the one of the highest grossing crowdfunding campaigns ever.  And it's still not a cent of that twelve point four million  because they set it up so that they wouldn't get any of the money  if they didn't get all of it.  That's it's amazing that they raised twelve million.  I mean, that's amazing. But twelve million, thirty two million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thirty two million is a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they're a lot, but they're manufacturing a phone, a premium phone. Right.  And they want to do it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is let me just open my calculator.  I could probably ask Google now this.  What is thirty two million divided by six hundred ninety five?  That would tell us roughly how many phones they need.  They say we need to sell this many phones.  You're not doing my voice.  No, I should, but I'm so they need.  Actually, you know what? It's only forty six thousand phones.  So let's say that six thousand goes to overhead.  That's they're only saying we if we don't if we can't sell forty thousand.  We won't do it. Demand.  That seems fair.  That it's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the greatest market research you could do. Right.  What's critical mass to make us profitable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put my seven hundred bucks in.  I can't really do more than that.  But since I have 18, we buy five things.  I have said, wait, I am now in a bad situation.  I have more phone, more active phones than I've ever had before.  And it's not good.  How many? It's not good.  I have two HTC ones.  I have a Moto X. I have I let my Galaxy S4 to IAS.  I have a Nexus four  and then on an iPhone five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you need all those because you need to accessorize.  If I go to Apple, I want to take the iPhone.  If I want to go to Google, I need to have.  That's true.  When I go up to Microsoft, then I've got the eight X or whatever.  And that's why the Facebook phone was so great,  because I'd always get mixed up over what the hell I was looking to carry there.  And then they came out with the with the one.  To me, it's all purpose or whatever the first.  So, you know, the next time I head up there, I'll dust off the first  and then I'll be ready to go.  The Google voice routes them all everywhere.  So it's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's thank God for Google Voice, except I have five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have put it one is like five from the half six lines.  Like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we don't normally talk about iPhones, but I think it's worth  bringing this up because this is this could make a big difference in the world.  I have now heard it from enough sources that I believe it,  that there is going to be, in fact, a fingerprint reader on the next iPhone,  the iPhone 5S.  How does that change if it's if it's accurate and reliable?  That is a big that could be a huge deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just talking about how I don't have a PIN code.  I know, and I know we've talked about it here on the show.  And I know, Leo, you told me that I should.  I don't have a pin lock on my on my phone.  Oh, I pick up my phone 20 to 30 times a day.  And the amount of time that I would spend swiping to see that's a reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for the Moto X.  And I hope that this feature makes it to other phones.  When you're in a authenticated Bluetooth area, you could say this is a trusted area.  And so when you're sitting next to your computer or in your car,  you wouldn't have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a great feature.  I love that feature.  Fingerprint scanner is an even better feature.  Right. I think so.  Assuming that the same exact action, you take the same exact action  to unlock your iPhone, whether the fingerprint scanner was on or off.  The fingerprint scanner will let you in if it's if it's your finger.  That that to me, you know, when you look at the different security measures  and I'm sure you talked about this with Steve a lot, PGP and two step off.  Security generally equals complete pain in the rear. Right.  I mean, it means expending more effort, spending more time,  you know, setting things up and verifying what's, you know, what a secondary things.  The fingerprint scanner is just same action by default,  but adds an extra layer of security.  It's like it's like websites that automatically  redirect you to the HTTPS version, you know, it doesn't require any extra user  intervention. That's innovation.  That's what that's what security has to look like. Right.  Right now, security looks like going way out of your way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you're David Miranda, Glenn Greenwald's,  the Guardian reporter, Glenn Greenwald's husband,  and you're in Heathrow for nine hours and they make you give them the pass  password for it, for his accounts.  Do they make you put your finger on the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They'd have to. Did they make him give the passwords, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know they seized it. Not to the not to the thumb drives, but to the other.  They went they went trolling around his his calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could he have reasonably said no? What is the crime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just kept saying, you know, cooperate, you're going to jail.  And he had no lawyer and no contact. So horrible. It's so horrendous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's this is awful. Because we're talking a journalist, not even a journalist,  the husband of a journalist. Right. There's no social privilege like there.  Well, one thing you could say is that he has been helping Glenn.  He's been doing work for the Guardian. So we know journalistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But all the more so he was either way, either way, either way.  It's appalling. They go after him as Glenn's husband.  Then that's pure harassment.  And if they go after him when he's on a journalistic task,  that's harassment of journalism, too. Either way, they're they're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's appalling. They were wrong in the first place because there's no  reasonable suspicion that he's a terrorist. Right.  Which is what they want that to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the other great thing, but this this ties into this,  this ties into the phenomenal story of GCHQ  up to number 10 Downing Street destroying the computers at the Guardian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And as if A, that stops anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they know that now the rest has been very clear.  We they told them this will do nothing. We still have. It's punitive.  It's punitive. But it was it was punitive. It was it was harassment.  Now, the one the one argument they could possibly make is, well,  if it's in the UK, we don't want any Chinese spies getting it on our turf.  So we just don't want this stuff here. Right.  That's the closest you can come to legitimate.  But but this ridiculous scene where they destroyed them in the basement  with the with the spooks watching on.  And so I tweeted the rest of the picture of the computers and I tweeted  that this should be an exhibit in the museum in Washington for the you know,  this is what prior restraint looks like, folks.  And the museum said, yes.  And rest of it just said, yes.  So these things are probably two museums.  One part of it's going to go to the museum in Washington.  And that's the artifact of what they did.  But in both cases, they there's material they already have.  So what are they going to do if they if they harass David Miranda?  And if they did manage to break into the key, where are they going to find  the documents that are already theirs?  Same with Guardian stuff. It's pure harassment theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and it really is a chilling effect on  something we need desperately, which is good journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so and so is we should mention this.  So is the sentencing of Bradley Manning today.  Thirty five years. Yeah.  That is a chill on journalism.  That is a chill on sources is a chill on free speech.  It is a chill on watchdog in the government.  It is a shameful, shameful moment in America.  And on that happy note.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, well, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm with you 100 percent.  I'm with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm in pain. I can bring the show down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Manning's a little more complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was a soldier on duty, had, you know, he'd made oaths and so forth.  So it's more complicated.  It's a little more complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the difficulty we're running in, I agree with you, but I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with Leo is like, you know, you.  We have stuff that we want secret.  There are some things we would like to have protected.  You don't want someone, for example, going through and deciding that, hey,  I'm going to steal everybody's birthdates and social security numbers  and put it out there because that's secret. Right.  I mean, there's stuff that we do try to protect.  And there there are people who are given access to material  and agree to have that thing.  And I think the balance you're trying to find is at what point does  the obligation you agreed to protect information become outweighed by  the obligation to correct even worse  illegality that are happening because of the exactly that.  And what's what I'm finding most disturbing is now that  we're not seeing any kind of a push towards saying, you know what?  We're having these whistleblowing things happening because there are bad things  that require them to be happening.  What are we going to do to get that balance right?  You know, the Obama administration right now just seems to.  I mean, they keep saying stuff like about Snowden, like, well, he's not a dissident.  He's not a whistleblower.  It's like, yeah, actually, he's matching those criteria.  Exactly what he is.  And so, you know, and you're not putting yourself into a position of saying,  what do we do to make and accommodate this kind of situation so that  if people feel like something is really going bad, first of all,  they can get it corrected without having to go to the media.  And then secondly, if they do go to the media,  they have some alternative to say, you know what?  I know that you want to put me up for 100 trillion years worth of  I'm going to go to prison or whatever.  But my argument is under federal whistleblower laws,  I actually have a protection and a legal obligation or a right or whatever  to to to step forward and say no, you know, in the same way  that we had laws that came after Nuremberg to say that, you know,  you don't just follow orders, you don't just do things if something's wrong.  And that is a tough balancing act.  And right now, I don't see anything that's coming on the US side of saying  we're going to get the balancing act better.  I see them occasionally saying, well, we should have more oversight  of our secret courts.  Maybe we don't need to have the secret courts or, you know, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm with you.  And of course, the president in his press conference a couple of weeks ago  said that there are internal whistleblowing procedures  that people like Snowden or Manning could have used.  But I have no. He was wrong, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said that Snowden was protected under that, but contractors were not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was wrong. Yeah.  And even if he would have been, I'm not sure I would have had the confidence

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that that would go to Dianne Feinstein.  Yeah, that's going to get you. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's it.  By the way, that's the bizarre thing I find him.  It's also too. It's like, I mean, I voted for a bomb.  I voted for Feinstein.  And now I feel like he might as well have been from the part  that I didn't for whatever.  I mean, yeah, it's kind of think like when you get there,  do you just sort of like get brainwashed and everybody comes out  the same in the end or I know I just for the Guardian,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for this weekend that's going to go up.  Because that's been troubling me a lot, Danny, because I'm the exact same way.  I mean, I didn't vote for Feinstein, but I voted for Obama  after having voted for Hillary Clinton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You couldn't. We should point out vote for Feinstein.  Yes. She went in California. California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And in fact, she's the reason I left California.  But that's a whole other story.  Really? Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I want to hear that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll do that in a second. All right.  But my conclusion about I think about the president  because I wrote this piece just saying basically,  do you really do?  What are you thinking?  Do you really want to go down in history as the president,  the destroyed privacy and the fourth transparency in speech and so on?  And I think it's the secrecy corrupts an absolute secrecy corrupts.  Absolutely.  But you start to believe that if this is secret, this is power.  And this is what we need to have.  And that's where, you know, our damaged lies versus somebody else.  And and I think that's kind of what happened to him.  He went down a vortex where they convinced him that it's that secrecy  is what you have to have.  And secrecy is exactly what's causing this problem.  We don't know what's going on with our government.  It's causing a complete lack of trust in our government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that leads to that also lead to like what was it?  The lava soft with the guy with the email that a bit software.  Yeah, the idea, the idea that he has to shut it down and then say,  I can't even tell you what it was I was served with.  Well, now being under risk just seems so fundamentally wrong.  I mean, that goes back to the fundamentals of why we have a constitution  that says you're going to be served with writs of why you're going to be accused.  You're not going to.  The idea that you could say is I've been accused of something,  but I can't tell you because it's a secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gotten worse because Ledar Levinson,  the feds are now threatening him with prosecution for shutting down his service.  Hey, we were going to have this great way to wiretap Snowden and others.  And you shut it down.  You're going to jail, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's no way to correct what they would argue is the bad.  So if you believe it from.  Believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That may just be saber rattling there, but the fact that they're even saying that is appalling.  And now, of course, I don't I don't know if you guys follow Groklaw,  but that's a great website.  The over overreaction.  I think it was an overreaction. Yeah.  I think she Pamela didn't really understand exactly what's going on.  I also think that P.J.  Pamela Jones, who writes Groklaw, which is a great site for finding  out what the hell's going on in our legal system with the with regard to lawsuits and so forth.  I think she wanted to shut it down for other reasons at other times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what was the what was this piece?  Can we summarize what if you go to Groklaw dot com, you'll see her last post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Groklaw, I'm telling you, is a great site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That because email issue takes a lot of people because email is no longer safe.  This site depends upon the anonymity and protection of anonymity through email.  Thus, I can't operate anymore. Goodbye.  Period done. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. She just basically pulling the plug.  Yeah. Kind of shocking.  But and I think it is overreaction.  But nevertheless, I don't think I'm not trying to diminish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. The principle that she's addressing.  She's right. But there would have been ways to address it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think she says she's getting off the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's just disconnecting entirely in the name of privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She says my personal decision is to get off the Internet to the degree it's possible.  I'm just an ordinary person.  But I really know after all my research and some serious thinking things through  that I can't stay online personally without losing my humanness.  Now that I know that ensuring privacy online is impossible.  I find myself unable to write. I've always been a private person.  That's why I never wanted to be a celebrity.  Why? Hard to maintain both my privacy and yours.  I do think she's mentioned before that she wanted to stop doing Groklaw,  that it was there were other reasons.  But she does make a good point.  And, you know, we've said this before.  It's hard to say that you're going to be private in any way.  It's very clear now if you use email, it's not private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what she's saying is that this is the chill.  We this is this is and that is the other.  I don't have faith. So I'm leaving this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Hey, I'm looking at I have been looking and will continue to look at ways  to do this show outside of the United States.  Should it get much worse?  Because it's not safe to be doing what we're doing right.  If it becomes unsafe and it could for us to do what we're doing right now,  that's time to leave. Where would you go?  I don't know. Iceland.  Maybe Iceland. That's where everybody else seems to want to go.  I'm thinking a boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If we go to Iceland, can we get Bjork on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Bjork on anyway.  I'm thinking a boat.  I'm thinking a pirate pirate radio offshore and international.  Oh, I like that image. Yeah.  And I've been inquiring into the issues, the Internet, and I've been inquiring  and we're making great progress.  If the Google Loon project just moves forward, we'll be set.  Of course, a boat can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get a few balloon balloons to follow us.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The truth is, you're kind of screwed no matter what.  There's nowhere in the world to go.  That's true. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So why don't you like Dianne Feinstein?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do you hate her so much that you left California?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was not it. No, no, no, no, no.  She drove me out.  So I was a columnist on. Wow.  Yeah, I was a columnist on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're not talking to her Chevy Impala.  You're saying no, like a like a dog drives it really quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can only get to New York for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm still getting the fed the tar and the feathers off of me.  This is not my real beard. Really?  So I was a columnist, an examiner, and I covered Feinstein.  And I think that, for example, I covered when Moscone and milk were assassinated.  I covered her ascension and I praised her regularly.  But occasionally I would criticize her.  Right. This is what I did.  Well, she went to you were either on on her side or against her.  This is this is her activities these days are true to that character.  You're afraid George Bush, you're with us or against us.  And if you ever dared criticize her for anything, that reset the relationship.  And you were the enemy.  And she went after she and her husband went after Reg Murphy,  the publisher of the paper at the time, and made my life really difficult.  And I finally just said, screw it.  Wow. York and found a job.  You're kidding. Wow. No, no, no. This is all true.  And so I came back and I announced my resignation.  And we rented out a Burger King for my farewell party. I did that.  And those junk junk mail guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There wasn't Chipotle at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There wasn't there wasn't there yet.  We didn't know. And there wasn't an Internet either.  And so my last day was on a Friday.  And that Monday, Reg Murphy announces resignation and a wag on the sea  does said, well, Jarvis, once he got rid of you, he could go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His job done. Wow.  Yeah. Dick Blum is a very well known developer and real estate investor  in San Francisco who wields a lot of power.  That's Dianne Feinstein's husband.  And between the two of them, you'd be hard pressed to find  a more powerful couple in the state of California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Life turned out fine.  I went on to do greater things.  That makes me sad.  I want to be on a dying newspaper now.  So I'm happy. It makes me sad. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Well, here's some good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What one more email thing.  Well, we're quick on this.  There's a bit of a kerfuffle going on right now because  the New York Times announced that they were switching their to Gmail.  Yeah. And so now there's all kinds of people on Twitter saying, oh, well,  nor sources are ever safe there, blah, blah, blah.  But you can still encrypt stuff through email.  Right. Yes. Not really.  And the and the and the metadata is already at risk, no matter what service  you use, including Lava.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's what you cannot.  Yeah. Lava bit never was secure because in order for email  to be transported over the public Internet,  it cannot be encrypted by the email sending server.  Gmail is encrypted, but only if it's talking to another encrypted  SMTP server, which are few and far between.  So in order for me to send somebody email a lava bit, the chances are that email,  unless I take further steps, is unencrypted.  So even, you know, lava bit wasn't secure.  It just stored it securely, but they had the keys.  So the government could ask for the keys.  And it's our suspicion that what happened was Lidar Levinson was asked for  not access to the database or somebody's key,  but an ongoing exchange of all keys.  So the government had full access to lava bit.  And it would make a great honeypot because lava bit says, hey, it's secure.  It's private.  Meanwhile, the government has full access to it.  So I think that's what we're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not only that, it's recommended by Edward Snowden.  It's used by Edward Snowden. Right.  What better could you use?  So the way to do it is use P.G.P.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or, you know, open.  I use open P.G.P. I use P.G.P.  In fact, if you're on a Mac or a PC, it's very easy to install.  GPG for the number four W.I.N.  for Windows and GPG tools for Mac.  Install it, get it, make a key,  put your key in a public place where people can download it.  That's what I do. Mine's at leoville.com.  Then people can send you private email.  Once you get their keys, you can send them private email.  And I plan on encrypting all mail to anybody whose key I have from now on.  Just just to mess with the NSA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it stays that way through the whole process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody can get it except you and your private key,  unless, of course, they hold you at Heathrow and demand your passphrase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what this means is that every single reporter on earth  should be publishing their public key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. So if a whistleblower wants to come to them,  they can send them private email.  Now, that's what we should all be doing.  Now, what you should also do is create a, you know,  the problem is the metadata also has to be unencrypted.  Otherwise, there's no visible address.  So you should also probably, if you're a whistleblower,  create an email account somewhere where you don't have to give them  a credit card number or any personally identifying information.  You should use Tor or some other IP hiding system.  I mean, there's ways to do it. It's hard.  But if you're a whistleblower, it's worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. All right. Thank you for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we have a there's a know-how episode, know-how 50,  where we show you how to use PGP.  Yeah, which is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was the first thing that explained it to me.  Easy. Yeah.  You get going nuts. It was very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I use it. And you should look at leoville.com.  You see I post my key.  You also post to the public servers because then people could look up  Jeff Jarvis and say, oh, here's his key.  And they can encrypt to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you have to you have to use a client.  You can use the Gmail web client.  You'd have to use a client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can if you use mail below, which is a which is a plug-in for Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, mail below. Right, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can you can encrypt outside of your email client  that cut and paste it in the email client.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep. Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. Very easy to do.  I have mail below.  Mail below is fine.  You know, there's some, you know, Darren Kitchen at Hack 5  has done a couple of stories on how insecure it is.  It's not insecure.  He's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good. Okay.  Good. That's good to hear. Thank you, Leo, for that.  Yeah.  You just saved journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I, you know, I've been I've had a PGP key since 1997.  I've been pushing this since 1997.  Nobody's ever done it.  Maybe now people will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because your point that if everybody does it, then it's not a big deal.  Yeah.  No, but if only certain people do it, then they're like sort of automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're in the New York Times and all of a sudden you're receiving  a lot of encrypted email from somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's going to raise some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the NSA has said, by the way, that they save all encrypted emails.  So you are in fact saying save me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I'm going to start encrypting all my spam.  Yeah.  Enjoy.  Yeah.  You might not be aware that search engines are very important if you switch links.  Would you like to link to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, if you read and, you know, if the NSA manages in some  distant future to decrypt my email, they're going to be very disappointed.  It's very trivial.  Google ready to buy its way into the NFL.  I hope Peter Kafka is right.  Writing for all things D.  This is fascinating.  Google is, according to what, rumors?  According to sources, Larry Page, along with Robert Kinsel at YouTube,  have met with a delegation from the NFL led by NFL commissioner Roger Godel.  According to these sources, the Sunday ticket package was among the topics.  This was the TV rights for NFL Sunday Ticket.  It's an all-you-can-eat subscription TV service.  It's currently owned by DirecTV.  Wouldn't you love that on your Chromecast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't like the NFL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would buy it.  I know.  I know I'm a queen and everything, but 150 bucks a year, no problem.  No problem.  And it's one of the things that keeps people from cord cutting, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'd be nice if they offered it because then DirecTV wouldn't keep trying to put it on my bill.  We're going to give it to you for four months free.  And then I'm like, all right, whatever.  And then big bill.  I'm like, yeah, I don't want that.  I didn't want it in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Google declined to comment.  NFL hasn't responded to Peter Kafka's story.  And it's a chat.  And NFL's meeting with other companies as well.  It's something they do this every year.  We should mention the rights.  DirecTV pays a billion dollars a year for those rights.  Nothing.  Chicken feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chicken feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's got that on their couch cushions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it wouldn't merely be to promote the idea of internet television, et cetera, et cetera.  Remember, Google's business is an ad business.  And there's no ads more valuable than NFL ads.  The Super Bowl ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the ads where you actually know you're watching it then.  Right.  It's the last remnant of live TV.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And given that an average NFL game has 11 minutes of action buried in three hours of ads,  gives you some idea of how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, now Leo, this is interesting too.  Imagine if the game is embedded in a player, what you could do with advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  So much more, right?  Yeah.  And that's the pitch Google could make to the NFL.  We'll give you a billion dollars and a cut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about.  And because we can target the advertising to the individual viewer,  we can multiply the value of the advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So really, it's worth much more to Google than it is to DirecTV.  They could maybe even offer to double.  Who knows?  Who knows?  I don't know.  I like it.  Let's take a break.  When we come back, we're going to talk more about maps, YouTube.  We can even talk about Facebook if you feel like it.  Twitter and Bitcoin.  But first, a word from LegalZoom.com.

The new tweets per second record has been set by an old Japanese manga movie  and it's live airing in Japan.  Danny, you have anything to say about this?  143,000 tweets in one second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess my reaction was kind of like, okay, great.  I don't need any more posts about how you managed to do it.  I'm just glad that you're doing it.  We don't need that anymore.  Yeah, we haven't seen the fail well.  When was the last time you saw a fail well?  I was like, what I do want to know on a regular basis is when someone sets a new record.  I think that's fascinating.  I suppose some people want to know how it's all architect,  but whether it's Facebook or Google or whatever, the whole...  And we've managed it.  It's like, yeah, we just kind of figured you should be able to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, but if you're an engineer sitting in a data center where you have done  Herculean things that no one even thought possible five years ago  to support that kind of network traffic, you want to tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the manga thing, I mean, it was fascinating that that did it.  It was an old movie.  I am always, always fascinated by what pops up more, how did it go?  I wish actually Twitter made it easier to spot that stuff.  I would love it if you could just...  They need a zeitgeist.  Like when Sharknado happened, from my stream,  I thought the entire world must have been obsessed by it, right?  And it turned out it was like, yeah.  It was a certain crowd.  It was a certain segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, a certain crowd.  Yes, it was our segment.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our very sad friends, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that was useful to know.  So I kind of want to look at that stuff.  Have you guys seen Magic Rex?  I find all that fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Magic what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Magic Rex.  I think it's...  Let me see.  Oh, yeah.  Magic Rex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Magic REC.  Magic, like the word magic followed by R-E-C.  I just tweeted that earlier today because it's been awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a Twitter handle.  And so when you follow it, it's a Twitter experiment.  And when you follow it, it DMs you when a bunch of your friends  follow a new person or a bunch of your friends are talking about a particular news story.  So, and it's really good.  I followed it a few weeks ago and it's definitely pointed me toward new stuff  that I'm interested in and it's based on what your friends are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Magic Rex as in recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, real time recommendations.  Magic Rex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, so I follow them.  And then what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then so now you just kind of wait and they will send you a direct message  because when you follow them, they follow you and then they'll send you a direct message.  So if a bunch of your friends, so a bunch of my friends today  follow Drew Barrymore, right?  She just joined Twitter.  So I got a DM from Magic Rex that said, hey, this person, this person, this person,  all people who I follow just followed Drew Barrymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, so it's like, it's like who to follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like who to follow, but it's way better.  It's way better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter's is worthless.  Yeah, it's kind of worthless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then I'll also give you links as well, right, Danny?  If more than a few of your friends tweet a link to something, it'll DM that to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's great because it's sort of like a notification of what happened with a bunch of  just your friends.  And that's what's been really compelling about it.  Like the one I got yesterday, I got it this morning and that's why I tweeted something like,  this is amazing because I've been doing the same thing.  And it was like a bunch of people followed internet.org,  which just came up on Twitter because of the whole Facebook thing.  And so I didn't know that account existed.  So when I saw it, I was like, you know, but other people I followed did suddenly discover it.  And so same thing, like I discovered a bunch of people followed Bordeleon Musk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I got that one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was like, what?  So he has an account that was there and I might have helped  generate the boot Drew thing.  I saw somebody else come on, like Drew's not on Twitter yet.  So I'm like, yeah, following her.  And she followed me right back.  It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Bordeleon Musk, that's actually a pretty funny account as well.  That's an invention from Elon in his downtime, a futuristic hyper parody account.  But yeah, Magic Rex is pretty cool.  So Leo, you'll start to get DMs.  Something has to happen, like a few.  I haven't gotten any yet.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, but you'll see when you get them, you'll be like, oh, this is, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is actually, I think this show is better than that.  I've already gotten two people to follow Bordeleon Musk and Direct Rex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there and Drew, no, I'm not going to follow Drew anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She was very concerned that she was late to the party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, just a little Drew.  I don't follow celebrities because they don't tweet for themselves.  They're using who say and special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of them are great to watch.  You watch them.  It's fascinating sometimes when, I don't know, some of the celebrities are awesome to follow  because you know, they really are themselves and they're tweeting things and they don't.  I find it fascinating.  And I find it fascinating when two different celebrities,  I mean, to make examples of this, that you don't expect start talking to each other,  like a William Shatner and Kiwi Herman.  That was fun.  Those two came together, but you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be fun.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then the other ones are boring.  Yeah, who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But didn't I think William Shatner did tweet Christopher Haddad.  What was his name?  The Canadian.  Canadian.  Captain of the ISS.  So that was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he's real.  What's his name?  Rock Center.  I mean, the 30 Rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  30 Rock V.  We're old guys now.  I can't come up with a name.  I want to say William Wyndham, but I know it's Alec Baldwin.  Balding Alec Baldwin.  Yeah.  He's himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Lady Gaga is herself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lady's real.  And have you been following her back and forth about Perez Hilton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  I didn't see that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She posted how upset she is about the manning sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for Gaga.  Pretty interesting.  I think Gaga is definitely real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's definitely her.  So wait now.  I had to switch over to her all because it defaults to just  she going back and forth with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  So somebody tweeted her or messaged her that Perez Hilton was in her building.  I didn't know they'd had a falling out.  And she said, if this is true, you need to tell me immediately.  And it was like this whole thing going on and on.  And then Perez Hilton starts tweeting her saying, your little monsters are killing me here.  And oh my God, it went on and on and on.  You'll have to search for it.  It's probably deleted on both their feeds by now.  But yeah, so that's both of those were real.  Those were not publicists.  Got hope.  I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Unlike Dr. Phil, who one of his producers tweeted.  Did you see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They tweeted something like, you know, is it rape if you're drunk or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, they didn't say that.  They said, is it OK to have sex with somebody who is drunk?  Which actually, I understand what he's asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the little bitches on Twitter just went crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, everyone went nuts.  And he issued an apology saying that it was not him.  It was one of his producers.  But you know what?  He should say this is legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it consent if somebody is non-compensative?  That's a legitimate question to ask.  I don't think there's a problem with that.  He was hoisted by the 140 characters.  That's all.  Yeah.  And I think this is a very typical Twitter storm.  We got to come up with a name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's true.  It was the way that it was worded.  It was poorly worded.  It was like, my girl is drunk.  Is it OK to have sex with her?  Right.  Which people took as if you don't have consent,  consent of someone who is, is it OK?  Which obviously, it's not OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they had more letters, they could have said,  is a drunk person able to give informed consent to something like sex?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's a legitimate question.  Right.  I don't think that's a bad question.  And I think the Twitter people were...  I only reason I'm a little bitter is because I say one thing about somebody  and then all the little people on Twitter start telling that person,  did you hear me?  They want to stir up that kind of stuff.  They love that.  It's the Howard Stern problem too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  The what?  Howard Stern problem?  Howard Stern problem.  He complains about that as well.  Yeah.  That he can say one thing and it doesn't matter if the person's listening.  They'll hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  You can't say anything about anybody anymore.  Used to be you could say stuff about people.  You could talk trash about people in public.  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, sub tweeting.  You get caught.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to be I could slam people right and left all day.  No one ever know.  Anything else to say before we get our tooltip and number?  I promise I'm not going to make my tip the five guys Android app,  although I'm tempted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw you.  I saw you eating that burger.  Did you catch me eating that burger?  I got a quick, quick shot.  It was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're a pro.  I'll just point up over here about Feinstein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll get this burger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  40 million registered Vine users.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I'm too old for Vine.  I think I go there.  Buy that.  Somebody should buy that Vine thing.  That thing is going to be huge.  I'm Twitter did hire a Google executive away to run their entertainment business.  I don't know if that means anything or not.  Jennifer Prince will help with little helm.  I'm saying helm because it's in variety.  Will helm Twitter's ad sales effort and movie TV biz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Should we talk about Internet.org?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the latest of Internet.org?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At all.  It's his balloons, his loons.  He wants to win millions on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Zuckerberg effort.  I guess Internet.org is the site for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nokia and Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every one of us everywhere connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everyone should be watching ads from Facebook.  Just imagine what the world would be like if Facebook could track every one of you  instead of just one incentive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I look at this and I think Mark Zuckerberg went to his publicist and said that goddamn  Sergey Brin is getting all the attention.  Make me Tony Stark.  Today the Internet isn't accessible for two-thirds of the world.  Imagine a world where it connects us.  The purple's got to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  His plan is a lot less imaginative than Internet connected balloons.  But it's pretty straightforward.  It's like lessen the data that mobile apps take up, lower the cost of wireless data,  and make it worth it for businesses.  And he kind of made the point of saying like Facebook's not going to make a lot of money  from these people because they're not rich.  Oh, that's not true.  We have an obligation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there's a way.  I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everyone.  Oh yeah, there's a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Six billion pennies adds up to something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well maybe they could just do it here first.  Yeah, let's start in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like to wire up another San Francisco park.  Could I get one other broadband provider in Newport Beach?  Because we're fairly urban.  We could use some other options out here other than our cable network.  It's ridiculous.  There's like no alternatives.  So yeah, I'm frustrated.  I don't need to have Kansas have any more options.  They have more options than I probably do.  I'm frustrated.  So it's a coalition with the wireless carriers.  We locked into this giant thing that cost me this huge contract forever and ever.  And they keep upping it and oh, well, you're on a smartphone.  So we have to add another $10 onto that because as if anybody's not using a smartphone now and,  you know, oh, let's add in the other thing here, whatever.  So hey, Mark and Google, if you guys are so able to change the world,  do you think you could change it right here in the United States?  Because you seem pretty powerless and unable to do that.  Having said that, yeah, I think it would be great if more people had internet access.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then Times article quotes Bill Gates who says, you know, I don't know if getting internet  access to the poorest people in the world is really important.  He says when a kid gets diarrhea, there's no website that relieves that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's such a such a bogus argument.  It says that you can the whole world can concentrate on only one problem,  the bills problem and anything else is then offensive because it doesn't deal with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's right, though, that getting drinking water and good health care and of course,  it is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This does not this is not it's not a zero sum game.  Yeah.  Let's look at Africa and India.  These are incredibly developing economies where there's huge growth of middle class.  For them, it's not necessarily about water and diarrhea.  It's also about economic opportunity.  It's also about education.  It's about information.  It's about informed societies.  Those are also good goals to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And Bill's doing very good work and I support the work he's doing.  And Mark and and Sergey can do some stuff too.  It wouldn't wouldn't hurt.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you know, I live in California.  My kid had diarrhea.  I googled it.  I mean, you know, it does work.  It does.  It's it amazed me how much I've googled things about infant care in the first 10 months of my  of my daughter's life.  I was watching YouTube videos and had a sponge bathe a newborn her first week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what happens, by the way, when you do that.  So Henry, my son, who's now going to college, we mentioned that and turning it just turned 18.  He got, you know, the selective service thing.  I figured, well, there's probably laws.  The school has to reveal that.  Then he got a razor from Gillette.  And he said, how did Gillette know how to send to send me a razor?  And I said, well, you know, probably the hospital sold her baby records and they've been keeping  track for 18 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  Well, the kind of marketing that goes on college is really is really insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And just, you know, maybe they bought it from the college or maybe maybe I googled a few too  many times razor burn.  I mean, who knows?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But so that information's out there and it does yield some interesting results.  But it is good.  The web is good.  No matter what you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because of all that porn.  It's all for porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or unless you want to be totally anonymous and private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let us get let us get from Gina Trippani a tip of some kind.  Our tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The latest stable version of Chrome.  Chrome version 29 has a has a new little setting.  I thought was caught my eye.  It was a little interesting because sometimes I go a little extension crazy in Chrome.  But if you go into settings and then advanced settings, there's a new button  which will reset Chrome basically to its to its its original state.  Yeah, it will.  It'll restore power wash.  Yeah, it won't affect your bookmarks, your saved passwords or your history.  But it will delete it will disable all your all your extensions.  It will unpin tabs.  It will also like reset your home page and your new tab page and your search engine.  It will clear it'll clear things up.  It'll give you that new new car smell in Chrome.  So to use it if you're if you're interested in doing it.  And actually I just did it on this machine because I like to keep this machine relatively clean.  You can go to the the hamburger icon and in the top right on Chrome and go to settings.  Advanced settings and then there's a reset browser settings button.  And that'll just clean everything up disable your extensions get everything back to kind  of factory settings without messing with your your bookmarks your history or your saved passwords.  A nice way to reset the browser if you've gone to extension crazy or things have gotten slow  or you just kind of want to you know something's gotten wonky and you just want to reset it back  to the the default without deleting everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  There you go.  Jeff Jarvis your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well so I'm going to go back to my downer topic of course at the NSA and all that.  And I just saw the the finally the government released the FISA  decision from 2011 that said that much of what was being done was illegal.  And Christopher Segoian is that a correct pronunciation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah South Segoian's brother Christopher yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The ACLU's CTO I believe is his title.  Yeah.  One tweet that just came up because they're digging through this on page 71 it says that  91 percent of internet communications acquired by NSA via section 702 are direct from internet  service providers not backbone taps.  Yeah yeah yeah.  So your ISP ain't your friend.  No.  They're your neighborhood spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been saying this for years people worry so much about Google.  There's one there's one guy who sees everything before Google does.  That's your ISP not just everything you do on Google everything you do everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that hasn't come out there's been no discussion of the ISPs at all.  And there needs to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well we have discussed it quite a bit.  And yes yes oh yes.  Of course remember Carnivore yeah Steve but in general remember we talked about Carnivore  when the FBI was trying to put a box in all internet service providers that would save  18 months worth of data that's you know pretty much being done now under a different name.  And we also talk about my good friend Dane Jasper who runs SonicNet which is an independent  internet service provider which has for years fought this and refuses to do that.  And they're the exception that proves the rule as far as I'm concerned.  That's the only one we're hearing from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other great thing you had on the network I think was this last week Father Robert showed  a tap for fiber.  Yeah.  And how you can show the physical tap.  Yeah you do it so easy.  Fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Easy easy peasy.  Danny did you want to share a tip or anything a tool.  A number.  What do you like man what do you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know you know I do a column on CNET every so often like once a week on  it's the common sense tech column and maybe I'll just share two things I did there.  I went on my trip and one of the columns I wrote when I came back was if you know if  you don't know about it you know the idea of just going local with your SIM card.  If you've got an unlocked phone it's pretty easy in a lot of countries.  I like it Heathrow I got off the plane walked over to a vending machine got a local SIM  card and away I love that column yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's that.  I love that column yours was great I've not seen the vending machine I would kill for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah it's really nice and I mean it was like basically about thirty dollars that I paid  and then I had unlimited internet access and three thousand minutes and three hundred or  three thousand text message three hundred minutes and it's great and you're wired up  and you're not paying all these charges to your local thing or whatever so I you know  I'd encourage people to think hey you can you can go local with stuff and.  But you can only do that if you have an unlocked phone.  You have to have an unlocked phone but it's not as hard to unlock some of the phones as  you think like you've got an older phone and you still kept it around AT&T will unlock it  as we talked about.  I unlocked to a Samsung S4 and a Samsung S3 just by googling it finding the code typing  it in and away I went.  It was pretty slick and it worked so yeah but yeah you got to have the unlocked phone  although the vending machine will sell you an unlocked phone if you need one.  Yeah.  But it's nice you know if you're going especially if you travel around a lot and you probably  pick these things up once you get going but this there's no need to be tied in that way  if you if you don't want to be unplugged.  And the other thing was just my following column that came up after that was now they  got back from the trip I was like time to organize all my photos and I don't have a good tip  there I just sort of was expressing pain points on how all our photos are going and there's  so many photos that are out there that I just feel like I want to throw up my hands and  give up.  But instead I'm kind of redoubling my efforts to dive into this stuff and I'm going to try  to explore it a bit more and how to maybe make your photos more manageable and I'm going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to I'm going to I'll help you with that one.  This is a third party service but it's a great service called ever picks.  I've been using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah and that's one of the things I'm exploring although see the problem I run into with ever  picks is Mac but not Android right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well here's here's the thing that I'm doing now and you know no surprise la vida Google  but on my Chromebook pixel this has now just been extended to others.  I put in the SIM card in the pixel you can do this on other Chromebooks now it automatically  uploads the latest photos straight into Google Plus the Google Plus stuff it does all the  auto awesome I can very easily manage them and put them in folders all that kind of stuff  there I'm loving that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The issue is for people like Danny who take pictures on a camera.  You put the SIM card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact one of the things about the Google Plus thing that I get into in the calm was I  really I really love a lot of what it's doing and yet it is difficult that it doesn't automatically  put things into albums and it's generating more photos than I can even handle already  and then I like to have my local copies right.  Let me tell you getting the stuff out of Google Plus is not as easy as you might think  because you either do a Google takeout and when I looked to try to do it it was like a 16  gigabyte file which is a lot to try to download it once or you got to go through 500 photos  at a time tick tick tick tick tick tick I kid you not tick tick tick tick tick tick tick.  So I'm really hopeful that they'll evolve that service because I think it's the closest of  one of the things I'm realizing is I really feel like you need a solution that automatically does  the upload out of your phones because we take so much out of it but I also want some kind of a  system where when I sync my stuff and I put them into albums if I ever want to go into something  else all that stuff does not get locked behind and I don't have the answers to all that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you should continue looking at Everpix.  I know it doesn't have a plug-in for Android phones but it does Picasso Web Albums.  It does Facebook, it does Instagram, it does Twitter, it does Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As is picture life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other benefit that I really like is you're uploading full resolution pictures.  It then gives you a very quick and fast way to review it.  It has flashback which I love which is your pictures from this day in history and since  I've uploaded all my pictures I have 40 or 50,000 pictures on here.  I have a very nice album of stuff going back throughout my history and I think Everpix,  it's not free, I think it's 50 bucks a year or something like that, is a very interesting  solution. This is created by the guy, we had him on triangulation who worked for Cooliris,  remember that great Cooliris which eventually became the Google Gallery, the Android Gallery,  and he also worked on another project that you might recognize and I can't remember the name of  it. This is I think applying a lot of intelligence. They dedupe, you can go back through years,  I can go back to my oldest photos and see them year by year. I think there's a lot to be said

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for this. I've been definitely playing with it more and in fact one of the things I,  and picture life is a very similar service that is more expensive but it has a few more things  like you can handle Android as well but part of me what I'm hoping is that they could somehow  like if Everpix, I wish it could just talk directly to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet you that happens. I really do. Look at the services that they support.  It's a pretty good, including PicasaWeb. Now I think that's the first step in Google and Gmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  by the way. But I'm also wanting to have a service that when I put everything, because I want to come  back and if I do put stuff, well I want it to actually either smart put things into albums and  actually work and that's part of what the highlighting stuff tends to do and then if I  add to it a little bit that'd be great but I just don't want to be locked into anything because  years ago I had Photoshop elements and I used to organize everything and then it was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  five years wasted. It's not going anywhere. Yeah, I use Lightroom and this also will pick up all my  pictures from Lightroom so pretty much everything, every picture I've taken is in here  and they organize by geolocation as well as date. I agree it's a real problem. This is the closest  thing I've seen to a solution for that and I take a lot of pictures. I'll definitely keep  exploring. Yeah, I'm pretty happy with it. I got out of it and then I realized I was kind of,  I needed something. I have a very simple tool that was going to waste more time than you ever  thought possible. If you were suffering a little iPhone, iPad envy because of the great Lauren  Brickter's Dots game, good news, it's now out on Android. You can thank me or curse me later.  Seriously? Dots. Dots. It's simple, beautiful and Lauren is a brilliant programmer and it is a game  that once you start playing you're never going to ever, ever stop playing. I curse you, Leo Laporte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
