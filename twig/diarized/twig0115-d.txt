Hi, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Howdy. How's it going?  It's going great. I love.  We can talk about Apple today, too.  I love it. We can talk about Apple.  And it makes me love my Android phone even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I'll get to that in a second.  That cackle is from the author of Public Parts, Jeff Jarvis, Buzz Machine.com.  The book Public Parts just out now. Everybody must read it.  It's about living life in public, which Jeff does in spades.  To a fault. To a fault.  That's a better phrase than in spades. In spades might be confusing.  There it is. Thank you.  It reminds it home on the coffee table.  It's a coffee table book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My last book made it into Page One, which is the movie about the New York Times.  Yeah. And the way it made it in was that it was David Carr's rest for his wrist.  I saw that. Obviously, unread and unused.  That's hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But somebody must have done that on purpose to as a tip of the hat.  No, a little dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, a little dig, you think?  I think so, yeah.  It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that'd be David Carr's rest rest. I'd do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? Something you want to share with us here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's curmudgeonly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is a curmudgeon. That is true.  That is true.  We are going to watch the entire Apple keynote thanks to Gizmodo.  Are you ready for this? In 80 seconds.  Is the video on here?  The video is by Woody Jang.  Yes, here it is.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I give you 80 seconds.  The entire Apple keynote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My first product launched just 10 years ago.  We launched the original iPod here.  Over 300 million iPods around the world.  The number one smartphone in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cards is an app which lets you create and mail beautiful cards.  I can't wait to talk about that.  It's like a joke.  Your message, reminders, Twitter, newsstand, camera, Game Center, Safari, mail, PC free next week.  iTunes match, find my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of this is part of iCloud.  All that's new inside the new iPhone 4S, a whole new chip, a great new antenna system,  8 megapixel camera with all new optics, 1080p HD video camera, AirPlay, iCloud, everything about iOS 5 and now Siri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am a humble personal assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The most amazing iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  iPhone 3DS for free and iPhone 4.  It's just $99 and the brand new iPhone 4S at $199.  Will be available in a week.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boy, I wish they'd done that version for us because we got up early.  We sat here for hours.  Oh, man, it did feel a little low energy, didn't it?  Even in that where you chopped it and made it into 80 seconds, it felt like it was just kind of dragging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I watched it during the entire thing all morning.  And I was sort of coding and I had heads went on in the background listening to what was going on.  And then I went to lunch and a friend of mine was like, Oh, so what happened at the Apple thing?  And I was like, I'm not really sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watched it. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not sure there's the iPhone 4S and she was like, well, what's that?  And I was like, it's not really different than the four.  Which, you know, I have to say, it's unfair.  I'm really excited about iOS 5.  I'm excited about that.  I think there's some really good new stuff in it.  New cloud, cloud capabilities.  Excited about notifications finally kind of catching up to Android.  And the Siri demo was super cool.  The cards thing was ridiculous, but the Siri demo was really cool.  So I'm excited for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's just do the cards for a second, because that just amazes me.  I was just beside myself.  The postal department is dying.  The stamps are dying.  They're going to keep it alive.  You know, what's next?  I'm Morris Code.  I pigeon.  Geez, I don't I really don't understand it.  It was driving me nuts.  There's tons of straight lines in it, but I didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there are other first of all, there are other programs on the iPhone that do do  this already, including Andy Hertzfeld's.  And the only thing that baffled me is they spent the first 40 minutes rehashing sales  statistics.  The usual.  They always do it, but the 40 minutes is long.  And then the big first announcement is this.  The cards you could print from your iPhone.  I thought this had better get better fast.  This is not a good sign.  My only reason, main reason I bring it up on this show is the chief exciting new features  for iPhone 4S are in every respect something already on Android.  Am I wrong?  Notifications?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's there's iOS 5 and then there's the iPhone 4S.  So we kind of have to, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but you do need the 4S to do the Siri Assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You do for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm yeah, but you're right.  We're talking about software because hardware there is.  In fact, it looks like this camera will be the best camera on a phone except with the  possible exception of the Nokia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was excited about the camera.  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good the good hardware.  And now a better antenna.  Nothing wrong with the old antenna.  Right, right.  Just this one's better.  But this was better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This one's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't want you to think there was anything wrong, but we fixed it.  But I have to say it does feel like Apple is not innovating  in most respects here.  This is the notifications are straight out of Android.  There's a little bit of an additional feature because they're live.  So you could put live weather and livestock in there.  The voice assistant is it.  We don't have it yet, but when we get it, I have to say it sounds a lot like what Android's had  with its voice search for a long time.  I could do most of those things with Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's true.  Although it looks a little more polished.  You know, with the Android voice commands,  you kind of feel like you're speaking to a computer from the demo.  And I haven't tried Siri.  They did make it seem they gave it a little bit of Apple College.  It seems like you're talking to a personal assistant.  And I tell you, I don't know how much I'm actually going to use it.  I was wowed by the demo.  I don't use voice commands on Android very much either.  I just don't drive a whole lot.  I imagine if I did, I probably would.  But yeah, it looks like Apple never does things kind of early and half-assed.  It seems like they come late, but then they add a little extra.  So I think the notifications have that little extra.  Siri looks like it might have a little extra.  But yeah, you're right.  This is all about sort of parity with what Android has had for a while now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Siri thing does some interesting things, for instance, somehow.  And again, this stuff demos so well.  In fact, I use the Android search type, say, you know,  listen to Bob Dylan, Forever Young, and it plays it on Spotify.  That's a great demo.  How often do I do that in real life?  Almost never, unless I'm showing off.  And so these things do make great demos.  But the idea that you could say make an appointment at noon,  and Siri talks back to you, which is something Android doesn't do,  and will say you already have an appointment there, would you like me to move it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a really cool example.  If that works, that's cool.  If that works, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a big if.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm kind of bad to myself running along the water  and telling my phone to reschedule an appointment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing is how often do you really do that?  Really.  How often do you do that?  The A5 processor, I think, is really at a parity only with the Galaxy S2.  The S2's processor is that TI Exynos processor running at 1.2 gigahertz.  The Galaxy S2 has a gig of RAM, which is what we think the iPhone 4S has,  although Apple never says.  It doesn't seem like, and the 8 megapixel camera on the Galaxy S2 is quite good.  Plus it has a bigger Super AMOLED screen.  They're not changing the screen.  In fact, they're not changing the form factor at all, which I think is a huge error  because as everyone knows, people buy new phones because they don't want the old phone.  They don't want to look it looks dated.  You're really right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They should have had fins.  Even new colors or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just put fins on it because then people will have to upgrade.  Now, I read an interesting article that actually makes a lot of sense  that Apple is now slow playing the game.  They are going to release a phone that is an upgrade for the two years old folks.  So this is the iPhone 4 for the 3GS owners.  Next year, they do the iPhone 5 for the iPhone 4 owners.  You see what I'm saying?  Because it's a two year term.  Now, this kind of, I think this could make sense that you slow play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But boy, that shows how backwards the industry is though.  Oh, absolutely.  The phones come out.  The fact that we're imprisoned in two years is just absurd and really hurts the hardware industry.  And Apple should have found a way to beat that down.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the past, they have.  They've upgraded every year, which is still slower than Android.  But maybe they're saying to themselves or maybe their research has shown  that consumers are pissed and say, look, I can't afford to buy a new phone every year.  I will have to buy it every two years when I get that free upgrade.  That's when I want a new phone.  So it's 3GS owners who are now looking.  It'll be iPhone 4 owners who are looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure not motivated to replace my iPhone 4.  There's no reason whatsoever.  It's not enough of an upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the 3G to 3GS parallel, right?  I mean, that took a year and it didn't change as much.  Right.  The 3G to 3GS.  It's changed more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of the changes are, all the changes are under the hood though.  I mean, the phone looks exactly the same.  The only advantage to that, of course, is you can still use all your accessories.  Your cases all fit.  You know, that doesn't change, which I kind of am happy about that.  We do now have a dual core processor.  So that should be a big change under the hood.  Screen is identical.  Here's a great comparison.  This is from thisismynext.com comparing the 4, 4S, and the Galaxy S2.  The screen of the Galaxy S2 is a lower resolution screen, although bigger.  It's 4.3 to 4.5 inches, but only 800 by 480 compared to 960 by 640.  It's not a Retina display.  Now, no 4G on any of the iPhones.  They claim they're faster now on HSPA+.  So maybe they'll have parity.  We'll see.  They should get all of the benefit of the HSPA+, if you have it in your neighborhood.  Global roaming on CDMA?  Yes, because they're using a dual core chip.  That's something that the Sprint and Verizon versions of the Galaxy S2...  Actually, there's no Verizon version.  Let's say the Bionic, which is Verizon's top of the line.  We'll have to see how the camera is, but it looked like the camera might be better on spec.  Certainly it can do things the other cameras in software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is anybody going to buy the phone based on the camera being a skunch better than another  camera on another phone?  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing Apple is moving to is don't buy a point and shoot.  This phone is good enough to be a point and shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fine.  I'm not arguing with liking it.  I don't think they'll upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think it's somewhat of an advantage.  Well, and again, it's very hard to explain.  But for instance, the fact that it's ready to take a picture in 1.1 seconds and it can  take burst mode 0.5 second pictures.  No phone can do that yet.  No camera phone can do that yet.  So that's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Better to go that way than the megapixel fight, which is meaningless.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They even kind of acknowledge that.  Storage is a push across the board.  Wi-Fi is a push.  Siri, you know, this table really isn't fair because as I said, Android has voice to text support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which I use for searches.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say I dictate many text messages because I get tired.  I get really tired.  And the dictation is very good.  If you know how to do it, you have to modify.  You have to speak clearly.  You also have to be alone.  And you have to be alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Standing on the street saying.  Can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I'm sure Siri will have that same problem.  My kids mess with me.  I'll press the button, start the search and Henry will start saying trees, fruit, flies, one, three, seven.  He screws with me every time.  It drives me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And basically, if you have young kids, if you have a baby in the house, it just starts crying randomly.  It's not teenager friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina, I got to ask a question.  How can you legally live in California and not drive much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, it's working at home in California that lets me do that.  My commute is down the hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a short commute, but I still drive a lot, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Siri assistant struck me as more akin to a parallel to voice commands versus voice to text.  It seemed less like a dictation tool and more like a command.  Well, we have commands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can say listen to, we can say navigate to.  I can say send an email.  I can say send a text.  I mean, this is Android.  Android has, I would say, 80% of this functionality.  It's the talk back to me stuff that is different.  And we'll just have to see how well that works before we do.  The Siri takes great dictation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, John.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the things they showed, again, as if they'd invented it, is on the keyboard.  There's a little microphone button.  There's a microphone.  And you press it and you can dictate.  And I kind of say-  Very familiar.  Apple is suing Samsung over copying Apple.  Samsung's already made noise that they may try to stop the 4S because it looks just like Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they're going after them, supposedly, in France,  which is kind of hilarious to pick that battleground too, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's good for, look, cross-pollination is good for us.  So I'm not complaining at all.  I just think that Apple kind of acts as if they invented this all, and it's not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, the other thing too is that I use, because I carry the iPhone now,  I use Google voice on the iPhone in Google search.  Right.  Right, so it doesn't matter whether Apple has it or not.  I'm using Google's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in any event, I think the thing that's very clear here is that  Apple did not up the ante so much that the hot top-of-the-line Android phones  are going to be threatened.  You know, we're going to see the Nexus Prime next Thursday, right, Eileen, or next Tuesday?  Next Tuesday.  So it will be, the Android Nexus Prime will be out before the iPhone is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then they've already made clear with it, with a fairly dramatic form factor, right?  There's a lot of interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eileen, who does all about Android, produces the show, is on the board right now.  Can you, that's who the disembodied voice is,  because I don't think we have a camera on her.  But Eileen, what are people saying the Nexus Prime will include?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're not quite sure.  The teaser video that they posted, and I can see if you can go to that, Leo.  I'll pull it up.  Yeah, let's see that.  That's pretty cool.  There's a real curve to it, and there's something on top of it.  And so there's sort of theories that it might be a tablet and phone, or not quite sure.  I mean, we know it's ice cream sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the other thing, it's ice cream sandwich.  Do we know how much new stuff is an ice cream sandwich?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're talking about slight modifications to the app drawer.  Sorry about this white screen.  It's going to look very much like honeycomb.  Oh, you're not seeing the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the video. I got it right here.  Something big is coming, says Samsung.  This is on YouTube.  I don't think they'll mind us playing it.  Gina and Jeff, a better plan.  Wine, candles, a better moment.  Another perfect combination is just around the corner.  Get ready for it.  Something big is coming.  That's it?  Even that.  Wait a minute.  Holy camole.  By the way, this looks a little bit like what we were thinking.  Let me pause it.  We were thinking that the iPhone 5 might be, it may still be next June, curved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's even more curved.  It starts to make sense.  It's curved like your face.  Very thin.  Wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when you throw it, it comes back to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Eileen, who's going to carry it again?  Sorry, I stepped on your punch line, Leo.  That was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, Google's streaming at youtube.com slash Android.  So they'll be streaming at 1130.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung currently sells to everybody.  You can get the Galaxy to us on everybody except Verizon,  and that's only because they've got the Bionic, which is very comparable.  I think they reasonably didn't want to muddy the waters.  I think the big question mark is how good is ice cream sandwich going to be?  How much improvement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, here's what I...  I had lunch, as you know, two weeks ago with Bradley Horowitz,  and he told me nothing of note, but I got the impression that it's going to be a big step,  and it's going to be a big step for the kinds of things that Google can do with it.  That when you look at Google Plus and other things like that,  that I think ice cream sandwich will have so many new hooks in it for both Google and for outside developers.  Of things you can do, just neat stuff you can do, and so it's in advance of that form.  So what's more important is the software or the hardware,  and if you can get both at once, is that going to beat iPhone to the iPhone 5?  Here's Andy Rubin posting on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Andy, for finally posting on Google Plus.  When we launched Android in 2007, we asked some kids if they had a magic phone, what would it do?  And then notice at the end he says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  If I had a magic phone, it would take me to the moon.  Imagine doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, I think we can eliminate that as a rumor for...  Well, no, no, not the Google guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Google guys want to go to the moon, so it makes perfect sense to me.  Ice cream sandwich.  The first...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The first phone on the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would turn into underpants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, I think that Andy is steering us a little astray here.  I don't think it's going to turn into underpants.  That's a cute thing, how it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kids saying that they really want their phone to make ice cream for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Imagine doing it with my cupcakes with sprinkles.  Uh...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would turn into underpants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It would go super duper fast.  Those are the wings.  Help animals feel better.  And make me into an astronaut.  And have peanut butter sandwiches.  Buzz, give me a sandwich, please.  So, make cookies.  And a hundred vanillas.  And a thousand vanillas.  It would take pictures.  Fit in my pocket and have a keyboard.  Oh, just big.  It sounds like ding.  Ding ding ding.  Beep beep.  Beep beep beep beep.  Choo choo choo choo.  Ring ring ring.  It would get me anything I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What will your phone do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ice cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting.  Ice cream at the end is exactly what...  I like that that's a plug for the Open Handset Alliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  You know, Android itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this goes back to 2007 before the G1 was even out.  So, that's Andy's best indication of what ice cream a sandwich will do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, there'll be a voice command, pseudo make me a sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I like it.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I figured the iPhone 4S would come with eye tongue  so it could lick your stamps on your cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that just really retro?  That it's that and they made such a big deal out of it  as if you've been waiting for your phone to send greeting cards for many years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I've been involved with the postal department on and off  in thinking strategy.  This thing called Postal Vision 2020 was a conference that I helped put together.  And we had Vint Cerf speak.  We also had the head of the Postal Regulatory Commission, Ruth Goldway,  who did a little kind of boxing match over issues with Vint.  And she was sitting up there saying that really we should find a way  to get kids to get back into greeting cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would help.  That would save the postal service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Easy.  I said next.  Now that Apple saved the postal service, next it'll start a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As long as we're talking Android, we should mention that there is a big security flaw  in HTC, the most recent HTC phones, including the Evo Evo 3D.  We believe the Sensation, a number of others.  HTC put some logging software on their phone with an update  and it turns out those log files, very extensive log files,  are available to anybody.  Not only that, you can get a privilege escalation very easily.  HTC says we're working on it.  We're going to fix it.  There's another security flaw on, it happens to be just the Galaxy S2 on AT&T.  If the phone has a lock code, you turn the phone on, you see the lock code,  you let it go back to sleep, then turn it on again, no lock code.  So I'm sure they'll fix that as well.  I think we should just be fair.  That's one thing Apple has going for it.  There have not been a lot of security exploits on the iPhone.  I think there is a legitimate, let me ask you this, Gina.  Do you think it's a legitimate perception that Android is a little more risky than the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do.  I do, actually.  I think that it's a legitimate perception to say that it's more secure and less secure.  By virtue of being open source and having the ability for third parties like HTC  to build a layer on top of it, it opens up a little more risk  because all the code isn't closed and completely vetted by Google.  So in one way, it's more secure because there are more eyes on it.  And in other ways, it opens up more risk.  So I kind of take it like it balances out in the end.  This security flaw, this HTC security flaw really bummed me out  because these apps are just asking for permission to connect to the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it, and they get everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, which basically every app asks for.  And it's one of the lowest security, I mean, you know,  if this isn't personal data and it gets access to this log.  And this log is generated by the HTC layer that goes on top of the Android core.  So it was a bummer.  And I think that because of the press that Android security vulnerabilities get,  I think that there is a perception that the Android is less secure,  similar to the way that Windows would seem less secure or sort of malware-laden  as compared to the Mac.  But I don't think that's actually the truth.  I think that, like I said, I think that the benefit of open source is more eyes.  So a little more security as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, given the choice between open and closed source,  I will always go open source, even though there's maybe some perceived chance.  And the other problem is I think there's this feeling that  because Apple vets everything, it's safer, or Amazon vets everything, it's safer.  You cannot do that good a job of vetting.  You cannot, unless you have the source code and you spend a good deal of time with it,  you can't say with any assurance that there's not malicious software in there.  You just have to hope.  Exactly.  So Apple is not making it more secure by approving all the software.  I think that's a myth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep, I agree.  I don't know if it was an enlistment or not,  but Google paid $100,000 to get people to go and reward them for finding bugs.  And it's clearly economical.  I mean, that's not even a headcount, especially not for them.  That's a good point.  That's not even one person.  You know, not far from it.  And I think that crowdsourcing that, being open so you can do it, makes a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And as somebody pointed out, as long as there is a kill switch on both phones, which there is,  that if a malicious app is discovered, it can be terminated remotely,  which they can and has happened, at least on Android.  That's the most important thing.  Because this stuff does out.  It doesn't, it's only a day or two before you people, researchers or whoever,  start seeing strange activity on the phone and say, hey, wait a minute, hold on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. This is a huge community.  Right.  So these switches are in place and there's a huge community of people watching and using  this platform.  Right. So there are no known apps that are taking advantage of this HCC flaw.  But as soon as one becomes, the flaw is there and it was discovered, but no apps,  no one apps are taking advantage of it.  The moment that an app does start to take advantage of it, it will get killed.  People are watching now, right?  Because people know.  Let me ask you a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Go ahead, Jeff.  The kill switch, who has the authority to pull it?  The manufacturer or the telco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in Apple's case, Apple.  Okay. What about?  Android's case, I believe everybody, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the market.  From what I understand, it's the market.  So Google.  So Google.  Yeah. So Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is more comfortable than an Egyptian telco with Mubarak in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. I think that's really important.  And there have been exploits on both platforms.  We haven't yet seen anything really horrible.  It's just a matter of time.  I feel like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, Apple had that problem where they were logging location data for a long amount of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably for similar reasons as HTC.  Apple's had to use the kill switch in the past.  Apple's had to have had a login issue with the security code logins.  So I mean, there's nothing perfect.  So I think maybe it's a fool's paradise to assume that, oh, my system's safe.  Even BlackBerry, which is famous for its security,  it's not safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no system is perfectly and absolutely secure.  This is just a different approach.  Right.  Apple takes a little bit more top-down approach.  Google takes a more depending on the community, peer-to-peer kind of approach.  And I think both work to some degree.  And sometimes there are problems.  There are vulnerabilities.  But the question is how quickly are they addressed and how are they addressed?  And are the mechanisms in place to address them quickly and fairly?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're watching This Week in Google.  Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, Leo Laporte.  We're going to talk about Motorugal.  There's Motorugal in the news.  But before we do, I'd like to talk about carbonite.com, the right way to back up.  Because it's automatic and it's off-site and you need it.  And if you're not using it, you better get on over to carbonite.com right now  and sign up for the two-week free trial.  They have two versions, by the way.  A home version, which allows you to back up everything on your internal drive on single computer.  That's for $59, by the way, for less than $5 a month.  And then there's a business version for people who have multiple computers, multiple drives.  And that you pay basically for the amount of data you store.  You could try them free right now if you go to carbonite.com.  Automatic backup, completely secure, 128-bit SSL uploading.  You control the encryption keys if you want to encrypt so it's safe there.  It is cloud storage.  So you can log on to your carbonite account on any computer,  on your smartphone, on your Android phone, your tablet.  And there's your stuff.  You can download it, put it on your system.  It restores a snap if disaster happens.  Your data is always protected.  That's what I am looking for in a backup solution.  Try it free for two weeks.  Go to carbonite.com and use the offer code TWIG.  If you decide to buy, use TWIG again and you'll get two months free.  14 months for the price of $12.  Carbonite, you got to back it up to get it back, please.  Don't be one of those people who calls me.  I get these calls every week on the radio show.  Leo, my hard drive just crashed and I don't have a backup.  What do I do?  You know, it's hard not to go, I told you, back it up.  Carbonite.com, offer code TWIG.  There's no excuse.  It happens to actually, this is one that happens a lot.  It seems to happen with iPhone users more.  Somebody called me and said, my dog just died.  I said, oh, I'm so sorry.  He said, well, I have all these pictures of the dog on my iPhone.  And the iPhone died too.  And I said, oh, I'm sorry, but you were syncing regularly, right?  He said, no.  So you mean you don't have a backup of what's on your iPhone?  No, it's all on the iPhone.  And I felt so terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that, I mean, Apple's smart.  When you plug in the iPhone, it backs it up immediately.  There's nothing comparable on the, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When I'm in a rush, iPhoto starts up and it takes forever.  And I kill it all the time.  You say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you don't do it every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm a very impatient man, Leo.  I'm very busy.  I have places to go, people to see.  I can't wait around for this.  Well, with iCloud, you won't have to wait.  You'll get to tell me I told you so very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, what do you use?  I use titanium on the Android, but I have to root it.  And the nice thing about titanium backup,  and highly recommended if you haven't used it,  if you have a rooted Android phone,  is it not only backup backs up all your apps,  it backs up all your settings.  So when you do a titanium restore,  it says, say you have to refresh the phone  or put a new ROM on it.  It all comes back and all the passwords are still there,  all the settings.  Isn't that great?  I love it.  Titanium backup.  Do we lose, Gina?  Did she rush off to download it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She froze.  She ran off to install it.  I was trying to elegantly recall her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which you did to me earlier, Eileen.  I appreciate the elegance of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, all this is happening behind the scenes.  It's blowing my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was suddenly off the air,  then I was back on in an instant.  I said, wow, Eileen is so smooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's good.  You have to be like an octopus at that TD dance.  She's very good at it.  There we go.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, Skype beachballed on me.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You must be using a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am.  Pinwheel beachball.  I know.  I hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The blue screen is a beachball of death.  Hey, at least it's happier.  Right.  So it hypnotizes you.  I'm hypnotized.  Motorugal.  Google has said, and this is Eric Schmidt talking  in an interview on Bloomberg TV,  that they are going to make handsets with Motorola  if the acquisition goes through,  but that other manufacturers should have nothing to fear.  Oh, I'm sure that'll reassure them.  The Android ecosystem, says Eric Schmidt,  is the number one priority,  and we won't do anything with Motorola or anybody else,  by the way, that would screw up the dynamics of that industry.  Well, that makes sense.  We need strong, hard competition among all the Android players.  We will not play favorites.  Well, wait a minute now.  Eric is so good at this.  Okay, listen carefully.  We will not play favorites in the way people are concerned about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  However, in ways you'd never thought of.  We'll figure out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, well, here's an example.  One of the ways Google plays favorites is hidden API calls, right?  We know they're hidden API calls that are not published.  They're not public, but Google uses them.  So that's playing favorites.  But people aren't concerned about it because they don't know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, play fast forward.  You're going to get, presumably it goes through and all that,  and everything's well, it's not a big deal.  Play fast forward five years,  and the next time Eric Schmidt's sitting before Senate again.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We didn't play favorites in the way you're concerned about.  He says, from our perspective on the patent issue,  we will end up having enough patents that we can end up with a rough truce with everybody else.  This is huge, which is how it's done.  That's been the pattern in all other industries.  I expect something similar in ours.  We're actually very happy with Motorola.  The fact they also had one of the best patent portfolios  was certainly a component of our decision, but not the only one.  So he's basically saying we bought them for the handsets, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I just wish that he would have said,  we bought them for a defensive patent portfolio.  Our priority is protecting Android,  and the patents had everything to do with that.  And, oh, yeah, sure, we'll have a little subsidiary  that makes handsets, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish he'd said that, too, but he's being honest.  That's Eric's flaw, isn't it?  You think that's it?  I think Eric's, when Eric talks, I don't think, I think he's not,  he's not as adept as one would hope, or as one would expect for a chairman of the board at spinning.  Is he? He's not a good spinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes and no.  I think the problem is that he presumes the world is too smart.  He cuts ahead on things.  I get it.  I actually think he's, I actually think he's not a bad spinner.  Yeah, he has his, you know, Schmittarian quotes that amuse us all.  And he, as he said to me, it's death by Twitter.  Yeah, that's an issue.  But I think that in a way he does, you know, he has a way, it's rather professorial.  When people say, is Google too big?  He's intellectual.  And he says, well, who would you want to run it?  Also the government, right?  It's very Socratic method.  He doesn't just cut with a line.  He tries to push you into your own logic.  That's why I guess I'm trying to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That makes, actually, that's great.  I think that's a little googly, right?  Very, very.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very much so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I like that about Google.  Everything's a puzzle.  Yeah, but I, but I guess I'm an intellectual too.  So I, you know, I kind of like that.  I hate the, I hate spin.  I don't want to be spun.  And I love the Socratic method.  Make me think Eric, make me think.  What is PhoneGap, Gina Trapani?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  PhoneGap is a, a wrapper for mobile operating systems to run HTML5 web-based apps as native  apps, basically.  So it lets you build an HTML5 JavaScript CSS app and then bundle it up with PhoneGap.  And then suddenly you've got an app that you can deliver through the Android market,  install natively on Android and on iPhone, and I believe probably other mobile operating  systems, maybe even, maybe even Windows and BlackBerry, if I'm not mistaken.  So it's a really good way.  It's a kind of right wants get a native app on any mobile OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It works with Dreamweaver.  So this kind of makes sense because Dreamweaver is an Adobe product.  Adobe just bought them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, smart move.  Smart move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Gina question.  If, if, self-serving question.  If we were to teach journalists who want to stay around longer certain technologies and  one that would allow them to do essential development, probably knowing they're the  content business, what do we teach them?  HTML5, Java?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God, I would hope you wouldn't have to be a developer if you're going to be a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree, but there's a push on that.  There are people who want to create Frankenstein monsters and that that's what we need.  I've fought it hard.  I've said, no, no, no, no, no.  You're the boss.  You're the one who specs and you get somebody to do it for you.  But it's so hard to find development talent now.  And there's a push.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think if you're a journalist, look, I'll give you a strong argument.  Look at TechCrunch.  It runs on WordPress.  I think if you're a journalist, focus, stick to your knitting.  Focus on what you do, which is journalism.  There's a content management, a canned content management system out there that you can use.  There's Drupal.  I mean, maybe I don't know, Gina.  I won't speak for Gina.  She's an actual developer, but I just think that's a lot to say, oh, learn HTML5.  I think if anything, learn, you know, find a content management system you like and can work with.  But I don't think you need to learn HTML5.  Gina, am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I see your point.  I mean, my answer is absolutely going to be learn web technologies.  Don't learn, you know, system OS specific technologies.  So I would have said HTML5 and JavaScript.  But then again, I mean, it depends.  What are you trying to teach your students?  I mean, are you trying to teach them to innovate, right?  To come up with new ways to present content and new ways to interact with content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, it's not always content, by the way.  It can be services.  It can be things that work with people.  And what I really have learned, I have to teach them is how to prototype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  You want to teach them how to spec and prototype and how to work with developers to make those  things happen.  But I agree with Leo and I think it's probably unrealistic to ask journalists to both create  content and then create the tools that deliver that content.  I think data visualization is really important and huge.  Really important.  So I think journalists, young, upcoming journalists and bloggers should know the Google  charts API really well and be able to come up, you know, create charts based on data  sets that are freely available.  In fact, we have a story about some smartphone data that we'll get to at some point.  So I think that kind of thing is super important.  But yeah, I think you're right.  Rapid prototyping and then communicating with development teams.  Hey, you know, I worked at Gawker for years.  We had an in-house tech team that wound up building out our own CMS.  I mean, because we were trying to innovate in this space.  I mean, WordPress is great, but I know that TechCrunch and GigaOM, they have kind of custom  plugins built for that stuff too.  So if you're just looking at published content, yeah, an available CMS right off the shelf,  totally going to work.  But if you want to teach your students to innovate and come up with new ways to deal  with that content or deal with services, then yeah, I think it's about rapid prototyping  and communicating with developers to create those things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kevin Marx also says in the chat room, and he's right, the other thing that we have the  challenge to teach, I didn't mean to go off on this event, but is data journalism.  That's what I think.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And really understanding that.  I think you have a limited scope.  I mean, you can only learn so much, right?  So your primary thing is to become a good journalist.  But in learning to be a good journalist in the modern era, you also have to learn things  like how to dig through data, how to use data, how to visualize data.  I don't think you should worry so much about how to present what you're doing or how to  create a platform for what you're doing.  I would hope that there'd be people who specialize in that that you could work with.  Right?  I mean, there's only some.  I'll partly also say that from my own experience because, you know, what we look for, what I'm  always looking for is a person who can be a journalist and understand technology.  And that's far and few between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's weird that we have students who are constantly pressuring us to teach them more  technology.  And so I'm trying to unfreeze myself and figure out what that might be.  You see me right now and contemplate.  It's contemplative, Jeff.  I think it's very hard and can talk at the same time.  It's really quite a skill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, now I'm frozen.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I mean, boy, it's, you know, who knows?  It's a whole brave new world for not just journalists, but for any kid going to college  right now.  And so I don't think it hurts to know technology, but not everybody's going to have a, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of where Jake is.  Jake Jake is thinking now not of majoring in computer science because he kind of thinks,  well, I kind of know enough to make some stuff and branch out and he's taking poli sci and.  Good on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And.  I mean, my son's interested in music.  And of course, what is he learning?  Electronic music.  So technology might be the, you know, the, the, the canvas for a lot of stuff that you do.  But I, but I do also think there's some people who just don't take to technology.  And I'd hate to think that those people won't have a place in the future.  True.  That's scary.  There's got to be a Picasso out there who just wants to put paint on canvas, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he used an iPad, but like, you don't know it.  Actually, I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Would he be using Photoshop to, to mangle ears and clocks and things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think so, but I, but it would be my best guess, but I don't know.  I think that he was very tactile.  Ah, true.  I don't know.  That's a good question.  A lot of artists that I know are working with their hands.  And this is not working with your hands, whatever it is.  It's working with your noggin, maybe.  Would Picasso use a Whac-A-M?  We'll have to ask.  You know who wrote a book on Picasso's eye on a Stasinopolis Huffington?  She could tell us.  Really?  Yeah.  She wrote a very big bio and not a very good one, but a very big bio of Picasso.  That's the, that's when I met her.  Really?  Before she was a Huffington.  Oh, she was a Stasinopolis.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sometimes I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That took us way off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes it's just not good to know stuff.  Gingerbread has a growth spurt.  38.2% of all devices now are running Gingerbread.  This is actually very good news.  You still see Android 2.1.  You still see a little sliver of 1.5 and 1.6.  But now I would say almost 75% of all phones are running at least Froyo.  45% Froyo.  38.2% Gingerbread.  And Honeycomb total of less than 2%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Gingerbread Man has hit puberty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, he's had a growth spurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  His voice is changing.  His dog is like this.  Fuzz on the chin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then just as soon as he gets comfortable with his new hair,  ice cream sandwich comes along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Smashed by the sandwich.  Smushed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He got smushed by the sandwich.  No, but this is a big problem, I have to say.  And this is one thing that Apple just doesn't have to worry about.  How many versions?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,  eleven versions of Android out there?  At least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a lot of versions.  And it's a pain in the rear for developers to make sure that your app is compatible across all of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's put it this way.  More phones have cupcake and donut on them than have Honeycomb on them.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's terrible.  And people with cupcake and donut can't do nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Eclair is 11%.  That's Android 2.1.  That's just a problem.  And I kind of blame the handset manufacturers.  I think that's exactly why Google bought Motorola is to say, look, dudes,  you can't, you can't, I don't know.  Maybe they don't have enough horsepower.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that really their fault?  Or is it the architecture?  They don't have a choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's an open handset alliance, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's going to be an 18-month turnaround.  From here on in, basically, they said that if you're going to have the Google logo on your  handset, you've got to update over 18 months.  So that's reasonable.  I actually think that that's an interesting point that you made, Leo, is that Motorola  always has the latest update to Android.  That's a little bit of a motivation for everyone else to catch up sooner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's OK.  That's I think that's where Eric's weasel words come from.  We may do things that you wouldn't conceive.  One would be just make sure that Motorola handsets always have the latest version of  Android on them, which just means you got to do it too, or you're going to be lost.  And that is kind of anti-competitive, but it's really not.  It's just pushing people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not as long as everybody else can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could do it, exactly.  Yeah.  So one thing that the iPhone 4S did not have, no surprise, NFC.  Google Wallet is according to PayPal.  Of course, PayPal might have a little ox to fry in this.  They filed a lawsuit against Google and two former PayPal executives who were in charge  of mobile payments at Google, saying misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of fiduciary duty,  those allegations were thrown out.  But it does tell you that PayPal is kind of a little nervous, I guess, about Google Wallet.  I don't think they need to worry so much.  It's going to be a while before NFC takes off.  There's only one Google phone on one carrier that supports it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Should Google buy, should somebody, who should buy Square?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Square, you know, and this is another company that says, forget NFC,  Square is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then what they have instead, though, is taking through the infrastructure of being a merchant and  exchange and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  They're building an infrastructure that could conceivably.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whatever the hardware, it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Article on Business Insider says that strippers are now using Square.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, there was a great column today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it was, oh, God, it was a Politico.  Female reporter went to a strip bar in Washington to look at what the implications of the end of the  dollar bill and the.  Oh, my God.  Do they have Square down there?  Small.  The problem is that how do you even put Square in a garter belt?  It's easy to swipe.  The guy at the strip club said that he's collected millions of single dollar bills over the years.  And so it's been there.  Yeah, and you don't want to know where those bills have been either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.  Kindle pre-orders, according to a leaked report, were very strong.  Ninety five thousand in the first day.  Amazon, according to this sales report that was leaked to Cult of Android,  has sold a quarter of a pre-order, a quarter of a million fires in five days.  That's pretty good.  Pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not it, not iPad 2 sales pace.  iPad 2 sold 2.5 million in the first month.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The first month since it was available.  It's close, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'd be one and a half million in a month.  So that's pretty close.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't have the cult thing.  Reminds me, Leo, I was thinking about this today.  Just a slight diversion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, no, divert away because I'm bored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not a good sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've got to step it up, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if I'm bored, I can tell you the audience is bored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't want me to spice it up.  I'm at the creepy line all the time.  I live on the creepy line.  He lives on the creepy line.  Where was it going?  Oh, it occurred to me that I couldn't ever imagine this week at Amazon.  No, although.  And Amazon's an important company.  They're doing a lot of amazing things.  But what is it about the brand and position of Amazon that just obviates that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just don't have enough interesting like consumer,  product interesting to consumers to talk about.  Although I think probably developers, engineers would be interested in a lot of the services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can talk about S3, EC2, kind of infrastructure, enterprise.  You could do an Amazon Deal of the Day show or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In a sense, Gina, they talk to consumers as consumers  more than Facebook or Google or Android.  Pardon me.  I mean, right.  I mean, I'm not pushing for it.  I don't think it would work either.  But it's weird that Amazon never saw itself in that position of having a direct relationship,  I think, with having a having a bond of brand with its people.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's basically Amazon is a shopping tool.  It's a cash register, essentially.  I mean, the Kindle is just going to be another thing that they sell on the site.  And I have to say, I think that the sales are going to go a lot higher once it is available.  Well, maybe that's not true because it's on the front page of Amazon.com now.  But just the power of being of the promotion throughout the Amazon.com site is so powerful  because people go to Amazon to shop and spend money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And when I did, I'm sure the other reason it didn't sell huge.  It sold huge, but it's not going to have that same kind of sales.  The iPad, obviously, is it is the opposite of an early adopters device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Start aside from you, Leo.  Anyone who has an iPad, I don't see any reason to buy.  And I want one, too, because it's a toy.  No, I don't see any reason to buy a fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't need both.  And I actually said I don't think it's going to hurt the iPad too badly.  But I do think there's a fraction of the potential new iPad owners  who will buy a Kindle Fire instead.  Yeah, I agree with all that.  But I'm saying you're not going to have a rush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not going to be this huge.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  I think that, in fact, it probably doesn't hurt iPad until the next iPad's out.  Right.  I mean, I would say everybody who wants an iPad is probably bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think there's going to be a seven inch iPad?  No.  Steve's legacy will live on.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there might be a 10 inch fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, you know, they made the Kindle DX, which was such a specialty device.  It didn't do that well because people didn't want a big clunky thing.  In fact, you might make the case that the fire is too big and heavy, as is,  you know, the backlit color, heavy.  It's not a good reader compared to the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's another question for you.  So ice cream sandwich comes out and let's say it does have lots of things,  but you're not going to get it on the fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you won't.  That's right.  Because it's not Android.  It just right.  They never said Android.  They never said Google.  By the way, I've just learned Android now has an app for printing postcards.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  They've had one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They've had one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even in this Apple stole postcard on the run.  Design and mail real postcards from your Android device.  There it is, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's one of many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have one family member, a cousin in New York, who is not online at all.  And what I want from iOS is just to automatically prompt me for a photo  to send her a card through that app once a year for her birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that a good idea?  That's what it should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For that one person who you actually still send send card.  I mean, does everybody have one?  Do you guys send cards?  Twit sends Christmas cards.  Yes, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I wouldn't do it for my iPhone.  It's a long list.  It'd take a little while.  No, I think I'm not going to send cards.  My mother would I send a card to my mom?  Happy birthday, mom?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't do cards.  My in-laws do them, but they're always those flowery ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My mom even, who is 77.  Actually, she'll be 79 next January.  My mom sends e-greetings.  She just skipped the year, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How'd she do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, she was born in 33.  I'm doing the math.  She said she's 77.  No, I thought she was 77.  She's actually 78.  She'll be 79 next year.  OK.  She sends e-greetings.  She hasn't sent a...  Well, maybe she sends my kids physical cards.  You know who sends physical cards?  Grandmothers to grandkids.  And they put a dollar bill in there.  And that's the only people.  And they can't do that with an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's true.  So that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  PayPal.  PayPal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I send mom for her birthday?  I send her an electronic greeting from Netflix  that says, happy birthday.  Here's another year of Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And mom used the code to get a free month at Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep.  And frankly, that's the card.  It's not made up.  It's true.  You know, I started this when Netflix was just DVDs.  I started this with maybe five, six years ago.  She did not have a DVD player.  So for that birthday...  I think for that Christmas, because her birthday is January 2nd.  So for that Christmas, I sent her a TV that had a built-in DVD player.  And then I got her.  On January 2nd, I sent her a year's end of Netflix.  I have to say, last year she said, honey,  because Netflix raised their price, it's only going to go for nine months.  But you know what?  I don't want the discs anymore.  I'm just going to do the streaming.  And now it's like 18 months.  So it's only $7.99 a month.  Actually, it's a really cheap present for my mom.  And it gives and gives and gives because she watches movies like crazy.  Netflix is fantastic.  Great movies.  I missed Elegy last year, the Philip Roth novel,  the Ben Kingsley and Penelope Cruz.  Very good movie.  Really enjoyed that.  I was watching that last night.  Swingers.  That's a great voice.  That classic movie.  Whoa.  What happened?  I open a new tab.  See, that is a Netflix app in Chrome, which I really like.  You can also watch Netflix.  Of course, besides watching it on your computer,  on your iPad, your Android phone, all the Android phones now.  They basically roll it out to everybody.  All the tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think except for those that have cupcake or dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're running a Claire, sorry, you're out of luck.  Get a new phone.  It's worth it just for this.  Good Will Hunting, The Office.  Oh, see, and you see 30 Rock in Office, new episodes.  And this is all instant and unlimited and just $7.99 a month.  When I say it that way, you're probably thinking $799 a month  because it's worth that much.  But no, $7.99 a month for Netflix.  If you're already a Netflix member, just check it out.  If you're not, try it out for a month free, Netflix.com slash  Twitter.  Do share this with your friends and family.  Make sure they use the, oh, some new Woody Allen movies  just coming in Netflix.com slash twit.  Give it a try today.  You know, I think with this new Galaxy S2, the big four and a half  inch screen, I bet you Netflix would look pretty good on there.  Pretty good.  The camera is great on that phone.  Oh, my goodness.  You love that camera on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was just saying I've watched Netflix videos on my phone  and it looks great.  Yeah.  It's just gorgeous.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's that super AMOLED screen.  It's not all resolution Apple.  Sometimes it's just deep, rich color hashtags on Google+.  Did you see that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought about Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm very happy.  It's I always remind myself just a specialized form of search.  And in fact, Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong, but the hashtag  there doesn't it doesn't turn into a link if you put a hashtag  on your post, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  And yeah, I mean, it's kind of weird.  It needs to go a little bit farther.  But I think it's so important to do.  I do.  You know, I wrote a piece this week that Occupy Wall Street  is the first hashtag revolt.  People gathered around.  People are frustrated because it doesn't have clear demands  and a clear spin.  But that's the point of it.  No one owns it.  It's the first really distributed revolt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what you do is you type hash Occupy Wall Street in your search  and then you get all of the...  All streets spelled out, I hope.  Oh, golly.  Let me do that right.  Actually, both worked.  So both work and OWS works too, which is...  Yeah, Google's doing something interesting with this.  They're obviously parsing it a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And of course, you can save the search and then start to follow  that search.  Oh, I like that.  Yeah, well, up at the top, it'll let you save it.  Save.  So it becomes a spark.  Now spark is a mix of news and conversation.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's nice.  So is this...  I don't understand how...  So is this... is this just regular search?  Is this just people using hashtags and then Google...  People using hashtags.  Search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty much it.  So it isn't a feature that's been added?  Not yet.  Not really.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.  So Twitter's culture is coming over to Google+.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it that Google, instead of using at, used plus.  It's just... it's like...  When Google first came around, we actually used this...  John C. Dvorak would use this as a way to test somebody's text savvy.  He'd say, what do you use to search?  And if they said Alta Vista, he'd go...  And if they said Google, he'd go...  And it's like, what's your email address?  AOL.com or Gmail.com?  You know, it's like that.  Well, hey, what's your handle?  Plus Gina Trippani?  Or at.  At Gina Trippani?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still love Twitter, though.  And the at really goes back to IRC, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, or Gmail itself, right?  Email itself.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.  The space in Google+, to express your handle in the outside world,  because there's a space in it, is a little weird.  I'm glad they have a space.  The space is great, but it's not how we...  We killed spaces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is...  I almost don't even want to report the story, but I will from CNET.  Google managements, public use of Google+, no posts ever, all of the yellow people here.  Red, no account at all.  Active green, minimal use blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a pretty...  This is a good looking chart, and I love how they use the Google colors in the chart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Vic Gundotra, of course, is published 150 times.  Sundar Pichai of Chrome, 58 times.  Those are the top two.  But then there's all sorts of people, including Eric Schmidt.  Never.  Never has posted.  He doesn't even have an account on Google+, as far as we know.  Larry Page has posted seven times.  Andy Rubin, eight times.  Sergey Brin, 15 times.  Don't you think they should be forced to eat their own dog food?  Or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who forces them?  They're the bosses.  Oh, good point.  No one forces them.  It's an interesting reflection.  I think that this just kind of proves that social is not in Google's original DNA,  and in the DNA of upper management.  It sounded like this...  I think that the push towards social came from the bottom.  And actually, the story behind it is that there was this big meeting  where people got together in little groups and brainstormed.  And this one engineer, kind of low-level engineer,  kind of had this huge rant about Facebook and social and how important it was.  And then I think Vic heard that and asked the engineer to stand up and tell the whole room.  So I think it kind of came from the bottom.  And I think the fact that the executives don't use Google+,  with the exception of Vic and Bradley, is kind of reflective of that.  Also, they're busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, here's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you don't have anything to do, they have something to do.  We're just sitting around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the problem for them.  Lawyers would probably have to read what they wrote.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Life is kind of different, I think, when you're at that level of the company.  I know. That's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it is sad.  But then again, if you're the Mark Benioff kind of in the world or people like that,  then you just say what you think.  Right.  If Google were a little more human in that way, it wouldn't be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just see that Larry Ellison fired Mark Benioff from the keynote today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then Benioff did the keynote across the street.  At the hotel.  And by the way, thank you, Mark, plugged public party.  Did he really? At his talk?  Awesome.  At the same time today, we had Mark Zuckerberg insisting, I use Facebook all day.  That was a story that was out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe he does.  Why don't?  Why wouldn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He posts public posts to his profile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He does now. You can follow him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you can.  I subscribed to him. He posted the other day.  I just celebrated my 10,000th day alive.  So I looked up and I've had 20,030 days alive.  I missed my 20,000th day alive.  It was September 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you regain your time lost when you left Facebook?  Time lost?  Didn't you leave Facebook entirely?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. No, none of that was preserved.  It was gone.  That's all gone.  Oh, why? I don't care about that.  There wasn't that much stuff up there.  I am trying to figure out because I did set up the timeline.  There's a little hack.  You make yourself a developer, set up an app and you can have a timeline.  So I did set up the timeline.  I actually really like it, which means which tells me it's going to be a flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because we like buzz.  Yeah, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buzz wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it, which means that normal people will hate it.  But I just think it's so cool.  It puts together all your activities and people.  And so you can now start to I showed you this last time.  I put my baby pictures in.  But I'm trying to figure out how to put other stuff in there.  And I haven't quite figured it out.  But I actually want to spend a few hours just filling out this timeline.  That just shows how what a nerd I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you're a digital scrapbooker, Leo.  It is. It's digital scrapbooking.  It totally is.  You need some sparkles and some cutout hearts, foam hearts to stick in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We need a Google plus convention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, what they need is stickers and stamps.  They should really do that.  I guess they stopped doing this.  Remember, you could buy virtual gifts for like real money.  Yeah.  To people on Facebook.  That's gone, isn't it?  I think so.  They ought to bring that back.  They should do that or no one's given me one.  No, I think it's gone, which is really crazy because they must have made a ton of money on that.  Susan Care, who did the original Mac icons, was designing little gifts.  They should do that for the timeline.  I'd buy some, you know, it's my birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you feel like you got to buy somebody else the gift.  The night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's worse, the cards or the gifts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  N5GM asked me in the chat room, are you going to put all your ex-girlfriends in your timeline?  I am.  Really?  Yeah, I already have one ex-girlfriend on my timeline.  My first girlfriend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  That's it. I'm stalking Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I know it's not done yet.  I want to have it all done by the time it rolls out.  I guess it's actually delayed.  Did you see this? They're getting sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they didn't beat that down. I saw some update on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, they did. Okay. So now they're going.  I'm not sure. I'm not sure.  The timeline trademark. You know who could sue them though?  There are about eight companies that were doing almost exactly the same thing where  you upload your stuff and it makes a timeline in your life.  Oh, well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if they start patenting our lives, we're in a real problem.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Marissa Meyer, why did she take a job at Google?  It was 1999. She was a young engineer  weighing offers from several startups during the dot-com boom.  She liked Google because among other things,  she'd be the first woman on a team of merely eight people.  She also got jeers when she visited another startup where there were 48 males.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you believe that?  Hey, baby. Hubba, hubba. You're hot.  You're a cheats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. It's like I'd rather be on a team with eight dudes instead of 48 dudes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey.  Oh, yeah. But the real reason, and this is...  On behalf of all men, Gina, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You apologize.  I just apologize. I give a blanket apology to every woman in the world.  Just a blanket apology. It's not our fault. We're poisoned. Our brains are poisoned with  testosterone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just blame the testosterone.  It's not our fault. We try.  Try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We try, but we have no choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like hair growing in the ears.  It just happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just sprouts there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can't help it. It's the testosterone speaking.  She was at a summit, Fortune Magazine's Most Powerful Women's Summit in Laguna  Nogal, California on Monday with Lulu Lemons, CEO, talking about why she took a job at Google.  But she says, the real reason I took a job at Google, I thought it had a 98% chance of failing.  It turns out that the 2% odds of success were far greater than what she thought others would have.  In other words, she thought they were likely to fail, but the least likely to fail of all  the places she visited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, she came up with an algorithm, didn't she?  Didn't she kind of come up with a decision table where she had all these different factors,  including possibility of success, and then just wait them out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes complete sense to me. It's very logical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The key to success is often failure.  It's totally fine if you just have to fail fast.  Google focuses about 70% of its time on its core business, 20% of its time on related businesses.  That leaves 10% of its time on far-flung ideas.  The key to is to avoid investing too much time and resources into any idea before it's proven to be successful.  This is such an engineering-driven company, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they can't help it. Speaking of not being able to help it, that's so much better there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, she said, of course, in the Stephen Levy book, it's because  Larry and Sergey were Montessori kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  That's the other reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't buy that.  Now, this is an interesting story. Google wants to do ad circulars.  Apparently, there's demand for this among some Google advertisers.  You got to feel sorry for newspapers.  Oh, they want to get to the kid beats.  Just hit them where it hurts.  Of course, almost all newspapers were basically invented to deliver full-page ad circulars to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the only reason to still print.  In the economics of newspapers, you see some papers are trying to think about going down  at one or two-day frequency, and the reason that they're doing that is not because there's only news  two days a week. It's because that's when they distribute what are called freestanding inserts,  coupons, and circulars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember in The Chronicle, the big moneymaker in the San Francisco Chronicle for years  you'll remember this, Jeff, next to Herb Cain was Macy's.  Herb Cain had a little thin skinny column that everybody read because he was the San  Francisco columnist. He even would refer to the Macy's ad because he knew there's always a big  Macy's display ad right next to me. He was the sugar, the honey to bring people in so  that they'd see the Macy's ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If I told the story before Stop Me, that's a blanket rule of permission at all times.  When I worked for the Daily News after I came back from a strike in New York,  coupons are controlled by Rupert Murdoch and the two of them, Robert Maxwell who bought us,  was a robber baron of his own sort, were at a huge feud. So we had no coupons.  When they finally reached peace, the week that the paper came back with coupons, our circulation  that week alone went up 120,000. So people weren't buying the news, all the stuff I was  working for, they're buying the coupon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fish wrap and coupons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Birdcage liner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So now if Google, and there have been other efforts to figure out how about coupons and  circulars online, how do you find out what's the target and best buy and such. But if Google can  help them really figure it out and recognizes the business proposition, which is that the circular  is a media property where manufacturers pay to be, and if they can enable those kinds of companies  to make money on it and make sales through it, that is going to be the last straw for a lot of  newspapers. Though I've said it before, but I think it's going to hurt them badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Supposedly you'll start seeing it today. They're working with the two biggest buyers of  full page ads in newspapers today, Macy's and Best Buy, and they're going to have web circulars.  They're going to look like the full page ad inserts in newspapers. Oh man.  It just starts to hurt after a while.  New Google Doc for Androids, three column redesign and more functionality. That's good.  That goes along with the Google Docs redesign. We were talking about before the show began,  because we use Google Docs for the show. And I was just noting that in Google Docs,  the spreadsheets now look like they're little gifts. Little wrapped Christmas presents.  Oh, this makes me happy when I see that. It's a present made of data. I actually like the new  design. This is kind of to go along with the new Gmail design. All this stuff is going to start  looking like this. I don't know how you'd characterize it. Cleaner? Simpler? Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Voice just got this redesign as well, and I called it tappable on Twitter, and Matt Cutts  laughed at me and said that that could be taken a lot of different ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It means you want to tap it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Clearly.  I'll tap that.  If there's anything you want to tap online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's the tablet thing. Everything has to be touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Touch interface. Yep. So bigger touch targets and cleaner separation, white space. It's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so excited. I just got this text. Hey, I got the money I needed.  I just got a Google Voice spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Voice spam? Block that sucker right now.  Holy cow. How did they do that? Bastards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait a minute. Let me just make sure it's not real. Hey, I just got the money I needed.  They approved me for $1,500 at onehrloansite.com. Check out their site too. Respond no to end.  Now, kids, do not respond. Okay? Do I have to tell you that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not us, but right now.  Do not respond.  You block. Block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You block, but do not respond. Google and AOL both got my hopes up.  Google is apparently paying $100 million to producers for new YouTube content. AOL says  they're doing a similar amount of money to video producers for original content, specifically for  YouTube or AOL. I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, okay, Leo. All right, Leo. Are you all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know who they're going to? Tony Hawk.  And Shine Reveille. That's the company that makes The Office and Ugly Betty.  Other expected partners. All the big names. IAC, Deca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what disappointed me. I mean, I understand why they're doing it. I get it.  They want to grab marquee names and there's a war going on over that, but  I don't want this to be.  Let's have some original content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't understand. This is the platform for every regular person to make content  and this deal is asking people who create content for TV to make it on this platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I guess the theory is they don't need to get regular people to do it. They'll do it.  So but in order to get like the big name producers to make high quality premium content,  they I have to say, I mean, this doesn't surprise me. We've had some conversations with some of  these companies and they don't they don't want us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, would you do something like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what do you mean do something like this? If they said here's five million dollars,  would you produce some content for YouTube? Hell yeah. Why wouldn't I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, as opposed to running your own outfit where you.  Well, I'd still run my own outfit. I don't think that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You still own your stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think Reveille Shine Reveille is suddenly a Google property.  They're just saying if we give you some seed capital, because I think the presumption is  you guys can't sell ads on this stuff. You're not going to make money on it.  So we'll give you the money that you would have made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, actually, it's an advance against Google ad sales.  Yeah.  So so that's all it is. They're up front in the capital.  It's like right kickstart for TV. They're up front in the capital.  And it's a book the same way. It's an advance.  You know, and Google is going to lose money on that, but it's going to draw people over  and it's going to motivate them around. So, you know, well, what do you think they want?  Besides marquee names? And of course, you are one. But what do you think they want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want mainstream, traditional mainstream production to start moving to the Internet.  Really? 22 minute sitcoms.  No, they want 10. They want five. They want 10 minutes.  They want they want funny or die stuff is what they want.  That's OK. I understand.  The Twitcom.  Yeah, no, see, we're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're just not. In fact, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, Dvorak, there's a sitcom in that man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked with YouTube Live. They didn't even know who we were.  They had no idea who we were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said, what is it that you do? In fact, we had several conversations and at each  time I talked with the same person, I had to explain what it is we do.  He had never seen it, never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me guess. They hired this person from Warner Brothers or something?  Yes. Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's crazy.  The reason why I asked earlier about whether or not you would do this, Leo, is because you  are able you don't need the seed capital, right? Like you've got a sales team and you're already  supporting yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Neither does Shine Reveille, but it's just it's free money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they said, well, we would like something that conforms to our needs, whatever that is,  five minutes, fast paced, you know, I'm sure I'd produce something for them.  Doesn't matter.  The Supreme Court of the United States.  Their loss.  I don't know. It's not even their loss.  It's not even I'm on that. It's not even I only mention I don't bring it up to say, oh,  I'll pour me. I just merely want to point out this is what they this is what they're looking for.  They're not looking for any of the stuff that is produced.  I guess they're throwing money into Angry Orange and Fred Figglesworth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's stuff original YouTube content they're throwing money into too.  That's true.  You got to attract the kids. I don't attract the kids.  Supreme Court left in place a ruling by a New York federal appeals court, which says  song downloads are not considered public performances under copyright law.  Yahoo and Real Networks were in litigation with the American Society of Composers, Authors,  and Publishers. You know them as ASCAP over royalty payments.  ASCAP said you owe us as if this was a public performance.  And Yahoo said, no, we don't want to pay that higher rate.  We want to pay the download rate. Supreme Court reviewed  and agreed. Said we're not going to hear the appeal. So that settles that case is done.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Phew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They won't have to. I guess they'll have to cut the Second Circuit rejected the lower court's  method of computing royalties, meaning now they'll have to come up with a new formula.  So it's still could still could go.  What is a public performance of music online? That's the question is music streaming.  Is Pandora a public performance? Do songwriters need royalties for streaming?  Look, I support songwriters. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But as always, it's trying to use old metaphors in a new world.  That's what doesn't work. You got to figure out what the essential needs and benefits are  and the competitive landscape and then do something about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said AOL and Google, but Yahoo and ABC News also have a distribution pact.  I don't get that one at all.  They're going to air Good Morning America on Yahoo.  Can't you just watch it on TV? I don't understand.  I don't get it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is a classic case where ABC gets all happy as they get Yahoo's firehose,  right? As if traffic is a commodity that you can just shove around.  Interesting.  They're going to report their traffic together.  Right.  What's also odd to me is that ABC lashes up with Yahoo just as its fate is extremely uncertain.  What if it got bought by News Corp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Fox, ABC, they like each other.  There's no problem there.  All right. Let's get our tip, our number and our tool of the week starting with you,  Gina Trapani. I was just checking to see if you were frozen.  Not frozen.  Your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have to keep moving all the time just to make sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not frozen. This is a pretty cool tip that was new to me. I'm giving credit to the Google  operating system blog for unearthing this one. You know how in your browser if you click on a link,  especially in Google results, the link turns purple because it's been a link that you've  visited already.  Right. That's kind of been a standard since the internet was born.  Yeah, that's been a standard in browsers forever.  If you have web history turned on in Google search, those purple links will show up if you  visited a page on any computer. If I visited a page on my laptop and then I go on to my desktop,  it'll show that purple link, which is pretty cool.  The other thing that you can do if you have web history turned on is you can,  you know when you find a page on Google and then a few weeks later you're like,  oh, that page I was looking at and you know that you visited it but you can't find it again,  you can actually filter or limit your search results to pages which you have already visited.  So if you do a Google search on the left side, on the left hand column, there's a link,  more search tools, and you can say, just show me pages which I have already visited.  I think that's the wrong screen.  Yeah, so if you go to Google, if you have web history turned on, you do need to have web  history turned on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that. So should I do a search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, just do a search for something that you searched over before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've searched for Gina Trapani many, many times and see it's purple because your blog,  I've been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right. And so on the left hand column, if you go down to,  I think it's more search tools, there's a visited pages link.  Click on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Visited and not yet visited. So these are the ones I've been to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so these are just the links which you have visited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are your sites that I haven't been to yet.  Well, that's not true, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's a neat tool if you've found the link weeks ago and you're trying to find it again,  and it's not in your local web history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been dying for that.  That's fantastic. So, oh, these are the ones you went to last time.  Yeah.  Right.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so just another way to filter results. This almost convinced me to turn web history  back on. I've had it paused for a long time.  Oh, you don't use it.  I stopped using it at some point in some sort of un-Jarvis-like privacy fit,  but I think I might turn resume back on because this is useful. And listen,  Google's tracking it either way. I might as well get the benefit of it, right? This is one of the  benefits of Google holding on to my web history is that I can filter searches that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I leave it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now it is time for a number from Mr. Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Repler, which is a, I don't know, some kind of job company, according to Forbes  and Cashmere Hill, their privacy person, says that 91% of employers in this survey say that  they do indeed go to social networking sites to screen job applicants.  Wow.  And this is going to scare you for a moment. 69% of those surveys said they had  at some point rejected someone for that. However, 68% said they'd also  hired someone because of what they saw. And so why were people fired? Is it the classic holding  a drink? Well, 11% idiots do say that, but the most common reason to reject someone because what  they find is they lied about their qualifications.  Yeah, well, that's reasonable, frankly.  The employer gets to do things or they made discriminatory comments  or they demonstrated poor communication skills. It's legit.  It is, yeah.  It is, like I just need. I can't do a sentence.  Uh, you know, post content about them using drugs or about them drinking. I think that's none of  their business. And I hate that people aren't going to be able to put up a picture of them holding  a beer. It's ridiculous. It's the boss doesn't drink beer. That's where society is all screwed up.  Right.  And hypocritical.  Right.  So keep your Facebook profile page. Don't be worried about just being okay for grandma or  for your boss, but don't be stupid remains the basic rule of life.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And would you really want to work for a company that didn't want you as an employee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. That's what that's what another Forbes columnist said. I think she was exactly right.  You don't want to work with that kind of company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. If that's going to be a big deal for them, that you were dancing around naked at Burning Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Life hacker, I definitely hired editors and interns because of their social media presence.  Well, that's true, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you reject anyone? Did you reject anyone because of what you saw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually. I mean, I would just way favorably people who had a strong online presence. I mean,  the job was a was blog editor. So I wanted someone that I knew had good writing skills and knew how  to handle him or herself in a situation, a common situation or a conversation online.  So it was part of it. But no, I never not. I mean, there are people who I befriended because  they had a kind of a cool, normal kind of like-minded, you know, I said this person is  a kindred spirit from their social media presence. And there are people who I've just not engaged  because they seem kind of creepy online. So I don't know that that might be that might be kind  of a rejection. But I've never I've never not hired someone because of their social media presence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, when we hire somebody, we certainly would pay attention to the fact that if they didn't  have a web page, a Facebook page or a Twitter account, we just kind of wonder, well, is this  person even right for us? Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I went to I went to a Davos thing yesterday and there was a session about trying to get talent  and programming talent and good discussion with Sean Parker and Tim Armstrong and some other people.  One of the other people said that he told the story of a guy who was hiring people and  interviewing them on his birthday. And four people walked in and one of them said, Happy Birthday.  Right. And it just showed off that the person did their research. That's all it is. They looked it up.  And he says, yeah, he always respects someone who finds a way to sneak in some reference to having  read a blog post or the person they hope that's interesting, because that can't I've met people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that that creeps them out. Where they go, really, were you  looking me up online? Maybe that's old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, see, that's interesting. I find it to be evidence of the person just being perceptive  and paying attention and wanting to impress. If it's something that I wrote publicly,  you know, and recently and someone says it to me in conversation in a professional context, I'm like,  oh, you, you know, you either follow my stuff or you cared enough to look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be flattering if you if they read your articles,  but if they knew who your third grade teacher was, that'd be a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be right. Well, I mean, if that was the thing,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  birthday's right on the edge there. That's pretty personal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting. But if you're friends with someone on Facebook, you know,  it's their birthday. If you've logged into Facebook, that just, you know, it's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  front and center. They've let you be their friend. Now the subscription thing muddies the water,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  though. Right. Well, but this is all we're trying to do is find our new norms as a society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I think that's where I draw the line. If you want to look me up and read about my  professional credentials and know about that, that's great. You're doing your homework. If  you want to know what my kids' names are, that's great.  Yeah, you got a point there. That's creepy if somebody you don't  know comes up and says, how are Henry and Abby? It's like, huh?  Yeah, okay. I see that. Yeah, that would be my feeling anyway.  My tool of the week is something very useful if you like to silence your phone as I do.  If you go to meetings or you're on the air and whatever it is, you don't want the phone to ring.  And yet there are some numbers you really need to have ring. This is a tool I've been using for  some time now. It's on the Android market called Semi Silent. You can designate certain numbers  that ring no matter what the silent settings are on your Android phone. There's a free version and  there's a paid version that eliminates ads. Free version works just fine. And you don't see the  ads all the time just when you're running the app. Semi Silent. I like it a lot.  Cool. That sounds good. Yeah, it's really, you know, if, you know,  you don't want to miss somebody's call that you're expecting, but you want to have your  phone quiet. This is good. I'm going to give you a second one, a freebie. This is called Screeble.  I'm trying to remember where I saw this, but it's very an interesting idea.  So you want to set your Android phone for battery usage. You want to set it to turn the screen off  in the shortest amount of time. The shortest is 15 seconds on Android. But the problem with that is  inevitably if it's 15 seconds when you're doing something, it'll turn itself off. You're watching  a YouTube movie and it goes black. Screeble has a very interesting idea. It was from one of the  hackathons. It watches the orientation of your screen, like how your phone is being held,  and doesn't turn off the screen if your phone's tilted. So if you're watching a movie or using  the phone to play Scrabble, which I've been doing lately, it won't, you could set the screen turn  off to be the shortest possible. But it does a very good job of keeping the phone awake as long  as you're handling it. The minute you put it down, it's done. Yeah, I think it's a really good idea.  It's called Screeble, S-C-R-E-E-B-L, short for I guess screen blank or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or a word we could find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A word we could find that wasn't taken by anybody else.  Gina Trepani is at SmarterWear.org. She blogs there. She's also, of course, the author of  ThinkUp, a great application that is used to call information out of Twitter feeds, thinkupapp.com.

Go right now to the bookstore.  That one down the street that still sells paper books and pick up public parts.  It's awesome.  Kevin Marks coming up this afternoon on triangulation.  I should have teased you. I should have said,  do we know anybody who invented podcasting two years before Adam Curry and Dave Weiner,  who created QuickTime at Apple Computer, who went to work for Tech Narate where he was the  chief engineer, who went to work at Google where he was in charge of micro formats and profiles?  Do we know anybody like that?  Yes, we do. And you've probably heard him many times on this show, Kevin Marks.  And he's watching us right now.  He is. And the only reason I didn't pull him on this show is because we're going to talk to  him for a full hour. I've wanted to do this for a while because he's on many of our shows.  But to sit down and talk to this guy who has really been so important to technology for so  many years will be a lot of fun. Currently, he's at salesforce.com, but Kevin Marks joins us at  4 p.m. for triangulation. Thank you, everybody, for being here.  Thanks. Take care.  Bye-bye. We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
