Yes, I'm all alone with my cozy fireplace and my bottle of mezcal  because it's time for our annual This Week in Google best of.  Of all the best ofs we've been doing, and of course all the shows this week to end the year are doing best of episodes.  This one is, I think, the most fun.  We have a lot of fun on This Week in Google and I think we've got some great stuff for you.  The thing, one of the things that sticks in my mind most, and I know it drives Aunt Pruitt crazy,  is we had a lot of fun with TikTok.  Remember those sea shanties that were all the rage?  Listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, did you trust me? Did I not take you to the Blob Opera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You did and I love the Blob Opera. You got another one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did too.  For another show opening?  Okay.  Yeah.  You got to play a few verses of it.  Okay.  Down under TikTok, shanty songs.  Oh yeah.  TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Aren't shanties...  Sea shanties, TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Sea shanties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Aren't sea shanties like, I guess I really need to get on TikTok more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Like sailor, like, what do you do with a drunk lady?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you do with a drunk lady?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, so go to 115.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Sea shanty, TikTok.  I might even sing along.  Apparently, is this a trend on TikTok now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes it is. Yes it is.  Sea shanty, TikTok.  Get that volume. Have you checked your volume yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I got to make it come out of the right hole. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Oh no, it's coming out of the wrong hole.  What happens when you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go back to the beginning. Go back to the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're messing it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The name of the ship was a belly of tea  The winds blew up her bowed up  Down below my billy boys blow

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Soon made the wellerman come  To bring us sugar and tea and rum  One day when the tongue in his tongue  That's actually awesome.  ...even go

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Isn't it? Let it go.  She had not been two weeks from shore  When down on her a right whale bore  The captain called all hands on swore  He'd take that whale in tow

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Soon made the wellerman come  To bring us sugar and tea and rum  One day when the tongue in his tongue  That's actually awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Alright, alright, Jeff. You're ruining it.  Where do you find lyrics to this stuff?  I mean, how do these people know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the Wellerman song and I just searched Google.  We could all do... We could do a quintet here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Alright, here's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the problem is we're on Skype, they're on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So water the whale's tail came up  Is this the same song?  ...to the side

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The wounding fought her when she died down below  Soon made the wellerman come  To bring us sugar and tea and rum

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  He's actually kind of lit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Soon made the wellerman come  To bring us sugar and tea and rum

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You know what? This is actually what makes TikTok pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it?  Because that's the collaborative part where you do what people add on  and do edit and do edit and do edit.  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  It's pretty amazing.  If you go down, you also go to the original one.  Hold on here.  So I'm on the wrong page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I've got some from CNET. Let's see.  Sea shanties are taking...  From Wellerman to drunken sailor  Sea shanties are attracting the attention of landlubber TikToks.  It went wild. I don't know what happened, said the guy at the center of it all.  Is this the original?  That's him.  I think so, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The ship was a belly of tea

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So he starts it, solo, and then other people on TikTok pick it up.  One guy comes back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So one guy comes back, the guy with the really deep voice, the bass.  He's great.  And then another one does it and another one does it and it becomes a chorus.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's a pretty great collaboration.  Yeah, and that's the thing that's cool about TikTok is people can take somebody's track.  Here's one with strings. They've added strings to this.  Strings, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like the hum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Alright, that's pretty awesome. I have to say.  See, the best part is it's not copyrighted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's in the public domain so you don't have to worry about remixing.  Yeah, that's probably why I see shanties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Now here's the club-ready remix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where's the drop? Here comes the drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'm sick of this song already, but still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to stay in your head for the next 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you enjoy that kind of music, I encourage you to listen to Stan Rogers doing Northwest Passage.  It's very similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And I love it because immediately Hank Green, who apparently has decided TikTok is the hip place to be, not YouTube,  is explaining the Wellerman song.  Oh, let's hear it.  Alright, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I love that there is sea shanty TikTok and I love that I'm on sea shanty TikTok and I hope there's more.  But I had some questions about this song because I listened to it with my son a bunch this weekend  and I didn't understand all of the references in it.  Now the main one...  Okay, that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could have learned something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I will say this. I like that this is not just people lip syncing.  At least this is some natural effort.  I would watch this because my only impression of TikTok was everybody's doing a lip sync  or some sort of a white transition into something else they're doing and it just got tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's how it started. That's what Musical.ly was.  It was just lip syncing.  But somehow when they bought Musical.ly and I think really the main thing that they did right was they said royalty free  and pop stars agreed you can use our tracks and it's not going to undermine our sales.  Have you watched the Fran Lebowitz Martin Scorsese documentary on Netflix yet?  No. Is it good?  Yes, awesome.  Looks like it'd be pretty funny.  It's called Pretend It's a City. She's hysterical.  But one of the things she says...  Oh, she's just like so grumpy and brilliant.  She's the Lewis Black before there was Lewis Black.  Lewis Black? Female version?  Yeah, yeah.  But she says the thing that's great about talent is it's just sprinkled around like sand.  You can't earn it or learn it. You're born with it.  And it's completely random.  And I think when I heard that I thought, you know what, that's true.  Whether it's writing, painting, ice skating, playing a bass, throwing a football.  Sea shanty.  Or sea shanty.  But what I realized is that's really where YouTube, TikTok really is a huge thing because it is randomly scattered.  And so it's not the people who went to Berklee College of Music or signed a record company deal.  In the old days those are the people we got to hear.  Or if you were maybe in the subway you heard...  Right there, you step in all the time, Jeff. You'd go in the subway.  Democratization.  And there'd be some brilliant violinist and you'd go,  this guy's playing for bucks in the subway.  Yeah, yeah.  But now...  I played in the subway.  What? Really?  Yeah.  What did you play? Hockey?  In Toronto.  Guitar.  Really?  Really?  You'd go down there and...  Yeah, I played.  Did you make money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Yeah, some days I made...  Geez, one day I think I made $150 for two hours I think.  That's awesome.  Were you still...

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Oh man.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it was great.  The best part is because it's the subway you can literally play the same five songs over and over because people are just on their way somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  People are moving.  You don't need a repertoire.  I'll be here all week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Just through the times they are changing over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Over and over.  Is that what you would do?  Kind of folk?  Yeah.  Neil Young, Bob Dylan, John Prine.  Nice.  Do you still do any of that?  I do, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, I love that.  See, when she said that I thought it's a shame I didn't get any talent because I would have loved to...  She also said that musicians, there's no other profession where people just love you because everybody associates a particular song with their youth or good moments in their youth or their child.  And so musicians, unlike almost any other profession, people just love them because it's this memory of their youth and so forth.  It's a good point.  Yeah, she talked about it.  She plays the cello or played the cello.  At one point, she said the elementary schools would get a free instrument up to a certain point and then you have to buy your own.  And they took her cello back and her parents...  And she said, I need a cello.  Her parents were trying to figure out how they could buy one.  And finally she goes downstairs and says, Mom, Dad, don't buy me a cello.  I will never be good at this.  It's a complete waste of your money.  I don't have that talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Unlike what the hard head told me in that trombone of his.  Did you buy him a trombone?  I did. And he was good.  He used it up until we got over here in California.  He stopped playing?  Yeah, he was focusing more on other stuff, particularly sports and whatnot.  Oh, sports, okay.  Yeah, definitely sports.  Girls here and there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  A few girls, lots of sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  But he was really good.  I give him credit.  It wasn't a total waste of my money because he was really good.  He was first chair pretty much as soon as he picked it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Are you sad that he didn't keep going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, a little bit.  Because I like how having an instrument in your hands just keeps you busy.  It's just something about the mental health part of it too.  Did he like it?  Yeah, he loved it.  He loved it.  He was good.  It's funny, every now and then I'll catch him listening to classical music.  Good. So he has an appreciation.  Right.  I can remember just thinking back to when people would laugh at us growing up for listening to classical music.  But he just embraced it.  Him and his brother, they both enjoy jazz and classical music as well as some of the other wild and crazy popular music that's all over the likes of TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So if you're not going to be a professional trombonist learning appreciation for music, that's a lifelong game.  That's a plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want a light moment here?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Bernie memes.  I love these mitten memes.  Now where did the mittens come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a woman.  It was a teacher who evidently knitted them for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And he wore them where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At the inauguration.  That's how fast this happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  This was from this morning.  Bernie sitting wearing these mittens and now they're putting him everywhere.  In fact, there's a sticker already.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's just the greatest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Here he is in that line of workmen building New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to love the internet, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  You got to love it.  Mr. Jarvis, you took part of my pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Here he is at DMV getting his license renewed.  You know, it's partly because his attitude and there's a shirt, a t-shirt already.  Here he is.  I don't know.  In the Bundestag.  I don't know.  Here he is in the Hall of Mirrors in Versailles.  Here he is at a basketball game.  Here he is.  Oh, yeah.  He was part of this very important photograph wearing his mittens.  They're pretty cute.  I got to say, oh, and this happens, of course, all the time to me when I wear mittens.  The very famous meme.  So Bernie is, this is how he was dressed.  It was apparently very cold.  It was snowing for part of it.  He's wearing his snow suit and some big knitted mittens.  And he's sitting with his legs crossed and his arms crossed.  He's like a cranky old man.  Life is like a box of chocolates.  And you just never know who's going to sit on the bench.  This is so good.  Next to you.  It's just the greatest.  See, the Internet's a beautiful thing.  Did you know that he was in the Queen's Gambit?  I don't know.  I don't know if you knew that.  It's a little hard to move the pieces with the mittens on.  Yeah, yeah.  There he is with Han and Chewie on the Millennium Falcon.  Boy, I want the sticker.  That's what I really, here he is.  You know, he's even helping out in the president's room in the Congress as the new president  signs some proclamations.  He's got a little folding chair there in the corner.  You know, there he is with Paulie Walnuts at the pig store cafe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Hanging out, hanging out, waiting for...  He's a brilliant.  Yeah, even on the moon.  Sorry, Ant.  Even on the moon.  I didn't know it was out there.  Too late, too late.  Even on the moon.  There's Bernie.  Yeah, yeah, everywhere.  This was, I think, the first one I saw.  He's just sitting at a table selling CDs at the back of the concert hall.  Concert merchandising.  Yeah, concert merch.  Got it here.  Get your t-shirts here.  There he is, the fly on Pence's head.  Yeah, yeah, he was at the debate.  People don't realize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was another picture of him carrying an envelope and something, so they put out  his schedule.  Like, 10 o'clock Joe's thing, 11 o'clock run by post office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Here he is on one of those special chair elevators that they sell.  See, our...  Here he is on the beach with...  Oh, wait a minute.  This is actually on the inaugural stand.  Chris Christie has decided to join him in the beach chair.  That's good.  That's a reverse meme.  That's a reverse one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Stacey, you see, this is where, going back to the prior discussion, this is where  the unlimited creativity is so wonderful.  Now, there's no business model behind any of that, but people did it for joy and love.  And the question is, how do you give credit for that?  If you wanted to encourage that, how do you create business models around that?  I don't know, but it's fun.  This is the first...  Well, I mean, we see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's obviously out there and people are doing it.  Yeah, it's great.  I mean, you're going to have to make...  I mean, you have to make it easy for people to find things.  I mean, any of us who used AltaVista or remember the original Yahoo page...  Yeah, Yahoo pages.  I mean, you have to...  Even if you have a distributed system, you're going to need to find ways to get people to  see what you're building.  I mean, I don't know how else to tell you, Jeff.  Business is...  No, no, I'm just speculating.  There's going to be a new book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  If you're not aware of Waldo, where's Waldo's?  Where's Bernie?  Oh, we're getting into copyright trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the Last Supper.  Yeah, The Last Supper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And there he is.  You on audio.  Yeah.  I feel bad if you're on audio.  You're missing all the fun.  Because it's just the perfect Bernie pose, too.  It's everything.  It's the mittens.  It's the pose.  It's the whole thing.  It's his personality.  It's the whole thing.  It's just...  Look, here's a guy actually selling a kit.  The look.  The Bernie kit.  You have his look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Steal his look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You can't quite get those mittens though, because those are handmade, handcrafted.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Made by...

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  They're not mittens?  Aren't they?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, no, these are gloves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  He's wearing mittens.  He's wearing mittens.  Made by Jen Ellis, a teacher from Essex Junction, Vermont, who gave them to him two years ago.  She was surprised when he began wearing them on the campaign trail.  They're made from repurposed wool sweaters and lined with fleece, made from recycled  plastic bottles.  Of course.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh golly.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'm glad we can be happy again.  We can be joyous.  We're happy again.  The reason I bring you on is because you sent me an email the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said, here's an NFT of one of my images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I was so taken with that.  I said, let's get Trey on because we have been trying Trey for a month to figure out  what the hell these non-fungible tokens are.  If anybody should know, it's you.  You're not the first artist to do this.  In fact, this has been, I think, mostly a boon for artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not the first.  I found out about it the first time two years ago.  I have a friend named Yash who was one of the founders of Pinterest.  He actually came out here to Queenstown, New Zealand, came here into the studio and was  telling me all about NFTs and how big they're going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Two years ago.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said, I don't really understand.  He just explained it to me for hours.  Okay, I get it.  I almost did it way back then, but I thought, well, sometimes it's not good to be an early  adopter.  Sometimes it is.  But now I think the wave of interest is so high that it's probably the right time to  get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Grimes got a lot of attention for selling $5.8 million of her art, digital art.  A lot of it animated.  I think all of it animated for 20 minutes, almost $6 million in 20 minutes.  The National Basketball Association, the NBA's made $200 million selling basketball highlights  at NBAtopshot.com.  The first time I became aware of what now we call NFTs was CryptoKitties, which was  a site you would use cryptocurrency, I guess Bitcoin at the time, to buy these digital  cats that would mate.  But Trey, it's kind of speculation really.  There's no tangible good.  If I have one of your pictures on my wall at home, that's a tangible good.  Not necessarily one of a kind, but it's a thing, a physical thing.  You're not selling, when you sell an NFT of your art, you're not selling the print, are  you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or are you?  No, but you can.  You can attach real life goods to your NFT.  Okay.  But you don't need to.  I sent someone a link in the Skype chat.  Like this guy made some shoes and it's like a digital shoe that spins around.  But then like if you buy it, you also get the real shoe.  And I think in 24 hours, he made about $3 million.  Oh my God.  Jesus.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, Trey, can you restrict other, can you put conditions in the contract about what  the odor does and does not get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, you could put that in the contract because you know it's a smart contract tied to the  Ethereum blockchain.  Yeah, so you can put the parameters in there.  You can really do almost anything that you like.  You can do, you could put it up for an auction.  So there's one of one.  You can put up a photo or a piece of art that's an open edition and you put a price on it.  And if it sells 560 units, then those 560 things are minted and that's all that will  ever be minted with that particular piece of art.  There's lots of different schemes and scenarios for selling stuff.  I think this is, there's, so you said speculation.  It's totally speculation.  And I, but here's my theory.  Although, to be fair, so is buying Starry Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  If you buy as an investment instead of just something pretty to put on the wall.  And I think that's where most fine art is sold as an investment.  You're speculating it'll be more valuable in the years to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And I think that they're right to speculate on it because right now there's so many Bitcoin  millionaires out there.  They're just all, they're crawling with them.  And people don't know, right now people buy Bitcoin and they just play the market the  other way for it to go up 4% or down 3%.  You know, it's like trading the Euro for the yen.  And that's a little boring.  It's much more interesting to buy instead of having an invisible Bitcoin to have like  a digital piece of art and the art there's secondary and tertiary markets so it gets  sold and resold.  So why wait for Bitcoin to go up 3% when you could buy a piece of art and it'll jump up  50% in a few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So is it, you think it's the case that people who are spending money on NFTs are not taking  dollars, say, and turning it into Bitcoin or Ethereum and then spending it.  This is stuff they've had, they have in their wallet.  And so it's just like buying more crypto.  That's what it sounds like.  It's kind of like that.  Right.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're probably sitting on hundreds of thousands or millions in Bitcoin and having  their Coinbase account.  And in these NFT sites, they often use this little wallet called Metamask.  So they can just convert it to Ethereum, send it to their Metamask wallet and they can  just go stir crazy and buy all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Is it usually Ethereum when you're doing an NFT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's actually good news because Ethereum is not nearly so energy dependent as Bitcoin  is, right?  I've been told.  Somebody said, Leo, you're an idiot.  It's don't worry about it.  Because I was complaining, actually, I was quoting Seth Gooden, who did a blog post  saying, you know, the only thing bad with NFTs is it's going to hasten climate change  because there's so much energy involved in these transactions.  But that's not the case with Ethereum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't totally understand the mechanics of Ethereum, but I do know that it can do  a lot more transactions.  Yeah.  And there's new with the new Ethereum, Ethereum 2.  Yeah, they've got a lot of different wild computer science techniques that are happening  that can, you know, makes it like 10,000 times as efficient as Ethereum 1.  Yeah, it's proof of stake is less energy intensive than proof of work, which is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the main reason Ethereum was developed was to do smart contracts like NFTs.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think it's a really interesting time because, you know, crypto has always been  very esoteric for the common person.  Yes, this does not make it any less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I got to be honest.  This just makes it even crazier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People that buy all these NBA cards and all this kind of stuff, they're like, oh, I'm  going to buy this stuff.  And so these are like regular people.  And so now there's, you know, non computer science nerds like us that are getting into  this collecting stuff.  So it's entering a certain zeitgeist.  It's still early, but it's nice to see so many people playing the game.  It's just a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It does remind me of trading cards.  Yeah, it's very much like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  In fact, that's what Seth Coden used the the Hannes Wagner card, of which there are only  10 as an example.  That piece of cardboard has no intrinsic value.  Or Superman one.  Yeah.  I mean, I guess if you're a Superman fan or if there's any Hannes Wagner fans left because  he played 100 years ago, you could say, well, he's a fan.  But really, that's not why people buy people buy Hannes Wagner baseball cards.  They buy it because of its intense value and they spend millions of real money on these  things.  Do you trade using your banana?  Sorry.  Go ahead, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was just remember the fine art.  It was a banana taped to the wall by an artist.  Remember that?  Yep.  And another performance artist ate it.  Do you remember that?  I remember that too.  And then, yeah.  And so that was his art was to eat the banana.  But part of the contract for buying the banana taped to the wall was that the banana would  be regularly replaced by the curi-  So it's okay to eat it?  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  The banana, by the way, was priced at $120,000.  Maurizio Catalan, he titled it Comedian.  And then along comes another comedian to eat it.  This is part of Art Basel in Miami Beach.  So Trey, do you see yourself as selling your goods, your images this way entirely or is  this just kind of a fun little sideline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a fun experiment.  I still sell big prints.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  People want them on the wall, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  This sounds a little name-droppy.  You guys know I don't take myself seriously.  But I did have two famous celebrities become collectors lately, Edward Norton and Leonardo  DiCaprio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Nice.  It is name-droppy, but it's okay.  If it were me, I'd do it the same.  Do you guys hang out?  Hey, Trey has introduced me to some major celebrities.  Hans Zimmer is a friend.  The last time you were in Petaluma, you came here with MySpace Tom and we went out for  Korean tacos.  Wow.  Yeah.  So everybody famous I know, I know through Trey.  He knows everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Wait a minute, you met Hans Zimmer?  I didn't meet him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Trey's friends with Hans Zimmer.  Trey's like his buddy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  We traveled around Europe together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah.  I wanted to ask from the standpoint of the artist that's a star of an artist and happens  to be able to make a sale of an NFT.  What is it from a payment standpoint?  I mean, are we talking real money that actually shows up or is it just going to sit somewhere  in a crypto wallet somewhere that they have to sit on forever and ever and just buy more  crypto-based items?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Good question.  I'd explain how it works.  So you take a piece of art, it can be a photo, it can have music attached to it, it can be  animated or whatever.  You upload it to one of these marketplaces like the one I'm going to put mine on first  any day now is one called Maker's Place.  And then so you upload it just like you're uploading a picture to Flickr or whatever.  You write a little description, you put how you want to sell it, what kind of price, and  then it goes live.  For example, the way that the money works is, let's say they buy it for $1,000.  Maker's Place takes 15% and 85% goes to the original artist.  So that's really quite good.  That's better than the usual gallery commission, right?  Yeah, way better.  Right.  As soon as someone buys it, that money is transferred into your Coinbase account or  your Metamask wallet and then you can convert that to US dollars anytime.  So you can cash it in.  Yeah, even better because this is a smart contract.  If someone buys that on Maker's Place and then they resell it, the original artist gets  10% of every subsequent sale.  So until the end of time, you'll get 10% royalty on that piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So I can see your interest in this for the artist.  This is a great deal.  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Maker's Place, huh?  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I can see the gears turning.  Maker's Place is digital.  These are digital art.  And that's one of the things I think that confuses people about NFTs.  As I said, I got from you, I still have it, a picture of the space shuttle launch.  It's beautiful.  And that's a physical thing.  It's probably a print, so there may be other copies of it.  That's very common these days.  You may also, if you have a Van Gogh, you might have the original.  A digital thing, the thing that confuses me is you can make infinite copies.  Does Maker's Place prevent you from making infinite copies of the art you just bought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they have a pretty tight authentication process.  Because when it's authenticated in the blockchain, it trades the original creator, only 20 exist  or only one exist.  But it's digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  How can they keep me from making another copy?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, technically I could take the same photo and upload it on another site, like Foundation.  So there's a certain amount of trust.  But there's ways they can check the Ethereum blockchain to see if the same thing's already  out there.  So that's why it's just so trusted.  The mind flip that people have to go through is, you know these, you all know Harare books,  like Sapiens, that humans are the only animal on the planet that believe in fictions.  And if we all believe...  We believe in a lot of fictions as it turns out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Like money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't see a meter, you can't weigh it, but we all agree on how big a meter is so  then we can use it to make stuff.  It's the same thing with money and now the same thing with digital art.  You can see so many people are buying it that there's enough people that believe in it just  to keep it going.  Same thing with Bitcoin.  People didn't know.  We've got to get more and more people to believe in this story.  But now so many people believe in that story, the story grows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could put code into the image too, right?  Like sort of steganography or you could insert something into the actual image itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But that'd be copy, Matthew.  If I copy bit for bit the thing I bought, it's going to be copied with the bit for bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, technically you can go screenshot my photos anytime and make them your screensaver  or whatever background.  But there's only one that exists in the Ethereum blockchain and it's authenticated.  That's the real one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Okay, I get it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  Yeah, that's the real one.  Trey tells me that I think he sold one NFT of his for half a million dollars.  They're doing quite well for for talented artists like Trey Ratcliffe.  I'm glad he could come on and explain it all.  We're going to take a break when we come back.  Lots more of the best of this week in Google.  We're going to talk more about TikTok.  Yes, we got some Linux and a lot more.  But first, let me talk to you about the company that has a name that just doesn't match my  experience.  It's Imperfect Foods.  And you know, we started doing Imperfect Foods, Lisa and I, because we realized that we wanted  to help the world.  We wanted to help the environment.  Did you know this is a stat that just is terrible?  35% of the food supply in the United States goes unsold or uneaten every week.  More than a third down the drain.  That's not right.  That's crazy.  And it's all because grocery stores want everything to look just right.  They don't want anything that's going to bruise.  You know, they'll put aside a third of all the produce just because it doesn't feel right.  They think it won't sell.  Well, you know what?  It's not going to sell because it's great.  It's delicious.  It's not imperfect.  It's just different.  Like you and me.  Imperfect Foods is sourcing quirky yet delicious foods, delivering them to you in a way that  reduces emissions, reduces packaging waste, saves you time, saves you money.  I mean, it is perfect.  It's perfect.  But they still call it imperfect.  I'm not going to change that.  Wouldn't it be great if getting your favorite groceries put time back into your week instead  of taking it away?  Especially now it's getting a little colder, a little scarier to drive.  Why not stay home?  Cozy.  Let Imperfect Foods deliver you.  They call it, and I love this, intentionally sourced groceries with just a few clicks.  Imperfect Foods, I-M-P-E-R-F-E-C-T Foods is a perfect grocery delivery service.  They offer an entire line of sustainable groceries.  They taste delicious.  They reduce waste.  The only catch, they may not deliver in your area.  Please go to Imperfect Foods dot com.  See if you can get them.  Imperfect Foods dot com.  See if you can get them.  If you can, hallelujah.  Once you sign up, you personalize your weekly grocery order.  By the way, it's not just produce.  There's pantry stables.  We've got blue corn chips on our last basket.  Oh, Lisa got some blueberries.  I love blueberries.  They're really great.  They're not imperfect, but they call them imperfect anyway.  Okay.  Yummy snacks.  Plus, your order comes on the same day every week.  Ours is Thursday.  Your day will vary because you know what they do that's really cool?  To save emissions, they deliver weekly by neighborhood.  So, you're all bundled together in a day with everybody else in your neighborhood.  That produces 25 to 75 percent fewer emissions than all those people going to the grocery  store, right?  It's actually reduces emissions compared to people driving to the grocery store.  Plus, who wants to drive to the grocery store?  The problem is I think people when they hear the name, they go, oh yeah, they're going  to be bruised.  They're going to be funky looking.  They're not.  I was kind of stunned when we opened the first box.  I went, wow, that broccoli is the best looking.  It literally was fresher than any broccoli I've ever had before.  It was incredible.  I couldn't be happier with Imperfect Foods.  Sure, when you go to the grocery store, you can get a pomegranate the size of your head.  Yeah, but so the Imperfect Foods pomegranates are smaller.  They're like baseball size instead of grapefruit size.  They taste better that way.  That's perfect.  I don't have a problem.  Okay, but they call them imperfect, so I'm going to let them call them imperfect.  You can get everything.  It saves you a trip to the grocery store basically.  By the way, I know sometimes when you get these deliveries, you go, oh, what about the  packaging?  Say goodbye to packaging, Gil.  Imperfect Foods is the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return  your packaging after every order.  We used to order from the local grocery store.  Everything would come in a plastic bag, everything.  It's like 40 plastic bags.  It didn't make me feel good at all.  Imperfect Foods doesn't put in plastic bags.  No, they put, it's a nice box which you can again return after every order.  It's just nice.  It's great.  Right now Imperfect Foods is offering our listeners 20% off your first four orders.  When you go to Imperfect Foods dot com, use the promo code twig, T-W-I-G, 20% off your  first four orders.  That's up to an $80 value at Imperfect Foods dot com.  When you use the promo code twig, Imperfect Foods dot com, promo code twig.  Imperfect Foods dot com, promo code twig.  Really happy to support this one.  They do a great job.  One of the questions I like to answer completely, nobody ever asks, but I like to answer, is  Linux really better?  Let's go to the terminal to find out.  Keep scrolling.  Oh, here we go.  This is for you, Aunt Pruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, I got to fix this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I apologize.  I'm having the Linux problem.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Linux.  All my audio clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Wait a minute, I can fix it.  Do you mind if I take a moment?  I got to go to terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure Aunt will forgive that, yes.  He's got to go to terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  What was that, Linux admin?  What was that?  I got to go to terminal.  No, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  To be fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He knows what he's doing, Aunt.  That's how Linux is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  At lunch, I decided for no good reason to blow out my Linux install.  In about half an hour, I installed a completely new Linux on here.  I was concerned because one of the things we'd done before is set the default rate and  pulse audio to 48,000, 48,000.  I was a little concerned, but then I played a YouTube video for John and it was fine.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're just going to have to go with a TikTok musical every time for the testing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Apparently TikTok.  That's what it sounds like.  It's TikTok.  Every single time.  Yeah.  Now I have to remember where it is.  I think it's in...  Slash Bin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's close.  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's in slash Etsy slash pulse.  Slash.  There we go.  And then, oops.  And then inside Etsy pulse, I need...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you saying about Linux?  Yeah.  No, this is easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  All I do is right click.  All I do is right click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Should I play it on my Chromebook?  It works every time.  I have to nano daemonconf.conf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, I have to sudo.  Wait a minute.  Sorry.  Wait a minute.  You didn't have the right admin, right sir.  No, I didn't have that.  I have to sudo that.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I have to sudo that.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I have to sudo that.  Wait a minute.  I have to sudo that.  Wait a minute.  Pseudo first.  Okay.  Control A. Pseudo.  Okay.  And then here's my password.  Be patient.  Now it's very easy.  We're going to go down here in the daemon.  We're going to go down here and find the default bit rate here.  You see the alternate sample rate.  The default sample rate is 40 for one, but I don't want that.  I want the default sample rate to be 48.  48k.  Okay.  You remember, right?  See, you know this.  You know this.  You know it's easy.  And the thing is, if you expect the operating system to do all that, you never really understand  how computers work.  I'm just saying.  Okay.  Now I have to restart pulse.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pseudo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Pseudo.  Pulse.  I can't remember how to do that.  Stop.  Let's see if that works.  No.  Pulse audio.  What is it?  Is it pulse audio?  Oh yeah.  I should have written a set alias to fix that.  That's exactly right.  I don't remember the name of the daemon.  Shoot.  Oh well, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Can we all get a look at Mr. Jarvis's face during this right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You can't do this on a Chromebook.  You're not selling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wanted to use Signal on my Chromebook and to do that I have to have Linux.  And of course what happens, I go in and I can't do it from my, what are they called  this week?  Workplace account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, that stupid workplace account.  Yep.  How do I restart the server is what I need to do.  Let's see.  I've got the daemon con.  Usually by now the chat room has helped me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  No, the chat room is saying no, we're not going to tell you the command, Leo.  Here it is, kill, kill and start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Thank you.  Pulse audio.  That's what it was.  See, I can count on Keith512.  Pseudo pulse audio.  That's what it was.  Audio, dash dash kill and then no daemon process.  That's okay.  I'm going to start it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's so good.  So you're starting it.  You had to put your tag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, I shouldn't have run it as root.  That's my problem.  There you go.  Right there.  Oh boy.  Okay.  Let's do a kill again.  Now it'll say, Oh, I know that one.  Yeah.  Now I have to not pseudo pulse audio.  This is the best way ever.  And now let's go back to Bridgerton already in progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For helping out there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Of course I closed that tab.  Wait a minute.  Let's go back.  Here we go.  Here we go.  One more time.  I didn't fix it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, it didn't fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I probably should.  I probably should reboot.  I just might have to reboot.  Shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, uh, Jeff, actually I might as well start with this, send along this tweet, uh, about

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And how easy it is.  We were talking over the weekend about why the youngs love Tik Tok.  And what I didn't know is that a lot of what people do in Tik Tok is all done in camera.  They, you know, my son who does a great Tik Tok channel, he does cooking on Tik Tok.  Oh yeah.  In fact, I'll, I'll, I'll show you the link.  It's sodium underscore deficiency.  I have no idea.  Interesting with the youths these days.  It's hard to find him because he doesn't have his picture on it.  Yeah, look, it's so hard to find.  I got a 404 women.  Let me type it right.  He has a picture of somebody else, not his picture, but, but so he's does all these food  things on Tik Tok and I'm like, why don't you ever cook these for me?  Oh my, oh my God.  This isn't me.  I had no idea.  Everything you learn, you learn on YouTube.  So that there he is.  So then I asked him, go ahead, Hank, go ahead.  You go Hank.  So then I asked him, uh, so how do you edit?  He says, well, I edited a premiere cause he's like learned how to edit right in the old  days.  But look at this.  This is a TikToker.  I don't know who, I don't know what her name is.  So Eden, Eden Harves, H A R V Z.  But she's going to show us how they edit in camera.  You can do all this stuff in Tik Tok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if you've ever seen Tik Tok, my trick also is to hold down the red button and let  go when you want to stop filming.  That is the best way to get it slick.  Okay, let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So, and we call that, we call that editing camera, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Where you're, yes, there are some things you can do in camera for us.  A transition.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But watch this.  This blew me away.  Now you tell me if you could do this in your camera.  So she, she's playing music and here's one thing that's really cool is Tik Tok pauses  the music so you can, you're matching the music as you, as you do it when you, when  you don't record.  So that makes it a lot easier to do that.  Yeah.  That's Tik Tok magic there.  What she's doing with a hand.  Watch this.  So she's just moving the camera around.  She's doing a face wipe and stuff like that, but somehow Tik Tok is, I guess they're putting  in transitions or something.  I don't know.  You'll see.  Watch the final version.  I don't understand how you get from what she's, it's Maya.  It sounds like Tik Tok magic.  It sounds like something they're doing in the ad.  Now watch.  So she's showing it as she made it.  See how she's doing a wipe with her hand.  Tik Tok is somehow, maybe that's just.  That's all Tik Tok.  It's like she takes her head off.  That's amazing.  That's beautiful.  Isn't that beautiful work?  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's, yeah, that's Tik Tok magic there.  Cause you can do in-camera transitions.  A lot of cinematographers do it pretty commonly, but they also do that with the idea of knowing  that it's going to go into Premiere or Resolve and they're able to sync those cuts up to  where it looks the way it did.  Right there Tik Tok is just using AI and saying, Hey, this is looking like a good cut point.  And I didn't even know.  But I think she kind of did it though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  She might've done it all in camera.  I don't know.  But turning off at exactly the moment when her hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Right.  If she gives it the exact point that it needs to transition, I think the app is smart enough  to know this is a cut point.  I think Instagram is trying to get along that same path with Reels.  I haven't quite figured it out yet, but I have been trying recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Neil, give her a plug.  What's her account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'll have to look it up again.  It was Eden E D E N.  It looked great.  Yeah.  And this is by the way, I mean, the Tik Tok, I have to say it's there are people, a lot  of it's just dumb.  You know, women showing off their bodies and things.  But there is some stuff that's really amazing.  E D E N H A R V Z.  Eden Harves.  Here's another one.  Taylor, as we're doing Tik Toks, Taylor Lawrence tweeted this out.  She says Queen grandma of edits.  Watch, watch, watch this one.  This will make you, this will make you realize it's not just for the kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah, that's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Now clearly she's using an editor to do this.  This is not as beautiful, but this is where Tik Tok really is kind of amazing.  I see this effect a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's rotoscoping.  Yeah.  Well, pink does it a lot.  He's doing that on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, obviously she's not handling the phone.  Look at that.  Queen grandma.  That was impressive.  Wasn't it?  Yeah.  Very impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can spend the whole next hour just watching Tik Toks, which is what people do.  No we cannot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Okay.  I don't want to admit this, I don't want to admit this, but if you scroll enough on Tik  Tok, they actually put a slide up with a guy saying, okay, you've been enough time.  Oh really?  Yes.  Oh yeah.  Oh they do.  You spend enough time on Tik Tok, take a break.  Oh nice.  Really embarrassing when you get to that because that means you've spent a lot of time scrolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the equivalent of Netflix like, are you still watching this?  You know that you should not be watching nine consecutive hours of television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Don't you think you need some sunshine right now?  So tempting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So tempting.  I've been watching, I was never into car racing, but I saw some Tik Toks of pit crews in Formula  1 and these guys in three seconds, they change all four tires.  I'm watching this.  I said that can't be real.  So there's a really good series.  It's in their third season now on Tik Tok on Formula 1 racing.  Drive to survive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I can't stop now.  I love it.  I'm hooked.  I was just talking about this yesterday.  Have you ever seen it in real life?  No.  That's docu-series, the camera work, the lighting, the editing, the sound design, it is worth  watching it just for that.  Forget the stories behind it.  But that whole series is like watching a trailer.  If you turn on movie trailer, it's got the same, just oh gosh, but that series is, I  love it.  Oh, I'm glad to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Now I told Lisa we have to go to Monaco next year.  Oh, take me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's actually a text story there, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  What is this sound?  Is this me?  It must be me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, you, sir.  It's me.  I'm playing Caspy.  My favorite place.  There's this woman.  Are we boring you, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  What is, what's going on?  Is Jeff doing his own show now?  He can't stop TikToking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The internet is addictive, you see.  And it's designed for this.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  What are you doing, Jeff?  Jeff, eyes ahead, please.  Uh oh.  I'm so glad we recorded this.  Clap if you hear me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Clap if you hear me.  What do you do with your kids, with your students?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You must, I mean, you're doing Zoom, right?  It's graduate school.  Okay.  So it's assumed that they're paying attention.  And plus, Leo, I just kind of by my presence demand their attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Apparently I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  There's one young woman on TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to find her and she looks like she's about 21.  She has a voice as if it comes out of a movie.  She has a voice as if it comes out of the 1940s.  Is she from Israel?  Nope, nope, nope.  She's just unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'm glad, I'm actually glad that the Trump administration didn't dismantle TikTok.  I mean, maybe they're spying on us.  I don't know.  So who cares?  It feels like there's such creativity going on.  It's so vital.  I really think it's great.  I'm sure that's the same on Instagram and Snapchat and elsewhere, but it's really a very exciting place to be.  Now, this is not moral panic.  This is really a scary story from The Washington Post.  She never returned her VHS copy of Sabrina, the teenage witch.  I love this story.  The DA's office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This happened to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  20 years later, she faces a felony charge.  She was trying to change the name on her Texas driver's license.  When they ran a background check, all they're seeing is these two words, felony embezzlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Blockbuster back in like 1999 or 2000 sent a ton of people to collections for tapes that they either did or did not take out that were never returned.  This happened to you?  But this happened to me.  I did not get charged with a felony, but I did get sent to collections, which for me was a huge shame.  Oh, that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  No, that's almost worse than a felony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Blockbuster had a database error.  And what happened is people who took out movies right after you on the card or something got attributed to your card.  So they had me taking out some video I'd never done.  So this woman, and there's a bunch of people in the comments talking about it, but it's from the same era when Blockbuster got super aggressive and had this whole database issue.  They were jerks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  In fact, this woman didn't take it out.  She said, but she was living with a guy who had kids and she thinking he went and got it and didn't take it back.  What's even funnier is the cast of Sabrina got into the act, including Melissa Joan Hart.  Yes, who did the shruggy emoji.  Okay, that's terrible.  This was highly traumatizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I remember once flying out of the country and I remembered, oh, hell, I didn't return a video.  And I thought I was going to come back bankrupt.  Yeah, the fees just went up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Compact interest works both ways, buddy boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  What a ridiculous industry that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Nobody is flying to join Google's flock, says The Verge.  Firefox has already said we're not going to do it.  Apple Safari won't do it.  Mozilla, Vivaldi, Brave, all out.  In this article by Dieter Bohn, he says Edge.  But I have to say when they asked Microsoft about Edge, their response was very equivocal.  In fact, to the point where I feel like Microsoft was hedging their bets and said, yeah, we're going to wait and see.  We might well use flock.  Just as a point of information, Steve Gibson did a very, about half an hour on flock yesterday on Security Now,  and I encourage people to listen to it.  It's at the end of the show.  He says it's a good idea and it works as advertised, that it is privacy protecting and it's very cleverly implemented to do that.  I pointed out, of course, Google has to make advertising work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google is...  For itself and many, many others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Google's kind of got to do the best it can to reassure people on privacy, but still they have to give something to advertisers.  That's what I was just talking about.  What Google did point out is that there are a number of categories that they don't sell ads against,  including things like your mental state, your previous incarceration, whether you're pregnant, any health conditions.  They don't sell ads against those and flock will not add those features to any of its cohorts.  So that might have been a little bit reassuring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pregnancy is interesting because that's highly lucrative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, if you look at what they won't sell, I mean, liquor, right?  The stuff that Google won't do ads for is actually a list of stuff that people buy ads for.  So I think this is why I feel like Google might be a little bit sincere in that they're trying to reinvent advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need to get past what it was.  And if we're going to shoot down everything that comes up just because it came from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they're not shooting it down because it came from Google.  Originally, EFF shot it down originally because they want to stop the web being built on an ad-supported model.  That's their idea is that your data should not be your payment for serving the web.  We should come up with something better.  And it might be something like what we're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, OK, so we end up in a world where everything is behind a paywall.  I wrote a tweet about this last week.  But my dystopia is that everything goes behind a paywall at major media and that everybody has a sub stack.  And the only thing that's free is disinformation with crappy ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a little crazy.  I think what's going to I mean, like I tweeted just the other day, I realized I subscribed to 11 publications, which is insane.  I spend about a thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.  But yeah, thank you.  I know. I mean, it's my job.  I mean, I do it because I run into paywalls all the time.  But it is frustrating also to try to.  I'm like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, I pay for stuff.  I pay for more stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I ever give Bloomberg any money except that I have to use Bloomberg's materials on our shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I give Bloomberg money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Reuters is going to charge that much, which is ridiculous.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Sorry, Reuters. I like Reuters.  So go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think what's going to happen is we're going to reach a point where people start hitting all these paywalls and they experience the pain of that.  And we're going to come up with new models because they're going to be forced.  Remember, I mean, we always this is what competition does.  You get this like pain point and then people will come out with like aggregators that are like of some sort and we'll get to that point.  It's constantly evolving.  And that's good.  That's what the web is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But that's exactly why we never want to get rid of the free tier because I don't want to put everything.  I didn't want to do a paywall per se.  Now, maybe that's crazy because this is this is patronage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is support.  This is help.  This is fans.  But I know people will be involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Financial Times, for instance, you can't read their content unless you pay.  Wall Street Journal, you can read some limited content, but not all of it unless you pay.  You know, paywalls are definitely a thing.  Is that because this idea of freemium doesn't work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because it's a winner take all market.  One of my numbers below, which I will now sacrifice for the good of the show.  Thank you, sir.  A view of all of the news sites that have over 100,000 subscribers.  There's 28 of them adding up to 23 million worldwide.  The English speaking world.  That's a fraction of the total.  It's nothing.  In the U.S., 63 percent of all subs go to three, cut them three publications.  You know what they are.  New York Times, Wall Street Journal.  And I subscribe to all three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the third one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Wall Street Journal, New York Times and Washington Post.  Yeah, I have a subscription to all of them.  Yeah, so do I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I don't subscribe to any of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You're the common man.  You're the real man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Well, but see the thing is, I totally get having these paywalls up because ideally they're  going to have legit content out there and legit information.  But there's a lot of times that I've been able to click on some of these stories and  whatever they're showing before hitting the paywall.  And I'm like, this is bad.  And it just doesn't warrant paying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'll bring up this.  There is a hazard.  Knox Harrington in our IRC chat brings this up.  If all the good content sites are paywalled, what will be left for normal, unpaying people  to pay to read is link bait and crap.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  But I'm seeing link bait from some of these reputable sources too.  Oh yeah.  And that's why I'm like, why are you even bothering?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not all crap.  I mean, mine's free.  It's more trade though.  I get a lot of people who are cranky that my stuff is too technical for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, too bad.  I mean, that's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do they expect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  People are just cranky.  I got to say, people are cranky about anything.  They don't complain about anything.  If you're not technical nuts, you'd get just as many people saying, you need to be more  technical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Each week I get someone telling me I'm too technical and I get someone saying, thank  you for explaining things so clearly.  So I take it all with a, okay, you can't please everyone.  But I will say there will always be, I do think there's always room for, I'll call it  a trade like publication.  My advertisers are happy to reach the people who are legitimately focused on my area.  And I think there's areas where that model will work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I think the narrower your niche and you have a very narrow niche, the easier it is to do  that.  I think if you're general, it's harder, right?  Because you don't have a natural audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you have a natural audience, it's just they're not lucrative.  They're just like the common man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Well, consider what is considered a frequent user of the New York Times.  They had to lower it from 20 pages a month to 10 pages a month to five or three.  Wow.  That means people who are paid, they can't get them to convert.  And they only come three to five times a month, three to five articles a month.  Yeah.  I'm reading.  I'm stunned.  There's all kinds of, I happen to have in my hand.  What is this Professor?  Hey, Senator McCarthy, go ahead.  Excellent paper.  Three great researchers, Duncan Watts, David Rothschild and Marcus Mubius just published.  And it's about fake news.  And they found that from 2017, there were 5,000 English language publications, academic  papers about fake news.  So what they're saying is they think it's maybe a little overblown and what the research  we need.  But here's some data in this.  News consumption is a small fraction of overall media consumption.  14% of overall media consumption is dedicated to news.  Right.  Less than 1% of regular news consumption and less than one tenth of 1% of overall media  consumption can be considered fake.  Three in four Americans spend less than 30 seconds a day reading news online while almost  half consume no online news whatsoever.  So we're weirdos.  We are really weirdos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, we are.  Oh, okay.  We're having fun.  It is the best of this week in Google.  I think every week is the best.  I love working with Stacey and Aunt and Jeff and we have so much fun together.  It's just a great show and I'm so glad you listen or watch and thank you for joining  us for this holiday.  I hope you're having a good holiday.  Happy New Year.  We'll all be back with the show live, doing new stuff this Wednesday, January 5th.  So don't worry.  We're not gone for good.  We just thought we'd give everybody a little time off.  Special thanks, by the way, to our producers, especially Jason Howell and our editors who  put this all together.  And thanks to everybody who suggested the best of clips.  We really appreciate it.  It helps.  Let's take a look back.  We'll come back with a lot more.  Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  You know I'm a big fan of Wealthfront.  Not a big fan of the diamond hands, the rocket ship to the moon, the stonk memes.  Yeah, that's fun.  Okay.  If you was going to Las Vegas and throwing your money away on the craps table, it's fun.  It is not a way to build wealth.  I know I sound like, you know, a cranky old man.  But this is what I tell my kids.  It's what I wish somebody had told me when I was a young guy.  It's fun, you know, but day traders, you know, for the most part, don't beat the market.  What you really want to do is get a Wealthfront investment account.  You know, save if you want.  Save a little bit to take and gamble away on stonks.  The odds are not in your favor if you're doing it alone.  Wealthfront is a great company to team up with.  Whether you're a beginner or you've been investing like I have for years, Wealthfront makes it  easy.  They do it right.  And they have the right tools for every portfolio, every need.  The first thing that happens when you go to Wealthfront is you answer a couple of questions.  What's your time frame?  What are you saving for?  How risk averse are you?  Things like that.  And then Wealthfront will create a portfolio just for you, just for you of globally diversified,  low cost index funds personalized for you and your goals, your needs, your desires.  You can also build your own portfolio if you want.  They have funds, some really interesting.  There's a clean energy fund, a crypto trust, tech investments.  A lot of us think, you know, tech's going to do pretty well in the future.  I don't know.  I'm not making a recommendation.  Hundreds of other investment choices.  One I really like, their socially responsible portfolio.  A mix of funds built around human rights and climate change and sustainability, diversity.  You'll feel good.  You're doing the right thing.  Wealthfront does things that make it easy to build your wealth.  No manual trades.  You don't have to look at the newspaper.  Does anybody look at the newspaper?  You don't have to look at your phone to see the stock ticker.  You don't have to pick stocks.  They handle all the investing based on your preferences.  You don't have to think about it.  But they also do things that you probably wouldn't think to do.  Things I know you need to do like tax loss harvesting, which lowers your tax bill.  In fact, in many cases, most cases I would say that your fees, which are very low to  begin with, will actually be covered by the tax loss harvesting they do.  They also, I think this is really important, rebalance your portfolio because sometimes  if stocks are doing really well, you get over invested in stocks.  So they rebalance it.  You're supposed to do that at least quarterly.  They do it automatically.  So you don't even have to, again, you don't have to think about it.  In fact, it's one of those things you set and forget.  You're just building your wealth automatically behind the scenes.  And it kind of feels good.  Wealthfront is trusted with over $27 billion in assets.  They're helping nearly half a million people build their wealth.  To get you in the door, they're offering, I think it's a great offer, your first $5,000  managed free forever.  Just go to wealthfront.com slash twig.  Please do that though so that they know you saw it on Twig.  Wealthfront.com slash twig.  $500 opens the account.  Grow your wealth the easy way.  Let Wealthfront do the work for you.  Takes all the anxiety out of it.  Some would say all the fun.  I don't think fun and long term portfolio building really should go together.  You can still have your fun, but let Wealthfront work on building the wealth.  Start building your wealth.  Get your first $5,000 managed for free for life.  Go to wealthfront.com slash twig.  W-E-A-L-T-H, wealth, that's a good word, front, F-R-O-N-T, dot com slash twig.  Get started today.  Wealthfront.com slash twig.  Well, thank you Wealthfront.  One of the things that's constantly plaguing this week in Google is YouTube's automatic  content ID system.  It's it's just nuts.  Watch.  Are you a creator, by the way?  You're a creator.  I'm a creator.  We're all creators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a good time.  Children are creators.  Finally, media recognize that they thought they were the only creators.  We're all creators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You know who else was a creator?  Beethoven.  That's the lead into your story, Stacey.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, what is happening here?  So this story is this is both a people suck and a content moderation is hard story and  also that YouTube needs better practices story.  So this is from Cory Doctorow.  He let me get the name of the lady right.  Sorry.  Let me let me open this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  The Marina Marina, a piano teacher who publishes free lessons.  I love Cory and I love his blog pluralistic.net.  He she creates free piano lessons on her piano keys.  YouTube channel celebrated her fifth anniversary.  Cory writes by announcing she was quitting YouTube because her meager wages were being  stolen by fraudsters.  She posted a video with a little bit of a Moonlight Sonata, which you might remember  Beethoven published.  No, actually, Beethoven did not publish this in 1801.  Beethoven wrote it in, I don't know what, 1762, but it was published in 1801.  It's in public domain.  In other words, the copyright belongs to Marina.  She performed it.  Nevertheless, you play or something you're going to get.  That's for a lease.  That's for a lease, not the Moonlights.  I can't hum the Moonlight Sonata.  I'm sorry, but it triggered and I might've just triggered it to YouTube's automated

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  play it right now, but then we're going to get taken down.  The Moonlight Sonata is very slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's going to, it triggered YouTube's automated copyright filter.  I'm amazed you recognize Fur Elise though.  And you named that tune Four Notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the nineties, I had a phone that played it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  A corporate entity identified only by an alphabet soup of initialisms and cryptic  LLC names had claimed Moonlight Sonata as their own, calling it Wicca Moonlight.  The content ID flag marinas track is an unauthorized performance of Wicca Moonlight.  She appealed the judgment.  The problem is you appeal.  We've had this happen to us.  Then, then they send a message to the copyright owners saying, uh, do you  agree that no infringement took place?  But of course they said, no, they infringed it.  So you show she can now let this shadowy company monetize her video, which  steals all of the revenue from her.  She can take her video down.  We are faced with this by the way, frequently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, no idea this was happening.  This is so infuriating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It happens all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is exactly the problem.  This is exactly the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought the problem was just that it took your stuff down  and you couldn't make money.  I didn't realize there was a group of organizations who, like, I get like

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  prints being...  And we've done this.  You can fight it.  You have to provide them with your full name and address.  And then they, uh, then they go and they, uh, and they, you go back and forth.  Ultimately it'll end in court, but even prior to that, and then the people  we've had people, I don't even want to go into it, but we've had people make, I  mean, the funniest things ever in their claims against us.  We had, uh, we had pictures of the NASA video, you know, we had the NASA launch  taken down by national geographic who claimed, oh no, we own the NASA video.  And of course that was an error they said, but anyway, this is content ID.  Corey hates content ID.  I hate content ID.  Um, and you know, it just doesn't work very well here is, and I love this  Corey published this from the EFF navigating YouTube's content ID, a  little flow chart to help you understand why Hollywood folks blame Hollywood, but  also blame, I blame the tech companies who thought we could solve this  algorithmically exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And it's the algorithm is the problem.  Uh, it's easily gamed.  Yeah.  Bad guys.  Yeah.  And I guess if you create something like YouTube where you get, you know, a  hundred million hours of content every day, how are you, how else are you going  to do it?  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and you gotta be, if you're going to be a platform, one of the costs of  being a platform is recognizing that people are going to game it and you have  to respond in a way that benefits the core users.  Google does it already for search.  They're like, Oh shoot.  Too many people are using weird SEO optimizations.  Now we're going to change things.  But what they're not doing is they'll do it for their core businesses, but then  they put out these creator platforms and they're not doing it for those businesses.  And that's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Not a big chilling effect on everything we do.  You know, I try to tell our staff, don't worry about it.  Don't worry about it.  But it really does create a chilling effect.  And we, we have to constantly say, Oh, we better not do that.  Cause they'll take us down.  Corey also points out that it's a really an uneven process.  For instance, an Instagram takedown takes a few seconds to file, but  28 months to appeal.  And we've had that where they'll take down a video and maybe we can get it back in  two weeks, but by then nobody's going to watch the two week old news show.  So it's really, it's really a problem.  There's a Warner Chappelle, you know, Warner music.  Ma demonetized videos that include the numbers 36 and 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why they should have, they should have bad effects for doing bad things.  And they should be penalized for overzealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Here's a Twitch streamer and munition.  Good name.  Uh, her videos were demonetized over the use of the numbers 36 and 50 to  protect copyright holders, the copy that did you get copyright?  You can copyright the number.  Apparently the, uh, media company full screen was simply, the claim was  simply over the number 36, you know, and you can appeal and maybe she's probably  back full screen is full screen is a social content company for talent and  brands they're owned by Otter media, a subsidiary of Warner media.  Um, they claim the number 36.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I don't understand how you can copyright a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they also copyrighted 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And while the claims are active before the appeal is accepted, they take all  monetization so, uh, and you can also lose your account.  I mean, the long shot is you can get a strike and lose your account completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should, when they, when they, when they're knocked down, they should  have to give back 10 times monetization.  There should be some sort of trouble damages for being bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They call it slap in law in the lawsuit world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Exactly.  Uh, there should be some sort of, uh, these are also the customers of the, of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the big companies and, and they are the ones who have the lobbyists and the  lawyers and so they would, you know, you know what they, they'd go run into  Capitol Hill and we'd have a SOPA people fight again.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's very easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Oh, it was pretty SOPA people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Soap of people.  We don't want to go with SOPA people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  We don't want to, we don't want to SOPA people again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  They're no, we, you know, we fight them, but, uh, you know, our, the risk to us  is that, uh, we would get a strike and too many strikes, we would lose our  channels and that would be a big deal.  I hate, I freaking hate YouTube.  I, I, I understand the value of it.  It's very impressive that anybody can create video, but it is also, it's kind  of a mess and, uh, and I don't like it affecting what we do as our content.  You know, I mean, I, I can't even humph, fear at least without fearing  that they're going to take it down.  Now I got to worry about 36 and Jeff, no numbers with 36 or 50.  I'm just telling you.  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Got it.  Yeah.  I don't want to take that chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no line numbers, 36 or 50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Let's start our picks of the week.  Now, Kevin, you came here at short notice in the middle of the show.  So, Oh, you do have a pick.  You're amazing.  What is your pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  My pick is the map of the internet.  Um, so are you remember the XKT did this a long time ago?  Someone, someone's made a current map of the internet.  Um, if you, there's a link to write, it lets you, wow, look at that.  So it's just like, it's this huge, huge map with like different land masses with,  with, um, it looks like a real map, but it's websites and they're scaled to  approximate number of users, I think.  Um, so you can see,  there's browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  All right.  Do you think it's in there?  Oh, it should be.  I would hope so.  You're on the internet.  Oh, wow.  This is, uh, is this, this is from HalcyonMaps.com.  Actually, I'm going to, this is one of those places where I'm going to spend  more time, uh, browsing their catalog.  Cause I love maps.  Look at the bottom where Antarctica would be the dark web.  Wikipedia is a, is like Greenland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I think basically they want you to buy this and put it on your wall, which is,  which would be fun.  I may well end up doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Here's the queue zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really what you need is something that actually changes over time.  So you need a display that links to software that's continuously updating this.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  Cause that would be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Also, I want the, I want the version of this in SVG.  So actually search the text in it rather than actually.  Oh, wouldn't that be nice?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it were a touch screen, you could zoom in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Here's Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Vcontact, the Russian version thereof.  Duck, duck, go.  Zoom is a pretty big island out of the ocean.  Zoom Island.  It's a big old one, but not as big as you know who.  The Island of Google.  It's actually.  Island.  That's a continent.  Google Stan.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's really fun.  Error correcting plateau, Google contacts, Android TV.  Google has a lot of, somebody put a lot of effort in this.  There's TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is a major effort.  It's a bit of a wrench.  Yeah.  I think I will get a poster for the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.  And it all looks like one of those old, old timey maps of the new world.  And then here's a list of major websites blocked in China.  Very handy.  Top website languages, internet users, percent of population.  It is now greater than 90%.  Oh no, this is, I see here.  This is based.  This is a smaller map and Canada is the only one.  Canada and the UK are greater than 90%.  And we're actually only, I don't know, down in the lower numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Canada looks like it's at 70 to 80%.  You think?  Again, colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, it's kind of a darker blue.  Who's 90% then?  Who's the darkest blue of all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that's up there in Scandinavia.  Norway.  Norway.  Finland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  All right.  Largest companies by revenue, highest selling video games.  Tetris number one, Minecraft number two, Grand Theft Auto five, number three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this is the same chart only now.  So it was 2006 versus two.  Okay.  Yes.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's changed.  Created by Martin Vargik of HalcyonMaps.com.  Good pick of the week.  I love this.  I love the colophon, which features 4chan, Google, Susan Wojcicki,  Piri Omidar.  That's great.  Last time we talked to you, Joe, we were talking about Russian  influence on the elections and disinformation.  That hasn't gone away.  Apparently yesterday, President Putin said, oh, we're not hacking.  We're not hacking you.  You're hacking us.  Okay, sure.  You're hacking us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how this works.  That is one of the tools of the big lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It's funny because it happens over and over again and yet nobody seems to notice.  Is just accusing the person.  Uh-oh, what happened?  I didn't do it.  I swear I didn't do it.  Jeff, we went black.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't do a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, you're back.  Is to accuse your opponent of doing the thing you're doing.  It's an amazing rhetorical trick because it gets them to get all twisted and nuts defending  themselves.  It's a combination of projection and what aboutism and the same thing.  Yeah.  Projection is a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, well, we're hacking you, so you must be hacking us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  We're not just talking about your garden variety, trolls and botnets online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hacking the power grid here, hacking infrastructure, hacking critical infrastructure.  I mean, yeah, so it's a little bit different.  The stakes are obviously enormous, but at the same time, Putin's always going to pretend  he doesn't know what's happening, but he himself is going to be the one to do it.  Putin's always going to pretend he doesn't know what's happening, but he himself is very  fascinated by technology and knows a lot.  So we should always be wary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  He also had an interesting justification for poisoning Navalny.  I mean, it's just fascinating to watch this guy.  I hate to say it, but it brought back a little...  This is where we were for the last four years, like with a guy who just says anything he  wants and...  Well, but a guy who's really f'ing smart.  Well, maybe that's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was in the room with him once in Davos.  Joe now goes there instead of me.  I haven't been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I heard the hotels, the rent too high.  The rent's too damn high.  Too damn high.  At the end of the day, you can keep your world power if I save a few thousand bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Putin saw a male journalist wearing a...  What do you call that greenish ring from Arizona?  Jade?  No, not Jade.  Turquoise.  Thank you, turquoise.  So it was a big turquoise ring.  And he focused on it.  He said, do men wear those?  And he wouldn't let go.  He kept going back on it again.  And the guy's wife had given it to him.  And we all try to get the guy to give Putin, make him put it on.  But he just finds an odd little thing about somebody and he just focuses in.  And he's scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Some people call that trolling though.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, his whole nation trolls us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That was my point, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Putin's response to ABC's questioning him about Navalny was, well, Black Lives Matter.  It's like, oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Anyway, it's not really on our beat.  But I think it's great to have Joan on because what is on our beat is the use of technology,  particularly the Internet these days, to spread lies, misinformation, to mobilize, to radicalize.  There's all sorts of malign uses.  Now, Jeff is the big defender of big tech and I don't disagree with him.  Big tech.  In fact, Joan, I'm defending the Internet.  Yeah.  But Joan was saying this.  You were not here at the moment.  But Joan was saying this before the show began.  Where would we have been in the last year and a half without Zoom and tech and all that?  Amen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wrote a thank you note to the Internet on Medium two weeks ago and I mean it.  I think that we would have been worked without it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But this is our constant battle on this show, but also just in general.  There's good in tech and there's bad in tech.  You wrote a piece, Joan, for Harvard Magazine saying disinformation ain't going away.  Can it be stopped?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was a piece that I was profiled in.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so there's a couple other researchers in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That headline on that piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Can disinformation be stopped?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your answer to that, Joan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, as with everything, it depends.  One of the things that I think the Internet has been fantastic at is helping us route information around the planet, lowering the cost of it.  I was just thinking about high fidelity video and how different it is to be isolated but not necessarily alone in the same way.  I'm wearing my Phone Losers of America t-shirt here today because I still romanticize the phone and voice and just the way in which people come to hear and learn from one another.  But there is something different about video.  When it comes to disinformation, I think we're dealing with, again, a distribution issue.  We're dealing with a content issue.  We're dealing with people who are motivated either through money or clout to push disinformation around.  Obviously, it's politically rewarding to be able to do that.  And so I wish I could say in this moment that disinformation can be stopped.  I think one thing we have to focus on is figuring out what should these distribution channels look like and how should they be run and who should oversee them.  And we got to go from there.  We need serious standards and protocols to get at what I've been calling a public interest Internet or an Internet that serves the broadest public good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I don't mean to sound so naive, but I don't think disinformation will ever be stopped as long as there's some form of profit involved, whether it's money, whether it's political power or world domination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, and as Jeff has pointed out, it predates the Internet by a long shot.  Well, since witchcraft, since print.  Yeah.  Maybe it is a little bit more.  I mean, look, we've always had, I'm sure in the preprint, there were middle ages.  There were conspiracy theories that made the rounds just very, very slowly.  But as soon as there were newspapers, you know, there's the press wars of the 1820s in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To balance printed ballots of people going through.  And that was the source of a lot of the witchcraft conspiracy theories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But there is a cynicism that's a little different.  In fact, it's interesting you invoked the phone losers of America, John, because I think there's they're they're harmless, but they also deal in a form of disinformation.  And there's a certain amount of almost cynicism, like a mocking, like we can fool these people because they're stupid, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's not stupid. I think it's trusting.  Right.  Which is even worse.  You're mocking people because they're trusting.  That's terrible.  And I mean, but that's that's what's so interesting here is we we have to change how information is shared and what kind of labels are put on and how it arrives at our door and what we call news and what we don't call news.  I've been a big pusher of trying to get us to think about, well, we have distribution pathways.  Social media really favors things that are popular and novel.  And so what if we were to also make sure that social media served things that are timely, accurate, local knowledge?  But nobody wants that, right?  I mean, that's as well.  I mean, we don't you don't have to want everybody wants to serve.  Nobody wants the vegetables.  Nobody wants water.  I mean, like it's like it's it's nice.  It's good to have.  It's necessary.  But like if you have a choice between water and and wine or water and a martini or water and, you know, ice cold seltzer like I have here.  Which is what Joan's drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that's that.  But part of it is, is really trying to figure out what in what proportions do we need this?  You know, and I think, too, you know, so like if you think about broad stakes of different conspiracy theories, like probably the most broad stakes that most people are familiar with is, you know, this notion of Holocaust denialism.  And, you know, a couple years ago, Zuckerberg came out and said that, well, he's not going to remove Holocaust denial on his platform because people have the right to be wrong about things.  And later, as we realize how big, you know, anti-Semitic movements get organized and how big they become when they are allowed to exchange information unfettered and reach audiences of people that do not necessarily understand the stakes of what they're reading.  And it's, you know, just kind of laced in with, you know, missives from your aunt and your, you know, your cousin's graduation pictures and your your friends, your best friend's cat and Holocaust denialism is just right there in the same mix.  It's different.  And so we do we do need to think about ranking, sorting, labeling, you know, I think we need more librarians at the helm of the.  Amen to that.  I like that.  You know, I don't think it's insurmountable.  I just think that there's a there's different ways of thinking about what the solution is.  It's a big hill to climb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right, Matt.  Now you're back in the hot seat because the New York Times says Sundar Pichai sucks.  Can a nice guy be an effective leader is the question the Times asks Daisuke Wakabayashi talking to restive Google executives, all anonymous, of course, who say that Sundar takes too long to make a decision.  We did that.  We have seen some blog posts.  The guy who founded Waze, Noam Bardeen, when he left, wrote a blog post kind of excoriating the Google culture, saying it had turned into a big slow moving company.  Do you do you stay in touch with people at Google, Matt, or have you?  Oh, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  And it's it's interesting because even, you know, in the later days when I was at Google, you could you could definitely feel like getting a change launched was more difficult, of course, than the early days, but also just like, OK, how does it affect, you know, you know, international markets, you know, the search quality and other languages, that sort of stuff.  And and some people are like, oh, you have to get all of these approvals.  But also, you know, it's a natural thing that when you are a really big company with a really big footprint and impact, you're going to have more scrutiny.  And that's, you know, it's it's hard to try to figure out how can you move quickly while still being big.  And I don't think anybody's found the perfect solution to that at all.  Every time I wrangled or interacted with Sundar, he was always doing a really good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I only talked to him when he was running the Chrome OS division, but I was very impressed by his genial nature, his intelligence, his candor.  I thought he was a really great guy, but that does not necessarily make a great CEO.  In fact, it might be maybe the contrary abilities that I have to say the Times buries about eight paragraphs in the Google executives complaining about Mr.  Pichai's leadership acknowledge that and say he is a thoughtful and caring leader.  They say Google is more disciplined and organized these days, a bigger and more professionally run company than the one Mr.  Pichai inherited six years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacy, you were going to say that all that all pipe in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was just going to say what they're doing is building a story based on an archetype.  Right. And so you've got the Zuckerberg archetype, which is I don't care about other people.  I never apologize. I never think about things.  I'm just in it for I don't know what he's in it for.  Anyway, the money, the data, the whatever.  And then you've got this sort of thing, which is, oh, he's too slow moving, you know, and very thoughtful and blah, blah, blah.  Google's separate problems that are slow moving.  And it is it is a much bigger company.  It's trying to do a lot more things.  But to there's two things happening here.  One is conflating the person at the top with the fate of the company.  And I know that leadership matters.  I mean, you look at Intel and you can just watch how leadership has just sucked a company just down the toilet.  But I also know that there are many people under him.  And Google is Google is a company that from the outside really looks pretty disorganized just in general.  So I don't know if I don't know if I feel like the executives, they're complaining about Pachai really means much.  Does that make sense?  And I think the New York Times is kind of making a story to fit a mold that it needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Jeff kind of was a little pissed off, actually, as I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Surprise.  Well, no, journalistic journalistically, I thought I just came up here.  Kafka and I, for me, just went back and forth with each other on Twitter.  Like, well, I don't know if I could do well in your journalism class.  I said, well, maybe not.  I think this is based on anonymous reporting.  You can write this story about any boss out there.  Well, some people like them.  Some people don't.  They don't like your mixed decisions.  Any boss there is.  And in my tweet, you can I said, I said, can you roll a scroll up?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  The more I think about this New York Times one man trend story about Senator Pachai, the more ridiculous it is, Jeff Jarvis wrote.  It could be written about any boss in any organization.  Some agree.  Some disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Some like some don't like go up to the prior tweet.  And the initial tweet is go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Media move fast and break things is Silicon Valley evil.  Google, our CEO is thoughtful and patient.  New York Times, let's do a trend story about Google cracking because it's not moving fast and breaking things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  There is a little contradiction there.  Mike Masnick replied to you.  He said, I mean, how much do you want to bet that if Google had acquired Shopify, we'd be seeing New York Times story about how we can't trust is that it was allowed to happen.  So that's another another point is that the Times has a little bit of a dog in this hunt.  But we have said on this show, Mike Elgin said at first, we've said it several times that Senator Pachai may not be the right man for the job.  Google, Google is making a lot of money.  They've they've they've doubled their staff.  They've tripled their revenues since he took over.  But, you know, it's making money the way it's always made money in search and advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can't abruptly switch.  I mean, Google is clearly trying other things to make money.  I don't think anyone in Google is like wandering around going, you know, not aware that search one day is going to erode.  But I think they're struggling with how to build up that much money again.  And part of that's just because they got in early.  I mean, it's like you got an early on the Web.  That gives you untold advantages.  And actually, that's why the FTC is in the Congress are looking at antitrust things now is the companies that got in early in these kind of newly forming networks are raking in the dough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if they did it well, there's also, I mean, of course, Alta Vista and Yahoo are untouchable.  Yes, you know, I mean, yes, I mean, to its credit did really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, same as Amazon, same as Facebook.  Apple's a little of an outlier there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  But, you know, it's interesting to me that I feel like Larry Page, Sergey, like they hired a lot of really great slash smart people in the early days.  And then sometimes if if Larry or Sergey or even Eric were like, we're going to go down this route, they had enough people who were like, maybe.  And it wasn't mutiny, but it was like, you know, we'll just have our backup plan in our pocket where if this thing doesn't work out, we're ready for the next thing.  Like you had a really high caliber of people.  And I think they've been able to maintain that much better than a lot of big companies that I know of.  The one thing I would just add is Google is it's kind of entering the whole tech industry is entering the lawyer season.  Like, you know, the ability to talk well in front of Congress makes a difference and will for the next few years, at least just because of the spotlight that's coming on on big tech in general.  And if you compare and contrast or think about Sundar testifying to Congress versus Larry Page, you know, Larry is brilliant.  He's fantastic. He has all kinds of amazing ideas, but he wouldn't be my first pick to go sit down in front of, you know, the Federal Trade Commission or Congress.  And it feels like Sundar is pretty well suited for that.  You know, certainly there's areas where he you know, you might say, OK, well, where's the maniacal vision or something like that?  But Sundar does a good job of listening to, you know, the feedback that he's hearing from what I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You know, I felt kind of guilty raising this whole issue about Sundar Pichai and I like Sundar a lot and I like Google a lot.  And I think this is a question that's yet to be answered.  I do. And I'm sure it is a question we will be discussing further in 2022 on this week in Google.  Hope you're enjoying our best of. There's lots more to come.  Jeff Jarvis will never let me live this down.  I'm sorry. I like Sudoku problems.  Jeff thinks I'm nerdy, but I had some recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I like them.  I just reloaded my YouTube page right now and the first things that pop up is a Photoshop tutorial.  MKBHD. They know you so well.  Wanda Sykes comedy because I watch a lot of stand up comedians.  And here's a hands on photography video.  Here's Alex Lindsay. Here's a Clemson replay.  It gets me. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's a good exercise. Let me look at what YouTube recommends for me.  Tweet the Sudoku for people who don't like Sudoku.  Mac Break Weekly. Boy, you are boring.  Another Sudoku video.  Oh, gee, a woodcock luring the worms. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you possibly make a video out of Sudoku?  Well, Jeff, it's fascinating.  Actually, this channel, people watching, making videos, it's boring.  This channel is called cracking the cryptic 12 time reigning Sudoku champ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And he makes Sudoku's. It's just it's fascinating.  Wednesdays. It's really, really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I like it. Oh, Leo, you don't have any YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  I don't have a life, but that's still pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's still pretty funny. Here's for some reason, a Nintendo Switch game.  Zelda Skyward Sword HD.  Chess office hours.  Renee Richie's Apple ecosystem. How Amy Webb beat her insomnia.  Oh, here's some more Sudoku. How to set a classic Sudoku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So tight. Yeah.  Oh, look, there's a lot of Sudoku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yesterday, Tic Tac Toe videos on YouTube.  Sometimes somebody is really going to win in a surprising way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You know, none of this is objectionable.  Actually, I think YouTube has done an excellent job.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Start watching. They'll stay.  Oh, they start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  If I watch one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wait, wait. Let's watch a Sudoku video and see what recommends next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  No, no, it's a longer long videos, as you might imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Well, no, you'll see on the right hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Let's see the calculus. This is only 49 minutes.  It's pretty quick. The calculus.  Within your page, it'll have what's next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Where would I see that? Over here?  Why don't you see that? I always see that.  Maybe it's too big. Maybe if I make it a little smaller, I'll see more.  Oh, I'm in theater mode.  How do I get out of theater mode?  Watch a video to tell you how.  I need a video on how to get out of theater mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Hover to the bottom right of the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  There's a button at the bottom of the video.  My mini player, theater mode, full screen.  That's theater mode.  I don't get any recommendations.  Because I'm happy watching this video.  They know.  About Sudoku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a model maniac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Actually, I'm not kidding.  This is my recommendation for the week.  The Cracking the Cryptic Channel.  And I'm not alone. 372,000 people agree.  It's the best place for Sudoku videos.  Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very soothing.  If you didn't want to be alone in your house, you could have it playing in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I don't think we're getting Sudoku shaming here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want an audit of your suitcase to Hawaii.  How many Sudoku books are you thinking of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I don't need a book.  I've got the Cracking the Cryptic app.  Which has some excellent Sudoku.  I wrote a Sudoku solving program.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Why does he like to see you?  What scripting language did you use?  I wrote it in racket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  It's not a scripting language.  Is Shatko crazy now with Sudoku shaving?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there's nothing wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Sudoku is mathematics.  It's good.  It's good for your brain.  It's good for you.  Cool.  I'm just not good at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  No, it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What the hell was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was that?  Stacey, do you need a waffle?  Is your stomach talking to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's a dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's not me.  Kylo's asleep.  Oh, he's dreaming.  Oh, he's snoring.  He's dreaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  He's so sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  He's chasing something in his dreams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you had a little camera, I'd have you move it so we could see, but you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's so cute.  You didn't remove his vocal cords or anything.  He can bark normally, right?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  He can definitely bark normally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But in his dreams, he barks like a dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now he sounds like a small dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I do have a close-up picture provided by Matthew in our Discord chat.  Add about another 90 pounds to that dog, and you'll have Kylo.  Thank you, sir.  He's dreaming of biting Rand Paul, says Stacey.  You got him worked up.  That's what I sound like.  Also, I'm glad you're back because we can now do the official introduction in three-part  harmony for Mr. Jess.  Or disharmony, as the case might be.  Disharmony for Jeff Jarvis.  He is, ladies and gentlemen, the Leonard Tau Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the  Grave Newmark.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoa!

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Graduates, School of Journalism at the City University.  Look who's appeared.  Stacey, look at that.  It's like Beetlejuice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She didn't know this.  It's like Beetlejuice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We've summoned you from the Pison Party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  We've summoned you.  We've summoned Craig Newmark to join us.  That was a little weird, wasn't it?  Wow.  Excellent placement.  Hi, Craig in the sky.  Hi, Craig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the great and powerful Oz.  Holy crap.  I was looking at the Discord while y'all sang, and then poof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is my new idea of surveillance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't have any Google Cam's up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  At least he's up front about it.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Let's actually widen the shot and bring Craig down from his perch in the pigeon cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a brilliant job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You now have named that position.  Pigeon cam.  Craig is of course the Craig of Craigslist, but lately has been a great philanthropist,  and among other philanthropies, the Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  That's why we sing their praises.  Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.  We sing it every week.  Every week.  Hi, Craig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Hey, it's my pleasure to be here.  I really do listen to the show fairly religiously.  I am very much looking forward to the moral panic of the Ootenberg drinking thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There you go.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It has put up moral panic.  Triggered it.  Craig, it's funny because we invoke you all the time.  What was it?  Not water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  May not be water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Inquiring minds got to know.  It's after 5 p.m. in New York.  He's in the East Coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, it's okay.  Pigeon milk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I am in New York now in pretty much our new home.  New York, as it turns out, is much better for my health.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Really?  Bagels.  They got bagels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, mostly I eat less badly.  In San Francisco, I would tend to fill up a refrigerator for the day,  but I have little discipline.  I practice the seafood diet, and that's not good to lose weight.  In New York, I get a little food, but if I want more food,  I have to decide if it's worth putting on pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So you're on the no pants diet is actually the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Whatever substitute for self-discipline works, I'll do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I can't go out because I don't have any pants.  No pants diet.  So are you in Manhattan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yes, we're pretty much in the village.  Oh, nice.  Even in the window, you see a little bit of a bird feeder.  Pigeons have been sporadically trying to get into it  and fighting among themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw them earlier, actually.  I want to see some pigeon action.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, are there any other birds in New York?  Other than pigeons?  I mean, I lived there, but I never saw anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The doves.  There are doves, and we have the occasional sparrow,  cardinal, tufted titmouse, and a few others like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Craig, are you a bird watcher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Pretty half-assed.  We put out food and water.  If the birds decide to visit us, that's good.  San Francisco, a lot more variety.  We've seen a lot of the wild parrots.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  Craig's a bird lover.  Bird lover.  We should note that Craig today, just before, announced...  Hold on, where is it here, Craig?  The whole news of philanthropy.  Pigeon philanthropy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is that?  So, Craig gave a grant to Palomacy.  Is that how you say it, Craig?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Una Paloma Blanca.  Paloma's a dove, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To continue pigeon and dove rescue work for PigeonRescue.org.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, I figure there are successor species.  I should suck up to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Do you also invest in robots?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I know, but I hedge my bets.  I also have welcomed our machine overlords.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So, that's really, is this kind of what you do now, day in, day out?  You don't run the daily operation at Craig's List, or do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, I gave that job up in the year 2000.  Wow.  Because people helped me understand that as a manager, I suck.  I retired a few years ago, particularly considering that I'm just short of 70 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  What?  You don't look that old.  I'm not blowing smoke.  I would never have thought that.  No, you're not that close, Craig.  I'm not going to let you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'll be 69 soon, but I need to desensitize myself.  Oh, he's 68.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, you're getting used to it, is what you're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's one year older than I am, and he's trying to put me closer to 70.  No, Craig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'm 64, and I do the same thing with 65.  Yeah, I've been preparing myself for that for years.  It's not easy.  Unbelievable.  Make sure you sign up for the appropriate parts of Medicare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I did.  Very good.  Because there's a penalty if you don't.  I was telling the crew I did that yesterday, which is difficult.  So you're full-time in philanthropy then, basically.  Yeah.  And you have done a lot of things, but it seems somewhat of a focus in journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, right now, from my point of view, and my background is computer science is somewhat abstract.  I'm looking at information warfare in different forms.  The big priorities these days are like helping with cybersecurity, fighting disinformation,  or as the cool kids call it, influence operations, and also countering harassment,  first focusing on the worst of it, which is directed against women journalists.  There's other areas, including helping vets, women in tech, and as you've seen, pigeon rescue.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  By the way, here is the site, Pallomacy.  It's pigeon diplomacy at pigeonrescue.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While you're at it, Google Craig Newmark and pigeons, and there are some great pictures.  You'll see.  Craig gets up close and personal with pigeons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I don't know if I would do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, some people think of them as flying rats, but I guess, Craig, you're an open-minded fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, those were stunt pigeons.  Okay, good.  As it turns out, pigeon pants is a thing.  They're diapers.  And you want the pigeon to be wearing the diaper before it flies onto your shoulder to coo lovingly.  Oh, 100%. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Note to self.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'm just glad you explained that the diapers were for the pigeons.  I was unclear at the beginning, and now I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you get to a certain age.  A little bit better.  I'd rather call them pigeon pants than depends.  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  We know how much Ant Prude loves TikTok musicals, and I'm sure that's why Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just for Ant.  Are you kidding me?  Just for Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  When I say I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like, what comes to mind?  I don't know, Wizard of Oz?  Nothing.  It's the grace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could be blue, I could be violet sky.  Is this a Grace Kelly movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I don't know where it's from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just know it's all over Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Is this Yentl or something other?  Sounds like Yentl.  It's not Yentl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One person can record all the parts, or two people can record all the parts.  And so it's quite popular.  You can go down below the one you're going to show and show why it's popular.  I'll show you.  I show the girls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Collaborative is the key.  Yeah, here's some girls.  This is called the Grace Kelly singing challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like.  I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful, I could be purple, I could be anything you like.  It's pretty.  It's like a round.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  But it can just be one person singing.  I like it though when it's an online video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  It's cool that they have this in a dad gum mobile app.  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I have to say, I'm a TikTok fan.  My son now has 200,000 plus followers and millions of views on every video.  So I'm a believer.  Anyway, the reason...  I'm a sucker for these.  They're all pretty to listen to.  I love them.  I love them.  I love the singing ones.  So apparently, I didn't know this, but Ryan Reynolds, who is of course...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, this happened yesterday.  The owner of Mint Mobile.  Yeah, don't give away the surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And Will Ferrell are working together in a movie called A Christmas Carol.  And Ryan Reynolds decided, you know, as long as he's got nothing to do, because this is the problem, frankly, being on a movie set, you got a lot of free time in between takes.  So he thought he'd try it himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I could be brown, I could be blue.  I could be violet sky.  I could be hurtful.  I could be purple.  I could be anything you like.  I could be brown, I could be blue.  I could be violet sky.  How's he doing the harmony?  I could be hurtful...  You layer it on.  No, I didn't.  Like an editor.  I could be brown, I could be blue.  I could be violet sky.  I could be hurtful.  That's pretty good.  He's a good singer.  I could be anything you like.  I could be brown, I could be blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could be violet sky.  I could be hurtful.  I could be purple.  I could be anything you like.  I could be brown, I could be blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I could be violet sky.  And will ferrel walks in and does the high part.  I could be hurtful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could be purple.  I could be anything you like.  I could be brown.  I could be blue.  I could be violet sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I could be...  Where's my,...  That's pretty damn good.  That's really freaking good.  I hope this Christmas Carol is a musical.  That's really freaking good.  And apparently it is a musical, so I guess they can both sing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and it's going to start like a musicals.  That's not going to happen.  That would be no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  No, negative sir.  That was good though.  I give credit where credit is due that to be able to do this inside of a mobile app is...  We're going to make him a Tik Toker sooner or later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why Tik Tok is so amazing because it enables that kind of collaboration and remixing  and it's just, it's a new level of content creation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So wait, I've got a better...  For you Ant, I will say...  No, well, I was going to say, because I thought of Ant this week actually, I realized I finally  learned how to do makeup and everyone was like, oh, just why don't you use a tutorial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I was just going to say, Stacey, you look really good today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, thank you.  I did not.  I didn't.  I don't have contour, but I finally learned how to do contour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I was just going to say, I didn't want to say anything.  No, no, no.  I noticed right away.  I wanted to be, because I know people, you know, Stacey, nobody likes it personal, but  given that you've raised this point, whatever you're doing, it's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I had an event earlier, so that's...  Oh, okay.  But YouTube gave people infinite time, so their makeup tutorials were killer.  I was like, I do not need to watch someone for 10 minutes, but for like a minute, people  can get everything I need.  And so, yeah, I'm like, screw YouTube.  Tik Tok is where it's at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Well, and as we mentioned last week, Tik Tok has more viewing now, more view.  People spend more time watching Tik Toks than they do YouTube videos, and that's probably  why.  Short attention span.  I talked to my son a lot about this because he's really become the Tik Tok master.  He's now my teacher on Tik Tok, quarter of a million followers and growing fast.  You can go up to three minutes, but he's found that it's better if they're shorter.  So by the way, today, he posted a video today, 4.6 million views so far.  This one, this one we showed, I thought we showed this one last week.  I would like to eat that.  One of the things he does is he's big on sound effects.  I love those sound effects.  Natural sound, Foley ASMR, whatever you want to call it.  He's the master.  The other thing he does, and I talked about this, is it's not clear when it's looping,  So people watch it over and over and over again because they're not sure it got to the end.  It's like a high quality gift.  He does that very consciously.  How long does it take to edit?  Half a day.  So here's his most recent.  This is a duck sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Nice choice of music for this one.  I know, I told him that.  I said he gives me a lot of power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I've heard it I think a couple of times on some of my videos, so maybe it's just trending on the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I asked him how he figured out what music places he does.  He's just listening to Spotify a lot and trying to find something that works with the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plus it's the real sound too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  The real sound is what's key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  So yeah, 8 million views, 7.5 million views, 3.5 million views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was asking you before and we got to interrupt ourselves.  How do you turn that into a living?  I keep asking that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Try not to be that dead.  When his mom and I got married, his mom's brother said don't marry a DJ.  Those guys are the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  They're not going anywhere.  Just a subtle nudge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  But that's true.  I realized I was doing the same thing with him.  Oh come on, that's not real media.  But it is real media.  This is modern media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He could get invited to the Met Gala next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I wouldn't be surprised at all.  I hope he wears that sweatshirt and sunglasses and the cheesy porn stash.  All of which we try to discourage him from wearing.  My 88-year-old mom says don't wear a hat, Henry.  You're so cute.  Why are you wearing a hat?  But I just tell her mom, it's a different generation.  We worked out this morning together.  I'm always querying him.  What are you learning?  He's really paying close attention to the feedback that he gets.  Both from comments but also views.  And he's tuning it slowly closer and closer.  You can see it makes a difference.  What kind of metrics do they give him besides just views?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I'll ask him, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You asked how do you make money.  There's a couple of ways to make money.  TikTok's ads are interstitial.  They're not in your video.  Unlike YouTube, you don't have pre-roll, post-roll, mid-roll.  There's nothing tied to your video.  You don't get any of that ad revenue.  It's like Instagram.  Every few videos there's an ad.  I see a lot more big brands on TikTok.  TikTok is doing suddenly very well.  But they do have a $100 million creators fund.  That gets parceled out.  He's got 4 million views, maybe $600.  It's not a big...  That sounds like YouTube money.  What TikTok does, because they know they're not sharing revenue with you,  they allow you to have ads.  You can sell your own ads in there.  The CPMs are something like $5.  Which if you have 7 million views is $7,000.  Nice.  Is that right? No.  I don't know.  $5 per thousand.  Chat room.  $7,000,000 is $7,000,000.  That's a lot of money.  Is that right?  Could that be right?  Scooter, save us, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  It's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Can you do it?  No, I just did it.  That's right.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was signing up for the Pixel Super Fans Club because I'm like,  we're going to talk about Google eventually.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Math?  Scooter is actually saying that the US TikTok creator fund is actually now,  they plan to spend $200 million over the next 12 months,  August to August 2020 to 2021,  and will be upwards of a billion in the next three years.  And more than double that globally.  They have to because otherwise creators, that's what killed Vine.  You got to share that money back or creators go, yeah, we'll go somewhere else.  And he told me YouTube Shorts is doing this too.  So, nevertheless.  Is he cross posting it to anywhere?  Yeah, he puts it on Instagram as well.  And I told him, do YouTube Shorts.  Why not?  What's wrong?  Why would you?  Why not?  I don't know if he's going to.  I don't.  But the next step for him would be to going out and selling ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or signing a deal with like having a knife company or a chopping block company or pan  company.  Or Sir La Tabla.  Exactly.  And then he just goes and does cooking demos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Exactly.  And he's going to be a guest poster on the Tastemade Instagram this week.  Tastemade is big.  That's a big Instagram.  That's branding there.  So, I think next year we'll see what I've been saying about my son.  Don't be a TikTok star.  They don't make any money.  I might be wrong.  I think it's not influencers.  He's a content creator.  And actually, my feeling is even if he doesn't make money on TikTok, the skills he's getting  are useful and we'll get him plenty of hangs for his product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  That's the one thing I can say about TikTok is the way it puts constraints on the content  creator.  It's telling you, okay, I need to create content that is 60 seconds long, that is going  to make people want to stop to click on it first of all, and then make them want to watch  it all the way through for 60 seconds.  And then make them want to say, hey, did you see this?  Let me show this to you.  That's pretty daggum challenging and not everybody can do that.  Yeah.  It's iambic pentameter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  Yeah.  Right?  It's the limits of poetry and art, the constraints make the art.  Yeah.  So true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And it also means...  Wait, Jeff.  This is true of YouTube and Twitter and everything else.  If you're going to be a content creator, you have to work your ass off.  You have to post every day.  You cannot stop.  It's a content machine.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was just going to say, Jeff, how does this relate back to Gutenberg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Give me time.  Give me time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Since you asked, actually, two, one, Shakespeare found that verse sold better than prose.  Interesting.  And so Shakespeare was the first major playwright who ended up with a real market in Paris.  A real market in printed plays.  So around the same time that Montaigne invented the essay and Cervantes, the modern novel,  and a guy named Johann Corollis, the newspaper all around 1600, Shakespeare proved the market  for printed plays since you asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  If you don't mind, I'd like to take us back to the 21st century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I'm just teasing.  I love it.  I could go on.  I love Shakespeare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Today, Amazon announced in limited edition $229.99 Echo Studio featuring Billie Eilish's  cover art for Happier Than Ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Oh, God, who cares?  Who the hell wants that?  All right, you want to see it?  Here's what it looks like.  You can have an emo teenager smoothing away on your Echo device.  I guess if you're really a big fan of Billie Eilish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just seems so niche.  And I guess it's just a cover print job.  I don't understand.  I'm curious about the economics of this and why Amazon's doing something like this on hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Because like, well, they have like a children's Echo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember they had they have a children's Echo and they actually did a line of Echo, like  smaller $99 speakers that were like the Diane von Pfostberg and two other designers that you could buy with their imagery on their Echoes.  It's a little expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Is $230 the normal price for an Echo Studio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, yes.  That's they're usually $250, aren't they?  This is $30 more, says the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Just for Billie Eilish.  You know, I would buy it for the kitsch factor, frankly.  People I know would come and say, why do you have some woman's face on your?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who knows?  Maybe maybe Shutterfly will start to allow us to print out our own photos on an Echo show or Echo Studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I mean, it's clearly for the massive Billie Eilish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are a lot of Billie Eilish fans out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  There are.  Definitely there are.  Oh, wait a minute.  The Echo Studio is 200 bucks.  This is 230 bucks.  So, yeah, you're right.  30 bucks more.  30 bucks more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  It also comes with, what, four months of Amazon Music, which does not seem like a smoking deal to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It should come with lots of Billie Eilish music.  No, six.  You get six months to Amazon Music Unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  And you can listen to happier than ever in spatial audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the only thing you can listen to on this device is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Over and over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  Because you're a big enough fan to have Billie Eilish on your device itself.  So they figure that's that's probably what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Here's what it's here's what it would look like on your Billie Eilish desk with your Billie Eilish poster and your Billie Eilish wallpaper.  It's really funny.  It's a puzzling device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I read it up because I'm like, who is this?  How expensive is it to make?  What is the what is the what was the conversation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  If even like Alexa could be Billie Eilish's voice, that would be cool.  But no, they haven't done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes sense, though, because that's a digital product.  But this is a physical product.  It's going to sit there forever.  I just I thought it was I was flummoxed.  Flummoxed, I tell you.  Flummoxed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You probably don't want Alexa whispering to you is the thing.  So you probably don't want Billie Eilish's voice.  You know, she talks like this.  She does lots of whispering, whispering.  She's ASMR.  Also joining us, Jeff Jarvis, who we have to we have to do the full introduction here.  And I've got it. It's a mouthful.
