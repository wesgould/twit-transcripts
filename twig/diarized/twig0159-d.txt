In fact, as you'll see in a minute, we're going to talk about a brand new kind of response to Twitter.  Before we do that, let me introduce our panelists starting to my left, Gina Trapani.  Hey Gina, good to have you.  Great to be here.  How's the meatballs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good, I got meat on the batch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I meant to send you an email. I want that recipe.  I'll send you the recipe.  I was craving Grandma Trapani's meatballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nona Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nona Trapani, pardon me. How could I say Grandma?  Also with us, Nona Jarvis.  Primitrually gray.  BuzzMachine.com and the author of a great book called, well, First What Would Google Do?, which you should read that.  But also the new book is Public Parts.  And also with us, Kevin Marks from his backyard.  Kevin currently works at Salesforce, but he's also the host of TumbleVision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't believe it. We always see him at home.  Does he really work there?  I work from home. Google has the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know the Google thing that decides when you're at work and when you're at home?  It thinks I work at the train station.  I swipe up on here and it says distance to work.  Oh yeah, that's a funny thing at Google now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does kind of make these decisions about where you think you're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It decides my work is the train station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very funny.  And we talked a little bit about this on Twitter, certainly, and I believe we talked a little bit about it last week on Twig.  Dalton Caldwell, who is a very interesting fellow, started iMeme, then went on after selling iMeme to create Pick Please,  which unfortunately a few months before this thing called Instagram came along,  and then pivoted into something called App.net, which was a marketing tool for people making apps,  and has pivoted again to something very interesting.  It all started with a blog post.  Let's welcome Dalton Caldwell for just the first segment of the show.  Hi, Dalton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, how's it going? Thanks for having me.  It's a pretty short notice, but here I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, like none at all.  We were talking about App.net and we said, well, I wonder if Dalton's around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sitting here getting my slides ready for an Airbnb tech talk tonight.  Awesome. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how did this all start? It started with a blog post, I gather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so sorry about the sirens. I'm right next to a fire station. We'll pass in a second.  It's fine. We can hear you.  So it started with my blog post, What Twitter Could Have Been, which I wrote for my own purposes.  It was not meant to start any project. It was not meant to be what it became.  It was just some, it was four paragraphs that I threw together on a Sunday.  And my point was that I didn't get Twitter for about two years at all as a user.  And then one of my programmer friends explained to me that it was actually an API  and that I shouldn't worry too much about what the UI does.  I should think more about what you can build with the API.  And at the second I got that, I became a huge fan of it and, you know, completely changed my mind about what it was.  And that over time, as they moved away from being the open API platform kind of company,  I think that a lot of potential was lost and that it's still a really great company and still a really cool company.  And I admire what they're doing and what it's for.  But, you know, there was a hole in the market that was created when they chose to kind of shut down the API  and that I really wish as a developer that this product existed.  And my thesis is that if they would have stayed building kind of an open API company,  the ecosystem would have been more powerful than what we currently have of the Facebook Open Graph ecosystem,  which is arguably the largest social platform we have as developers right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wrote in the blog post that as you understood a hugely divisive internal debate occurred among Twitter employees,  one camp wanted to build the business around their real-time API, in effect be a kind of a dial tone for a messaging system for the Internet.  In this scenario, Twitter would have turned into something like a real-time cloud API company.  The other camp looked at Google's advertising model for inspiration, decided their own version of AdWords would be the right way to go.  And obviously that second group won. Yes.  And, you know, now Twitter is going to do a TV show.  They've got ads. If you watched during the Olympics, I mean, it really has become an ad-supported system.  But what's wrong with that, Dalton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, nothing's wrong with it. It's their prerogative to do so.  And I think a lot of people misconstrue my critiques, is that of saying that what they're doing is wrong, they're bad, and they shouldn't be around.  That is not the basis of my critiques.  The basis of my critiques is that as an app developer, shutting down the ecosystem isn't great.  And I would have been building more Twitter stuff myself if I had more confidence that the platform would have stayed stable and that developers need a social platform to build on.  We need this to build good software. And if Twitter is saying it can't be it, well, that's not great. That's too bad. We need to find something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we envisioned, I think, a whole world of automatic Twitter bots doing everything from telling us what's going on in the weather to what's going on in the World Series.  I mean, just this whole thing of this messaging system.  So you did a little pivot. You said, well, maybe I could use app.net. And you created, you set up a page, join.app.net.  What was your idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the idea here was I wasn't sure what I was going to do. Again, to be transparent, I was weighing whether to sell the company and just go work at a big company.  And I've been public about that. And I decided that I really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was also a very good post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you.  The Facebook post? Yeah, that was great.  I decided that I didn't really want to sell the company and that it would be a shame to just go sell the company at this point in time.  And that what I really wanted to do was just go for it and try to build the world that I want to see.  And again, to be transparent with you guys, I had just come from FooCamp. And that's...  Gene was there. We didn't talk.  But I was hugely inspired by a lot of the sessions at FooCamp about the open web and about some of the mistakes that were made when trying to build our social platforms.  And so I kind of walked away from it with this idea that we all created the social web in the past 10 years.  And I realized that there's a lot of people that I was in the room at FooCamp with helped create this stuff.  And that it's not like we should just wipe up our hands and say, it's all done. This is the best that it can be.  And that actually there's a room for people to try new approaches and that we shouldn't just give up and assume that we're stuck with what we're stuck with.  And that was very much my mentality coming out of FooCamp and what inspired me to be crazy enough to do this.  So that's what was going on in my head. Do I really want to sell the company right now?  Or do I want to try to be as optimistic as possible and rethink the assumptions we've made about the social web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why did... You know, Evan Prodromo did Identica, which is now StatusNet, with kind of a similar idea.  A free, open source, federated internet messaging system.  You're not open in the sense that you're not open source. You're open in the sense that the APIs are open.  And the real key to this was that it would be a paid service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's correct. I mean, if you know my background, I fought the digital music industry for 10 years.  And, you know, if you Google me, you'll see that I got sued by the music industry and negotiated and settled and did licensing deals in the music industry.  And that dealing with copyright and media companies was what most of my career thus far has been about.  And my takeaway from that was that actually the people in the music industry are actually good people.  And I think people don't give them enough credit that they are good people that want to do the right thing.  It's just that the business models of the music industry are predicated on controlling content.  And once you have a media business model that's predicated on controlling content,  you're going to end up making choices that consistently lock down access to the content by third parties.  And so in a paid services model, you are providing infrastructure that pushes bits through the service.  And you're not really interested in trying to control them. You're not interested in trying to see what's inside the packets and manipulate what's inside them.  You're just providing a service for your customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of like the idea of saying this is a business and it's that old meta filter meme.  If you're not paying for it, you're the product. So the idea here is the product is the product. You get to do what you want with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a third model though, isn't there, which was talked about after you released, Dalton,  of starting something that's truly open source out there and it's federated and that no one controls it.  No one owns it. Obviously, there's a cost problem there.  But you start something like that's truly open and or even like for that matter,  WordPress that's on an open source platform and then they build upon a commercial company upon it and others can build a company upon it.  So there's a third model there. Did you consider that model too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. Again, to be very honest, that is a totally valid model and people have been working at it for a while.  Some of the people I talked to at food camp were people that have been trying to build this.  That's where I met the co-creator of PubSubHubbub and we spent a lot of time talking about it.  And again, I want to make clear that I hope people build exactly those kinds of things.  And I don't have this idea that we're going to be all things to all people and solve for everything.  My model for this business is actually GitHub where Git is open source and GPL and anyone can use it and install it on their own server.  But GitHub is a company and it's a for-profit company.  And it's actually really useful that it's operated as a hosting service.  No one is forced to use GitHub that does not want to use GitHub.  You know, you just run it on your service on your own servers, excuse me.  But if you choose to use GitHub, there's a lot of advantages of having this hosted service,  of having them innovate on features, of having to not worry about keeping the site up, et cetera, et cetera.  And similarly Dropbox, anyone could roll their own Dropbox using R-Sync.  You would set up an AWS instance, set up R-Sync, download some code.  You could kind of roll your own Dropbox and I'm sure a lot of people do so.  But I think it's ultimately good whether or not you use it or not that a service like Dropbox exists, that that company exists.  And so that's kind of where I see this business fitting in the model is that we are not going to be a solution to the things that Jeff just talked about.  But I see this as a piece of the infrastructure that it's better to have exist than not.  Does that make sense, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm also curious to get you and Gina going.  I've quizzed Gina often every time that Twitter pulled back and said, no developers, we want to do this now.  And I said, how can you still develop in that environment?  And Gina says, well, this is part of the risk and so on and so forth.  I won't speak for you, Gina.  But I'd be curious to hear you two and your viewpoints on especially the Twitter ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I have to say, like, I didn't I was pretty skeptical about App.Net.  I signed up as a developer.  I didn't think it would get funded and it did.  So I'm really thrilled that Dalton is proving me wrong because I was at the session, the open web session that he was at at Food Camp.  And I really believe in the principles behind App.Net.  As a developer, I always try to go to where the people are.  And I guess my my kind of question about whether or not this something like this can, you know, succeed is, you know, just getting, you know, making the app accessible to everyone is part of that is making it free.  That's why Facebook and Twitter have gained critical mass.  And so and there are kind of problems that get introduced when you have to, you know, when people have to pay 50 bucks a year to basically access something that they can get for free otherwise.  I'm kind of looking at it less from a principled standpoint, which I'm absolutely right with Dalton to a kind of more practical kind of standpoint.  Like as a developer, like I certainly want to develop App.Net, but it's you know, you got to get the people.  And now, again, I hope Dalton proves me wrong gets and gets a ton of people to do this.  And, you know, also, so that aside, the other thing that I think about when I look at open protocols, I think about aim, you know, like AOL had this instant messenger protocol and it issued its own client.  And then a lot of other people built a lot of other clients.  And then there was Jabber.  Then there was, you know, I see you or whatever.  Now we all sort of run instant messenger clients and I don't really know what protocol I'm talking to people over.  Right. I've just got all my buddies in a list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so I'm wondering if that's the sort of second version of it.  I mean, the first version was when people were trying to reverse engine.  There was a huge fight.  Microsoft and AOL were having protocol change fights.  Microsoft is trying to write an interoperating creating client and aimed kept changing it.  And one of the reasons that the Jabber protocol won out was because the people could build multi clients for an eventually aim after aim licensed it to Apple for I chat.  They got a bit more relaxed about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, right. So in this kind of situation, like an app that open protocol, are we envisioning that lots of different companies will be able to run at that?  And that's the question.  They can all talk to one another.  Is that is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you how do you preserve the openness and have a closed source?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where the pubs of our activity streams, etc.  Yeah. So we stayed as blob comes in.  Right. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we've stayed at support for all of those.  And again, because I was a fool and I made friends with a co-creator pubs of hubbub very, very familiar with the thinking behind behind these open standards.  And I mean, the fact that I was even invited to hopefully shows that I'm on team open standards.  And so my belief is that the back end hosted infrastructure may or may not be open sourced in the future.  I'm not going to promise it yet.  And there's a bunch of reasons why GitHub itself is an open source, meaning that the code that they write.  But at the very least, if the protocol is always open, there can be infinite implementations.  And I'm fully aware that new implementations and competitive services, what we're doing will be built.  I say this in some of my blog posts that this is not necessarily going to be a huge company, but that's OK.  Right. It's it's all interoperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what's interesting, I guess, because it uses standards.  You don't need to federate. There's just you're just an implementation of a standard.  Is that right? That is federation, as I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, so that's a better way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really? If you if you didn't pop some hubbub right, then you end up with federation.  And one of that's one of the reasons that it was very hard to get Twitter and Facebook to adopt that is that their worldview was there.  The center of the world. And they didn't see federation as a goal.  They look at the protocol and say this is inefficient for what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it may be with all due respect why status net has not taken off, because although it's federatable, you have to run status net on your server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. No, this is a problem Gina and I were talking about as well, where the challenge is getting stuff running on a server is hard.  The same problem Gina has with the stuff that she's building.  Yeah.  Yeah. And that's something we need to we need to make that easier.  You know, there are there are things that make that a little easier, including, you know, Heroku, the company I work for,  and it makes it easier to redeploy things, but it's still not trivial.  And that is an issue. Being able to get stuff running the cloud is still hard.  I mean, so a couple of analogies.  So GitHub is slightly different because GitHub has a business model that is if your stuff is public, it's free.  If it's private, you have to pay.  And that may be a model that would suit.  And if in effect, that's that's what status net has done, that they have a model that's very like that, which is if you want to do public stuff,  they will host stuff for you.  You can have the source if you want to do an in-house activity stream.  Then they will send you services to do that.  So so status net is in some ways close to GitHub than you are.  You have a different model that's more like a classic hosting model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we should explain that.  But what Dalton did was a Kickstarter style fundraising drive that said if you want to be in app net, you can join for fifty dollars.  If you wanted to be developer, you could join for one hundred dollars per year.  And you said you said I could fund this myself, but I think it's better to show to see if there's interest.  And you raised how much money, Dalton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it closed at twelve thousand and change backers and eight hundred and three thousand.  I took a screenshot of it.  It's posted up there.  Can I talk about the free thing real quick?  Yes.  So look, do you remember what Twitter looked like the day it launched with the like gluten?  Green Google logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I didn't see it to a month or two later.  But you should look it up.  It's pretty funny.  It's ugly as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got it right here.  And it's missing an E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they spelled it differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And deny the day Twitter launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what it looked like.  Yeah.  And what I want people to understand is that this is a long play.  Right.  And for you, we want something that's sustainable.  Financially, any short to medium term.  And that's very important to us, because we're not sustainable financially.  Then it'd be very difficult for me to state with a straight face that this is something dependable that people could build on.  Right.  Like that's that kind of transparency is very important to me.  Additionally, we don't want it to grow too big, too fast, because we want to make sure we can scale the technology behind the service.  Right.  The worst thing we could do is all of a sudden we start fail wailing all the time because we're overwhelmed with new users signing up and they're disappointed.  Thirdly, one of the things that that did costello said on stage, as I recall, and I could try to find the Twitter Twitter is, hey, if we were going to be an API company, we would have just launched with all third party apps.  I don't know.  I can find I think was in the Fred Wilson post.  I'll find a link to that.  But his point was they were already so far along that the idea of maintaining third party apps was too late in the game to to put the toothpaste back in the tube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Fred, Fred earlier, just to remember what I said, Fred earlier had said when I complained about some Twitter functionality, he said, that's what the outside apps and developers are for Jeff.  Yeah, too bad.  So they're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What joined up app done it is today is we're not trying to be all things to all people.  We're not trying to appeal to all people.  In my first blog post, I discussed the Paul Graham essay about how to start a new search engine.  And his advice was not to build something that appeals to all people, rather build something that appeals to 10,000.  He calls him hackers.  But what he what he means is is Uber nerds and not to worry about it being too nerdy, because if you can build something that's used by 10,000 Uber nerds, you're going, you know, that's a huge step forward to get towards something that would be Google scale.  And so the way to think about what we're doing now, vis a vis the pay model and vis a vis appealing to developers, et cetera, et cetera, is that we're trying to get third party developers to build on this as fast as possible.  And in fact, we originally weren't going to build a website hosted at Alpha app net at all.  We basically had to do it to prove that this wasn't vaporware.  And the goal is to nurture the third party ecosystem.  And a lot of developers in there and they've already built.  If you look at our at our GitHub page, they've already built 20 or 30 integrations in the past seven days since our eight guys been open.  That's the future of the company.  Yeah, there you go.  People are building, you know, half dozen iOS apps and Android and desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really amazing.  And this is very encouraging to see this kind of response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's the future of the service.  I would think of alpha.app.net is our reference implementation.  And my intention is to just open source that sucker, put it on GitHub and and stop maintaining it at some point in the search in the future.  Right.  This is our platform could do.  It's not the service.  Right.  That's so that's what we're doing.  And I understand that a lot of non-technical people have trouble understanding that and they see something like a paywall and they're reading all these conspiracy theories into some sort of, you know, I've brought all sorts of interesting things here.  But the idea is we're just trying to put strap developer community.  And this was the way to do it.  And I think it's working based on that on that GitHub page.  So I'm adult Dalton.  Sites that this is working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you do you and I'm one of those not very bright people about this.  I want to get a sense of the long game that you have in two questions, two ways.  One of does is this then if 10,000 geeks use it, does this become a way to pressure the Twitter is to pressure the closed systems to to act differently and open up because they have to.  And then the second question, a little more general, is if you look at the areas that kind of have worked in that pressure view that Firefox isn't number one doesn't have to be number one.  It led to competition.  It led to I think Chrome to an extent as well.  And it led to a much more healthy ecosystem.  You know, ditto for Apache taking away what was going to be Netscape's hegemony over server software and so on and so on.  So where do you see you fitting into the ecosystem?  Where do you want to be in that?  As we hear you see other closed systems that we we great against.  What's the right model that you would push others to do?  And in the end, what's the what happens to the old closed system when there is this new pressure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, sure.  My vision is that again, I point to GitHub.  It's a smallish company.  I think that 50 or 60 employees.  It's very profitable.  It seems like a really fun place to work at.  They're not trying to be all things to all people.  It's it's it's a smallish growing fun place to work.  And the way my vision for this company is, is not that we're going to be building a new Facebook or building a new Twitter.  I think that's not at all what I'm interested in doing.  I just want to build in a cool infrastructure company in the spirit of, you know, building an ISP in the early 90s or a BBS in the 80s or something like that.  Right. This is an enabling technology.  And I think history will judge how compelling or useful it was based on the ecosystem of what developers build on top of us, not on how rich we get or how many employees we have or what our valuation.  Right. So I want to I'm asking your influence on the ecosystem.  Oh, so I think that this will definitely have an impact.  I mean, it already has in the press.  You know, it's it's clear that there's a lot of interesting PR games happening and we'll see more and more.  And so I was kind of making these moves have changed the tone regarding how third party app developers are being treated.  And I really don't know what will change.  And I think it does come down to financial incentives and business models.  And so I'm not convinced that that Facebook and Twitter are going to be able to radically change their stance towards third party developers because it's just not in their financial best interest to do so.  And they have a fairly tight deadline to hit their financial numbers.  So I I don't I don't know what they're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, again, talking about the future, do you imagine then a world at which some point where you run a server, there are many, many clients that are interacting.  You may not even run a client.  You have a reference client. That's it.  And then people pay you. And is it going to be fifty dollars per user is per year.  Is that the is that the going to be so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So financial stuff, I I really don't know.  I'm going to talk about this at my tech talk tonight.  We've tried to just make something sustainable off a small number of users.  And as the service grows, then we have the freedom to do things like either freemium as things like Dropbox or GitHub.  And again, I'm not promising those. I'm just saying that is certainly a doable option.  Right. And the other thing that I'm going to experiment with that I blogged about is a third party revenue share proposal where there's a mechanism by which  your you, the user's money flows through to third party app developers. Right.  So if you're a third party app developer and you're building on top of app net and you're adding value and you're you're creating utility for users  through your software that you're getting paid and the economics are flowing through to you.  Because again, I think that's what's great about about the app store and things like that.  There's nothing downsides of it. But at the end of the day, you can you can make a lot of money if you build fantastic IOS.  Software. And I think that, again, in my vision, third party developers add the value to things like Twitter and Facebook.  And so they should be getting paid. And it's a complete inversion of what we're seeing now in my in my humble opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's true. You've closed it off to developers at this point.  You can't go and pay 50 bucks. I mean, 100 bucks to be a developer at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you can. Everyone can sign up. What happened is that in the last 48 hours of the campaign, the number of backers doubled.  And so we have six thousand alpha requests in our queue right now. And we're working through them.  And again, to be transparent with you guys, we wanted to put in moderation tools because if we just dumped six thousand new people in our tiny little alpha,  it's going to get hairy really fast. It's already happening.  And so we're not trying to do some kind of conspiracy to keep people out or something.  It's just like, thank you for letting me in. Very happy. We're human. We're here. Here's our little office.  I have 300 emails in my inbox. I have to speak in front of 300 people tonight.  You know, we're we want to get everybody in. We want everybody to be kind to each other.  We want to build our moderation tools. We need to build our terms of service, which we're going to be sharing on GitHub to solicit feedback on the way to think about this.  This is an alpha test to validate. This is real. And to to spark people's imagination to start building integrations on top of it.  And a couple of things on that is like in terms of novel integrations, we spend a lot of time on this one GitHub issue talking about private messaging.  And I think it's the coolest thing ever. It's GitHub issue 33.  And the idea there is you can have the infrastructure to do something like you could implement like a group tech service like Beluga or GroupMe using the semantics in there.  You could use it for turn based games. You could use it to build something kind of like a Google Wave.  We're trying to build on all these semantics to do things that look nothing like the Twitter UI. And that's part of the power of the API.  But again, given Google Wave, one of my big takeaways was that they made their UI try to do too much.  Yeah, this is just as powerful as an API of an API as Google Wave is.  But we made a really dumb, simple, easy to understand UI to show it to people so that people don't get spun out on it.  And again, people are freaking out because our UI looks too much like Twitter. But I think that kind of misses the point.  That's just our attempt. I mean, it's easy to understand right out of the gate. Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And that actually that's a good approach.  I have to say I'm a lot more interested in developing for app.net now that I've kind of I feel like I have the kind of the fuller the fuller story.  I mean, the next 12 months or so. So you've got a bunch of people signed up and backing the project.  These are obviously people who were attracted to the principles that you laid out in your video and that are kind of dissatisfied with the way they're being treated if they were developers.  So if anything, you've got a kind of fantastic developer salon of the sort of most elite early adopters going on, you know, community wise.  And then you're going to have all these different apps getting built, which is which is great.  I'm impressed with the amount of developer activity you've had already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you. That it's this is the coolest thing I've ever done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really amazing when you hit something, it just takes off.  The fact that you in just the last couple of days made your goal.  It actually looked it looked like you weren't going to make it. Yeah. Yeah, it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think what turned the turning point was the alpha. And so maybe if we wouldn't have shipped it.  Yeah, it's good you did. You know, there were downsides to ship the alpha.  One of the downsides was we couldn't guarantee usernames would be given.  So there's username collisions. And so there's some folks unhappy with us that I understand.  But otherwise, we would have to restrict all alpha invites to hit the end of the username claiming date.  So like there was there was definitely some downsides to shipping the alpha when we did.  But at the end of the day, we called an audible. We did it.  And I think that's what put us over the goal. And I guess glad we did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you so much, Dalton. I know you want to get back to your slides. We're going to let you go.  Congratulations. Yeah, it's exciting.  And I think a lot of people do have no idea what you're talking about, but we get it.  And so we're going to explain it. Join.app.net.  Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Great to talk to you. Thank you.  On last minute, I mean, literally 30 seconds before the show began, we said, hey, what if we get Dalton?  And he was very kind to join us, even though he's on deadline.  So maybe this is really one to go to Kevin Marks.  You know, a lot of people say, oh, it's just a gated community. It's a $50 Twitter clone.  I don't get it. What's the point?  Obviously, and that was one of the risks of creating alpha, creating this app.net alpha is that it's concretized it.  But it really isn't. It's about standards.  So would you explain to me, PubSubHubbub, Kevin, why this is really open and not just Dalton's good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, it would be nice to see if it is really open.  That's the Dalton says going to do that. And we for now, we can trust him to hold him to that.  And, you know, we're his customers, so he should be listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's 12,000 people who who will hold them to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's the difference. So this is the difference between something that is web like where there is an open standard,  which means that anyone can build things that interoperate and something that is owned by a whole company.  And we seem to have been so blogging was like this blogging ended up being something that was done by lots of companies in parallel,  but interoperated because you're primarily publishing web pages.  And then we had some other stands for moving things back and forth.  RSS, Atom and the various ways of sending comments stuff back and forth.  So there was so it was some infrastructure, but it wasn't owned by anyone.  Lots of things that have been built since then do roughly the same thing.  But add features that only work within that environment.  Tumblr is one example. Tumblr has a lot of nice social features, but they're restricted to Tumblr.  Twitter is another example.  Twitter has these the at mention stuff that works very nicely, but it only works inside Twitter.  And so there's a chunk of standards that we're trying to do this in a distributed way that some of which I worked on as part of the things that came out of OpenSocial.  And some of these and we have various implementations of these.  But the challenge is always with any of these things that are that are mass usage, you tend to converge on one or two deliveries, delivery places for them, if you like.  And that's that's the sort of inherent tension.  So what do the network effect? You want to be where all your friends are right?  And, you know, the better answer is we have a protocol that actually makes things interoperate.  But getting those built and actually doing that is more work than building one that just works within your site.  And once you are one of these successful sites, your incentive is to do less of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turn yourself into a silo. Yes. Which is what Twitter did.  Yeah. So it remains to be seen what Dalton will do.  But but if he lives up to his commitments, then what he's done is seed something that would be a more open.  But but I think, see, I'm very concrete.  I think a lot of our listeners are concrete and are saying, well, OK, but where what so what site do I use and how does what and how does the stuff I put on that site have anything to do with anything on any other site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's the problem is moving the stuff between sites and connecting them.  And that's the piece that's still messy.  But, you know, PubSubHubbub is designed to do a distributed notification model.  And it works so that you can post something and then anyone who subscribes that can receive the posts, whatever site they happen to be on.  And that's built and it works. It's been running for a few years.  But the challenge is still hooking those up.  And the thing is, if you look at that from the point of view of Facebook or Twitter, it looks horribly inefficient because there are all these you get.  You're basically sending an entire set up tear down for every post and they're moving towards these streaming world views where they're coupling streams together.  So from from their headspace, doing that is inefficient.  And they'd rather read through their systems that are more efficient.  And they have the volume and they say, oh, you guys don't understand volume.  You know, you run into that kind of conversation.  You know, another another company that's a little bit like this is Echo.  You know, Echo, Chris, Chris Lou.  What they have built sounds like what Dalton was originally saying, which is an API back end that roots activity streams.  And what they've built, what they've been doing with that is using that for media companies to host conversations on their own sites, but actually couple them into the rest of the system.  They've been they've been doing that fairly well.  You know, so if you go to, you know, some of the TV companies, which TV companies they're using and you use stuff on their site, you'll be having a conversation in their world.  But it will also be propagating out to your Facebook and Twitter.  And that's something that they've, you know, they've but their back end is running on the activity streams protocol and really stuff back and forth that way.  So there's, you know, there is there are examples of this pure API company, but their customers are other companies.  What Dalton's trying to do is get customers that are individuals.  Now, that's interesting.  You're still in a rush, right, Gina, with the stuff you're trying to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, it's interesting what I like about his Adaltons approach that this idea that you're starting very, very small to so that you don't scale immediately and fail well everywhere.  I mean, if you think about the way that Facebook started, it started on the Harvard campus, right?  You couldn't get on Facebook unless you're at Harvard.  And that's part of the reason why Facebook got really got good early and then they scale.  Then they went to other campuses and then other campuses and then it opened up to everyone.  So I think that that's really kind of smart move in his part.  I mean, I think the question I mean, he's basing this idea is like he think so he's he started this very small service with 12000, you know, kind of, let's say, elite developers who are rich enough to throw 50 bucks or 100 bucks at a social service that no one's on yet.  So these are pretty privileged people with disposable income who are very deep in attack.  Let's just be honest.  So he's starting it with that and he's saying, OK, now I expect the developers are going to show up and build clients that are going to make the service.  So he's he's basing it on this idea that that developers made Twitter what it is.  That's what's one of his premises.  And it's exactly the thing Twitter's turned its back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we I don't know if I completely believe that developers made Twitter what it is today.  I think the developers contributed a lot to Twitter and made some great clients and developers listen to the way that users were using Twitter with replies and hashtags and implemented those features in their clients a lot faster than Twitter did because Twitter was just struggling to stay up.  But I don't know if we can argue that Twitter developers kind of made Twitter what it is today.  You know, is Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber using Twitter when let's face it, they drive a lot of the traffic, you know, because of client developers.  I'm not sure.  So, I mean, he's making a bet.  He's saying developers going to show up and going to make such compelling clients that people are going to say, you know, this is just better than my other options.  I want to start using it.  I mean, I want to see him do it.  I want to see him succeed.  But he's taking a huge risk and I have a lot of respect for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, with all due respect, we're taking the risk.  Well, he's doing OK.  We put a lot of money into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's getting a lot of money.  Yeah, 12000.  To be fair, he hasn't actually cashed all the checks yet.  He's got a bunch of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  You don't the money doesn't go into his account until you have an account.  And so actually, he's he's only got, you know, a small fraction of the total.  But, you know, and the reason I put in 100 bucks, Gina, is because for years I've said Twitter is not what it could have been this exact thing.  And it may end up being something like this has no really front facing user interface.  It may be that I mean, you know, Twitter could have empowered the Internet of Things as much as anything else.  Right.  It could have been a lot of different things.  But once once you have to be an ad supported service, the Internet of Things is not good for you.  It just uses bandwidth for no good reason.  Well, no, I don't really agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I think that if you depend upon this service to bring your stuff, you know, Google brings you now transit schedules that's just kind of Internet of Buses and things.  And but there's value to that as long as there's value to that, as long as you're there reliably as a result and engaged in it.  No, there's value.  But, you know, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, there's a big story about that as well, because all of the there's a whole issue with these metropolitan transit services pulling back their data because they decide that they want their app.  They don't want people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This just happened in New Jersey with New Jersey Transit.  And if you stand in line for a New Jersey Transit train, you never know what the track is.  And there's this horrible cattle call.  So he just got the predictable tracks beforehand, published that so you could go stand by the right track and then J Transit cut him off.  And I'm going to give you his name in a second.  And we're considering the NJ News Coop is looking into whether there's legal help available because it's public information, by the way.  But go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But this is not the first time it's happened.  It's one of the reasons that transit directions are missing from the Apple app.  Is because because these companies want to do their own app, even though they are.  It is public information.  It's we pay taxpayers paid for it.  But that's the world we live in.  And I think that I really think that that's what's interesting about what Dalton's saying.  Even though he's a for profit service, it's in service of the idea of a unmediated channel of creating.  Now, somebody's got to pay for it.  So I like I don't mind paying for services.  Pinball use pinboard as an example.  It's a bookmarking service.  And the amount that it costs to pay for a year of pinboard depends on the number of users and the more users, the less it costs because he's covering his costs.  I think that's a good thing.  I don't think. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Leo, he also the argument, the argument is I still hold out hope for ad support because I have to.  That's how journalists are going to make money.  And I think we're going to have more media and how I want to keep things from going behind paywalls.  The whole world.  So it becomes a real issue of whether people have access to content and services.  So I don't think that and Dalton never said this.  Dalton made very clear that he never said by charging, it's pure.  But some people try to argue that.  I don't think that going to add support necessarily corrupts you or makes means that you can't do other things or you can't control your own example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's a consequence.  Yes. But on media, there's a consequence to Twitter doing that, which is what we need to see our Web page or use our clients where the ads are presented.  Otherwise, a third party client is a bad idea because it takes all of our content without monetizing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's where Tumblr is going another route where David went away from advertising,  but then now says that he's basically trying to take the lessons he has about people and how they operate and bring those same lessons to brands.  And it's up to the brands to come up with compelling experiences people want to go to and actually do spread around.  And he'll share that brands with them.  You know, share that brands with them.  As in any ad, it's up to them to do it well or not.  This idea that you're selling this is a huge issue.  The idea that you're selling audience, that the media is about making content and selling audience is what shifts.  I just want to post about this today because the Knight Foundation has a great news challenge and the genius should have gotten it last time.  But that's another story.  And their next version is mobile.  At the same time, the New York Times has a new CEO who came from the BBC, no revenue experience.  And Arthur Salzberger, the head of the New York Times, says that they're going to go to mobile and social and whatever the third one was, video.  So I see a danger in this idea of going to mobile because we in media will think, well, then we're all going to try to do is make content and sell audiences through a new pipe.  And you know, on the show, I've argued a million times that Google is not about that.  It's about generating signals about people and thus being able to serve them better.  And that's what I think mobile is really about here.  And in that process, you are going to serve merchants to you're going to do it, but you're going to have to do it in new ways.  And we can't assume that that advertising operates as it did anymore.  We can assume the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just think there are different kinds of companies.  I mean, an infrastructure company is not an average media and advertising supported company.  I mean, we're not an infrastructure company, but I don't think that PG&E should be ad supported.  PG&E is our electric company in the state of California.  I should explain.  Con Ed should not be should not be ad supported.  That doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And Twitter really kind of straddled that, you know, really you could have gone either way.  Yeah, it could have been a utility.  Right. They've made a choice to go media.  I mean, they tried different things and that was the one that got some traction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think. Yes, you're right.  You know, they have tried different revenue models over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think the other thing that, you know, but that's by the way, why I admire what Dalton's doing, because he said he's making the choice up front and saying this is we're going to monetize this and see if it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's fair enough.  But I think the other thing about what's what's going on with Twitter at the moment is that they are trying to, you know, weirdly they're trying to move to the web.  The Twitter that we that we grew up with that we're familiar with was was primarily SMS based.  That was the it's it's sort of design center originally.  And everything that was added to that, you know, they spent a long time retaining that aesthetic of it must be less than one hundred and forty characters.  We can fit it into an SMS.  We have mobile clients, but they're it's the SMS on your phone.  And that was that that was their worldview for a while.  And it was the third parties that built richer clients that did a bit more.  And now they've said, no, actually, OK, we can embrace the webness of Twitter and the SMS thing.  We're going to emphasize that a bit.  And therefore we need to build richer clients.  So I can see how their, you know, their mental evolution has been going.  But that that does mean that there's sort of intention with their own, you know, route, if you like.  And I think to some extent, the fact that Twitter works, works very well for celebrities was by accident, not by design.  You know, the the the.  No, but I think it influenced their decision.  Oh, no, of course, if you say decision.  Right. But, you know, this was the thing that, you know, it was clear that it was started out as a group messaging technique.  Right. If we're making SMS is better, making having this message going on.  And those of us who are using in 2006 remember that.  But it very quickly became clear that the asymmetric following model and the at replies being secondary was actually a strong feature for enabling conversation between people who have lots and lots of followers.  Or so you can have also known as broadcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the point.  It's not because the thing is, you can have, you know, me bickering with Rupert Murdoch or whatever going on.  And you can follow both of them and they can decide to follow each other and join back.  Or you can you can have a set of TV personalities who are talking to each other over Twitter that happen to be followed by thousands of people.  But because of the structure of it, it actually is stable up to that level of fame.  Whereas it's that it's quite hard to do that with any other comment system.  And that's so they stabilize something that worked very well there.  And therefore, they're capitalizing on that.  And we saw it through the Olympics.  You know, suddenly all these people never heard of were enormously famous because they were ridiculously skilled and fast and whatever.  And they were able to keep using their Twitter accounts.  And there was a certain amount of trolling going on in responses to that.  But they but they were able to stay using it in that same way while competing in the most intense athletic competition they will ever see and use that.  And that's that's an example of that model suiting that world very well.  And so there is there is there is an affinity between Twitter and mass media that was not there when they started and has had this sort of strange effect of.  I was enormously grumpy that NBC weren't showing the Olympics opening ceremony live because I wanted to watch it with the Twitter stream.  I wanted to see all the English people, the UK people I follow talking about it and joking about it and saying, oh, that was cool.  And it's suddenly maybe you watch what what live television and the company that's bought the monopoly on live television wasn't doing it.  Right. And that was just bizarre.  So that there is that interesting synergy that's there.  And the the echo guys are exploring some of that as well.  But the that has sort of moved away from what it what it what it was when we started using it and what the developers built a lot of the tools for.  Originally, which I can which is the gap that the audience seen and moved into, I think, is saying, OK, we can have conversations with each other.  And to some extent, it's what plus is trying to do as well.  Plus, they're saying, OK, there's a room for this talking to everyone, but there's also room for talking to subsets of people.  And they're trying to explore that space, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to take a break.  There's there's actually Google News, too.  But I think that's such an interesting story.  I'm really glad we could cover it.  It was a good conversation. I'm glad I'm glad we got to address that.  And I think that it's kind of ill understood.  Maybe it's only developers that really get it.  One more stupid question.  Why not XMP instead of PubSub Hubbub?  Wouldn't that be better suited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're doing slightly different things.  OK, so PubSub Hubbub is designed with this publishing propagation model.  XMPP is designed with a chat model.  So there's an assumption there's more of an assumption of symmetry in XMPP.  It's quite how Twitter did build XMPP support early on.  I was trying to rabble about this a couple of nights ago.  And it was one of the things that gave them a big spike in users when you could pipe your tweets into your XMPP stuff.  But they found that you hit tension in the way the protocol works because there is an assumption of symmetry.  There is assumption of I'm following you and you're following me.  Everything's going back and forth.  That's that's sort of baked into the way you build XMPP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So PubSub Hubbub is really more for a one kind of a conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where PubSub Hubbub is is better suited to the asymmetric follow model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, got it.  That was a good question.  I didn't know.  It shows you.  I thought it was just going to say, oh, Leo, you're just so silly.  We're going to do two different things entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can bridge them and you can you can.  Yeah, no, you can use one to talk to the other, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  I just get Jeremy Miller on to explain.  I thought they maybe they were different layers or something like that.  But no, actually, it was it was germane.  Let's talk about the post office.  There's a there's an there's a one to one follow model going back to Ben Franklin.  It's the original XMPP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is standards that have remained the same for hundreds of years.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it ain't free, baby.  You've got to pay for that.  But that's OK, because it's very cheap.  Actually, if you think about what you get from the post office, somebody will hand  deliver a physical item for as little as 45 cents anywhere in the United States.  That's a great deal, right?  You know, it's not so fun is going to the post office to buy the postage and all that.  That's why I love stamps.com.  It actually brings the modern age to this very cool thing.  That's the post office.  If you use stamps.com, you can use your computer and your printer to print postage.  You can print it right on an envelope.  You can send packages and letters of any size.  There's no limit.  Well, I mean, there's a physical limit.  You can't send a house.  But, you know, I mean, there's no that 13 ounce thing where you have to go.  No, you don't have to worry about that.  You can bring it.  You don't have to bring it to the post office.  The mail carrier will pick it up.  You can even schedule free pickups with the post office.  Post office loves stamps.com.  That's why they offer discounts.  You can't get at the post office up to 21 percent on express mail, up to 15 percent on priority mail.  I'm a big fan.  Stamps.com is awesome.  In fact, we have two accounts here at the office because we do a lot of mailing.  If you're an eBay seller or an Amazon seller, you'll really love it because it integrates into those systems beautifully.  You even get a USB scale that tells you exactly what postage you need to put on the package or the envelope.  I'll tell you what.  Here's the thing.  Try it.  We've got a no risk trial offer at stamps.com.  Go to stamps.com.  You're going to see an $80 deal.  Don't do the $80 special offer.  Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner that says, heard about us on a podcast.  Type in twig and that $80 offer turns into a $110 offer and you get a picture of me, which makes it even more valuable.  You get the $55 in free postage.  You get the free digital scale.  You get the $5 supply kit.  You get the four week trial.  It is an amazing deal.  $110 value.  And all you do is pay shipping and handling for the scale about five bucks.  I want you to try it right now.  If you're in the US, stamps.com.  Just forget, don't forget the promo code is twig for your special $110 bonus offer.  Stamps.com.  Kevin posted in the chat room while we were talking this article from TechCrunch.  Google Maps now features schedules for more than one million transit stops worldwide.  So I guess they're figuring out how to aggregate all of that.  But isn't it the case though that a lot of these metropolitan regions are saying, hey, we want to keep this to ourselves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, there's definitely pushback on that.  But the smarter ones are realizing, oh, people can find out when our transit happens.  That's good.  They don't yell at us as much.  Oh, and they actually pay us money for that stuff.  We have a revenue model on people getting on trains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me mention the name of the one in New Jersey.  It's called Clever Commute.  So folks on this coast join in the cause that it's our information and they should be able to get it out.  Yeah, that's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just absurd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's one of these things that you end up having to fight area by area because we've seen this.  The big one in the UK was the Ordnance Survey Mapping.  And that was set up so that they have really, really great detailed maps of the entire UK.  But at some point, they decided this should be a business.  And so they had the government mapping department trying to sell maps to companies with enormous amounts of money.  And it took a while.  Eventually, it took a while.  And Google making the example of, well, mapping for free is useful.  And then they flipped it.  So I think they still have some very high end mapping services.  But broadly, they have open access to all these great mapping resources, which means it's easy to find things.  So if you are gathering data for a public service, getting more users is good.  But particularly transit, this should be obvious.  It should be obvious that if people can find out when your trains are, more of them will take them.  So Google changed the search algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's interesting.  The EFF says Google has kowtowed to copyrights holders because there is now a pirate penalty, a penalty, by the way,  which Google's own YouTube apparently escapes.  If you have an inordinate number, and we don't know what the number is, of take down requests, by the way, approved, whatever that means, take down requests,  Google will kind of not...  Verified, I think.  Verified, whatever that means.  Valid.  I think...  No, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They used the word valid.  They used the word valid.  Whatever the hell that means.  I think it means not have counter nurses filed against them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's valid unless it's against us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Then it's not valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think of this?  Is the EFF right that this pendulum is swinging too far into the rights holders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the other side, I'm not sure I have a big opinion, but Lauren Weinstein says on Google Plus in a very good post, calm down.  It's one factor.  And indeed, as with spammers, do we really want it...  When you search for a movie, an information movie, do you really want the first 20 sites to be nothing but torrent sites?  Is that the legitimate content that you want there?  So it's a factor that I think is probably in the interest of quality search.  Now, the other end of it is, yeah, it's kowtowing to the entertainment industry and to copyright interests.  But there is some level of copyright interest.  I mean, I'm on the right side here, folks.  But there is some level that says that I don't think that necessarily putting up torrents of current movies that are in the theater is cricket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are two things that EFF is worried about.  One is the fact that it's kind of opaque.  Google is not saying what a high number of takedown notices is.  What is that? How does Google determine it?  So forth. The other is, and I think this is also an issue, at least from our own experience on YouTube, the false positive issue.  It's not unusual for rights holder.  For instance, the Mars Curiosity video was taken down for a day because Scripps Howard News Service asserted the rights to it,  even though, of course, they don't own the rights to it.  NASA owns the rights to it.  Right. And so that happens to Twitter all the time.  It happens to us all the time.  And it's Brazilian companies.  It's companies that I think are trying to game the system, frankly, trying to get their ads on our content.  Now, that's on YouTube.  And Google says they're not paying attention.  This is not about YouTube.  It's as if somebody says, I want to take that Twitter TV down.  Those guys are pirates.  And so far we have I don't think we've received any of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think my answer to this is the same as the answer to the three strikes thing, which is if you make three bogus three strikes notices, you get shut off the Internet, too.  So if these companies are sending bogus takedowns, they should be penalized.  Yeah, let's take them off the Internet.  If they take the, you know, if they are generating non valid DMC requests, then penalize them, too.  That would that would be a sensible check and balance on this.  And they're going to need that because, you know, the trouble is this is, you know, aggression's law.  This is as soon as you use another name for it, I can't remember the name of it.  But as soon as you use something as an indicator, it becomes invalid because people start gaming it.  So it used to be that the link graph that they generate a page right from was wonderful because people making links because they cared.  But now it's been contaminated by people making links for the sake of influencing page rank.  It used to be that, you know, writing prose about a topical thing was a good signal and before.  Now there are machines and content farms and all kinds of nonsense.  And Google has had to write special code to deal with the fact that three quarters of the Web is now robots trying to game them.  So this will do the same thing. This will generate even more DMCA bots.  It would it would taint the signal and they will have to then add some second order corrections to that to say, well, if you're actually someone who's trying to create a tainted signal, you should be penalized, too.  And if they were smart, they'd have announced that at the same time to try and stop people doing that.  Well, if they're doing it, maybe they're not doing it.  But you've seen this discussion. Danny Sullivan has been good about this talk about backlinks with the last two releases of the search update iteration, Panda and Penguin.  I think Google has been sending out notices saying your site has dodgy looking backlinks to it.  You will be penalized for this. And suddenly, you know, the people who used to send out send you email saying, please link to me.  And I send an email saying, please don't link to me.  Please remove your links from my site. You're damaging my SEO.  You know, so there's this sort of, you know, for that one, they've they've said, OK, fine, we're going to try and squish this a bit.  And, you know, they're going to need to do this.  You know, the same thing is going to happen to this one in good time.  We will now find all the firms that wrote DMCA take down bots are going to be going around to everyone saying, well, take your competitors down.  Why did you do this? And some of them will fall for it.  You know, it'll cause more mess.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that was my that was my big concern about is that you basically be able to copyright bomb instead of Google bomb, you know, a site you could copyright bomb them.  You know, if you decide that, you know, if a rights holder decided that they had a vendetta with Twitter TV or Gawker or whatever, they could just, you know, hammer them with with notices.  And then that would affect their rank.  But, you know, the YouTube part of this was interesting to me, and I don't think I quite understood it.  They were basically saying that sites that get large amounts of takedowns because their user generated content like YouTube wouldn't be penalized as as badly.  I didn't really understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They need to come up with a rule set that allows them to exclude YouTube, but not just make it a YouTube rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they did. So Danny Sullivan with an update says Google says, oh, it's not just YouTube.  Many popular sites will escape the pirate penalty, which doesn't reassure me in the least because they're not saying what about the unpopular sites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're trying to. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if I'm not as popular as YouTube?  I don't know. It isn't big enough yet.  This is completely missing the point. You too.  I mean, Google. Oh, good.  They say, well, you know, if you're popular, there's other reasons, you know, that you know, we count more than just the number of notices.  We're not going to say what we count, but we count more than just the number of notices.  So Facebook, IMDb, Tumblr and Twitter, they should be fine.  Oh, great. Well, I'm reassured.  Thank you, Google. That that makes me feel so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is this is one of 200 signals, right?  Is it 200 signals per search results at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, but yeah, I just yeah, I don't want to be I don't want to be, you know, chicken little.  We'll just wait and see what happens.  But if suddenly Twitter disappears from Google search, you'll know.  We know why those Brazilians Google buys fromers first.  They buy Gazegat. Now they buy fromers for one hundred forty three million dollars.  I think it was you, Jeff Jarvis, who tweeted.  Well, at least we know Google's a content company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't somebody else tweeted that they said the media company.  And, you know, I'm not 100 percent sure about that, actually.  I yeah, they have content in those two forms now, but they have content and data in all kinds of forms.  You know, this bus schedule, all kinds of stuff that they're serving directly now.  And the thing about the travel guide business, I used to work with photos when my last employer  owned Random House. And as soon as the net came along, man, it was a disastrous business.  As soon as it happened.  Now, I'm surprised that from more fromers and photo errors have stuck around partly because nobody really got their act  together to do a really good alternative guides.  And so there is some still value value still in having a comprehensive list of top places, which is basically what those things give you.  But as a business, people weren't buying books anymore and and they were getting so much information from the net that it became a bad business immediately.  So for Google, it becomes a pretty easy thing to throw this in like Zagat and it's just another source of local data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And it's only one hundred forty three million.  I mean, really, that's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing. That's only that's only five FTC fines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that's it's less than the cost of my four square.  Oh, yeah. Not that Dennis was sell to them because he's been he's tried that once and been burned.  But, you know, so that there are things that are building this, you know, there is there is there is four square.  There are sites that are successfully building guidebook style data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but I think there's room for for something that is editorial as opposed to crowdsourced.  Mm hmm. Yeah. So that's what fromers is not what Zagat is actually.  Zagat is no different. It's crowdsourced. Yeah. Yeah.  It's a guy's no different than Yelp. Really. I guess there's some editors collating those votes, but not much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not my case. They pick the quotes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So who's going to buy Michelin then? Oh, because then you get the the valuable one star.  You get those stars. Marissa will go for that one.  I think Marissa will get that at Yahoo so she can go around a fancy restaurants and get Marissa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did not did not take the the Alibaba money and give it back to shareholders, pissing them the market that day.  But she's quite right. She now has money to spend on these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She is right. Yeah. Keep that money in house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And apparently she just joined Flickr today. Did you see that? Marissa joins Flickr and doubled its staff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doubled its staff. Oh, really? Sean Bonner is going to be happy.  That's awesome. Like us are going to say, oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She likes us. She remembered us. It was a very smart and probably very cheap thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. They now have two employees from five to 10.  It's not a big deal. No, I'm being mean.  They have some very good people working on Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And here is the here is Marissa Myers photo stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What more do you need? That's all you need, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's still using her Google portrait. Is that from Google?  I'm pretty sure that's her Google exact portrait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's it. We just wonder. It says this photo was taken six hours ago.  Yes, I mean, it's uploaded. I'm going to favorite it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is called not not reading the exit data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right. Yep. Oh, what's that? Exit what? Huh?  Wow, that's great. Dear Marissa Meyer actually worked.  Yeah. So there you go.  Yes, Sean Garner, the guy that this was this is actually her and not somebody playing a game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question. She did post a bunch of good photos to plus.  Right. Well, tons of her her ceiling. Beautiful ceiling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm going to add Marissa as a contact and just see if.  So the question is, will Marissa use the data liberation front to get those photos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google take out. There we go.  Just to flick it. We designed Google should just do it for just to prove that that's the way they are.  All right. Who the magnanimous do do I get to do plus Leo Laporte yet?  No, I don't. So I can't wait for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody. Yeah, this is the new thing.  And Kevin Marks, you pointed out this might break the Internet.  Well, we're not quite, but it's a little bit of a surprise.  I mean, I think it's a little bit of a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Internet. Well, we're not quite, but I know I can see why they're doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me explain what they're doing.  You they're they're vanity URLs.  If you go to your Google Plus account, your URL is some goofy long number and digit that is, you know, it's kind of hard to get one digit number, which is the decimal encoding of the internal ID.  I, I, for instance, some one oh one two six one two four three nine five seven oh seven six three one nine four two two.  And that's a little hard to give out to people.  So someday we will all be able to be plus Leo Laporte plus Kevin Marks.  So we'd be plus dot google dot com slash plus Kevin Marks, except.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the second plus is the plus symbol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's often ignored by clients.  It's not as it is ignored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is that when you send a URL and a form into a URL from HTML, it turns the spaces into pluses.  Right.  Which means that there's a there's a problem with, you know, with using pluses elsewhere in the URLs because some of the libraries don't aren't smart enough to realize you the question mark first before the pluses of space.  And so you'll get some encoding issues.  So it's just old libraries.  We have to worry about.  Google's internal stuff will be fine.  But passing sending euros with pluses around can be problematic.  You know, it's it's it's.  But I can see why they did that because it's not plus Google dot com slash whatever.  It's Google dot com slash plus Toyota handing out pieces from that from the the top level namespace, which is actually pretty.  When I was there to get anything in that namespace, you had to have a meeting with Marissa first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So everybody gets their own.  That's nice.  So that plus is the is the signifier.  This is a Google plus user.  I can see how they've done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, when I do that, it makes me signing.  That's kind of crappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you you, Kevin, marks are kind of grandfathered into profiles since that was your product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So not just anyone else who signed up at that point.  So profiles when we know they took mine away, Kevin, they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did profiles dot Google dot com gives me a slash Leo Laporte gives me a four or four.  They took mine away.  I think they took people's away.  Oh, so you are special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He hid his in a place they'll never find.  It's in the desk drawer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go get it, Matt.  The best one is is is is is Paul.  He's got the only four letter Gmail address.  Four Buckeye.  So if I go to it, we'll just have a Gmail address, less than six characters.  He's got one that's that's four characters.  He is that Gmail is a certain advantage to doing that.  He wins at namespace.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is he going to be Google dot com slash plus Paul?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would know, but maybe not.  So that's the thing.  So when we set up profiles in the first place, we said we want namespaces having 21 digit numbers is crap.  Right.  And this was a huge internal fight.  And the answer was OK, but you can only use the Gmail namespace, which makes sense because that's the namespace.  They actually actively manage and they've got a really good mapping service goes back and forth.  But it means you're exposing your email address.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I go to profiles dot google dot com slash Laporte, that should work because that's my Gmail.  And it does.  OK.  So that's my mistake.  I was using my Google plus name.  Use your Gmail name.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you see your gym.  Yeah, that works.  The thing that we set up there was the Gmail account and the pushback was you're now leaking your email address.  That's a terrible attack.  Privacy, blah, blah, blah.  It's like it's an email address.  Get over it.  And it's Gmail.  It's fan filled is it.  But so that was the pushback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you did.  I know on the bottom of profiles, you used to be able to push a button that says please go back to a 21 digit number.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also, if you had a Google account that wasn't a Gmail account.  So if you set up with a different email address, you could then get yourself a piece of Gmail namespace and use that.  And it would create a Gmail account for you the background as well.  So so I've got some my my Kevin Marks at Maccom Google account ended up with some really crappy thing because I was testing something internally.  It's now called you internal test.  Kevin Marks or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've had those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So right now, Toyota and some big brands does Lady God.  Who is going to get the plus thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it they said initially they have said they've declared a new namespace.  This is a new namespace for Google, which is they've been trying to get rid of these YouTube had their own blogger had their own Gmail had their own.  And there were a bunch of others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Facebook's been you could do this on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've always been able to Facebook didn't have one for a long time.  Then we all claimed it in one in one night.  Right.  That's right.  But Google had a whole bunch of companies that bought that had different namespaces.  It was trying to consolidate them.  And the answer at the time I was there was it goes into the Gmail namespace.  So clearly they've done the internal fight to get themselves a new namespace.  But now they're going to run to the same allocation problem that everyone does, which is all the other Kevin Marks is what that namespace as well.  Right.  And, you know, people want the three character one Matt enough to actually hack someone's computer and delete his his back.  So there are there are issues around namespace allocation.  And so they're going to they're about to set themselves up for a sort of big fight over namespace.  And it'll take a while before they come up with a policy for that.  And it was the same with Facebook went through this.  Facebook did pre reserve a bunch of brand brand like namespace stuff beforehand.  And they also there was some favorable treatment for employees.  I think because they seem to have got namespaces before anyone else could sign up.  But then they had they said, OK, now we open the floodgates and everyone sign up for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you guys see the story about the oatmeal?  The oatmeal did a comic making fun of Google Plus saying that nobody leaves comments that you have to hand out these terrible long URLs.  And, you know, the example URL was funny.  I just put the tech run just story in the rundown.  The joke URL in the comic was something like, you know, blur, gay, SDF, meat pie, donkey orgasm, 93 poop.  And so Google actually created that URL and redirects it now to the oatmeal kind of in response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here it is. Plus Google. Yeah, there it is.  It's very long. And so now it goes to Matthew Inman's, who's the author of the oatmeal Google Plus account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then now this announcement that we're going to get pretty URLs.  So I don't know. I give I give you oatmeal all the credit. Maybe he thought it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that. We've been bickering about this with Google Plus for at least for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So they say everybody will get it at some point.  Right now, big brands are getting it and then it'll be verified.  Google Plus, and then then everybody gets to fist and the unwashed masses.  And then, of course, somebody will have already taken all of the good names.  Right. And you'll be Gina 17894 once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the thing is, they spent so long trying to stop you being, you know, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Real names, real names until we have a namespace issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then we have a namespace issue. Oh, maybe you can use your handles in that bit. Maybe.  I don't know yet. So there's probably some huge internal like giant fight over what that means.  And whether the one true bigs with an exclamation mark can have his handle again or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here. Hey, this is kind of nice. If you're a musician streaming concerts on Hangouts,  there's now a studio mode that gives you very high quality audio, which is very cool.  I think that's great. Yeah. So when you're setting up your Hangout, you could choose between voice or studio.  And you know, have you seen Huffington Post's new video live dot Huffington Post dot com?  They've really integrated Google Plus like crazy in it. Oh, interesting.  I should be watching them since they're doing kind of what we're doing, only they're doing it with news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're doing with news with people sitting around a little.  Let me put on now what's on it. Yeah, that's a little living room.  Talk about movies or something. But then they have guests come in on the they have Cadillac as their not sponsored partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would rather have to be honest for but OK, so there they are.  This is this is what turned me off completely to it. So they've got a Hangout going in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We can get you on. So I encourage everyone to make comments and hopefully we can get you on as a community member.  But you say humans are visual creatures and there is a science behind beauty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just I don't you know, I wonder if this is if there's a market for this or not. Maybe there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder too. I'm really I don't know. I don't know. It's going 20. I think it's 24 hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not because I went in there. But there reruns. It's very much like us actually.  They're probably doing something very similar. And I just wish Ariana had come to me because I could have made a deal on some old equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a try cast on the best, but I know you could have had very cheaply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it is interesting how they're using Google Plus. And by the way, our Hangouts rather.  And by the way, they're they're doing some branding on it as well, which is kind of interesting.  I wonder who they went to for this. But it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's also an anchor at KOMU and by the University of Missouri, Sarah Hill, who does she uses Google Hangouts on the air.  And she actually has people talking to her through her IFB from the public.  She doesn't mind it. And she gets interesting stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. So they're broke us news thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chad, can we set that up so that the chat room could talk to me at any time?  Just right in your ear. Just all the time. What? What? What?  You know, that only works because nobody's watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know how she does it. She's she's wonderful. She really does all kinds of great stuff.  And she has a post up from a technical person who went through all the technology stuff that they did to make this operate to get the air as a feed into the Google Plus.  And the audio audio audio. But it's kind of interesting to see how Google Plus Hangouts are being used now by media in some interesting ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there it's interesting because they're switching it like TV. They're they're going second, second, then boom.  I could see a director switching this. Look at this. They're switching really fast back and forth.  Huh. And they're doing the same thing, Chad, that we do.  You see there's a Huffington Post window in there. We do as we sign on.  See that blank that black screen there. They sign on as kind of an account on the Hangout.  And that's how they're able to get the feed. Yeah, they don't have no they're not giving program to their users.  So the users would either have to have the stream. Anyway, this is all technical stuff that I geek out about.  Yeah, well, it's interesting. Again, Ariana called me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I like the idea of them turning out the audio quality on Hangouts and just saying prioritize audio because great.  You know, you still need like and now export for me as an MP3, would you nicely?  That's that's the piece that YouTube is crap at.  But that's that's valuable for doing these kinds of things.  Certainly would help us get tunnel vision going again if that production process was a bit more streamlined.  Right. That'd be a perfect, by the way, technology for tunnel vision.  Yeah, I mean, I mean, he can play with that and see if he can get tunnel vision back on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't realize it was off the air. Tell me about TV.  We're taking a break. Hiatus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're on a hiatus because we lost our producer and me being the producer didn't actually work because we've nothing ever got posted.  So we need to work out a way to get it posted. So if you want to be a producer, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it that the they have found new Egyptian pyramids, perhaps thanks to Google Earth.  And this is not this is Google Earth said I didn't know Google owned a satellite.  I thought they were buying images from other companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they put some money into one satellite.  I'm not sure. Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it says, according to his overhead watching you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they're watching you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Located about 90 cheaper than driving all those cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It stays over Germany all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's really interesting.  And they actually I don't know who was looking at the pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But was this was this verified?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These were definitely pyramids that they didn't possibilities that it wouldn't be.  And so there's some doubt.  But it but you know, it's pretty manmade looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it is it is just 12 miles from Abu Sidum, which is another site.  So it's in the it's in the right spot to do it.  I think it's but although it's quite large, so it might in fact be a significant find.  Kind of cool. Amazing.  Isn't that and that that looks pretty manmade.  Either that's the Mars Curiosity crane that just got a little off track.  I don't know.  Anyway, cool.  Here's another one. Man etches name and sand visible from space.  The world's largest graffiti by Hamad.  Just just off the coast of Abu Dhabi.  It's also a canal.  Yes, it's an artificial waterway.  He's a 63 year old billionaire, Hamad bin Hamdan Al-Nayan, who has enough money to carve his name into the sand or pay someone to do it for him.  Well, I doubt he did it himself. He's 63 for crying out loud.  Yes, you know that. You know what that means, Jeff.  You got to pee every hour. No time to.  Let's see. Sky Drive for Android coming in just a few weeks.  Rim says Blackberry 10 is available for licensing.  Anybody want it?  Euler Euler.  Anyone Blackberry 10? Anyone?  It's like what?  Cheap. Anyone?  Computer science at Khan Academy. We talked about this on Security Now. Khan Academy is going to do a kids school kid computer science class, which is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Has anybody figured out Ev Williams and Biz Stone's Medium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here it is. Welcome to Medium. We're rethinking publishing and building a new platform from scratch.  These are the guys who founded Twitter. Ev Williams.  And Blogger.  Blogger. Yep. So this may be more like Blogger than Twitter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I can't quite figure it out. But basically you, how did Dave Weiner put it? You contribute to a collection.  So you're not really publishing on your own. There's a discussion.  Like Pinterest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pinterest attacks the others.  Yes. It's not time centric and it's not author centric. It is vague topic centric.  So in some ways it's closer to being a wiki model, except that you get multiple entries on a given topic.  Here's an example.  I haven't got an eligibility yet, so I'm only able to like things.  And it's also massively non-browseable, which is weird.  And I asked him about this on Twitter and he said, oh yeah, we can use Twitter for that for now.  But it's actually quite hard to find things unless you get a URL from outside.  And the way they, if you embed a link in it that goes through some redirector that doesn't work very well, so Google can't call it very well either.  So it's this sort of weird thing of its own that is also not very discoverable or browsable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's an example page. This happened to me, life made of stories.  Kevin Rose has posted a little story on here about peeing with Al Gore.  So there you go. That's what you're raising the tone as ever.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I do think there's another company, new company called I think Spongebob.  It's a weird name. Craig Silverman, who does regret the error, who's a wonderful, wonderful guy, Canadian, redundant now, who started a new platform that I saw that some media companies are going to start to use where it's a collaboration platform.  And it occurred to me as I was talking to them that I think that this is a little bit what I was saying, I think, is that blogging became a chance for individuals to finally speak.  And I think there's a layer above that that organizes collaboration on creation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a photo page that they use as an example. This kind of makes sense.  And I can almost see this taking off. This is when I was a kid, things were different.  You post a picture of when you were a kid. When I was a kid, I read the manual.  When I was a kid, we played with electronic kits, not computers. When I was a kid, it was okay to wear this shirt. I could see people.  I could see people doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blogging has been around for more than a decade. It's time to rethink what this is. There's another one.  Jonathan Harris did Cowbird as a storytelling platform that was used by National Geographic for a big project.  So I think it is time to rethink this whole notion of how we publish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is really interesting. It seems very ephemeral.  Especially since it's not searchable. It's not linkable.  Well, Twitter wasn't at first either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it also has upvotes in it.  Each of these subpages has an upvote.  This is good. This is shiny. Got it.  They've got a varied number of phrases there.  And you have to auth with Twitter to do that.  And then by default, they organize the categories by most voted on.  You can actually reorganize them by new. There's a little interesting versus new click at the top.  But it's not sticky. So every time you pop back, it goes back to interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just signed in. I just authorized it with the wrong account.  I have an account called Wasted Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I have now authenticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not good.  Well, I thought there may come a time when I'd like to post drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you can post about urinating with Al Gore as well.  This might...  Well, Wasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need to follow that now. It's got no followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think everybody should follow Wasted Leo.  You'll know it from the profile pic.  Go ahead. You can show it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, have you stood next to anyone famous in a urinal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Gina Davis.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  I had Forrest Tucker from F Group.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.  OK. Well, that was a good topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the rules page of Medium says, there aren't many.  In fact, they can pretty much all be summed up vastly.  Don't pee in the pool.  There you go.  So you haven't peed in urinals and not in pools.  It's very focused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to take a break, come back with our tip tool and number of the week.  We've got coming up very quickly triangulation in just three minutes.  And that's exciting because it's going to be Phil Lybon of Evernote,  the CEO and founder of Evernote, which is a really interesting freemium model,  a very smart guy with lots of interesting things to say.  But before we do that, let's talk a little bit about our friends at the Ford Motor Company.  Here's another new site, social.ford.com.  I find it really interesting to watch this company,  a more than 100-year-old, century-old company,  march into the 21st century.  They've done it with their cars and the technology in their cars.  This is a social site around Ford, and they're doing badges,  which is kind of interesting.  In fact, you can get a tech geek badge while you're here.  They have...I'll probably get the Mustang badge  because I'm a mustache.  But there is the tech geek badge. See that?  Great outdoors, off-road, flex, I drive one.  This is smart.  There's also an interesting article by a fellow you might know.  Here's the idea. There's articles on Ford social, social.ford.com,  about all sorts of things.  But there's also a chance for you to post your ideas.  Here's an article that I wrote for them about an interview I did with one of their technologists.  We talked a lot about autonomous vehicles and so forth.  But if you have an idea for a way Ford could make their cars better,  you can also post there.  There's some really interesting stuff in here.  You read my article, because I talk a little bit about the GPS lane,  some of the autonomous stuff like lane departure warnings that they're putting in there,  what they call, what Ford calls workload information management.  This is an interesting, although controversial idea,  the car is paying attention to the conditions.  If it's like rainy or the road's slick or whatever,  it will actually shut down some of the things that you can do in the car,  in effect saying, pay attention.  And I think it's a great idea, but a little controversial.  You can read about it and cast your vote.  Lots of interesting ideas here.  Weight sensors to keep an alarm to sound.  If there's somebody sitting in the seat and it's too hot.  There's some really interesting Wi-Fi music sharing between cards.  A 15-year-old submitted a biodiesel hybrid post.  Social.Ford.com.  Get in there, grab your tech geek badge,  and read that post that I wrote about Jim Buchkowski.  It was a very interesting conversation we had about how Ford wants to use the cloud,  for instance, to sync your car or your vehicle to your home or office.  Social.Ford.com.  Gina Trapani, it is time for your tip of the week,  and I know you're happy about this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For those of us with multiple Google accounts,  and that's all of us here on this panel and probably lots of our listeners,  Google's launched a new sign-in page, which is an account chooser.  You associate, you have to enable this, by the way,  but once you enable it, you associate all the different Google accounts  that you control, and when you go to the sign-in page,  once you have it enabled, it's accounts.google.com slash account chooser.  It shows you a list, and you launch whichever account you want to go into from the list.  So, simple little tweak, but definitely handy for those of us who have multiple accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And where do I enable that?  Oh, here it is. Right on the front page.  You can improve your Google experience by connecting your accounts.  No, that's from other services.  Where do I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you go to accounts.google.com slash account chooser,  does it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see if you can enable it there.  I clicked on a link from Lifehacker, which I'll actually add to the show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Account chooser, maybe account singular chooser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so there you go.  You add an account that you want to add to your list,  and then it'll show you that list of accounts you've added.  This is so great. I have about 10 Gmail accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This will be very, very handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll be a better launcher.  And a quick, shameless plug.  My Android app, To Do Text, which you can go to todotxt.com,  reached 1.0 this week.  So, it's available in the Play Store,  and I'm awaiting Amazon approval, so it should be in the Amazon App Store as well.  Very simple text-based task list.  It syncs to Dropbox.  You can archive your stuff that you've completed to done.text now.  We added some cool swipe gestures and some syncing bug fixes,  so check it out if you haven't already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am going to upgrade right now. How exciting!  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we have new art that looks awesome on the Nexus 7 and the Galaxy Nexus.  So, we have the extra high DPI icons now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks really nice. Cool.  Allow new access to my Dropbox. That's great. Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Woohoo! Oh, there it is. Very nice.  Call Mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Call Mom, Act Phone, plus familial piece.  That's the Tom Anderson of To Do Text.  Everybody gets one item. Call your mother.  Call Mom.  Call your mother.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in Moby, a mobile ad company, has a survey,  and take these with a grain of salt shaker.  But they insist that mobile web users spend more time watching their phones than watching TV.  144 minutes a day to 141 minutes a day.  And other numbers, 96 minutes on a computer, 90 on a radio, 43 reading, and so on.  Then other stats. 77% of people confess to using mobile devices in bed.  70% while watching TV. 65% while waiting for something.  43% while with family. Yes, we do.  41% in the bathroom. So, finally, we're all out of the closet and in the bathroom.  And so on and so on. So just some little stats for you today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My tool of the week is something I reviewed on the GizWiz, and I've been using it now for about a month, and I love it.  Wouldn't it be cool if you could take your Google Voice account and attach it to your phone  so that when your phone rings, it's your Google Voice number. It actually rings a phone in your house.  This is a little box called the Obihai. It's only $30. It's very inexpensive.  They actually have a couple of different Obis.  But what happens, and by the way, once it's set up, it does not rely on their server.  It uses Google Voice. It does kind of a weird hack, I think, with Google Voice to use Google Chat.  But what happens is when somebody calls my Google Voice number now, it rings a phone in my house.  I pick it up. I can make phone calls from it, free phone calls to other Obis users.  Wait, like a landline?  Yeah, well, it's like a landline, yes, except it's not. It's connected to my internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I see. So it acts like an airline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it becomes a true VoIP solution that's free because it's using Google Voice.  And it's only $30. There's no monthly fee or anything. The box is very inexpensive.  I use the OB100. There's a 110 that gives you, I think, two lines.  Or actually, I think it connects to your regular landline so you can have a single phone that will...  so it bridges to your voice service as well as VoIP, so a single phone that answers both numbers.  So this is a great way to tie your Google Voice number into your home phone  and make Google Voice calls on an actual, what appears to be a landline. I really like this.  And it's inexpensive.  OBHAI, obihai.com.  Hey, that was fun. Thanks to Dalton Caldwell for joining us on Short Notice.  I hope he didn't screw up his talk tonight.  I'm sure we improved it.  Yeah, everybody should go see his Airbnb talk. How about that? We'll sell some tickets for him.  Yeah, there you go.  If you're in the San Francisco Bay Area, you can go do that.  Kevin Marks, tummelvision.tv as soon as they get a producer.  And salesforce.com. Anything you want to plug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I suppose the relevant Salesforce thing to plug is Chatter Communities, which we announced yesterday,  which is letting you build...  Chatter is the Salesforce internal Twitter, if you like, the thing that lets you talk amongst people who are inside your company.  Chatter Communities are ways to extend that to your customers as well.  And we announced that yesterday. It's salesforce.com.chatter.communities,  with the idea that companies can open these kinds of conversations with their customers as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're getting towards lots of these things that will plug together,  and I'm hoping that we can get some of these to plug into these other bits as well.  That would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, the author of Public Parts. You must buy the book.  He's also a professor of journalism at the City University of New York and blogs at buzzmachine.com.  Thank you, Jeffrey.  Thank you.  Thank you to the lovely and talented...  By the way, what designer clothes do you wear, Gina Trapani?  Oh, yeah.  I loved it when... Did you hear about that, right?  Hillary Clinton, some reporter, is talking to our secretary of state and says,  what designers do you like? And she said, would you ask the man that question? Would you ask that?  And the reporter said, oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, I missed my chance. Would you ask a man that question, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would, in fact, and I wish somebody would ask me because I'm wearing Tommy Bahama today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ah, Tommy Bahama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina blogs at smarterwear.org, is the author of Think Up at thinkupapp.com,  and is, of course, a very welcome and very snappily dressed member of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With my white t-shirt. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the Airbnb Talks. They're at airbnb.com slash tech talks,  and there's still room to sign up for Dalton Caldwell's talk.  6 p.m. San Francisco time, if you're in the San Francisco area.  I thought I'd give him a little plug for that. Thank you all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should ask Anil what designer clothes he wears. That would be much more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, next time Anil Dash is on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anil makes me look really bad all the time. He is always well dressed.  He's a sharp dresser, that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. I like a guy who knows how to wear pointy shoes and look good.  Thank you for joining us. The heels I'm not so sure about.  Thank you for joining us.
