And a lot of times it's things like news and media because Jeff Jarvis is here,  professor of journalism at CUNY, the City University of New York blogger at BudgeMachine.com,  author of a great many books including Geeks Bearing Gifts, his latest,  and What Would Google Do in Public Parts, and El Fin de los Medios de Comunicación de Masas.  That doesn't, that's, is that Geeks Bearing Gifts?  Yeah.  The end of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The joke doesn't work. The end of...  Mass media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mass media communication, yeah.  The joke doesn't work in Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it doesn't work in Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's a good point. If you use an idiomatic saying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been all three books of mine have been the same problem.  Yeah.  What Would Google Do?  Joke doesn't work, Public Parts, joke doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, you're very chauvinistic, very U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am, I am. I just got accused of that by a Finnish journalist.  Just accused me of that on Twitter, just moments ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the most global man I know.  We're so glad to get you back from New Delhi 24 hours.  But I hear a chortle that makes me, my heart, pit a pat a little bit.  I believe Gina Turpani is in her house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought I'd giggle at you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love your chortle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter celebrates.  Yeah, we love Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, of course, founding editor at Lifehacker.com.  She's got her own startup, which is called Think Up.  ThinkUp.com.  She's got a new project she wants to tell us about in a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So great to have you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Gina only comes here once a month now because she's so busy with her startup.  But it's sure nice to have you when you do come in.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great to be here.  I miss you guys.  It's nice to take a break from...  I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Head down coding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, head down coding.  Sometimes you got to look up and talk to humans.  What's the new thing?  So we got a new thing.  It's called MakerBase.  The URL is a little goofy.  It's makerba.se.  Because the com, the .com wasn't available.  You got the Swedish one.  Yeah, we did.  We got the Swedish one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's invitation only at the moment because it's really broken and early and we're working on it.  But if you are interested and you want in and you're listening to the show,  just tweet at me and tell me that you heard about it on Twig and I will get you in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's what it says.  You make great things.  Tell the world what you made.  So it's for app creators?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's for digital creators.  So not just apps.  Apps, games, podcasts, shows.  Anyone that's making any sort of piece of digital culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You would absolutely count.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Yeah, it's about projects and makers, not companies, not titles.  Right.  We're talking about like digital things and their makers.  And by maker, I don't mean coder.  I mean everything.  I mean, we mean everything.  Designers, writers, project managers, legal help.  I mean investors, everyone who helped bring an app that you love to fruition.  We want to capture in MakerBase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what will we get out of this?  Is it going to be like a crunch base for makers or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, some people have made that comparison.  I mean, one of our lofty goals and this is me and my co-founder, Anil at ThinkUp.  You know, this conversation we've had is like, there's always like a point in your career  where you like talk to that person where you kind of like you get your big break.  Like somebody takes a chance on you or, you know, gives you a job or sparks an idea in you  and that's kind of when your career takes off.  So our idea is like if we can make like the credit roll behind the apps that you love transparent,  you know, if we can have the liner notes for apps, just like, you know,  CDs have them or the IMDB for apps the way that movies has them that I'll make it easier for people to say,  oh, how do you know, who do I need to talk to you to find out more about how this happened  or who are the people that work together a lot?  Like you'll see these kind of power couples or power teams go through several, you know,  projects like Evan Biz.  You know, we'll go through audio and medium and blogger and you know, and Twitter.  So we want to kind of make the we want to make the network of creators of makers kind of transparent  to help people, you know, see the faces behind, you know, what we made and honestly to help,  you know, for underrepresented folks to find their pathways in and make those big breaks happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To put it in my terms, it's bylines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bylines.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's Gina.  I presume you made this entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.  I did.  And everything is editable by everybody.  So the show is like a Wikipedia too.  It's like Wikipedia.  The show counts.  Yeah, absolutely.  The show is a project for sure.  Yep.  Medium count.  You're writing on medium, Jeff.  I think I added medium for you.  And then each person has a role in a project and a role could be like, you know, I made a suggestion  on how to make the logo better and the role could be I founded it, you know, that there's like a blog.  That's nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina, just put up my latest chapter from the book on medium that was not meant to be a blog.  Sorry.  Is about what I think I'm talking about the show is what I call credit right rather than copyright.  The need to give credit to people for whatever deal may come down the pike in this in the string of  creative co-collaborative creation online.  And this is a this is a start to that.  That's really really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a directory though, essentially.  It opens directory.  IMDB is a good example.  There's also doesn't Mozilla have a similar kind of open database of stuff.  This is good.  I like this a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are a lot of projects like there's this like Angel List and Geek List and Dribble.  I mean, there's a lot of communities for people who do particular things, but this is very maker  and project focus.  So tell me who made super and what that was like.  And eventually we'd like to add like Q&A and you know, like that and it's really cool.  Like we showed this to Ed Williams actually and we had added him as like the founder of blogger.  And you can see the edits that people make that to their home page.  So he actually edited his role in blogger to add that he had written some code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually wrote the code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This guy is a billionaire and he really wanted to get in there that he had written some like ASP, you know.  It's like very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where did you get this avatar of me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so everything right now we're doing autofills from Twitter primarily.  So that's when I made this entry for you, Leo.  This is your Twitter avatar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I've changed my Twitter avatar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can click on the edit button anywhere and change that.  So that's your role.  So you go to your page.  Got it.  I can edit that.  There's an edit button on the top right there.  Got it.  And again, this is really...  Avatar URL can be different.  Got it.  Yeah, we have to make obviously uploading or changing images a little bit nicer than just entering the URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially that image.  That was my Twitter image for a brief period of time.  And then people explained to me it looked like I was dying in a vat of acid or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an amazing photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not... I'm not vain.  Let's put it that way.  I don't...  Because that is not a flattering picture of me there.  All right, I'll fix that.  But this is cool.  I love this idea.  And you wrote this all from scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did. I did.  Yeah, we were using a bunch of code from ThinkUp and that framework that I've written.  When we learned a lot of lessons from ThinkUp and we want to make the data entry as...  We want to make it fun, right?  Because we don't want to give people a job to set up yet another resume.  But we want this to sort of differentiate itself enough from LinkedIn and from those kind of other networks to make it worthwhile.  We want this to be the place where people go to see the liner notes for an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  I love that you have these genotouches.  Roll, raise the bar.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a definite genocent of wimsy.  Wimsy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like writing goofy copy and then somehow it doesn't get caught in those lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope you come up with a bunch that just go in there like, you know, order the tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Order the tacos.  That's a good one.  Order the tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the taco orderer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Brought the donuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Complained incessantly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Added bugs.  Heard it cash.  Yeah.  See if I can find it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's my, this is going to be my new avatar photo, I think.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Liam, you are a beautiful woman.  I have to tell you.  That is some great eye pickup.  I have never seen.  That's a great photo.  A lot of work went into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is actually, actually, it's very cool.  L'Oreal makes an iOS app that puts makeup on you.  Was that what it is?  This is done.  I thought your wife was tormenting you.  No, this is done programmatically.  She just said, hold still.  And it's actually kind of amazing.  She did the same thing to herself, but there's no, that one's not, that one's a little obviously creepy.  This is, this is me.  That's creepy, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it was, it is so well done.  The shadows and the dark.  It looks real.  I'm sure that Lisa had like pinned you down and did makeup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  I'm going to save the image and make it my, my, my, my, my new Twitter handle.  Twitter profile.  Isn't that great?  So nice, nice job on that.  Let me go back to the, this was a 20%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said, make your base here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this was a 20% thing.  We were, what does that mean?  Well, you know, we were slogging through some like backend projects around payments and the Facebook API changes at think up.  And honestly, it was, it was hard.  And so we did make your base is kind of a productive distraction.  We did Fridays.  Most people go to the bar, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, let's write some more code.  What do you say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This has been, this is a Neil's idea.  He had this idea in 2011 and he talked to me about it back then.  And I remember feeling this twinge of, oh, I really want to work on that.  And then, but we were too busy.  We were too busy with think up.  And finally I said to him, listen, let's, let's just build this thing.  It was his idea.  He had talked to a bunch of people about it.  A few people had actually started it and it never shipped.  And I was like, let's just do it.  So yeah, this was our, this was our Friday fun day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazing.  It's fairly, it looks, it seems very stable and fast and reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From your mouth to the web server gods.  You have a lot of jigs in things, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't forget.  You know what?  We've just sent a thousand people there easily and it's handling the  traffic very smoothly.  What's your back end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is a straight, straight up lamp stack.  You don't run your own servers though.  No, we've got it on the Linode box.  This, this particular one, we're on AWS for think up, but we have our  staging kind of play, play sandbox servers on Linode and we actually  put the maker base on Linode.  Oh, neat.  So yeah, it's, it's perfectly fine.  Like I said, it's invitation only.  So people who are going to it who are, I can't don't have sign in  rights are just giving us their Twitter credentials.  So there's not, not a lot of, not a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably why we haven't brought it down yet.  Yeah.  But you know, this is great because if you love Gina Tripani, you  could come here and just like you would on IMDB, you'd see every  movie that somebody was in.  You'd see all the products that projects that Gina's worked on in  the days.  It's not exactly a resume in fact, because these are all direct links,  right?  So that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of, it's also a GitHub for non-Git-Es.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  You know, this is my frustration is that there are all these  communities for coders, but I just, you know, we want everybody  to learn to code and I think that that's a good idea, but I don't  I've really come to this place where I realized that being a  coder like doesn't necessarily mean that you're the one creating,  creating this stuff, right?  Like there's so much more to coding apps and games and to  creating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a coder, that's generous of you.  What?  I mean as a coder, I'm really privileged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not much more, just a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People think I have some sort of superpower.  It's like I have this idea and if I only could code, then I  could make it happen.  But what is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Coding is a superpower.  Look at this.  You made this and you made it fairly quickly, I'm guessing.  It is.  I just, that's, that's a superpower.  That's a hell of a superpower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But without writers and designers and even people to do your  privacy policy and logo.  I mean, there's just, there's so, there's so much else that goes  into it.  And you know, like did you know that this was PHP?  Like, you know, there's part, a good product is going to make  the technology behind them invisible.  And I think that that makes a, you know, a different skill set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something you should say that because we were talking about  AppCamp for girls yesterday on MacBreak Weekly and Kelly  Gumont, who's a counselor there, they may have, they have an app  that just came out, but she said that's one of the things that  the girls learn at AppCamp is you don't have to be a coder.  They need, you need designer, you need all these people.  It's no application is just some person writing code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, the real skill to teach is going to be working in teams.  I mean, that's what we're seeing about journalism is that we  don't work in teams.  We are lone wolf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should play more World of Warcraft.  That would teach you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's, there is this like lone wolf kind of mythology  around coders as well.  And that's, and that's not, that's not, it's about your ability  to get the right people together and collaborate and lead, right?  I mean, most founders, sure, did some ASP coding on blogger  early on, right?  But most founders do, you know, they wear lots of different  hats and I think there's a lot of invisible aspects to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  having said that you should all learn Lisp right now.  M-A-K-E-R-B-A dot S-E.  That's not hard to look.  It's just, it's Swedish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you say it with a Swedish accent?  MakerBase.  MakerBase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  MakerBase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All our, all our Swedish viewers and we have quite a  few are just hating us right now.  How do you get a dot S-E?  You just go to the Sweden nick and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I think we, I'm pretty sure we just used hover.  You have to submit some little extra paperwork that, that you  don't for dot coms.  I forget what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you don't anymore have to be in that country to use the  country code in many countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you don't.  I think you have to submit like the tax number of the  organization or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope you don't get a Swedish tax bill now.  I think you might get a Swedish tax bill.  You're doing business in Sweden.  Oh geez.  Oh, it's okay because they've got great health care there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And wonderful hearing and great sonnets.  I love Sweden.  I love Sweden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I adore Sweden.  I love it.  And you're going to a Finland, which I also, Scandinavia is  great, but it's very different, you know, the Finnish do not  consider themselves, you know, part of that Scandinavian,  Norway, Sweden, Denmark thing.  They speak Korean.  They're there.  It's a, yeah, well, it's a Russo.  It's a very different language and yeah, it's like Korean,  which is really bizarre when you say that.  You're going to Helsinki for what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Newsgeist, Google Newsgeist.  So they do Zeitgeist.  I'm familiar with that.  We talked about this.  I don't think we talked about this.  No, it was last Monday.  So Google has made a friendship pact with so far eight  publishers in Europe, The Guardian, El País, The Republica,  Ditsite, FZ, I'm forgetting who else.  Sorry about that.  And you know, you know from the show, if you ever listen to  the show, you know how the German publishers go after  Google, especially Akshul Springer and Borda and Google  led by The Guardian pulled together consortium.  I was a part of the meeting at Davos where this was  hammered out a bit.  And so Google is agreeing to work on product development  to give a, I'm not crazy about this idea, but 150 million  euro innovation fund rather like the French bribery fund,  blackmail fund and to do training and fellowships and  that kind of stuff and have this Newsgeist.  And it's to me that the success of this will be as we put  it at The Guardian and as I put it, whether the real action  here happens in Mountain View, whether Mountain View cares  about news, whether product cares about news, whether they  recognize news as part of the mission of organizing the  world's information and whether they recognize the business  models around that, whether they come to mutually beneficial  real business deals, not just blackmail and whether they  spread this past Europe where they're just putting oil on  squeaky wheels.  But having given those caveats, I'm encouraged that both  Google and Facebook are paying attention to news companies  right now.  And so this is a big deal.  So they're having this Newsgeist thing.  They had one in Phoenix for American publishers, mainly  mostly American publishers and journalists and academics  and so on some months ago and now they're doing the European  one. And then so I horned my way in.  Neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should be there of all people.  I thought so.  I thought so.  Yeah.  And I think I commend Google because I think this is the way  to do it.  You could you could fight.  You can go to court.  You can pull your take your ball and go home.  But it's always an opportunity to talk and to work out  something.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  And you know, the German publishers will do the bat.  The ones who don't like Google will say, well, we're not  cheap.  I argued that the real goal here is not money.  Not not some bribery payment, blackmail payment.  The real goal here is is mutually beneficial business  deals.  And to me those are going to be based on exchange of data  which is going to be hard in Europe.  But I think it's critical.  You know, you again, you know, my spiel here that the Google  knows us in ways that publishers simply do not.  Google knows more about our content than we do and the more  that Google can make us smarter and so we can do our jobs  better the more benefit that will bring to news companies  at their core.  So that's the that's that's what's going on there.  Meanwhile, Facebook has met with a bunch of publishers and  released four new things that we talked about before in  December and reportedly they're setting up this new structure  where publishers will be able to publish their content directly  on Facebook.  So people and mobile will not go off and link off from  Facebook.  Reportedly none of this is known and I don't know.  There'll be a generous revenue share even up to 100% for  advertising on that news content on Facebook.  There are some big important issues to discuss around this  about it.  You know, Google I mean Facebook becomes not just a newsstand.  It becomes an editor of the news.  It decides what goes where and there are issues to discuss  there.  But again, I think there's there's there's a great starting  point to have that discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just noticed that it's so funny.  Facebook's always tweaking their algorithm that I feel like  the newsfeed is better than a lot for me personally in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  last few weeks is the is the is the extra relevant.  Oh, you know, here's a story and then here's three more  that are related to that.  I do like that.  It's working well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think yeah, that works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also are doing interest targeting.  Go ahead.  Jim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought they just made an announcement fairly recently  that they were actually going to dial down the amount of  links from brands and publishers and dial up in, you know,  your friend like actual news from your friend.  Yes.  And which and they said we're going to do this and we know  that it's going to, you know, hurt our bottom line, but  we're going to do it because we hear from users.  Is that what you're saying?  Leo?  Like is that what's making your newsfeed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think maybe that is it because one of the things I  didn't like is, you know, I thought Facebook was going to  be a way for me to stay in touch with family and friends  crazy me.  I thought that was the point of it.  And they very much moved away from that with the newsfeed.  You could still, you know, on the newsfeed go chronological  instead of top stories.  But if you look at top stories, it's it for a long time.  It was a lot of brands a lot of crap.  I've seen a lot of up worthy style link bait and I just  wasn't interested and then much more so now it's it's  friends and family.  Although I feel like it's very algorithmic because I  certainly don't see everything by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll see like a big announcement, you know,  somebody's having a baby or getting married, but it was  like a, you know, a week ago or something, but it just  so many people liked it over time that it bubbled up.  So it feels like oh, this is a little bit later, but at  least I am seeing it.  I have noticed that it's been better.  My newsfeed has been a little bit better in the little  time that I spend on Facebook.  Anyway, Jeff, I didn't I didn't mean to.  I didn't mean to cut you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that whole thing about publishers hosting their  content on Facebook.  It just at first glance just seems insane.  No, why?  What?  Well, yeah.  I don't know.  Talk, tell me, talk to me about this, Jeff, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  well, all right, here's the other problems are obvious,  right?  You're handing over your content to Facebook and if you  believe content is the only value you make, then that's  an issue.  I would argue that what what's more dangerous is if you  hand over your relationship to your reader to Facebook,  but that again is where Facebook I think can do  something about it.  I wrote a post about what Facebook could do for news  And my argument is that Facebook can make news  publishers smarter about their own users far better  than they know so that they can give those users  greater relevance and greater value and increase the  value of news organizations.  So I think that's possible.  That's not what's been talked about yet.  It's not there in the cards yet, but they haven't said  what they're going to do yet.  Now, meanwhile, at one level, you've got to recognize  that people are not less and less and less.  They are going to go to news sites.  And so we must go to where the readers are.  There's a page-based web and now there's a stream-based  web and Facebook has the stream-based web and stream-based  webs are about attention.  And so you want to get into that attention stream  somehow and and Facebook recognizes the clicking off  especially on mobile from a link on Facebook to open  up a browser no matter how fast the site is a bad user  experience.  You're going to lose traffic along the way.  So will Facebook.  So they said spider to the fly come here and put your  content here.  Well, then to me that all matters simply is about  business deal.  If the content is in I've long argued you've heard when  they show it if content were embeddable on these platforms  with the business model attached to that content, then  there's every reason to let your content fly and the  business model to me means one your brand is attached  to your there's revenue attached whether that's your  advertising or the hosts advertising or a revenue share.  That's just a matter of negotiation.  Three.  This is the important part data attached analytics  attached that you know that you know, this reader is  interested in something and you can give them more  relevance as a result and Facebook doesn't hold on to  that information alone.  That's that's that's the big issue to me and that's  unknown and therefore links to you.  You still have a site but a site may be more like an  archive now a site may become less important.  So so you find you know, if you look at Snapchat  discover publishers are going there.  They're getting paid for it.  You want to be on Pinterest mode media.  The former glam just announced a whole big new platform  which which curates stuff publishers can be part of  that.  You put your stuff on YouTube get distributed.  I think we're going to get to a point where less and  less and less emphasis is put on the site more and more  and more emphasis is put on going to where people are  and where they are right now may not stay this way.  But right now is in streams of attention.  What do you think about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just the money part Facebook is paying them.  They're paying Facebook is paying them to do this.  Pay.  Well, we don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't know yet.  That's not been revealed.  But but there have been there have been rumors.  There have been reports on verified reports and I don't  know.  I'm not a privileged to find out but I'm not under any  NDA as of yet or anything but but there have been  reports that that I think the way the report says is  that the publishers add appearing on the distributed  content on Facebook.  The publisher would keep a hundred percent of the  advertising for that if that's the case.  Basically what you get is all kinds of new audience  for you and your and your advertisers.  What's not to love?  What's not to love is if Facebook only learns more  about your readers than you do and Facebook is the  one that controls relevance and Facebook controls  that was also not to love is if Facebook when I was  at the Perugia Journalism Festival.  There was a study there an academic talking from  Oxford talking about how Berlin's biggest paper I  think in Norway.  I think chat room will correct me.  I had a picture illustrating 60s hippies and had  some some nude people frolicking to the beach.  Well, of course Facebook took that down because  that's their community standards evidently got in  trouble for apparently their statue of David their

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  community isn't in Scandinavia.  And and that's the problem with community standards.  If you apply them globally, what does that even mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you end up with the lowest common denominator  of freedom.  We're all going to be in Burkitt's, you know that  that doesn't work clearly.  So so also at face at Perugia Andy Mitchell from  Facebook gave a talk where he where he talked about  all these good things Facebook's doing but when he  was questioned by a well-known journalism  professor George Brock by another person about  Facebook's responsibility to society now that it  becomes more of an editor of journalism Andy kind  of didn't grapple with the question sufficiently  and George Brock and Jay Rosen went after him.  I think this is a discussion that Facebook has  to start it.  They don't have the answers right now, but but  there's a face.  It's a discussion to have that what is Facebook's  responsibility to society.  So there's a money responsibility here.  There's a data responsibility and there's a societal  responsibility of free speech.  But if you can work that out and always the optimist  maybe to my fault.  I think that that if news could get all kinds of  new readers and new relevance on Facebook through  Facebook with a good business deal with protection  for journalistic standards with protection for the  relationship with the consumer.  Those are a lot of ifs then I see a positive thing  here.  Now the other argument that's made is that okay,  let's say they do all of that.  Let's say it's just hunky-dory.  It's group hugs.  It's it's kismet.  It's karma.  Then the fear is that what Facebook give us Facebook  could take away.  Yeah, they change the rules right which we've seen  with Twitter Lord knows and others.  But again, yeah, but I think I think that that's that's  part of the discussion to have is to say that is the  is the state of Facebook.  Listen, you need to understand some principles here.  We need to negotiate some principles about your  behavior when it comes to these things that actually  matter to society, you know, that's been the arguments  about Facebook doing, you know experiments with human  beings to get them to vote more.  Well, that's also known as advertising and marketing  and and we all do testing.  Yeah, I be testing but but there needs to be a  discussion of principles so that that that when there  is a controversy and there will be we can take the  discussion back to those principles and test against  those principles and and see what works.  So I'm optimistic.  This is this is doable.  But but I don't know enough to know where Facebook  really is.  It's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it is a really big deal.  It feels like this mirrors.  I've been I've been having this ongoing discussion  with my friends kvetching a little bit about about  medium, which is an obviously an amazing tool,  but it feels like all of my my friends who have been  this like an independent bloggers, you know, the the  the Andy Bayo and the Dana Boyds and the Neil  Daschers the Jeff Jarvis is even are writing on  medium now and I was sort of I was sad.  I'm sad.  I'm generally sad too.  Yeah, it makes me a little sad and I really thought  to think hard about what's sad about it because  everyone loves medium, you know, and Anil has argued  with me.  He's an advisor to medium, you know that the writing  tools are better and he writes more because of me.  There's community to see his stuff.  Yeah, there's distribution right like medium, you know,  Andy Bayo saying like 10 times the number of people  see the stuff that I write on medium than they ever did  on on my site waxy.org and so I can't tell if it's  just it still seems crazy to me and I have yet to  write a piece on medium and part of me is like I'm  afraid that I'm going to like it too much or something.  I don't know.  Well, you should try I find Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's it's it's a different thing for different  uses right medium.  We talked about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You always cross post to your own site, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, always a little that's why what I because  media on medium you hold on your copyrights.  You can put as many places you want.  No problem medium.  That's that's really important and they do have an  export tool and they do have an embed tool.  So I have been made to work on my blog.  What I would love is you could use that by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm sorry the embed tool.  Yeah, just something to make your blog a little jazzier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was mean.  I'm sorry.  Why don't you use Gina's framework?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the other thing.  My blog has become more of just a repository or an archive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's a perfectly appropriate thing and we give  out your blog address because that's where you go.  You may see Jeff in other places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I for all things Jeff.  Yeah, I think you'll go to Baker Bay.  Yeah, I feel like I'm sorry.  I'm sort of mourning that right and there's this  parallel.  I know I agree with you Gina and I'm but there's no reason  is that just because I'm old and dumb like I you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder that too not about you but about me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's a thing like you should go to the word  people are right like.  Yeah.  Yeah, and I guess that just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or do you go to other people's spaces?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can go to other people's spaces if a you don't lose  control of your content ever right in your relationship,  right?  So cross posting as far as I'm concerned is fine.  Yeah, and I guess the other thing would be as long as  those other people don't influence your content.  Yes, and so I put myself in the position of like what  if what if NBC came to us and said we'd like to take  some of your content and use it digitally.  If it if if I didn't lose control of the content that  be fine if they didn't say tell me, you know make it  forty four point three minutes that would be fine,  but you know would kill us.  Well, that's the you know, and and and then the other  the other issue is a larger issue, which is so they  could say that but you're doing a deal with the devil  and it might be that at some point this is for sure true  of Facebook all that changes.  I guess then you could pull back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had this discussion with my class my own class just  just Monday where the emotions come out first.  They will I don't like Facebook does this.  I don't like Facebook does that I had I took me a long  time to get things down and say whoa.  Everything in life is negotiation.  Yeah, and either you got a good negotiation.  You get a bad negotiation, but you have to go in saying  what do they have that I want?  What do I have that they want?  Where are we complimentary?  Can we do something mutual benefit and it's a matter  of negotiation and a matter of a deal cold hard  thought through negotiation and of course you don't  negotiate individually with Facebook.  But does Facebook give a deal that is good for groups,  you know writers meet this medium give a deal.  It's good for writers.  I think they're they're they're enabling.  There's a great thing called mid-century modern Debbie  Gallant who was the queen of hyperlocal bloggers.  And now I work with her in the ecosystem in New Jersey.  She started a new site called mid-century modern for  people our age Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I must go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you got big print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think big print is yours about about peon and things  like that.  No, it's not about.  But Debbie Debbie's one of them is going to kill me for  joking Debbie's wonderful and she's basically says I  can make a new business on medium as a platform that  would be a change.  This is a woman who built barista net.  She built the premier hyperlocal blog ran it for 10  years knows how to do it knows everything that's tough  about it and she's gravitating to medium because it gives  her distribution.  There's a chance for advertising opportunities.  It's elegant and beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It strikes me.  That's the main thing that people like about medium is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  elegant and beautiful elegance is amazing and that seems  dangerous.  It affects how I write it absolutely affects how I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  write because because the interface is so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you want to be prettier.  You don't want to be as sloppy as I can be in my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I take it all back dancing gifts.  I take it all home page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the home page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Click on that that that the letter to Cheryl from Katie  Hafner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Katie have lost her husband as well.  I did not know that I didn't know.  Yes similar way.  And that by the way, Sheryl Sandberg's post about the  loss of her husband on Facebook on Facebook, of course,  because Cheryl's the COO at Facebook was really touching  and and couldn't have been more beautiful.  You know, we we had oddly enough Jason Calacanis on  Twitter on Sunday and he played poker with Dave Goldberg  calls him Goldie.  He said on Wednesday, I sat right next to Goldie during  the poker game and he and he gave a very touching tribute.  I didn't know Goldberg.  Did you guys know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I only know him as Cheryl's husband, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he but he was a mensch.  I mean, there's just no question if you read the tributes  and after talking to Jason that this was a great guy,  you know, it really frosted my flakes.  And I can't remember who it was some blog decided.  Well, they haven't revealed the cause of death.  So it must have been suicide and that so infuriated me.  And unfortunately, I think forced their hands.  They did reveal eventually that it was a just a freak accident.  He was on a treadmill and alone apparently in the gym at  the Resort of Mexico fell off.  They don't know because nobody was there.  I guess hit his head and bled out.  There's just a freak accident.  Although kudos to the Washington Post which told that story  and then said and by the way, this happens a lot.  Treadmills are really dangerous.  Be careful.  We have a treadmill at home and in fact had an accident.  Our 12 year old got burned because he was riding on it fell  off.  He didn't have the clip on that stops it and the treadmill  burned his arm not badly, but it was kind of an eye-opener.  These are very powerful engines and can be very dangerous.  So anyway, I don't know why I brought all that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except I had you click on that piece.  We were looking at the video.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Glad we mentioned Goldberg.  I mean my social feed was phenomenal from that moment.  And that was where Facebook people who wanted to know him

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook really lived up to its purpose.  It did.  In fact, it's the second time in two weeks it has because the  safety center that Facebook does was such a resource for  people in Nepal to let friends and family know they were safe  and it worked amazingly and it might my friend and our digital  photography guy Chris Mark Ward who is a regular there said  the reason is everybody in Nepal and Katmandu where they don't  have a lot of computers a lot of infrastructure, but a lot  of people have smartphones and use Facebook on their smartphones.  That's that's it.  And so it actually you would say well Facebook.  It's going to be useful there, but it's immensely useful there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two things on Facebook.  We're on Facebook one just on this point.  So I left a little comment on Cheryl's post just to thank her  for the generosity of doing it in the midst of her grief.  And I noticed that that Facebook prioritizes the comments on  posts according to me as a user.  It's people I know.  Isn't that great?  No, I had no idea of that.  Yeah.  The other thing to mention about Facebook slight change of topic  is you saw Zuckerberg's video trying to thread the needle on  free internet and net neutrality, which I think he did actually  pretty well.  Did you see that?  I did not it's on the rundown under Facebook.  Okay, because the issue with free internet is that if you if  you give it away in Africa or India and say these are the  services you're going to get free including that Facebook  green Facebook a light Facebook that is a violation that would  principle of net neutrality, right?  So what's not argues in there is net neutrality is very important  net neutrality is about trying to charge people rip them off.  This is about trying to give people free internet and we can't  afford to give them the whole internet for free, but we can't  afford to give them something to start with and services make  money in the end by basically upselling you and he opened up  internet.org to other developers now, whether it's open enough  one we can debate till the cows come home, but it's a very  delicate argument and I think he did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well to your to your point looks the first comment.  I see is you yeah, because Facebook knows.  Oh, you know, that's your buddy Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So by the way, what are the people who like that comment?  Yeah was Mark Zuckerberg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's clear.  He's in here responding to people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but what was also so I my notification on Facebook said  Mark Zuckerberg parenz a friend of Robert Scoble.  Oh Lord, he's he's zeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's he's Zellie.  That's it Scoble is Zellie.  You figured it out.  He is Zellie a man of no apparent, you know, I don't want  to say use but no apparent talents who is everywhere.  It's a Woody Allen movie.  You got to see it.  And so though so you felt like we were not listening to Mark  because it's you know, it's video but it's long but you  feel like his response was he said threaded the needle.  He threaded the needle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, I think it's I can imagine people coming to me and  saying oh, but you forgot this forgot that and I think it's a  very complex discussion, but I'm I was very curious to hear  what you two would think about this is a limited free internet  a violation of net neutrality and does it does it does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think you could the perfect can be the enemy of  the good.  I think sometimes yeah.  Okay, ideally it would be a free and open internet, but if  that's not practicable, let's make the first steps and and  with a with a and then this would I would ask Facebook to  do with the intent and the goal of making it open eventually.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and I said that there are this to I said there you need  a discussion of principles.  You need to say that you know, he won't think he said is he  has no ads on it.  That's good.  You know, you need to say that you're not going to pull the  rug out from people and exploit them.  You know, you need to understand what principles are but but  yeah, I think that on the free end being able to get people  connected in some even limited way is better than not be  connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say I have to think that and you know, and the  example that Chris Mark our gave of of Nepal really shows  that there is value even if it were just Facebook that there  can be some value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's a can of worms.  It can become a can of work, you know, it's one of the  things was like that there has to be a very clear goal toward  do you know opening it all up right so but but yeah, let's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  take a break.  We're going to come back with more Jeff and Gina.  It's the band back together.  Love doing it this time.  I got a new watch.  I want to show everybody it's not the Apple watch.  It's actually a pretty good competitor to the Apple watch  and there's actually the changelog is busy busy busy.  There's lots to talk about including a big acquisition  that a lot of people are applauding for Google.  But first a word from legal zoom, you know, if you're  starting your own business, there's certain things you ought  to do but it doesn't require a big expensive white shoe law  firm to get done.

Had you used anybody use time full on iOS people I know who  have were really fond of it.  It was kind of an interesting artificial intelligence take on  time management.  It would go through your your calendar and your email would  look at what you had when he had time to do stuff that you  wanted to do it would actually say hey, let me schedule this  in for you because you're going to have time to do it.  Well, Google has acquired them.  The app will stay available.  For the foreseeable future according to Google, but they're  going to try to add time full features into Google's existing  apps and services.  This would be great in Google now.  So what does it do if it's good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we I haven't used it.  I haven't even how it's like it supposedly figures out times  when you're most productive or it uses behavioral science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It tells us that it's much more effective to change the  environment people work in directly than introduce a new  tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it going to yell at me?  I hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here.  Let's watch the video.  I you know, the Apple watch yells at me to stand up every  hour and I've not found that annoying and in fact found that  fairly useful.  Yeah, because I actually do stand up if you've ever worn a  Fitbit there is value to knowing kind of everything you need

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to do here's their video and finds good times for you to get  things done.  Timeful gives you an overview of your day and what you have  this guy sounds depressed.  It's a calendar.  Wake up.  I'm tired and I don't want to do this video list directly  on your calendar giving you a suggested game plan for your  day.  You can drag things around to adjust your schedule.  Every time you check something off time for learns more about  you and your preferences.  I'm going to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's iOS, which is the issue for me.  I don't okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you enter to do list you schedule your to do's you  check them off when you do them.  That's how timeful tries to understand when you've been  productive.  So I'm I'm more likely to get to the gym at 11 o'clock in  the morning, but if I wait past 6, I'm not never going to  go that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and then it learns and it gets better again, which is  you're right.  I'm always skeptical that now Gina of course has a very good  to do list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zoo kind of person.  Yeah, I am a to do dot text to not person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am a to do person, but you know, I but I so I was just  thinking I mean it seems like you'd have to you have to  obviously use their their to do like this to do in this  calendar.  I wonder how Google is going to incorporate this because  Google has its it has its tasks project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has keep which is tasky like I would only use a to do list  program that works with Google.  Yeah, there are and there are many I use any do I've used  one.  I use wonder list there.  There are many that will work with Google tasks.  I assume this will start to I don't know if it did before

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's got it's got to right.  Right.  Yeah, that's interesting.  So you better get to the gym now and or you know, this is  a good time to work on that project.  I just I'm just not the type to write down like I'm going to  I got a code for three hours today.  No, you know, I got my calendar.  So it sounds like you have to obviously required to do some  of that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no way.  I'm gonna happen says Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm now flashing on this image Leo that that I can see  on the next episodes of Silicon Valley.  There'll be a meeting everybody's sitting down and  suddenly everybody just stands up because it's their hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to stand up guarantee you it's so easy to see to spot what  Dan Lyons is putting in that show.  Because it's so insider.  Like did you love the Mark Cuban guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he's he's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's this jerk jerk good the season.  I've been enjoying it.  Although I fear as Jason said this as well on the twit that  it's way too inside.  I mean we get it because we know the so there's a Mark Cuban  character who is like the biggest bro ever billionaire  bro and he says all about ROI man.  What a return on investment.  No radio on the internet.  He invented radio on the internet and then it's so funny.  The best part is where he shows up and he says I started  with 1.4 billion and now I have 1.6 billion and the the  Piper guy does the math and says given inflation you're  actually losing money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there was the three comma club.  There was so many great he's disrupting fatherhood.  I mean there was so many great lines.  I my favorite scene was that when they're interviewing  coders and Jared says so are we to take it that you did not  crush it in 2012?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I had a health problem in in 2012, but I wasn't able to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  100% crush it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wasn't able to and the cyborg.  Do you love the cyborg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So great and you know, whatever that a lot of people complained  about the representation women on the show.  So I loved it that the the engineer that they hired finally  hired a woman like completely troll the whole team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, oh she trolled him and then the and then she's going  out the door guys says I love the dragon tattoo.  Love the girl with the dragon tattoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was like so crazy.  So funny with cringe.  I mean, it is really there on point this season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So apparently time full.  I'm not sure the chat room saying that Dan Ariely who is  a guy of course, who wrote predictably irrational and is  a behavioral economist very interesting guy had something  to do with time for.  I don't know if that's the case.  I'm looking at their website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're not going to be rational enough to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  I'm always suspicious.  Oh Ashton Kutcher is an investor.  I'm always looks like he made a big exit.  I'm always suspicious when they say the computer will do it  for you because they never seem to do a very good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say that the Google Now is like, hey, you've got  this place to be you need to leave in 20 minutes.  I love Google.  Pretty great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where the battlefield by the way having now, you know,  I've used I used Android Wear for a long time with my Moto  360 have this new one, which really looks pretty and I've  been using the Apple watch.  Yeah, I'm that guy with two watches.  But I have to say that is if there's one advantage Android  Wear has it will be Google Now because Apple can't really  do that.  It can't do that.  Not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple Calendar and Apple Mail and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you have an iPhone, you don't have a choice of  Android Wear.  You only have a choice of what I'm saying is if you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  live in the Google verse, all only live in the Apple universe  and there's Google Now.  No value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, that's what they could replicate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but Siri doesn't Siri have some features around your  stuff or or no?  Siri completely separate.  No, you know what does Microsoft show me my day.  Oh Cortana, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tana is very asked you a lot of questions about yourself and  then tries I think Apple because of their stance that I  applaud but their strong stance on privacy is going to have  a hard time doing what Google Now does because it really  Google Now works because it goes through your email.  You know, it's it's it looks what you're doing where you  are does all sorts of things that Apple of course could do  and probably is doing by the way, but but isn't it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The story recommendations like the stories that you'd be  interested in is actually quite good for me.  I find myself flipping over to Google Now as much as I would  go to Twitter.  If I'm just looking for something to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once again, I I'm not getting it.  Now I'm every all I get is Snowden and Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you may friend and need to broaden your interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I use the Google I use the Google Play News app.  I look at all kinds of stuff.  It knows what I search for for some reason is always Chromebook  and Snowden last week tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not that's not too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they don't know how it does it.  I watched them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did it does know what you watch.  Yeah.  So here's a baseball for me.  Here's an article about Colin Kaepernick.  They know I'm a Niners fan.  Here's classic rock and oldies.  There's some Beatles information.  I don't know who Kamil Nanjiani is, but apparently he's not  Kunal Nair.  So that's good.  Here's where I parked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a stories to read module like separate from the  ones with the dark header?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Yeah, I got that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want stories to read is where I wind up customized the heck

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  out of this thing.  We did it last week.  You weren't here but you know, we went through this it because  they've added downloaded apps now.  Oh, where would I everything else?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is another module that's called stories to read.  How do I get that module?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So stories to read.  Let me see.  Where do you get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you turn I mean that's what's that's part of what is  annoying and time full will be equally annoying about kind of  computer driven decisions is if you let the computer do it,  then do you ever get to do it?  And is there a way to override the computer and maybe the  computer isn't so smart about me after all.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right.  It's at the top of everything else for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stories to read.  So I got is there a way chat room is there a way do you know  to turn that on?  There's an orange one is orange good.  That's sports, right?  Yellow how long it's take me to get home.  The gray is what I'm getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, you're right.  You're right.  You know, this is pretty good list.  I didn't know for example, that reddit is starting a video  division to create original content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  I think it's because we failed.  We tried to do a show called read it up and read it was very  interested.  Sarah Lane and Chad Johnson hosted that they both disappeared  after I canceled the show.  So maybe it's my fault.  They but it just didn't it didn't quite work for me.  We did a bunch of beta test episodes.  We tried changing things around.  Read it was immediately in touch and said can we you know,  you know what we their interest they understand the value of  doing a dig nation for read up read it and so as soon as we  stopped read it up.  They did an audio thing and now they've just announced they're  going to do a video production as well.  Is it basically dig nation?  Well, that's I think kind of what we were thinking is let's  do a dig nation where you highlight the interest dig nation  was really valuable in making dig a success because it was a  very engaging fun podcast with Kevin Rose and Alex Albrecht.  In which they would highlight great stuff on dig and they  talk about it because the show did so well it drove a lot of  traffic to dig and I think that's probably what read its  thinking.  But I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always imagine that dig nation kind of serve the super  like the super users of day, but no it did bring it.  I think you can say that the nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know for a fact or both but but I think you didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  have to use dig to enjoy the nation.  You say oh that's that's the hot stuff this week and they  had fun listening to what it was and they drink beer and  they go to the bathroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, they're bringing it back.  Oh really?  Well, you know I'll ask Kevin.  Kevin's going to be on the new screensavers on Saturday.  He'll be our guest host.  But yeah, it was my understanding that he and Kevin  and Alex had talked and that they were going to do at least  some new episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If not, Kevin's left Google Ventures, right?  And he's working on new stuff.  What's he doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has an assistant there.  It's really this really, you know, once you're in the good  old boy network, life changes.  So he still has that email address and he still posts  Foundation as a Google Ventures thing and but he's got a new  startup Watchville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm still waiting for that change.  He's on a boat.  I want to get to that network.  How do I get to that network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Gina, what is it?  We're working stiffs.  That's the difference.  Yeah, we're working stiffs.  Some people I've seen it happen before.  They just it's not just because they get money.  We were talking about with Jason also about secret.  There's a little upset over a secret secret which exited.  This is the anonymous app that was used basically by Silicon  Valley insiders to bully other Silicon Valley insiders.  They shuttered this last week, but what I didn't know and what  came out in the stories about it is that the founders the  two founders during their a round their very first round of  funding had taken six million dollars off the table three  million each and I asked Jason is that usual I've heard of  founders taking money off the table.  He says unheard of he said and it upsets people.  He said it's not unusual if you've been working for a long  time on your startup and you're taking another round of  funding to take a little bit Kevin did take took some money  on the I think on revision three took some money off the  table a million dollars or so.  But he said you never do that in the a round.  That's just appalling and now we're starting to hear other  VCS like upset about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the secret thing is weird.  Yeah, isn't it the idea of you take money off the table after  you would like haven't paid yourself a salary for several  years and have been through several rounds.  Right.  Yeah, you've earned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  After you're fully vested in your stock to be your investing  schedule in stocks.  So you don't we're running away.  This is before that you get fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is before the IPO obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also think it's a good sign for society that it died  secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, although yik yak and some of these other college-based  ones are worse.  Aren't they?  Because they yes, so secret really ended up just being  annoying to Silicon Valley because that's the only people  who first of all who read it and it was all about people  saying bad things about other people's silicon Valley.  But yik yak and these other ones are and whispered are  really about kids in because they're geographic.  So you can see all of the people talking about stuff at  school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my my wife who works in University Administration was  at a conference of other University administrators at a  panel about the problems that yik yak introduced and people  in attending the panel were on yik yak saying things about  what was going on.  It was very meta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's addictive.  It plays to our worst.  Kind of side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's tough though, you know, like I found myself in  this weird position with secret.  I mean, I think I don't think that the founders acted, you  know, in good faith and it sounds like the exit was bad  and I realized that like the experience on secret was  actually quite bad.  But I do think that there's a place for anonymity.  It's really hard to do well.  I think ask Metafilter does it does it kind of well.  It's the only place that I've seen people be able to sort  of anonymously ask personal questions.  I think there are people in this world who have legitimate  life-changing secrets and I do think that there's something  there like how can people reach out and talk to one another  about those secrets?  I mean from you know, I'm in the closet.  I think I'm a woman.  I'm here in this country illegally.  I just got diagnosed with cancer and haven't told anyone  I mean people live with like really soul-crushing secrets  that you really you could get you can get support from people  online, right?  And I mean there's ways to do that through, you know,  whatever throw away handles whatever but I think there's  something there in the product.  There's something in the spirit of the product.  But it's the architecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's how you it's how you make it and if you make it in such  a way that people are going to come in and just use it as a  snark factory.  Yeah, then that's what it's going to become or if you're not  going to devote the resources to get rid of that stuff, which  you're probably not going to do then that's the problem.  So it depends on how it's architected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is good.  This kind of goes back to my thing about you know, it doesn't  take a coder to make it app right like that designing a  product like that particularly like that a sensitive product  is a very difficult thing and the moderation required in a  setting that you know allows anonymity is also tremendous.  But I don't know I what I didn't like about the secret thing  is that everyone was sort of dismissing it as this terrible  idea and I actually think that there's a little bit of a good  idea like some good could come out of a scenario like that if  it's done well, it was not done well in the case of secrets.  But yeah, RIP secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get your project fi invite yet?  Nope, did you?  Nope, no, but somebody's email me said I got one.  So they're going to us.  In fact, I noticed a change in language in the project.  I said this is Google's wireless play wireless cell phone  play.  I noticed on the project fi site.  They said something like.  Oh, no.  Jason has just showed me something very disturbing from  the verge signing up for project fi will destroy your Google  voice account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, how do we know that kind of consumes it and what you  basically give up a lot of voice features if you and and and

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  roads you go down you can't go back on it appears all kinds  of bad stuff.  And I know it's got me thinking twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do they warn you anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they have it in their house.  I mean, I'm sure they do in the onboarded process and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  everything because I use my Google voice number all the time.  So here is here is a page.  I guess somebody got an invite and send them a screenshot like  your Google voice number.  Keep it no matter if you keep your Google voice number or  not many aspects of Google voice will carry over to your  project fi service.  Your Google voice credit will be transferred automatically to  project fi bring your Google voice number to project fi  actually wouldn't mind that or use a different number your  Google voice number will be released when you activate  service no getting it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you either ported over or you don't and it gets released  is how I read that which doesn't sound like a very good  good thing for voice faithful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google voice notes that once a voice number has been  transferred to fi you'll no longer be able to receive or  send calls or messages through the company's Google voice  apps, but does hangouts still work because I have I stopped  using Google voice apps and say goodbye to your voicemail  and call history.  These will no longer be saved with voice.  What you've switched old messages will be preserved,  but that's I've already transferred to hangouts on that  right most people I would think have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have voice existing conveniences like call forwarding  blocking automatic voicemail transcriptions and cheap  international calling are making the move to fi.  And if you've already routed messages of voicemails at  Google hangouts, these changes may not seem so drastic.  But if you are still using the plain old Google voice apps,  maybe do use another email to register for Google fi.  It doesn't sound good that we've been waiting for the other  shoe to drop.  Haven't we on Google voice?  It's hard to tell for me to tell what this means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I know exactly.  I'm trying to understand it to somebody just posted in the  chat that Russell Holly at Android police basically saying,  you know, don't worry about it.  It's not going to destroy your Google voice account.  So we're missing some sort of context area from the verge,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  perhaps.  I trust Russell Russell's been on all about Android many times.  He's a great commentator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he regularly is the one on it, you know, on the Android  sites that saying, hey, you're the sky's not falling.  Yeah, everybody's freaking out over nothing.  Let's let's take a step back and take a closer look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android M.  You just got used to L.  We just got lollipop.  Get ready for meringue pie.  Mars a pan.  Mars a pan.  Mars a pan.  What's a pan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would be a marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Marshmallow.  Marshmallow.  Macaroon.  I think there's too much Ghostbuster temptation here.  Marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want a Ghostbuster.  Look at this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the article from Android police has features macaroons  French style Macaron.  They'll be announcing Android M at Google I.O.  according to the conference schedule.  They've since removed that page.  But here's the screenshot that Android police got Android  for work update Android M.  Is bringing the power of Android all kinds of workplaces.  Maybe that was just a typo.  Maybe they meant L.  L was announced last year at Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure they meant M and they just, you know,  but they don't set it off and didn't mean to.  Right.  Or maybe they meant to.  Because Google sometimes it seems like they you know,  this happens and it goes away and they know that people are  just going to spend the next month obsessing over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know.  Yeah.  I'm liking L a lot.  But there are still some issues.  There's still a memory leak which they have yet to fix.  Really apparently have a problem.  Well, you probably reboot your phone every few days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, how does that manifest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this comes, you know, mostly from XDA developers and so  forth.  Let's see.  Here's a green bot article that's probably written in user  speak.  It manifests somebody in the chat room says because I have  400 apps.  Android lollipop.  This is an old article.  So I'm not going to well from January the issue tracks in  the issue tracker in the AOSP bug tracker.  It says rampant use of RAM.  A memory leak causes apps either to run slowly or crash  without any warning Android 5.0 point one apparently takes  up as much as 1.3 gigs of RAM.  If you don't have more than two that could be an issue ticket  for the RAM issue opened on the AOSP tracker a month ago.  That would be end of the year last year.  But I have also seen others say that neither five one or  five one fixed it.  Yeah, it's a mixed results on that.  Yeah, I reboot I actually do reboot my Android device  restart it, you know, just restarted every day or so.  You do.  Yeah, I have noticed and it could be a Samsung thing.  God knows Samsung's got similar.  Oh, yeah, but it could be a Samsung thing.  They apparently are soak testing 5.2 already on the s6  edge.  People have seen it but no word about whether that affects  it or whether the issue is more of a Samsung issue.  But yeah, I've noticed that it gets a little less responsive  over time.  And if you reboot it at all seems like that could also you  people are right.  I do have a little bit too many apps running so it could just  me me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've only had lollipop a couple of days on my one plus one  and I haven't seen that but I've had I've I forgot to plug  it in and it ran out of battery.  So I changed it.  I had you know restarted it for that reason.  Yeah, I haven't seen I haven't seen that yet.  That's interesting.  I like lollipop though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that you're using oxygen on your one plus one  probably right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I know I saw it's not it's a cyanogen 12.  I guess it's 12.  Oh you got CM to 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, see I put now see I don't know what's going to happen  Jason.  I both put oxygen on one plus ones, right?  Yeah, because it came because it came out first.  Right.  I just wanted to root it and we had to do all that, you know  new new recovery and twerp and all that but I love it.  Yeah, but now I don't think I could put CM 12 probably on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it right because he could is it lollipop base?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could I yeah, oh oxygen is as pure as can be it's pure as  the lollipop as it can be.  It's basically a GPE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's there's very very few customizations on top of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your product edition.  Let me see if there's a software update.  This show I always check for updates.  Damn your device is up to date always up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Damn it always up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate it about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I do like the I like a material design a lot.  I think it's good.  I'm you know, I'm not crazy about touch was you know,  Samsung's it's pretty clean but Samsung is always is but I  have noticed that there's some sluggishness over time.  And so I just I restart from it's very easy.  Just press and hold the start button you restart and five  seconds later, you know, 1030 seconds later you're back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you finding any value to the curve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, in fact a little bit it gets in the way because your  touching the screen all the time.  So sometimes I accidentally touch the screen having said  that this is the nicest.  I love this phone.  I'm going to be so glad now that I have an Android Wear watch  that I can go back to using because I've had to use an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been paid all to that wouldn't last too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like actually like the Apple watch.  I don't I really think that what really has happened is  there's very close parity at this point between Android Wear  and Apple and I think they're going to go back and forth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like that which pisses me off about the media coverage  because you know when it came out Apple came out it was  as if Android Wear didn't exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I had that same feeling.  Have you compared like the heartbeat monitoring and the  steps are they comparable across the two watches Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know people have often Dr.  Mom keeps saying why don't you wear all of the bands  and then work out and see what they say and I don't think  that matters so much as long as you're consistent with one  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because really you're comparing yourself to previous days.  The Apple watch seems to be very very  accurate I would say Android Wear has been less so but not  horribly less so I haven't I just got this I haven't actually  done any exercise with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what is the what is that's the LG what again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I guess we should talk about it.  Let's take a break.  We'll talk about the urbane.  Is that urbane or what?  Actually, I don't I maybe we don't need to do we only have  one more right?  I could do it.  We could do a little urbaneify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the flat tire going on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yeah, no flat tire LG got rid of that with the the R as  long as you have the the bezel you're okay and it's a what  I really like about it.  And I think the key well the bezel doesn't hide it.  It's just a rat.  It's literally a round LED.  Hello, what's going on here?  Oh, that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love you could hide the electronics needed that required  the flat tire in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Either maybe I don't know if you were I think they're just  using a different screen nowadays and they don't really  know is that it.  Yeah, let me see if I can get so comes with some nice watch  faces.  This one's kind of interesting.  This is called daily that gives you calendar information as  well.  But the big look at that.  See that's my next appointment.  The big the big thing that's kind of cool about this is it's  an OLED screen.  So the Moto 360 is LCD and once you get to once you go OLED  you never go back.  It's just it also saves battery because only the white stuff  is using juice.  So I feel like yeah, the other thing that I like Android  Wear better, you know, you know, as the Apple Watch turns  off it really has to save power.  So what it just goes blank Android Wear has always had this  kind of dim version.  That's what you're seeing right now.  The so the watch is always on you can always see what time  it is.  But if you want if you want to wake it up, you know, you do  the little bit of the wrist thing.  On the other hand, the Apple Watch has consent heartbeats,  which this cannot do yet.  I keep pressing too hard.  It's I forget doesn't have forced touch.  I like this.  This is the stock watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Force touch is an Apple Watch thing.  Yeah, that's an Apple Watch.  It detects pressure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, 350 bucks on the urbane.  It's the same guts as the G watch are.  It's but the OLED screen is gorgeous.  And I think it's the styling is good.  You know, it's a little maybe it's a lot of stentations.  I got the gold one.  They have a silver one as well.  But if for 350 bucks you get gold, I think it's a good looking  watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This yeah, how big does it feel versus the Moto?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a 42 millimeter Apple Watch.  The Moto is about the same size, you know, square versus round.  This is big a slender rested man or woman might not like I am.  Yeah, and there's no unlike the Apple Watch where you can go  38 millimeters.  There's no there's no alternative in the Android wear space.  They're all big.  The Apple Watch is pretty.  I mean, come on.  You can't.  It is pretty cool.  It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean that one's pretty hip like it's pretty hipster, but I  like it.  Yeah, it's sporty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you saying my specific one is pretty hipster?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I mean hipster in a good way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it more hipster if I have Mickey on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard about the Mickey face.  What is up with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, remember Disney and Apple are kind of close.  This is the stainless steel with Milanese loop, which is about  700 bucks as as displayed upon my hairy wrist.  This is $350 with a leather band, although it's a standard  22 millimeter so you can put any watch band you want on there.  When does the urbane go on sale?  It's been it's I bought it last week.  You are here.  You did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It still says it didn't appear to be on sale.  Oh, yeah, it's on sale.  I bought it last week.  It's coming soon.  No one says coming soon on the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They ran out.  They ran out.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also this is the first watch with the Android wear 5 is a  5 2.  I guess I put one I believe or 5.1.  Yep.  And so that's kind of cool because it has the new card  flick, which I can't do because I don't have any cards, but  you can instead of touching it.  You can flick the cards like this.  It also has Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm wrong.  It's nope out of stock out of stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they sold that apparently you can and get them elsewhere  including a I think 18 team Verizon had them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the silver is in stock.  Not the gold you you endorse the gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a little coppery, but it's you know, what do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  think Gina?  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Taste alert here on the style of that watch silver versus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh silver versus gold.  I'm silver person.  Sorry Leo.  I would go with the silver but I silver looks nice and it has

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a complimentary leather band.  I really like actually this this watch a lot.  This you know what it comes down to what are you going to  carry an iPhone or an Android phone?  What do you like better?  Because the watches are so similar in capability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think these watches are ever going to talk to other  the other operating system or now it doesn't seem like  there's any financial incentive.  I mean it seems like these are accessories to the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ports are that that Google is going to do a version of  Android wear for iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it will not be very capable because Apple is it  can't yeah, Apple doesn't give you access to all this stuff.  I mean, it's certainly the Apple watch will always be the  most capable choice for somebody wearing using an iPhone.  I think they're both good.  I think smartwatches are of limited utility and nobody  should nobody should think of a smartwatch as something  that they have to have it doesn't do more than the phone  does.  Well, I guess it does if you talk about sending heartbeats.  I can't do that with a phone but and you know having sent  Lisa an awful lot of heartbeats now, I think we're kind of  I think we're kind of over it.  You know, the other person has to have an Apple phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that really seemed more like a marketing kind of over  that thing than the actual something really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's no longer even romantic to be honest with you.  So that's that Leo that's marriage.  Yeah, yeah, maybe maybe the Apple Watch is like marriage  after after six months.  You couldn't care less.  No, that's terrible.  I'm joking.  I'm joking, honey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Send another heart quick quick quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just you know, of course Lisa and I work together.  So it's not if I wanted to send her a heartbeat.  I could just press my chest against her ear.  So that would make that would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Get away from me.  So anyway, what else is new in the in the Googleverse?  Let me look quickly.  There's stuff here.  Yeah, let's see.  I do I think when we talked to think about this idea that  the Wi-Fi now is available just as the Apple Watch can talk  to the phone anywhere within the Wi-Fi network.  The Android this is the first Android where they use that  feature and it does have Wi-Fi enabled on it.  And I want to test whether it apparently will use the public  internet if it can get on the Wi-Fi.  So I'm going to leave my phone home tomorrow or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're going to phone call on it because one matter use  Google Voice.  That's okay.  There's an item at the last IO item a twig fan Matt Gunnard  this says it before every IO.  He looks up Google patents.  Oh, and he found a very interesting research and he found  a whole bunch that appears to be about a newfangled camera.  Ah, I love this is worth passing on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I found there been a lot of rumors that Apple was going to  have a new style camera with almost like the HTC one camera  with depth sensing in it and a whole new way of doing things  quad-core image processor multiple core image processors  portable device image processing nothing using sensed eye  position right and imaging device with system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, these are looking at glass related that would make

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  more sense.  Be yeah could be problem with patents especially in a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  company camera separate from processing unit.  So communication.  So, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a patent everything defensively.  Yes, it's not necessarily indicator that they're going to  be doing.  No, but I like that.  I like the research.  It was fun.  On the other hand, if I if I file a patent, you can bet that  I mean it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't they promise that they're working on a new camera?  It was a couple of IOs ago.  I feel like it was maybe like right before the last IO where  people saying hey there, you know, there isn't an Android  phone that can that has the camera can take the photos at  the iPhone can you know what's going on and he sounds

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  familiar.  Yeah, it was it was Victor or Eric Schmidt.  I can't remember which but they basically to the effect of  the next Nexus is going to have an amazing camera the Nexus  6 which I'm not sure if I would qualify the Nexus 6 is having  an amazing camera.  So yeah, it was probably just talking it up a little bit  with my guess.  But who knows that's that's what the next Nexus needs to  have right and we keep asking for it every year.  But this is one this is like a different year from any others  in the world of Android and the fact that there are cameras  on Android phones now that absolutely go head-to-head with  you know, the other amazing camera phone, which is the iPhone  the S6 the S6 easily goes head-to-head with the iPhone the  LG G4 amazing camera.  So now suddenly we've got a taste of it and we want it on  you know all the other devices.  So I really hope that that happens with the next Nexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that Apple will though will update its camera on the  next iPhone which comes out in the fall.  So it's going to be you know what competition great thing.  Absolutely.  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You look like a good photographer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love it better cameras watches whatever I might just bottom  my takeaway on any smartwatch is it's not it's a luxury not  a necessity.  It might be a value to you if you do the particular kinds of  things smartwatches are good at exercise listen, you know,  I mean there's some some value to it.  But for the most part it's a luxury item that really isn't a  necessity if your phone does everything in most cases and  just fine.  So I'm not I'm not wild about this.  Google is according to Android police going to also introduce  at IO voice commands that will let you control apps entirely  through voice.  This would be kind of the big issue with watches.  I have is they're too small to really do anything useful.  The UI is just too constrained.  But it's also too embarrassing to talk to your wrist.  Well, and I have had phone calls where I'm talking to the  wrist.  Yeah, I mean, it's cool.  I guess it's you know, it's great to be able to answer an  Apple watch call and say like hey, I'm in the middle of a  show right now.  I've done that a couple of times.  Can I call you back and it's quick and it's and you don't  look like too much of a fool.  You wouldn't want to walk down the street talking to your  wife.  Maybe you would maybe we'll get used to it.  We got used to people talking to themselves with Bluetooth  ear buds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can you can talk into the Apple watch.  Yeah, can you hear what the other person says you have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  conversation?  It's a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a speaker on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a phone.  You can make a phone call.  Voice actions in the new.  Is this part of this is part of Android right?  Yeah, would be able to allow developers to design apps that  use voice commands instead of touch input.  Without adding a lot of overhead it'll give users access  to their Android device through voice alone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some some new voice actions.  I have it in the change log as well along these lines.  I can't tell if this is referring to that or if they're  just going to open it up right to every developer and right  now.  It's just partners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, you want to see the wrist flick on the airband.  I got a few few cards I can show you so you see the cards.  Actually, this is kind of nice.  This is in the when it is in the dim mode.  The cards just show up as a little bit of text at the bottom  of the screen, which is kind of nice.  You know, you've got a notification and you can kind of  read it when it's in the bright mode.  It shows up as most Android wear watches and this is the  new thing instead of swiping you can do the wrist flick.  Whoops.  Oh and it'll come up and you go to the next one like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a bad trend that they said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we've said that before and I don't mean it's lovely  to have and it's great to really see the gadgets and they  get to show it off.  But and I think I think that it helps them and I mean,  I think people paid more attention to Chromebooks  because of of giving away the pixel, right?  They didn't all use them.  But I think they said oh, there's this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ian Thompson is hopeful that the new pixel will be available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, I've already had mine, but that's okay.  I mean, the same thing last time.  Absolutely.  I wonder whether the problem is they can't give five to  everybody, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently many people won't want it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So and they haven't generally I mean, maybe they've done  this with a phone with phones in the past, but they haven't  really duplicated a handout year to year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So like it's not going to be another watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  So I wouldn't expect another watch necessarily.  I actually wouldn't expect another Chromebook and unless  they feel like they really want to get everyone inspired  on making more Chrome out which I could be an ace's flip

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would be an ace's flip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that?  The Chromebook.  Oh, the ace's flip Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the tablet come I'm waiting for it.  It's coming out soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's a is it a convertible?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's cool.  Oh, you don't know.  You know what it's going to be is what's the what's the  little the Chromebook on a stick?  Chromebook on a stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  Oh, yeah, that's what that is.  Oh, that's what they'll give away.  That's what they'll give away.  Sure.  Why not?  Nine bucks reasonable.  You're right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Under a hundred bucks.  We don't might even be a lot under hundred.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they set the hard the bar high with cardboard.  Where they how are they going to talk?  Cardboard this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cardboard turned out to actually be really great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could have got that was it was better than a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the most memorable.  Yeah.  I mean Nexus Q the Chrome box.  Remember they gave us the one year they gave us the actually  from the Chrome box.  The pixel was amazing, you know, but the cardboard was you  know, I because it was a piece of cardboard was such a cool  piece of cardboard that really stuck out.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A tap apparently is has has some sessions that you know,  where they say they're going to show off wearables in quotes  wearables that we hope will blow your socks off.  I mean, I always all about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That means their shoes.  Wait a minute.  I'm not kidding.  See, wait a minute.  So all I'm saying your socks off or maybe it's like House  of Rest Band.  We can only hope what why would you want to wear a  wearable in a shoe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's get smart a shoe phone shoe phone get smart.  Sports Illustrated used to have a sneaker phone.  I like that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do this IBM used to have a thing that would be in your  shoe.  And then when you shook hands with somebody you would make  a connection between his shoe and your shoe and it would  transfer his business card to you from from it by the hands.  Oh my God, you gotta be kidding me.  They showed it at Comdex people were using it.  That was a lot.  Maybe that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Levitation shoes.  Most accurate step tracker out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's how the Nike thing worked with the Nike.  I can't that right right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know the the giveaways that I owe aren't just  giveaways to you know, give you stuff.  Generally Google is also doing it because they want to spur  development in a particular area or particular direction.  So, you know, maybe maybe there are is some sort of wearable  that we haven't thought about that Google would hand out  because it's a different type of wearable also not to mention  play services update allows for multiple wearable devices to  connect connect to one smartphone at a time right?  No one's well except for you Leo you're wearing two watches  at the same time, but most people aren't doing that but  you might have different wearable devices in other ways  you have different phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it's for.  You have one wrist one in your shoe one on your sports jacket.  Well, if you whatever it happens and an Android watch that  would make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe there are other wearables that we don't know of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yet and you know that there will be plenty of nerds at I  owe wearing both Android wear watch and Google Glass and  have a tablet a Chromebook and a phone on them.  You know that absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not going to do the I don't think we'll do the change  log.  I don't want to make Gina feel like that's just got to do  that every time she comes.  Oh, I'm there's not that much.  There's like a couple of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not that much and we talked about the voice actions  which was it which was right.  That was one of them collections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to talk about that collections?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at this.  I just I didn't get it at first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so you basically can file your posts under a certain you  can create a collection of posts.  So if you like to post about Glee and Chipotle and Android,  you can make three different collections and then subscribe  to say just your Glee collection, but not your UFC  collection.

Transcript:  How about cats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about cats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the thing folks and you know, you know, I am the great  defender of Google Plus.  Yeah, I it's a it's a straight line.  I get a laugh on no matter where I'm talking.  I still like Google Plus, but the truth is I'm gonna use it  less these days.  Is it worth?  You know, this is a neat feature, but is this going to draw  you back to invest in it again when you fear that it's dying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's sad because I love it like you and it's still it's still  useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh it is it is but connect to your audience particularly Leo  like yes and for all about Android too.  But yeah, my my Google Plus page is a sad tumbleweed.  Yeah, I'm doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys even had like far more followers than I ever got.  I stalled out for some reason recommended.  You were recommended.  That's really sad.  I never got recommended.  Twitter never put me on the suggested users list.  I never got remitted and recommended by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Organic following man.  You're just all that's what I tell myself.

Transcript:  Oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Google Plus.  It was my home page on my browser and I have it on all of  my look you can even see it's on the front page of the S6  and the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is the first edition and right around a year  to Google Plus edition first new feature.  That's a good point.  Since Vic left since Vic left always seen up until now is  features being redirected to other places.  Maybe have we seen new photo?  I don't even know possibly we've seen my minor updates to  photos, but even photos is being extracted out of Google  Plus and sent to its own home, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'm totally happy with Google Plus powering the  comments on apps in the Play Store and on YouTube and maybe  even, you know, if somebody wants to embed comments in  their website, but yeah, I think that the kind of social  network.  Well, I don't want to say this.  I feel like going to upset our viewers because we there are  a lot of people in the community that love Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I love it and I prefer social networks that are kind  of, you know, dying and so I do.  I stayed on friend feed long after the mojo had gone.  Yeah, you did.  I guess along secret.  I stopped.  You know what?  I felt so bad.  I would only look at secret while I was in the can on  the can.  No, I felt perfectly appropriate.  So I and I would always feel dirty afterwards.  So I just decided to leave it from my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No toilet could even no toilet seat could fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but washing toilet seat can fix that secret stank.  I think I should probably go home now.  We still have two ads to yes.  I thought I did too.  All right.  Here we go.  Let's do one right now.  We'll have we do there's lots more to talk about our show  today brought to you by smart things.  Actually, this is a great topic.  I like talking about the smart home and when I do go home,  you know, my home will welcome me because I have smart  things.  My home will play some soothing music will put on sunset  on my on my hue lights.  You know, it knows I'm there.  Thanks to smart things smart things was a Kickstarter  project.  In fact, one I believe that ms.  Tripani invested in the idea was simple to take all of the  smart devices you have in your home.  You schlegel locks your quick set locks your drop cams your  nest and Honeywell thermostats all that stuff and instead of  just each of them talking to their own app on your on your  phone.  They all talk to the smart things hub, which then talks to  the smart things app on your phone and suddenly you could  control everything simply and easily.  This is the right way to do smart things.  Once you have the smart things hub in the free app, you can  add as many devices as you want to customize your smart home  and it works with so many things.  In fact, there's a list on the smart things page that just  goes on Z wave Zigbee local area network cloud to cloud all  the protocols are handled by smart things.  We love it and you'll love it too.  So here's the deal is it smart things calm take a look at  their solution kits.  These are good because they kind of you know, if you've kind  of saying well, what can I do like there's the energy  saver kit that will you know, turn off things when you're  not around not moving.  There's the lighting automation kit that will there's water  detection.  That's actually great for the vacation home.  If the pipes burst, you'll know here's the deal go to smart  things.com and get 10% off any home solution home.  I'm sorry home security or solution kit and free shipping  in the US smart things.com slash twit and don't forget to  use that offer code TW IT that's smart things.  dot com slash twit.  We love it use it.  It's part of my smart home.  I don't know if you know, it's nice.  It actually doesn't feel like a smart home.  It just feels like things just work.  It's not like the home is like alive smart things just makes  it kind of all just work which I actually is to me that's even  better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The great product.  I'm glad that they are sponsoring us cloud big table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh boy, blame this to me.  No, no.  A highly scalable performant no SQL database.  You know, I you know, this is really geeky but I was playing  with a JavaScript framework called meteor and I was asking  around about it and they said oh, it's nice.  Yeah, it's great except it uses Mongo.  I said what's wrong with Mongo?  Oh, you don't know Mongo DB, which is another very popular  DB no SQL no SQL database apparently has loses data.  I didn't know this but people who develop with it say oh,  so that's not a good thing in a database missing data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, generally with the database you do want the data to be  there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I hope I'm not I hope I'm not besmirching Mongo because  I like Mongo.  I think meteor is great and it uses Mongo.  It's very easy, but you're not using Mongo.  Are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're not we're old school.  We're using the old my SQL.  Very old school, but I think I'm ready to kind of move into  the no SQL because that's the new hotness.  It's the new hotness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of faster because it you know, there's less  overhead anyway cloud big table is Google's no SQL database  and it is to use a buzz term or two highly scalable and  performant.  Performant should not be a word.  It's fast.  It's a noun that's it's an adjective that sounds like a  noun.  And is made up.  I think anyway, this is nice that Google releases this kind  of thing Gmail runs on Bigtable Google search runs on Bigtable  Google Analytics runs on Bigtable that should be enough  to tell you Bigtable is fast and effective single-digit  millisecond latency twice the performance per dollar and it  can be integrated with all existing applications in the  Hadoop ecosystem.  There I said it.  All right moving on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an interesting article from the verge eight cloud  photo sharing services.  This is what this is, you know what PC magazine used to do  this kind of thing.  It's what the big publication should be doing comparing  multiple, you know only only a company with a lot of resources  compare can compare them all and that's what they've done  here at the verge Casey Newton love him all-time greatest  album the best way to manage your photos in 2015 and the  point Casey made is that really everything is now reached  some sort of feature parody.  So which one should you pick?  Amazon just started their their their service.  It's you know, if you've got prime.  It's kind of unlimited storage for prime members.  I could tell you right now do not use Apple's cloud drive.  It's just crazy.  The iCloud photo libraries does not work photos, right?  It's not photos just and it's just been a nightmare for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you've lost you lose some photo album metadata from the  old it's probably running on MongoDB.  I mean you got it.  I mean Apple's never been great at the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Apple charges more really for storage than I think anybody  else does it's a buck for 20 gigs a month a buck a month  20 gigs Dropbox and carousel.  I do use it's pretty cool.  Flickr is now giving you a terabyte for free.  So why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My Flickr is just so abandoned though.  It's so sad.  There's no one on there anymore.  In my network anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So which is your favorite each of you?  Well, I do.  So here's my recommendation use a couple because there many  of them are very inexpensive.  I use Dropbox.  I use Flickr.  I use Google Plus and I use OneDrive.  You forgot where a photo is?  No, they all so every picture I take on my camera phone uploads  to OneDrive Google Plus.  I actually do not automatically upload a Flickr OneDrive Google  Plus and Facebook.  And that way I don't have to worry everything but they're  all private but they're all safe and because they offer basically  all offer free unlimited storage.  OneDrive is free unlimited storage if you have a office  subscription.  You know and Dropbox I have a huge amount of Dropbox.  So I don't know what this picture life is.  What do you do?  I use SmugMug too.  Love SmugMug.  Oh wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I only I turn on auto upload to Google to you know Google  photos.  So that's for storing and then to share it's Instagram.  That's where my friends are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of them that we just described have automatic uploading  on on iOS and Android.  So that's and the prices do vary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I worry about this a lot though because now that I'm taking  pictures of my kid and you know she's changing so much and  you know you want to save these.  Yeah, I'm gonna get a kick myself for losing her newborn  photos.  This is a great article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you Casey for doing this because this is the most  important one price comparison.  So you can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you but if you downloaded it to a physical drive,  Gina you you still have a compatibility.  I just got a question from an old friend of mine today from  the early days of Epicurious and she's trying to get stuff  off the old 20 year old zip drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh man.  That was a mistake.  I've accepted that it being uploaded to Google.  It has a better chance of lasting 20 years than then if I  have it on course of the external hard drive here.  Of course it does.  I've accepted that there was a long time and I was deluding  myself into thinking that I need to just keep stacks of  hard drives in my home.  No terrible.  Right.  It's a terrible way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How would you get stuff off an old zip drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to find somebody with a zip drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you need a zip drive or unfortunately zip drives

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the interfaces on zip drives are parallel, right?  Maybe they had some USB ones.  I don't know.  And I love zip drives.  Right.  You're going to go to a she's going to go to a data data  service.  There are yeah, there are services.  There are lots of them that keep all of this stuff so that  they can and it won't be cheap.  No, it won't be.  So if you put it on a proprietary medium, it's then  your duty to constantly check to make sure that everything  still works.  That's why the cloud is really the solution.  The cloud eliminates this issue.  So much so so apparently there are USB zip drives.  That's that's good news.  If it's still working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's could be worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should should to launch a photo storage service.  I feel like they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Oculus Rift will ship in early 2016 according to the  Guardian early next year.  That's Facebook bottom.  We had the developer edition because I did the Kickstarter  Chris has that right now.  You're still doing stuff with that Chris you developing  virtual reality game.  All anything with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I have just played with it a lot just play with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sick a lot and gotten sick a lot.  That's encouraging.  Just just by the every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll go put it on for 15 minutes or so and vomit and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  vomit.  Yes.  That's why I gave it to you.  That's exactly why I gave it to you.  Actually, this is this is not more than just an article in  the Guardian.  This is a tweet from Nate Mitchell extremely excited to  announce the Oculus Rift will be shipping q1 2016.  We can't wait to get it in your hands.  No price has been confirmed.  I like augmented reality, but a quite a bit of disappointment  over Microsoft's demonstration of the HoloLens.  It's a our visor slated for release later this year.  They showed it at build last week and Paul Theron Mary  Joe Foley used it and said it's different from the one  they showed in Seattle a few months ago.  The field of view is narrowed to just this little slit.  Oh, that's not good.  What do you think of this guys talk hashtag talk pay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So traditionally in business.  You're told that it's rude to talk amongst your fellow  employees about what you make.  But in fact, is it rude?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it about rudeness or is it all kind of fighting drama?  There's potential drama, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lots of potential drama.  Oh, yeah.  But it's also from an economic point of view, the smart  thing, the sensible thing to do because then you know,  you know, if you're getting underpaid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think this happened on I think was Friday  and I was actually I was at a conference.  I was at seven on seven on Friday and I was kind of  heads down with my doing my thing there.  So I missed it.  I missed the whole task tag, which I couldn't I couldn't  believe it.  I thought it was a fantastic idea.  I mean for in terms of equal pay, you know, it's really  important.  I mean being transparent about what people make it  helps people who are just getting into the industry.  It helps, you know, people figure out am I getting paid  fairly?  Did I screw up my negotiation?  I mean, this is you know, which a lot of people do.  I mean from an employer standpoint point of view, it's  scary, but I think it's it's one of these, you know,  public parts things where it's like the more transparent  we are about this is the better it is for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wear two hats on this because as an employer, it's  scary.  Well, it's not so truthfully.  It's not so much that I worry about people negotiating a  different amount.  I because I hate it when people say well this guy and  people sometimes do this guy makes more than me.  I should make more because we pay I pay each person what  I consider a fair amount given our needs their abilities  that kind of thing.  I'm not I'm never trying to negotiate somebody down because  just for the saving money.  We try to pay them a fair amount of money, but but it  often comes up, you know, and it is a source of strife.  People people, you know, will hate other people because  they're getting more money and they'll resentful and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're being valued more and you're closer to this person  or you know, yeah, you think more highly of them.  It gets very very personal.  It's very it's a very vulnerable.  So a lot of people in that talk pay hashtag saying like  I'm scared.  I can't do this.  I don't you know, I don't know what's doing it anonymously

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  would be good.  Yeah, you know having a maybe how does how does the talk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pay account work?  How do you get the no no, it's just a hashtag.  So it's your account.  There's also an account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a bot and I feel like it was maybe it accepted  DMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be good.  How that bot worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's anonymous or watch the hashtag and then retweeted  them.  I'm not sure but but the bot yeah, I thought the bot was  I mean, it was fascinating looking through the tweets and  did you learn anything different careers?  I mean, I think I mean, I yeah, I mean, there were definitely  salaries.  I thought I was surprised that seemed lower than I thought  there were salaries.  I thought were higher.  I mean, you know, they just it just runs the right, you  know, runs the continuum and it really so much has to do  with like time and place and situation and you know,  negotiation and confidence and you know, all the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you remember Gina what was company about two weeks ago  that announced that they wouldn't negotiate with employees  because it was it was a matter of gender inequality in  pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, right.  I mean, this is this is one of the things about gender the  wage gap between genders is that you know, men are or sort  of socialize, you know, this is the general theory of men  are socialized to be more more confident to negotiate more  aggressively and women negotiate less aggressive.  They're willing to just say hey great, you know, like I'll  take whatever you offer me.  Whereas you know, employers low-balling, right?  So I don't know.  I haven't heard this.  I know buffer which is a company that does like social  media stuff.  They they actually publish their entire company from CEO  all the way down of everybody's salary and their formula for  figuring out that salary.  And so they've been super transparent about about about  salaries.  So names and an amount people were using which I thought was  really interesting.  I know it was reddit.  Yeah, reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was so reddit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, all the more important given who the CEO of reddit or  who the CEO is still Ellen Pau.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's still interim CEO said no longer negotiate salary and  accrues new talent.  Yes and no.  I mean that probably so I'm a public employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So your income is public public is going to be in fact somebody  pointing out in the army.  It's public.  You know what pay grade you are, you know exactly what you get.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That seems great.  Yeah, but the problem is that there's a different issue now  we'll get in all kinds of trouble and I am a liberal on  the Hillary Clinton liberal before I say what I'm about to  say, please keep that in mind.  Say that please keep that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is a Hillary Clinton liberal because that doesn't  sound liberal at all to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, let's keep going Jeff.  Just keep going.  I'm not believe me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a liberal for the last somebody for the last eight  years tends to say I told you so but that's another question.  Yeah, no, he's gotten better.  He's gotten a lot better.  Where was it?  Oh, so I'm not a happy Union guy because the Union basically  puts the ceiling on what I could negotiate myself for my  own value.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it does that Jeff I should point out to provide an  equitable playing field for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been in I've been in horrible unions of my limited  career.  I mean the newspaper Guild was just always awful.  And so I'm not yes, they exist in some places for good value.  I don't question that I'll salute that flag, but I I rather  resent having to pay my dues and I don't get anything for  it and I'd rather be on my own.  But I can't.  That's what this is going to be flame in certain quarters as

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a public employee.  I mean state public state employee, you know, have it  going into a career or say in the military where everybody's  salary is transparent and you know that going in and there's  just an expectation.  It's just a matter of what level or what title that you get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just get an alert from the New York Times Hillary Clinton to  court donors for a super PAC.  Oh, no, look at that.  I love I love smartwatches.  That's nice.  Anyway, I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  Sorry, Judy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's okay.  But to be but to be in a job be in a private, you know job  where people aren't necessarily talking about their pay and  maybe being the only person on your team who reveals your  pay or being concerned that you're that you're overpaid or  underpaid, you know, like I saw one woman say I'm only going  to reveal my pay and talk pay if one of my male colleagues  does it first, you know, if we kind of do it together that  was interesting to see that dynamic.  See, I love the opportunity to negotiate what this what this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  structure does here is it takes away my opportunity to  negotiate and obviously I make a lot less money than I used  to make.  I do this because I have a mission now and I'm giving back  and that kind of stuff and it's and I get benefits and I get  other other benefits of plenty.  So it's you know, I knew what I was getting into.  Absolutely.  But I don't like not being able to negotiate my own value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fascinating.  Isn't it?  I mean, I mean, I brought this up knowing it was challenging.  Fascinating.  And this is but this is transparency in action.  You can't really keep a lid on information anymore because of  the internet.  Yeah, and you can't keep a lid on a pay-per-view boxing match  either apparently.  Oh, isn't this great?  You know, all right.  Well, okay.  So people apparently were using Periscope and Meerkat to stream  the $90 pay-per-view Mayweather Pacayo fight.  How do you pronounce his last name?  Pacayo?  Shows how little I know.  Paciao.  And I actually just because I wasn't going to pay 90 bucks  for it because I don't like to watch people hit each other  for 180 million dollars.  But I did just check to see and I could watch the fight on  a number of streams on both Meerkat and Periscope.  But really is that I mean if you is that taking money out  of Comcast pocket really or HBO's pocket or Time Warner?  No, because if you want to watch the fight with buddies,  you're not going to say oh come on let's let's all sit around  the phone and watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You go to a bar that's airing the fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You go to a bar that's stealing it.  No, or you pay 90 bucks and you invite friends over and they  throw money in a hat.  This isn't this is not taking money out of anybody's pocket.  I don't think and yet everybody's all...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'll say on a matter of principle they have to fight  it because any violation of their copyright blah blah blah blah.  That's BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean there's live blogs.  I mean there's so many ways to keep on top of...  This is another example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, I wouldn't want to give that guy money.  So I would have just watched the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't watch fights.  Yeah, I'm not being not a real man.  I don't watch fights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to the Wall Street Journal YouTube considered  building something like Meerkat or Periscope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is they damn well should have.  This is so interesting.  Kicking themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they didn't because they were tied up dealing with  lawsuits potential lawsuits.  YouTube was engaged in a legal battle with Viacom at the  time over the use of unauthorized copyrighted material.  I mean, this is the thing like YouTube really paved the  way for a lot of this and they were I mean, it's hard to  believe that Google didn't have the resources to build  something like this because they were fighting but this  is this is an interesting take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes more sense though that they were foreseeing a  day when Mayweather and Pacayano would be fighting and  that they would have then a massive piracy problem and  they and I think given that they were fighting with  Viacom, they thought we're not going to give one more  way to pirate stuff.  Because you can't do content idea on live streams, right?  Or well, I mean it's it's live and it's over.  Right.  So YouTube claimed it qualified for protection from  liability because it removed clips from its site per the  DMCA.  Right.  Periscope says it does the same thing, but that it's  meaningless because it's Periscope gives you 24 hours  to watch it later.  So I guess it's not meaningless.  Meerkat can't it doesn't so they just what are you going  to do if you're copyright holder against live streaming  video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was talking to so I brought this up with my my students  and one of them said he watches a whole bunch of  football matches from people who were in the stands.  I said, I said, is there ridiculous little tiny people  he said, but he said, but the commentary is great because  the guys talk.  He right.  You get your everybody's own show Al Michaels in the  stands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's which yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  What if twitch took, you know, we're we're we're  ABC Sports, right?  We're ESPN.  What they're playing real games.  The quality is awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With a ball.  Yeah.  Same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ustream which has the same issue in this same article  in the Wall Street Journal's Brad Hunstable their CEO  says we can delete pirated material within 10 seconds  of the broadcast beginning.  We have fingerprinting technology that'll do that.  Last month HBO sent takedown notices to Periscope after  users broadcast Game of Thrones.  And HBO says we want app developers to have tools in  place to prevent this.  It seems like that'd be a business opportunity for  somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's a business opportunity right there for  HBO and ESPN a company imagine if you could share a  broadcast that you do have the rights to with a friend  with your own commentary.  It becomes marketing.  This is this is the shared economy.  You set the rules people will do it within the rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need kind of some overarching thing because really  this stuff is going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just going to happen.  Yep.  Yep.  So you got to find business models that take advantage  of that's it.  This is this is goes back to the argument about putting  your content into Facebook.  It's going to become inevitable.  So how do you negotiate a mutually beneficial arrangement  for that?  And if you're if your users want to do this and they'll  market you and they'll add value to it.  If you're smart, you're going to find a way to make that  work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, like HBO now HBO breaking away from the cable  companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yeah, exactly.  Every every every pardon me for this man for himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you a cord cutter Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we have cable.  We just we just didn't pay for the extra but we did but  we got HBO now and I can't my my.  Better half enjoys live sports too much and doesn't want  to deal with the hassle of who's up to me.  I would be completely just dreaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you ever cut off Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, fortunately, I can afford to have the top cable  tier.  So there's never a lack of television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't watch much live.  I mean, I and I record some but you know what?  I'm now with all this traveling I'm doing.  I download the download and download out of my Nexus 7  on planes and that's how I'm watching the whole series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I that's what I'm addicted to.

Transcript:  friend of mine, Peter Travers, who's the movie critic  at Rolling Stone.  When I worked with him at People magazine many many  years ago and and VHS tapes had just emerged.  This is how old we are Gina.  Peter prided himself on having you know every movie ever  made he would constantly get new movies to cause and so  you know, well the poor guy I have been made to ask him  what's the use whatever happens wife hated it filled up  the entire base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really it's a hoarder mentality can't watch them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was at the time but he was a movie critic and he was  you know, he was a student of movies.  He always had it and he could go back and he wanted the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ability to just at any moment go to his life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes and go find the scene and know from it, which is fine.  But but become digital all that work to nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I had a friend who taped every VHS taped every  episode of Cheers because he didn't want to live life a  life in which he couldn't at any time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry you that was the best show ever made.  Yeah, really in its day in its day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a good show.  It was a great show.  So he loved it so much.  He had it but a closet full of Cheers tapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I have this is even worse.  It's like the zip drive thing earlier.  Thank you someone on Twitter for giving me an answer,  which I'm sent to my friend.  Oh good.

I don't you know, I mean the moon lighting my moon  lighting is the best one.  But but you know some interview on W XYZ.  I don't know why I still have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a huge deal.  Even being on TV now is a big deal.  It's less of a big deal now because it's like what's  TV but that's awesome.  My dad taped everything on TV because it was an amazing  thing in the VCR.  I was like right hold on to this thing and rewatch it.  Although I have to tell you the idea of a movie critic  rewinding and fast forwarding of VCR tapes to find a  scene.  I find hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me just go off and show you something in a second.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thing that bothers me and it really does bother me is  how much we should have access to everything now,  right?  But how much stuff is not online is not digital that you  can't get even if you for love or money.  It's not like it's not just not on Netflix.  It's not anywhere you can't buy it.  A huge amount of stuff.

You see those those things with the blue on here.  Yeah, those were the size of VHS.  So you could you know, watch Glory Glory or Passion of  Paradise and  sing and check it off and you could you could glue those  onto your VHS tape.  I have a tape here.  We'll put that in.  How's that for geeky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's great.  That's great.  I know I would have totally bought that just for those.  I would be like, yeah, yeah, that is really clever.  I want to stick these on my tapes.

Transcript:  And he gave you a tin cup because you're blind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, because it was to beg because he was to beg he mixed  the metaphor, but he was thankful because Bill Cosby was  so poor.  At least it sounds like you kind of had a sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was that was such an uncomfortable scene.  Oh, it was horrible.  Yeah.  I always I always found him a delightfully weird-looking  kid.  Like I was like always like this kid is great because  he's just so weird.  Yeah, I guess bad but also weird but he was fine as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My lawyer when I used to have one the honorable Harry Weintraub  Esquire used to always say on the bill telephonic communication.  Oh Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and those are expensive man.  They pick up the phone the bills the timer starts.  You got to have them.  I have them lots of them.  I have more than one lawyer.  Did you know that?  I have many lawyers and each of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, did we ever talk about is the is the I don't want to  jinx it podcast troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, the troll is dead instead.  It's dead.  Well, he had you know, they had kind of gone away.  Anyway, this is the company that had claimed that they patented  podcasting and went after the networks and Adam Corolla and  some other smaller podcasts sued them in East Texas.  That's of course a hotbed of podcasting.  And and Adam not, you know, Rose raised money online crowdfunded  some money to fight them.  He said I'm gonna fight them.  They tried to settle he said nope, we're going to court.  Finally.  They just said, all right, forget it.  They dropped it and the troll themselves said the reason we  dropped is we realized podcasters really don't make that much  money.  We were misinformed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But then as part of it and we were involved in this I could

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tell you now, you know, because it's I think it's over and Lisa  said you must not ever talk about this.  But you know, you don't when you have legal stuff going on,  you don't want to talk about it.  But in fact, our lawyers told us that they will the podcast  troll will record anything you say and use it against you in  court.  So you got to be very careful what you say.  So I just kind of clamped up but we hired a firm known for  defending pod troll patent patented podcasting.  Known for defending pod troll patent trolls against patent  trolls.  The principal of the firm who was great.  I loved her had knew that judge because there's one judge in  Tyler, Texas.  She knew that area.  She she persecuted prosecuted cases there had one cases there.  She was really great and San Francisco if anybody needs a  good attorney and a pod in a patent lawsuit.  This one is the best.  I can't remember a name off the top of my head.  But so this cost you money.  Oh lots of money.  So we had them come in and one of the things we talked about  is something called an interpartis action that you can  do with the patent trademark office.  If you think the trolls patent is invalid, you can actually go  to the patent and trademark office and contest it.  But our attorney at the time said it's a mixed bag.  If you win great.  The whole thing's gone.  If you lose you've really screwed yourself in strength  that you strengthen your opponent, right?  And because your because your opponent says look they even  filed a claim against it and the patent and trademark office  reasserted our our patent.  So we declined we decided not to do that.  It's the cheapest way to go.  But we decided I don't want to take that chance.  We felt pretty strongly that we would be able to go down to  Tyler, Texas.  I was going to have we had a whole strategy.  We were going to have a barbecue on the courtyard, you know,  the square the courthouse is on a square outside the square by  the way, the patent trolls offices are on the square as  well.  We were going to have a barbecue and invite all the West  Texas podcasters including including I said, okay, I  guarantee you there's churches in that town podcast.  So we're going to invite all the ministers from those churches  all the podcasters down.  We're going to invite the jurors to come have barbecue  with us so they could meet these people and understand that  it isn't in fact and this is why it works in Tyler, Texas in  these jurisdictions is they don't like big companies.  They don't like big business.  They don't like them taken from a little guy.  So the the patent troll positions himself as the little  guy who's being taken advantage by the big guy, you know, GM  is you know, I invented windshield wipers and GM's just  came in and steamrolled over my rights and they win.  That's why you win because the jury it's a jury trial and jury  says, you know, that's terrible.  We can't allow that.  So we want to make sure they understood that that's not the  case with podcasting.  We had a great strategy.  I was ready.  I was I was I was already and they never sued us.  They sent us a letter asking for three and a half million  dollars.  Which we just left.  He said, where'd you get that number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  But that's still a gulp letter when you get it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The funny thing is that these guys weren't the best patent  trolls ever because the trick in patent trolling is to ask  for something that's less than the cost of a court case.  Not more.  Right.  If you ask for three and a half million, I'm going to say,  you know, our attorney said it'll cost you in court.  If you yeah, our attorney said it'd be about a million and  a half dollars.  If you go with us all that we go all the way with this.  Some of that's still cheaper than three.  You're supposed to ask for half a million so that the business  person says well, I shouldn't be giving them this tip.  Business as well as she you know, I guess I have to make  even though we know this is not we can't take the chance that  we're going to have to go to court and pay damages plus the  amount of money they want.  So we'll just settle for a smaller amount.  That's how you're supposed to do it.  These guys were pretty inept.  Anyway, the thank goodness the Electronic Frontier Foundation  decided to pursue this inter partes disputation of the  patent with the trademark office.  We gave money.  They did a crowdfunding.  They raised a lot of money to do that.  I was I was I was you know nervous, but we helped them  with prior art.  We had done a lot of prior art research and we knew a lot of  people in early days of podcasting and so forth and their  patent claimed they invented podcasting in the mid 90s when  in fact, you know, there are people before then doing it.  So it wasn't called podcasting but you know their patent was  basically on how you can create an online playlist that people  could then use this program to go out and get the get the  playlist to get any updates to the playlist.  So we showed that many others had done that before then.  So anyway, so the US Patent Trademark Office just about a  month ago said, yep, that's a bad patent and over time.  Turned it now.  It's not dead.  In theory, they could go again, but I think that they probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they've learned that you have no money.  So yeah, right.  There's no money.  We're going to have million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you crazy?  I couldn't write a check for that if I wanted to what are you  nuts?  So yes, so we hadn't talked about that so much, but thank  you EFF for pursuing that doing a great man.  I'm blessing him.  Yeah, and if you ever need a good law firm in a patent case,  second, I'm probably could find this.  I should get I should give them a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I give them a little yeah.  Little love little love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go back through my emails and I'll find.  Find their names Lisa's probably going crazy right now.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shut up.  I talked to a lot of other podcasters.  They they went after a lot of people.  Personal audio was the name of the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing like a common enemy to bring together a community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I touched a lot of podcasters and we talk, you know,  we were all thinking what to do what to do.  But since we had the resources to hire an attorney we did just  in case and to kind of plan going forward.  I cannot find the.  This by this this goes back to a 2012.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, yeah.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Well up, you know what you can send me an email.  I'll find the information and send you her name if you need  if you need them.  But I did I had nothing to do with killing the trolls.  The trolls were killed.  Thank you very much by Adam Carolla who continued to fight  the fight and by the EFF who did a great job and and and did  the right thing as it turned out.  We didn't have the nerve to do it pursuing an inter-parte  states judgment.  I gosh I hope it's okay to talk about that.  I hate to do that.  You asked.  You know me I'll talk about anything but I didn't mean to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  actually like about you.

Transcript:  We do this show.  It's the last show of the week and I'm always punchy when I do this show,  which makes it a little bit looser.  What's going on there?  Is there a gradual fade?  Kind of fits...  It does.  It could be...  That wasn't intentional.  I'm going to see...  I'm going to have Lisa feed this into the L'Oreal makeup creator and see what happens.  We do this show.  Wednesday afternoons, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time, 2000 UTC.  I want you to watch live because probably all the good stuff will be edited out.  But if not, you can get the on-demand audio and video after the fact and that's always available at  www.twit.tv slash twig or wherever you get your shows.  Do subscribe.  You know, I was looking at the stats and for a long time,  you know, like the first eight, nine years of the Twitter network,  90% of the shows were downloaded on iTunes.  It was just by default.  That's gone way down.  It's like 30% now and the podcast clients on various platforms have just taken over.  So that's subscribing your podcast client or use one of the great Twitter apps.  They're wonderful.  And we've got some exciting news coming on our Twitter apps.  I guess it's time for TN2, so I better wrap this thing up.  Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next time on Twig.
