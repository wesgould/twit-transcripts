Transcript:  This is Twig, this week in Google.  It's time for Twig and a very special episode as we close out on 2015.  Jason Howell, our editors, and you have put together your favorite memories of the year.  So what this is about, what you're about to see is a clip festival, the highlights, and there have been some great ones of this week in Google.  Happy New Year everybody. We'll be back with a brand new show next week.  I'm Leo Laporte. Thanks for being here. Up next, the best of Twig.  Thank you for coming out for our New Year's Eve party.  Still beardless, which he did for $20,000.  I am still hairless, which I did for $40,000.  We raised $75,000 for UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund. Isn't that great?  Amazing.  Nice job. That's Gina Tripani from thinkup.com.  Hello.  And all about Android. And I have some very sad news.  This is her last Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, my last weekly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We said come back whenever you want, but I know that the business at ThinkUp has gotten busy, busy, busy, and you just don't have time to do.  She's also leaving all about Android. In fact, you don't have any podcasts, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, I won't be doing any podcasts the first time in like six years.  Yeah, this is just this is just so sad and bittersweet.  But, you know, I started building this company, ThinkUp, and I think we have a shot at making something that is sustainable.  But it's been it was like a weird kind of year. 2014 was hard.  You know, we raised some venture capital and then we figured out that we're a business, but we're not a venture capital business, meaning that, you know, we're not the hockey stick geyser, you know, 10 times, whatever.  We're just a regular business kind of building revenue very slowly.  So we decided, hey, you know, we're not going to do VC.  We had to lay off a bunch of our team, which is really tough.  I'm sorry. Yeah, no, no, it's OK.  I mean, my team was fantastic and everyone was extremely understanding and totally got it.  Everyone landed on their feet and it was a small team to begin with.  But, yeah, it was tough. It was definitely painful.  But, you know, we, Anil, my co-founder and I, you know, really want to give this a go and we want to work on it full time, the two of us together.  And that's what we plan to do in 2015.  And so it's going to be a full time job and a half.  And I've just been trying to be real honest with him and with my family and try to figure out.  You have a new baby and I mean, you just moved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so there's a lot on your plate. I completely understand.  And I'm still I'm still bereft. I'm still very Jeff and I had the same reaction the chat room is having right now because they're hearing it for the first time.  I said in capital letters, this is horrible. Jeff, what did you write? It was great.  I got in fact, I got to read Jeff's tribute to Gina because it was it was you said it.  Of course, you're the wordsmith. You said it better than either.  At least I could do you just just quite moving.  Let me write. Let me read it to you.  I am so depressed about this, Gina. Oh, wait, this is our email.  If there's anything that would make the show possible, I'd be so happy to keep working with you.  And we have worked out something. So stay tuned.  Gina's genius is bringing both a technologist perspective and a profoundly ethical view of technology.  And she's the nicest person I know. These are going to be impossible shoes to fill.  And it's we all agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of shoes, I then I then try to push Gina, Gina, for very creative.  I tried to push that we could do this like a shark tank where Barbara and Lori shift off.  It could be the part time. Your response, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I said I only wish that I could wear heels the way that Lori and Barbara wear heels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That email thread was quite fun, I must admit.  And Jeff really said it eloquently for Lisa and me both.  We just there's no way we can replace you.  You have agreed, I'm happy to say, to come back once a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, I yes. And I thank you for letting me do that, because I tell you, the idea of quitting completely cold turkey really freaked me out.  This is such a hard decision. I mean, we've been through a lot together.  It's been six years, 400 hours once a week. I mean, I've lived in four different apartments.  I've done this show from two different offices, from my mother's basement.  I mean, yeah, I had a child. I mean, yeah, a lot has happened.  We've been together for a long time and I really wrestled with it.  And it's just a matter of kind of hours in the day.  And part of it is that I'm primarily a developer.  You guys are embedded in news, right?  It's easy for us. It's all we think about all week long.  Yeah, yeah, but there have been times and I'm sure that our listeners have heard it.  There are times when I show up and I'm like, I haven't heard the story. I just haven't.  I haven't been reading the news. So it's a little bit more prep time for me.  And it takes my head out of I get into that coder, the coder flow thing.  And so and I'm just going to have more on my plate this year.  So it was such a hard decision, but I've so enjoyed my time on the show.  And I am going to be back once a month. Thank you.  And if I can harass Jason and Ron into having me on.  I don't think that'll be hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Harass? Are you killing me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I will. Hopefully I can come out anytime.  Let me ask you, let's be honest with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you had won the app arena, would you have stayed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this what we needed to do to keep you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that because I can fix it?  Windows 8 one vulnerability.  Microsoft knows about it.  In fact, they've known about it for three months because Google told them.  Microsoft waited. Google announced it.  They said after 90 days, it's fair game.  Microsoft, I'm sure, would have preferred that Google said nothing.  But Google's point, and I think it's well taken, is, you know, if there's a security hole,  it's reasonable for us to give the company a time to patch.  But it's also a public's right to know if this hole exists because the company could otherwise just ignore it.  And attackers could find it.  Now, don't worry so much because Microsoft points out that a bad guy would have to have valid login credentials  and be able to log on locally to a targeted machine.  It's not something that could easily be done over the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have weird mixed feelings about this.  It feels like, I mean, on one hand, I totally understand that Google notified Microsoft about this vulnerability,  gave them 90 days, and once the 90 days were up, even though Microsoft didn't issue the patch,  announced the bug, published code on how to explain the bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They showed you how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I sort of get it.  But I also wonder a little bit, like, somebody from Google couldn't pick up the phone,  didn't call somebody from Microsoft five days before, and they're like, hey, no, really?  We're going to put, I mean, well, they may have.  It felt like a little bit of a public shaming slap in the wrist PR thing going on here at the, at the, you know,  at the risk of, you know, opening up users to a vulnerability.  Like, I really can see both sides of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd love to get your opinions on this.  We talked about David Cameron's speech on the Security Now yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, man, I'll bet you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a trainwreck.  And I think Cory Doctorow had a good take down on on Boing Boing.  But so Cameron, the prime minister of Great Britain, says that it should be illegal to make a communications product that the law  and that the home secretary can't listen in on.  And he said, it's OK.  You're protected because the home secretary would have to sign a warrant for us to listen in on.  And now I have to say, I I think it's one thing for David Cameron to say that it's another thing for it to actually happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what it reveals in the attitude is the Greenwald's argument.  What it reveals is just a terrible view of our rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And Cory argues it's also ignorance.  Yes, says David Cameron says there should be no means of communication, which we cannot read.  And no doubt many in his party will agree with him politically.  But if they understood the technology, they'd be shocked to their boots.  Cory is always eloquent in this stuff.  So he says Cameron doesn't know what he's asking for, because in order to make this work, you know, you can ban WhatsApp.  You can ban iMessage or Apple's messages, both of which provide encrypted message passing that the government can't read.  But first of all, you sure you want to ban iOS from Great Britain?  OK, but then you can't ban Linux.  Who do you who do you ban if you're you know, who do you stop for Linux or BSD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It makes no sense. It makes no sense.  And it's it's like saying no one is allowed to have door locks just in case we need to come in your house.  Right. Right. Right.  But it'll be only only for your own protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, but there is an analog there.  You know, if you have a gate here in this area, a lot of people in the farm areas have a gate before you can get in and they have a special key that the fire department.  It's a it's a special key. The fire department can open because if your house is burning down, you don't want the fire trucks to have to stop at the gate.  Or drive them down. So there's an analog for that.  The TSA TSA approved locks keep bad guys out, but the TSA has a way of opening them.  So there's a precedent.  Corey points out, first of all, if you put a back door in any kind of software that not just not only makes it easy for law enforcement, but criminals, voyeurs and foreign spies.  So you've made all communications insecure.  Any firms. This is this is what Cameron's proposing when Corey breaks it down.  Any firms within reach of the UK government must be banned from producing secure software that includes Microsoft and Apple.  All major code repositories, GitHub and SourceForge, for example, have to be blocked because that's where you get the open source for programs like TechSecure and others.  True Crypt.  So you got to prevent that. Search engines must not answer queries about web pages that carry secure software.  I raised this point yesterday with Steve.  It also means that you have to have a back door in secure HTTP, HTTPS, SSL.  That's not an easy thing to do since that's essentially open.  Virtually all academic security work in the UK must cease.  Security research must only take place in proprietary research environments where there is no onus to publish one's findings such as industry R&D and security services.  All packets in and out of the country and within the country must be subject to Chinese style deep packet inspection.  We're just talking about that. I'm sure Sandvine has a tool and any packets that appear to originate from secure software must be dropped.  Existing walled gardens like iOS and Xboxes must be ordered to ban security software.  Anyone visiting the country from abroad must have their smartphones held at the border until they leave.  That's the fun one.  Proprietary operating system vendors like Microsoft and Apple must be ordered to redesign their operating systems as walled gardens that only allow users to run software from an app store which will not sell or give secure software to Britons.  Free and open source operating systems that power the energy, banking, e-commerce and infrastructure sectors must be banned outright.  So that's why Steve was upset and a lot of people are upset about this. I think it's pretty clear it's unenforceable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And even if it was enforceable, it wouldn't achieve what it's supposedly going to achieve or wants to achieve.  You criminalize security software, only criminals will have secure software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what it indicates is a belief that there is a manifest destiny and a right for government to be able to listen to anything we say.  And that's the real issue. That's what this reveals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. It's telling into their state of mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, and unfortunately in Britain at least and in lots of other European countries, it's taken for granted that the government has those rights.  I think the US is abnormal in a way in the sense that people won't put up with that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the sad thing is that he's blaming the attacks on Charlie. He's saying, well, after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in France, we've got to do this.  Which makes no sense at all.  But that's what happened in the US. As soon as 9-11 happened, we had the Patriot Act. That's the kind of knee-jerk reaction.  Here's Prime Minister Cameron speaking. Oh, after an ad. How come there's an ad before? The Prime Minister speaks.  Apparently people who are having erectile dysfunction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's actually the Prime Minister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. No, it's a Charles Schwab ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The first duty of any government is to keep our country and our people safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much has been used? Is that the first duty of any government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's to protect our freedom indeed. But how much tyranny has been wrought under that justification?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And as Corey points out, it would not keep us safe. It would open all communications to bad guys, spies, and Corey points out, voyeurs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Paris once again demonstrated the scale of the terrorist threat that we face and the need to have robust powers through our intelligence and security agencies and policing in order to keep our people safe.  And the powers that I believe we need, whether on communications data or on the content of communications, I'm very comfortable that those are absolutely right for a modern liberal democracy.  But what I've done is we legislated very recently on communications data.  It's totally the opposite of what should be allowed in a liberal democracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's pointing out in the chat room, and this is true also, that Cameron's faced with, I don't know how significant, but somewhat of a challenge from the right-wing UKIP.  The UKIP, yeah.  And that this may be merely a political statement that he knows has no chance of passing through Parliament.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think he is trying to saber-rattle and look tough.  He's not known for being tough, and this is a great opportunity.  Oh, look at all the terrorists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But look at the justifications we have.  In France, there's been, since the Charlie Hebdo murders, there have been, I think, 54 examples of people being arrested for supporting terrorism.  Now, after a loud and clear support of free speech, then what turns around?  We turn around and we abuse free speech.  In the American view, you support even obnoxious speech to support speech.  The other problem was all the great reports to Guardian and elsewhere of all of the heads of state who marched alongside Hollande who do terrible things to free speech.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was really ironic to watch that parade of dictators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  France themselves just finished arresting someone for something they said.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  54 cases of that.  They arrested a comedian, a well-known but radical comedian in France, because he posted on Facebook something that they didn't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right after saying, we have to uphold free speech.  There's no free speech if you don't say what we agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's really a case I don't want to go off the reservation here.  But that's one of the shocks to me in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo case is that when I talk about free speech, what I get back often is, oh, you're American.  You have a different view.  And I wrote about this, that free speech is weirdly, oddly American.  And no, it's not peculiarly American.  It is a human right.  And unless we see it that way.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But the protection of it and the explicit protection of it is unusual to the U.S.  In many countries, other things take precedent.  Security.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think there's a lack of understanding of what free speech means.  And that really struck me after this case.  And by the way, I also took to task American journalists and newspapers for not publishing the cartoons.  I understand.  Be clear here.  I understand why the Jewish Chronicle didn't publish them.  Yes.  But Margaret Sullivan, the public editor of the New York Times, first time she attacked the issue, she kind of danced around.  But today she came straight out and said the New York Times was wrong not to run the current new cover of Charlie Hebdo.  And that it's not offensive by any standard of civility and it should be there.  And even our American newspapers don't really understand, I think, to some extent, that free speech is not just a right for journalism, it's responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, and this comes up whenever I write about free speech, especially when I'm talking about proprietary platforms like Twitter and Facebook, you know, that are effectively corporate owned kind of town squares.  Someone will say, well, free speech only applies to government.  Like the First Amendment is only designed to apply to government.  And so free speech is just a fiction unless it applies to how government treats citizens, which doesn't make any sense to me at all.  I mean, the whole point, the whole reason why there's a First Amendment is that it's a principle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Matthew, I'll argue that case.  No, the reason that is that part of your free speech is as an editor, part of Leo.  Leo has free speech.  Leo can say, Jarvis, I just don't like you.  I've had it with you.  I'm fed up with you and your damn Chromebook.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Get off my air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And he has a perfect right to do that.  That is part of his.  I'm not the government.  But the government can't tell me to stop extolling the virtues of Chromebooks.  It's not the government's rule.  Right.  But a private company has a full and complete right to decide what speech it chooses to distribute.  And that's not censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Sure, it does.  And my only point when I wrote about Facebook was Mark Zuckerberg made a point of standing up in favor of free speech and against censorship and said he stood behind all of those principles,  despite the fact that Facebook routinely censors things for no reason or for reasons it doesn't discuss.  I'm not saying they don't have the right to do that.  I'm just saying you can't have it both ways.  You can't say that you're.  Well, no, I think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you can.  You set your standards because otherwise what we'd have and this is why we have Section 230 in the US is that if it were a binary switch, we would have no forums and no discussion in the US because if you were held responsible,  as for example, Europeans are for the things that occur on your site or the things that you link to, then you would have no discussion.  So Section 230 protects us from making our own judgments so that we can make our own judgments.  We can let things go up that we disapprove of.  We can take things down.  That's our freedom.  No, I have to disagree with you there.  I think that they're private.  But Section 230 protects them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  If Section 230 protects them, then why are they take?  Why do they take so much stuff down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because well, for another way, forget the Facebook.  Let's say that the comments on my blog, I take down things there that are offensive and stupid and off target and abusive.  And that is not only my right, but I believe my responsibility to have a good community there.  If you believe that all speech is equal, all speech must be allowed.  It's allowed by government.  But that doesn't mean that I should be forced to be the host for it.  It's not inconsistent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not inconsistent for you to support censorship on Facebook and be against government censorship.  That's not my point.  That's not censorship, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or what else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could call it censorship.  It is censorship.  Let's say it's censorship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Censorship is when no, censorship is when government censors you from speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm willing to broaden.  I'm willing to agree with Matthew to broaden it and say censorship is censorship.  And it's just cutting something off your site for whatever reason is a form of censorship.  But it's still not inconsistent to say I have the right to do that as a private business.  But what I would and we should all fight against is the government doing that.  Yes.  That's not inconsistent.  So it's not inconsistent for Mark Zuckerberg to say, yeah, of course, we have to control the environment on Facebook.  But I don't want the government arresting somebody because they say something that the government disagrees with.  That's not inconsistent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But the fact is that Facebook and Twitter are used by governments to censor.  They are actively censoring people on behalf of the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They also say, Matthew, in that case, they also say, they always say that they must follow local laws.  Now Twitter does it more cleverly.  Twitter does it more cleverly.  It will cut out something in France and leave it in the rest of the world if the French government demands it to be taken down.  Not just that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They actually fight requests in court on behalf of their users.  They fight.  And in some cases, they have put content back that they took away because the government of whatever country didn't didn't make a good enough case.  Facebook.  So you're talking about all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One is when they are when they're an agent of government, when agent when government says you must take this down under law and they do that because they follow the law.  If they don't like it, they may fight it, but they lose and they take it down.  That's one thing.  It's another thing when they choose to take something down on their own.  Now Twitter was indeed a very, very open platform.  But Twitter hit the wall with two things recently.  We talked about this on the show a while ago.  One was the beheading videos and two was the naked celebrity photos that have been stolen.  And Twitter decided basically for the first time really to say, OK, that's going too far.  We are making an editorial judgment to take that down on our own without request.  That's their right to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But look, Google does not take down videos that criticize Turkey from YouTube because there's a law in Turkey against criticizing.  Well, no, they don't.  Because they get blocked from Turkey because they make a choice to leave that content up because YouTube is is blocked in Turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they've chosen to go with that way.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right. So I'm saying at some point, a company has to decide whether they are just going to roll over for every government request or whether there are things they are not going to do when asked by government.  Exactly. Right. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We agree there. Yes. And so Google thus got out of China. Right.  But are you suggesting that every company should pull out of every country where the government demands they do something they can't do?  Yeah.  That's that's well, OK, that's the doctrine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you have to punish these countries for having that kind of reactionary point of view.  And if these companies did, the countries would soon turn around, I think.  Yeah. Well, given the right to be forgotten, then Google should pull out of Europe.  I agree. Look, Google did it in Spain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  YouTube a number of times, even though so they'll punish them and block them.  And then they put them back on again.  I just think if Facebook has principles, which it sounds like they do, then they should stick to them instead of bending over for every government that asked them to take something down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with your view. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they fight. But it's not as simple as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you why it's not. They're publicly held.  They're publicly held companies and they have a fiduciary right to their stakeholders to maximize profits.  And it's hard in that environment to take a principled stand, I think.  If it's a privately held company, they should do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But it's I will. I don't want to go down a rat hole here.  But someone recently pointed out to me that companies do not actually have a legal fiduciary duty to maximize profit.  They don't know there is not a legal duty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they but they but the shareholders could punish them.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But they don't have a legal.  Yes, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, any company, public or not, has the right to lose money and do it, run a crappy business.  I'd also like to always protected from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg controls the majority of the votes.  True. Voting shares in Facebook and so he faced no risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He can do whatever he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He faced no risk.  What are you saying Zuckerberg should do?  Be specific. Should Facebook pull out of 20 countries?  Should they pull out of every country that doesn't have a First Amendment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I would like to see Facebook put up a bit more of a fight.  That's what I would like to see.  You think Twitter is a good model for this?  Twitter puts up a fight.  Twitter is a better model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I don't think I think you're presuming that Facebook doesn't fight.  Facebook also has a transparency report.  Google has transparency report.  They all fight.  Twitter does more and more cleverly.  But Twitter does other things that are odd.  But I think Twitter is not well-agreeable with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some of the fighting from some of the companies looks like window dressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Facebook does not say in its transparency report, I don't think,  specifically what the complaint is or what content it involves.  They can't. They're not allowed to.  They can't.  Look, Google doesn't either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is only allowed to say that they get between one and 900 requests from government.  And that was after fighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Twitter will tell you what the order was, what it related to and where it came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not in a lot of cases they cannot, Matthew.  They'd be jailed. They can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  They can't in cases where the US government has asked them for data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. If it's a national security letter, they have to shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But if the Turkish government files a court order saying take down that thing  because it makes fun of Kamel had a Turk, they can certainly say that.  And they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, Amir Afrade, who works with the information, has such great contacts at Google.  He's often breaking scoops.  Google plans to shake up the US wireless market, he writes, by selling voice plans to consumers directly from Google through T-Mobile and Sprint.  So I guess to become an MVNO.  Yep. Yep.  It's the latest example of how Google tries to prod incumbents to change their business to benefit Google.  That's what they do with Google Fiber, show you that it's possible to have a gigabit ISP and make money on it.  Google's expected to reach deals to buy wholesale access to the carrier's mobile voice and data networks.  It's code named Nova.  Nick Fox is leading in a long time Google executive.  And Amir says a launch this year seems likely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It makes sense in a lot of ways.  I mean, I'm kind of surprised they haven't tried it before now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Disney is an MVNO.  I mean, Virgin.  I mean, there's so many MVNOs.  It's an easy thing to do.  One of our advertisers, Ting, is a Sprint MVNO.  It's an easy thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a timing issue here because they couldn't at the point when they were trying to launch Android across all carriers, they couldn't do this.  Now where the carriers aren't going to drop Android, they can do this.  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting that Sprint and T-Mobile are...  These carriers already, right?  Explain to me why Sprint and T-Mobile are willing to have these third parties lease wholesale data and sell below their retail prices, offer better plans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I think both of them are struggling.  I guess they need to, huh?  But it feels like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there's a fixed cost and a variable cost.  So the fixed cost is maintaining the network and growing it, and they want to keep doing that.  And then there's a variable cost, which is running all the stores and signing people up and recruiting them and so on.  And so if they can offload some of that variable cost stuff to somebody else, they're happy to do that because it helps them with the fixed cost.  That's basically how MVNO stuff works.  The other thing is that the reason it's those two is that they're the GSM ones.  So they're the ones that it's actually straightforward to interoperate with as opposed to Verizon, which is weird as anything, and AT&T, which is not quite as weird, but still slightly odd.  Whereas GSM is like the global standard.  The reason you can pull SIMs out of phones and put different ones in and have them work broadly is that they use GSM.  And yeah, there are different bands and you have to have different radio frequencies.  It's actually slightly more complicated than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sprint's not, though. Sprint's a CDMA carrier.  So they would have one GSM and one CDMA carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, so it's been Sprint.  Okay, then I like it.  That's what's interesting about this is it's both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  And I think that's probably why it is both, because I think they want to be able to say whatever kind of phone you have, you can bring it over.  That makes some sense.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The risk, I mean, as Amir mentions, Sprint and T-Mobile, their networks are not as robust.  They don't have as good coverage.  Yeah, they also ran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they're willing to do it.  Exactly.  The reason that Google has held back on this, Amir writes, is because they didn't want to upset wireless carriers.  They needed them to carry Android phones.  Now it's not such a big deal because what's...  I just said that.  You just said that?  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I just said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the other...  But okay, then I'll add the...  Did you say this?  The other reason is antitrust.  Okay.  I think if Google were to come along and say, why don't we just buy T-Mobile?  They could do that.  But the likelihood of government approval, I don't know, might be unknown.  So this is a great way to do it.  And as you point out, cleverly, in advance of my insight, that now they don't have to worry about pissing off the other guy.  You just said it so eloquently, I didn't understand you.  They didn't want to piss off the other guys.  You know, I think I'd be tempted.  It wouldn't even have to be less expensive if I thought Google was going to deal with me more fairly and have better customer service.  But Google's not exactly known for customer service, are they?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  But well, it's a trade-off, right?  So I had a problem with...  I used T-Mobile because I think their deals are pretty good and their service is good.  But I had a problem last week where my phone stopped working on Wednesday, just as I was getting on the train to San Francisco.  And so when I got to San Francisco on Wi-Fi, I was like tweeting them saying,  Oi, my phone stopped working.  What's up with this?  They're like, oh, try turning it off and on again.  It's like, yes.  Yeah, what else?  I've also tried taking this thing out and putting it back in again.  It is not a physical floor.  It's a network floor.  And then, you know, after doing that with the customer service guy, I said, OK, yeah, you're right.  I'm going to have to transfer this to engineering.  They'll get back to you within 72 hours.  And it's like...  And, you know, I wasn't actually going to San Francisco for the rest of the week.  So I let it sit for 72 hours.  But that got me to Saturday.  And Saturday was like, they still haven't fixed this.  And they haven't responded to me any further with updates.  So I went to the shop and said, OK, give me a new SIM now, please.  And that straightforward, they gave me a new SIM.  And then it worked.  So clearly it was not necessarily the SIM, but the network's knowledge of the SIM.  But it's like, you should have told me to go to the shop.  You have retail shops for this exact purpose.  Why did you tell me to wait 72 hours for engineering to look at it?  So it's one of those like...  But the thing is, Google doesn't have retail shops.  So if that happened to me with Google, they would have to mail me one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Erica G. in our chat room says she has Google Fiber and the service is excellent on Google Fiber.  So Google has figured out, in a consumer-facing business, at least, how to do it right.  Presumably that would apply to an MVNO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And I wonder whether, you know, would Google, would they be prepared to help Sprint and T-Mobile with their networks?  I mean, if they, Google has lots of people who understand networks, lots of people who have got tons of fiber,  you know, maybe they can actually help improve those services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Intriguing.  And then buy them.  Well, I think that's got to be the ultimate goal is how can we just buy them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The head of Deutsche Telekom was flying a kite about selling T-Mobile this week.  Oh, wasn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been trying to sell that for ages.  Remember SoftBank was going to, or was that Sprint?  Wasn't SoftBank going to buy them?  And then there was Sprint, T-Mobile, Merger.  But historically, the US government has not looked too kindly on these things.  They don't care if Comcast, Time Warner, Merge, that's fine.  Apparently, the telco lobbyists are not as effective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Google buying T-Mobile would be less of an issue because it wouldn't reduce...  They're not in the same business. Yeah, they're not in the same business.  I mean, it would create vertical integration, which is not a kind of problem, but that's...  They're less worried about these days, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd be all for it.  According to GreenBot, Cyanogen wants to take Android away from Google.  We'd do a better job.  Let us maintain Android.  Kirk McMaster wants to build Cyanogen.  So the history of Cyanogen is kind of interesting.  It was originally a custom ROM that people would root their Android phones and put Cyanogen on there.  And it was basically an AOSP version of Android that you would then, I don't know,  quasi-legally download all the Google apps and make it a Google phone.  Sorry, Google, I wasn't talking to you.  Oh, do you need something? I'm here.  Google, did you say Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's up, boss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Don't get it wrong. Leo, we're all right.  Do you want me to look up something about Cyanogen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can do that, you know. I'm right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's go for a walk, okay?  McMaster...  And I think putting it on OnePlus One gave it some real credibility  because now it is the official operating system on at least one high-end Android phone.  And frankly, those of us who used it, Gina was always very complimentary.  I know you were, too. Really liked it.  So Kirk McMaster is saying he hopes to build CM into a full-fledged Android rival.  He wants its own app store, a more open structure.  Makes no sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No sense.  You're going to fight against another app store?  Developers have to build for another app store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true, but I do agree with him when he says  that Android is really becoming a commercial product favoring Google services.  And while there is AOSP, nobody wants...  AOSP is the open source Android minus Google stuff.  And no sane phone manufacturer is going to do that.  Amazon is the best example of somebody who took AOSP and forked it and did without Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The whole reason I use Android is because it is integrated with Google+,  with Gmail and Google Maps and so on.  That's exactly the selling point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  For you, but if you were in a developing country where you just wanted a cheap phone  that worked pretty much as the way the iPhone does but didn't come with that price tag,  then you might not care that it had to work with Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cops don't like Waze.  They say this could be dangerous that Waze tells you there's a police officer on the road.  Big bad Google again.  They call it a stalking feature.  Which is ridiculous.  I doubt cop killers use Waze, but maybe...  Anyway, they're campaigning to pressure Google to turn off,  because Google owns Waze now.  The feature that warns drivers and police are nearby.  It could put lives in danger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basic lesson is you can't control information anymore, guys.  We'll find some way to know where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That information gets there because other Waze users spotted a police officer.  Usually the reason for it is because it's a speed trap or they just want to let you know  you should drive more carefully because there are police officers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or it's also an indication that there's been an accident or something.  Well, you have a button for accident, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do, yes.  My experience is this is more like, hey, slow down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Google's answer was the more people think there are cops all over,  the slower they're going to drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually better.  Yeah.  Julie Mosler speaking for Waze says Waze does work with the New York Police Department  and others around the world by sharing information.  These relationships keep citizens safe, promote faster emergency response,  and help alleviate traffic congestion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I mean, it's hard because whenever they do a DUI checkpoint,  they're required by law to tell you they're going to be there.  Oh, really?  They have to announce there's a DUI checkpoint.  They have to pre-announce where they're going to be.  Wow.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Why is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Because people have a right not to, I guess, get into a search area.  Get jumped.  Well, I don't know why it is, and maybe it's just the California law,  but they have to announce them in advance.  Also, when you come up to a checkpoint,  you have to have the ability to turn away from that checkpoint  if you don't want to go through it.  Really?  You're kidding.  Yeah.  I think I did a story on checkpoints once.  Not in my neck of the woods.  Out here, they block all the turns.  And then they're probably violating the law.  And if you actually got a ticket, well, first of all, if you got a ticket,  I'd probably hope that you did, but sorry.  But no, you're supposed to be able to turn off.  Interesting.  That's part of the way the law works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not the first time four U.S. senators in 2011  asked Apple to remove all applications  that alert users to drunk driving checkpoints.  Nokia removed the sobriety check tracking function in one of their apps.  Trapster was eventually discontinued at the end of the year,  but the founder says it was because Waze did so much of a better job.  I understand police would be nervous about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You can totally understand it, especially what happened in New York.  My first initial reaction when I saw that was like, wow, yeah, that is scary.  And then if you think a bit more, it's like it is not difficult for you  to figure out where police are without having to...  If you're going to go out trying to find a police officer,  you probably don't need to rely on Waze to figure out how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The truth is people don't just have guys who are on patrol in there.  The truth is they're putting up speed traps.  And, God help me again, Google has a point that you end up slowing down.  The cops don't get to zap as many people,  but if people are actually going slower, it's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, when we get the auto driving cars, it won't matter,  because then we'll be speeding and it'll all be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they'll report on all your movements,  and then we'll have a privacy crisis and that'll be the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has added a virtual genius bar.  Have you seen this?  I think genius bar is trademarked, surely.  They're actually using help outs.  It's called Google Device Experts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of like May Day from Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So employees involved with the service told TechCrunch  it's been in testing since November.  Google spokesperson said,  we're in a limited trial of an experimental support feature gathering feedback  not yet ready to share full plans.  Is this the thing we called that day on the show?  No, it's different.  This is in the Devices section of Google Play.  So you're on the web, you're in Google Play in the Devices section.  Click the Help icon in the top right corner,  and then under Contact Us there will appear a Video Call button,  and that will give you a Google Hangouts with a Google Expert who can help you.  So we can't call anybody now?  Well, I can try it.  They say you can share your screen, so this is very much like May Day, isn't it?  So let's go to play.google.com and see what we can do.  I don't think it's rolled out yet.  I think it's just something they've spotted.  So there's Devices.  Here's Help.  Is it Video Call?  Video Call.  Yep.  How can we help you?  What do I need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I use Skype on Chrome OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Start a Video Call.  Wow.  Sorry.  This is going to be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm trying to troll them, but you know, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the first one here.  Ready to join?  Now I think, would you like to share your screen?  We have to kind of tell, don't show this.  We have to tell them we're doing this before we actually do it somehow.  Share my screen.  Google Hangouts is sharing your screen with plus.google.com.  Your screen sharing.  Present to everyone.  They hear my audio, but no one is coming in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They're getting something out of the microwave.  Oh, hey.  How you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm on a podcast called This Week in Google.  My name is Leo.  And I'm wondering if I can show people, because we're showing people this new feature,  if I could show people your screen and we can record your voice.  But Doug, before I can show this, I need your permission to record it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Go for it, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go for it, Leo.  All right.  Thank you, Doug.  So everybody's going to see you now.  Yes, and I have nothing confidential on my screen, so go ahead and look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, thank you for sharing your screen.  But yeah, I saw that you had a question about using Skype on Chrome OS.  Yeah, can I?  So currently, Skype is currently not supported on Chrome OS.  There are, however, great alternatives for video chatting on Chrome, on Chromebooks as well,  as well as communication apps that are available on the Chrome Web Store, including Hangouts.  Are you familiar with Hangouts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am.  We love Hangouts.  In fact, we're using – this is Helpouts, isn't it?  Isn't that what we're using right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We're actually – we're on a Hangout right now.  I know Hangouts is kind of similar to Hangouts, but we're actually just straight up on Hangouts.  This is just plain old Hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doug, are you a Google employee or are you a third party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I work at Google.  We're here in beautiful Mountain View.  You're in Mountain View?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love your set.  That looks so cool with the Android stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, we are very Google-y here at Google.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many of – do you know how many of you are there doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I know we have a – we do have a small team.  I wouldn't be able to put a number to it, though.  I'm really bad at math and counting.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there are other people and you're all kind of near each other doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, kind of.  I'm not too sure how big the team is, but I do have my own team here and we are all kind of our team of device experts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, did you – were you a Google employee before this or were you hired specifically to do this kind of support?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, actually, because you are kind of our press.  We do kind of –  You can't talk to me. I understand.  I do have a link for you if you like.  It's press at Google.com.  Yeah, I'm familiar with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I apologize for ambushing you, but that's why we asked you ahead of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no. I definitely care if I can help spread the word or kind of –  Well, you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what we're doing.  That's exactly what we're doing.  Yeah, lots of people now are going to try this out.  And I love, Doug, how you shared that link with me and I could just – it was in a little window down here and I could just click that to go to press.google.com.  That was cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, this is really neat.  Hey, Doug, you're great.  I'm really glad you liked it, Leo.  Do you want to be a cool host this week at Google?  Yeah, we could hire you as a host this week at Google.  We've got to replace Gina here.  Hey, it's very nice to meet you, Doug.  I really appreciate it.  Oh, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It was really great talking to you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. It's a great demo of what you guys can do.  Thanks.  Thank you very much.  Take care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I will. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just another – bye, Doug.  Bye, Doug.  Bye, Doug.  Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That is so cool.  That is great.  He was a good sport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was a really good sport.  That never gets old.  That never gets old.  Calling Google support on this show never gets old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I know you did it first on All About Andre.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think it's great.  I think it's awesome.  And I would imagine you guys are pretty darn impressed, as impressed as I am, because for  the longest time, Google and support have not been two words that have shared –  Right.  They're so human.  – been associated with good.  Yet, both of these times that we've done it on this show, the response has been super  quick.  They've – I'm sure if we would have dove in with a pretty hardcore question, probably  would have got a good answer.  I'm pretty impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, he did not refer to a notebook or anything, at least not that I could see.  He knew the answer.  Yeah, he wasn't doing a – oh, page 78 is great.  Yeah, let me go to – yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  So you do that by going to the Play Store and –  A little question mark.  – clicking the question mark icon, and then under Contact Us, there's a video call.  At least there was online.  There's also live chat and phone.  And that is impressive for people who have in the past said, oh, I don't know, I can't  get support from Google.  Now, they don't do this for Gmail and stuff like this, although he did answer a question  about Chrome OS.  He answered a question about – yeah.  Yeah, he did.  Wow.  That is sweet.  He did a Chromebook.  I guess that's –  Well, they sell Chromebooks here.  So, you know, but they sell products here that cover the entire spectrum of Google stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, if I've been obnoxious, I could have asked whether there's any possible use for  my Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be interesting?  Because Glass is still available in the store.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't buy it.  They have it.  You can't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They just have it there.  I don't think you can buy it.  So, speaking of right time, timing is everything if you're selling shares of your company.  Larry Page and Sergey Brin have decided to, according to a filing with the SEC, sell off  some shares.  That's nice.  As of January 30th of this year, they had a total of 44.6 million shares of Class B  and 44.6 million shares of Class C stock.  They're going to sell two million each of the Class B common stock.  And, of course, only Google founders and Googlers can have Class B, so it will convert to Class  A upon sale.  And then another two million shares each of the non-voting Class C, which I presume  would also convert, for a total of ch-ching $4.4 billion.  Wow.  But they're only selling 10% of their holding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, they're still the major controllers of the company.  It doesn't, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, they'll own 11.9%.  But they have 52% of the voting power.  When Google went public, this was considered at the time, they did some really interesting  things when they went public, including that it was a Dutch auction they did, but they  also made sure that they kept a lot of the voting power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the split aimed even more control, as I remember, right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When they did the split.  That's right.  They converted some shares.  So 52% of the voting power.  Nobody's going to change the plans at Google anytime soon.  Class B shares, mostly owned by Bryn Page and Eric Schmidt, have 10 times the voting  power.  I like this picture.  This is from Business Insider.  That's Larry.  That's 2006.  They're a little older and grayer than that picture.  But I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  And I don't think anybody in the market, you know, stockholders should worry that they're  selling.  You know, it's 10%.  Cash in a little stock.  I wish I could cash in $4.4 billion worth of something.  I wonder what they'll do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It leads to things like philanthropy and estate planning and probably buy another plane or  something, you know, investing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gets to be a point, though, where you have so much money that you don't even really...  It's absurd.  It's a different...  It's got to be a different world where you don't even have to...  I mean, I can't even imagine.  It's just a different world.  There is a burden, though, and I don't know how philanthropic are they and how philanthropic  is Google.  There is a point where it gets to be so much.  Google does a fair amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google does a fair amount.  Do they?  Yeah.  Google.org, don't forget, they pledged a portion of equity, a portion of revenue.  You know, Benioff is the leader of that in San Francisco of pushing companies to pledge  portions of revenue and portions of revenue, portions of equity, and portions of employee  time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Each year, Google.org donates $100 million in grants, a billion dollars in products and  80,000 hours in Google or time.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  But do Larry and Sergey have their own...  Is there a page foundation or...?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think one of them does related to health stuff.  That's right.  I think it's Larry.  That would be Larry, right?  I think so.  You know, the other thing is there's nothing to say that they have to be public about it.  Right.  And you don't know what they give.  In fact, I think that's the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The left hand should not know what the right hand is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, but I was thinking about that.  I was almost going to call into the Stern show for some reason, I forget what the peg  was, and ask Howard because he's very public about his wife's charity, which is a Long  Island animal shelter that she's building for cage-free cats.  So he does stuff.  He does a calendar.  He takes the photos, so on and so forth.  And you know that he does other philanthropy.  He mentions it very discreetly.  Good.  But doesn't talk about it.  But you know, I was but I was wondering about this and I wanted to ask him.  And I guess I understand why it's a matter of humility, but it also is an opportunity  to promote a cause or charity that you care about.  And by not saying I give to blank, then you give up that opportunity.  I understand where you don't both from from, you know, let's not trumpet my charity says  rich person.  And also because once I mentioned one charity, they're all going to come running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like universities like this one.  Well, you'd also want to be a role model, right?  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But I think part of why you don't disclose is because it could look like you give preference  to certain groups over others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wouldn't it wouldn't the right kind of disclosure be something like I give 10 percent of all  my income to charity, period.  And then, you know, choose the charity of your choice.  And but but do I mean, this all comes from this particular kind of thing.  It comes from this perception.  I don't know if it's real anymore, but for a long time, there's this perception that  Silicon Valley was minting millionaires, but they were not very progressive in their charitable  contributions.  I don't know if that's still the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know either.  But if you're if you're a millionaire and you have a really good accountant, an accountant  is going to advise you.  Yeah, that's a good to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it actually I should be because I have an accountant.  And and the truth is that they keep the federal government keeps raising the threshold of  your AGI for what you can deduct.  And so in fact, they are not incenting giving as much as they should.  They're disincenting it all the time.  I can't remember what the threshold is now, but I think it's over.  It was four percent.  I think it's gone up.  And that's wrong.  That means you have to give more than four percent of your income before you could start  deducting it.  That first four percent is taxable.  On you.  Yeah.  Just the same thing they do with medical expenses.  And that doesn't seem like the right way to promote philanthropy.  What we I don't know if I should talk about this.  It turns out that you can deduct from from dollar one if you do something called community  development.  So when we and we give twit gives a lot a lot of my charities, all my charity almost  is local.  And that's one of the reasons because then you can deduct it from zero from dollar one.  If it's called community development as opposed to charity.  Anyway, there's ways and ways.  That's why you have an account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have two major charities, Tufts University and the next one.  And the next one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my daughter's daughter.  Oh, the next university.  Yeah.  Tell me about that.  Yeah.  Tell me that I have two kids in college.  That's a charity.  Yeah, they're both nonprofits.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  I got a new product for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just got the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I got a mysterious email from Motorola, a Lenovo company.  Although to my knowledge, there is no snap fish on Motorola phones yet.  But I just got I got an email last week from a Motorola saying we'd like to send you a  box.  It's embargoed till six to eight a.m. Pacific time Wednesday, the 25th today.  Your box will arrive.  And I think their hope was that people would have live unboxings all over the Internet.  I just I wasn't going to rush in.  So I came in at my normal time and we opened up the box.  And this is what we got.  I think this is inspired.  I wish more companies would do this from a point of view of a tech journalist.  What's the point of doing this?  I think it's a good idea.  I think it's a good idea.  I think it's a good idea.  I think it's a good idea.  I wish more companies would do this from a point of view of a tech journalist.  What a wonderful thing.  So I open up the box and here it says slide to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'd be great if it had a time that you really couldn't do not open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be great?  Well, it arrived.  You know, based on when it arrived, I guess there wasn't really that wasn't an issue  because I couldn't open till arrived.  So you slide it open.  Actually, I'm sure it came out this way.  And it said the new Moto E.  This is the second generation of Motorola's really inexpensive phone.  List price 150 bucks.  And it was kind of cool.  It says start here.  So you open the flap and that actually in here were these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put your hand in and something will bite it off.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here were these bumpers.  This is one way you can customize it.  They have a variety of colored bumpers.  And then you flip this open.  This is I thought this was really cool.  Here's the welcome desk.  Oh, you also had a badge with your name on my name on it.  It said Motorola that would let it.  So I already got my badge.  Thank you.  At the welcome desk.  And there's a door.  So cool.  There's a door.  And then you pull open the door and there's little seats for you and the other press to  sit in.  And and there's what's what's his name?  Rick Osterloh.  Rick Osterloh.  Hey, Rick.  He's a little Rick.  And there was a phone in here which I've since taken that taken out.  But that is so cute.  Thank you, Motorola.  What a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The phones was getting very good notices today that they've they've done a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here it is.  Right.  This is remarkable given now somebody said it was B it was for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let me unlock it because I think Best Buy might have leaked the price and information  last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody said it was for sale.  One hundred twenty bucks.  But that's for the three.  That's for the three G.  OK.  So this is the new this is the new one.  Full 4G.  It's a small screen.  It's a QHD screen which is what?  960 by 540.  Two hundred forty five pixels per inch which is small but but not tiny.  Now it's only eight gigs of storage.  In fact the first thing I had to do was take apps off because I of course it immediately  on installs everything.  And once you take apps off but it's a good looking screen it's fairly it feels fairly  snappy.  It has you know OK Google the standard OK Google doesn't have a lot of them a lot of  it does have the watch while you're driving.  It will assist the motor assist.  Yeah I really I love that.  There was and it's supposed now I don't know anything about battery life yet because I  just got it.  But it's a fairly hefty battery for a something this size.  Here's the says meeting have a productive meeting so it won't ring now because I'm  in a meeting which is awesome.  And it's lollipop and not only lollipop but clean lollipop.  It is it is effectively you know Google version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there any any moto wear on it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's just the moto apps that are needed to do assist.  And I think it probably has the connect app which allow or migration and my crazy yeah  to migrate stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like a mini Nexus.  I mean it's pure Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pure Google.  So in fact for people want a really cheap Nexus for development this is a great choice.  They're saying in the press kit they say it's for first time phone you know buyers.  It's for kids.  This comes off and you can customize it.  There's a black version also and a variety of different colored little these little colored  things.  Oh this is something nice even though only eight gig storage.  It does support an SD card micro SD card up to 32.  I don't work on that.  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why don't why don't more phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's such a nice feature.  It's hard to do in the US but I think Google's figured it out now.  So if you wanted to storm it would be more for music not so much to give you more app  storage.  So now I've made it a pink phone because I like pink.  I think this is for a first phone.  It's also third world oriented.  They will be a dual SIM model and there is an FM radio in it.  I think that's something that already nation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's hard to know nations want but for anybody who wants a cheap unlocked phone.  I mean you think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just just remember back to our wonder of smartphones and what this cost $129 for a  phenomenal phone and also also compared to the prices being rumored for the new Samsung  over a thousand bucks eleven hundred thousand bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I give Moto a lot of credit here.  I mean they came out with this Moto E last year.  I got one sitting here as well.  Great little disposable phone.  Absolutely great backup phone.  They have a purple thing on your.  Yeah I put the purple band on there.  My little Rick Osterloh he won't stand up.  I don't know what happened.  He fell down but they added a front facing camera which last year's model did not have.  Yeah five megapixels front and back.  No flash on the back which is a little unfortunate but that's OK.  You mentioned the Moto assist.  It also has the some of the notification stuff that the Moto X has.  Yes.  You can't put your hand over and have notifications appear.  There's no sensors for that.  But if you nudge the phone when it's sitting down and the screen is off the screen will actually wake and show you your notifications.  So they're doing what they can with this you know with very limited hardware.  I mean this is up to a quad core chip as compared to last year's dual core chip inside.  It's a Snapdragon 400 410 something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah it's not going to set the house on fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Last year's model actually only had four gig of storage.  So this is the eight gig is actually a doubling.  It really I mean it's almost the same price as last year plus it has LTE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is remarkable.  I think for a kid it's also it feels indestructible.  Gorilla Glass very plasticky but boy you feel it also somewhat water resistant.  I feel like this is the kind of phone that somebody would give a kid or your first phone if you're in a budget constrained.  Yeah kudos to Motorola.  I think this is really pretty impressive.  Kevin this is probably coming out of Chicago not out of China.  I mean the design and the sensibility and all of that.  Well it's hard to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean if you look at it you can see in the band that I have I mean it looks like the Moto X design which really originated back here.  So you've got the dimple.  Yeah I mean it's the dimple and everything.  It's just a reuse of a very smart elegant design and it's a little bit of a chunky monkey because of that battery.  But you know they say 24 hours of battery life to be expected.  See that's remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually cast my Moto X aside in 2014 Moto X because I couldn't get through a day as much as I love it and I had the leather back and everything.  But you know if I can get all the features and it lasts a day this thing's compact.  This isn't a bad choice at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could actually buy one of these outright for $149.  Never put a SIM card in it just use it as a Wi-Fi Android iPod for you know.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The unlocked unsubsidized price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well then $129 because you don't need the 4G.  Right.  Good point.  Why did they release this before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because there's going to be a lot of noise from Barcelona starting on Saturday.  And the best way to avoid that is to do exactly what they did.  This clever little box with the mini Rick Osterloh in it.  And by doing that they got our attention.  Didn't they?  Hi Rick.  Yours is like falling over.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Like there's glue on the bottom but my glue never sets.  So Rick I'm going to put him on my desk somewhere I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really like Rick and I really think.  I hope Lenovo doesn't screw this company up as they have screwed IBM's ThinkPad up.  Nice job.  Is the ThinkPad bad?  I know they all screwed up their fish.  ThinkPad does not have SuperFish.  It was only on the cheap consumer grade products that it has all that.  Here's some masking tape in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rick Osterloh even has a back.  They went all out on this guy.  Oh my god.  They spared no expense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man.  Holy cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This changes everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This changes everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love how this is kind of like thumbing their nose at the big, kind of what's become a tradition now,  which is just that in order to get attention, they feel like, these companies feel like they need to throw these huge announcements  filled with glamour and Broadway music and all this stuff.  When really all you need is a clever kind of campaign that's sent out at the right time,  which in this case ends up being before Barcelona, and they're going to get a pretty decent amount of awareness and coverage out of it.  Yeah. You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what else about that is that if you go to a bit, you know, for the sake of of of Twitter,  I've gone to the big Samsung event at Radio City.  Oh, God.  Right.  Where number one is an awful event.  Number two, they don't give away any phones.  Number three, I'll bet it cost five times what just giving away the phone in the cute box cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think they sent a lot of these to bloggers and people who probably can't afford to go to Barcelona.  They don't want to go to Barcelona.  So you get more attention by doing that.  Yes, smart.  Their Moto X announcement this year was in Chicago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you need them on your shoulder.  I can do that.  Well, you can speak in your voice.  You know, is he the good the good angel or the bad angel?  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's hanging on for dear life.  I can tell you that.  By the way, the Samsung phone, the S6 has a new form of payment.  Remember, they bought loop pay.  That's kind of an interesting technology.  Jeff Needles uses it.  It allows you to hover your phone over a swipe terminal.  The phone sends out a magnetic field, which is read as a as a real credit card being swiped.  So in other words, Samsung's pay will have touch to pay.  But also this swipe capability, which will make it the most compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's going to work far better, I think, in Europe than here.  I don't think they swipe.  Do they swipe still in Europe?  Well, yeah, no, you do.  You do the chip card.  I thought they did chip and pin.  Yeah, but but I think those terminals, you know, when they come in a restaurant in Europe,  they do you pay at the table with the device.  Well, it's pin.  But I think they also have a swipe there.  And I don't imagine you can hold up against that.  But in the US, there's a hell of a lot of purchases for which this won't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, swiping is going away, I think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How are you going to pay for a restaurant check?  I mean, how are you going to do with those?  Well, they just get these new touch terminals every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every restaurant, every waiter in the country.  They're mandated to.  I think they're mandated to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is this is all changing.  Is it is it that definite?  So we're moving to chip and sign instead of chip right by October of this year.  No more swipe.  So there'll be a chip, but it won't be necessarily pin based.  You'll still maybe sign.  So that sounds like the waiter will if he comes to your table,  we'll have a thing that you touch your I'm getting a new American Express card.  It's on its way with a chip in it.  I think all your credit cards will be replaced the next few months with chips.  That's I think NFC, right?  You tap it and then it registers it.  You still may have to print out a receipt and sign it.  Although it's not it doesn't mean you can't do chip and pin.  It just means that they're giving them a little more time to get used to that notion.  So chip and sign, though, is by October.  And it may be chip and pin in many, many of the places you go.  So that's to fight fraud, although we'll see how well that fights fraud.  Yeah.  But that but that's why everybody and their brothers announcing these new payment systems.  Samsung and Apple and everybody else because Walmart because they they realize that that all of the terminals are going to be refreshed  in the next six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a huge opportunity.  Real opportunity.  Everyone's trying to take advantage of it.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Android Pay even exists.  Sundar Pichai talked about Android Pay to replace Google Wallet, which is to tie in with Google Wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  Yeah, because that would get really confusing and which actually wouldn't wouldn't be too surprising knowing Google.  But yeah, it's more it's more like APIs for developers to allow developers to kind of tie mobile payments.  So they're not going to deprecate the wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll still be able to use my wallet.  Right.  So it will provide a secure store.  It will have an API.  Apps will determine when and where you can use payment cards.  The Google system will tokenize card numbers, much like Apple and Samsung pay do.  That's one of the real advantages of these payment systems from the privacy point of view and a security point of view.  You're not giving the merchant your credit card or any personal information, merely a one time token, which they can use to verify that you are paying this amount.  Google's Android Pay will use NFC for transmission will support biometric authentication via hardware.  Oh, that's another thing on the S6.  They figured out a way to touch without swiping touch ID fingerprint right now.  Although I have to say I've gotten used to the note for and I'm pretty consistent on it.  But see, I just did it and said, no, no, you didn't.  You do it a little sideways.  You have to do it just right.  I do like this and it does unlock Google Wallet.  It unlocks LastPass.  So there already is a standard kind of API for for the Samsung fingerprint reader.  But you know, one that works like apples where you just put your finger on it and it reads it and you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple's works so well.  Yep.  But you know what, Leo?  You know what I don't want on my Nexus six?  A button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Well, as a result, you have a physical button and this is why the Apple iPhone is a physical button.  That's why Samsung.  It justifies Samsung's continued defunct to the home button.  Right.  Maybe they knew.  So Pachai said that they're not trying to compete with Samsung's offering.  It's just to give them another choice.  And I guess it will work with the Samsung fingerprint reader, which is cool.  No timeline.  I guess we'll find out more at Google I.O. in May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am glad that they're stepping this up a little bit.  I mean, for a while it was unsure.  I was unsure.  Certainly.  I think a lot of people were what was going to happen with Google Wallet.  You know, was it just going to go away?  I mean, I was really starting to wonder because my I use Google Wallet whenever I can because it's more secure.  People ask me, why do you do that thing with your phone?  Why don't you pay by credit card?  And I tell them I get there's a pin.  You know, I can revoke things very easily if someone gets my phone or something.  But I've been going to stores and it hasn't been working because stores are I guess not subscribing to the service anymore.  Whatever.  So I was getting really worried.  But I'm really glad that they're stepping this up.  I'm glad that they bought ISIS or whatever it's called now.  Soft card.  Thank you.  Because I think that and I think that they I think the reason they did it was just because they got so worried with Apple Pay.  I think that kind of forced worried or they saw an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think that just as we said, this is the time if you're going to put your flag in the sand, this is the time to plan it.  Yep.  I you know, while it was hurt because the carriers chiefly Verizon wanted to use soft card.  Right.  I mean, how many times have I installed Google Wallet or tried to on an Android device and says your your carrier does not support it.  Yeah.  But that changed at some point.  Now everybody does.  Right.  Have you had problems on Verizon with your?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I have not had problems, but I run a custom ROM.  So so you wouldn't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google actually specifically took took it into their own hands and changed the way wallet authenticated fixed the secure elements, something along those lines.  The details are a little shady, but they basically went around the carriers and said, OK, well, if you're going to block it there, then we're going to do it this way.  Now, what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was real thrilled because my wallet was working and I put all my credit cards in there.  Right.  As far as I can tell, it's functionally identical to Apple Pay.  The only difference is the fingerprint reader.  I think it's great.  Use a pin instead of a fingerprint reader.  And now that's coming.  And everywhere that uses Apple Pay, it works because touch ideas, touch ID, you know, or whatever it is.  Yeah.  Touch to pay is touch to pay.  So I'm not sure what's going on.  And this is not good because consumers need to know with some reliability what's going on.  Maybe that's why they've almost feels like they've rebranded Google Wallet Android Pay in the same way they rebranded Google TV Android TV.  Google likes to rebrand its things.  Well, it's all Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's the that's the more consumer friendly brand.  Yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, let's talk about I have actually not one but two new Chromebooks and Jeff, time for me to eat crow.  Whoa, history book.  Yeah.  Well, you remember I was pretty dismissive.  You've been nice.  We've been a shtick of it.  I've been dismissive of the Chromebook.  And a lot of people still are.  They say, oh, it's just a browser pretending to be a computer.  But a few things have happened.  One is obvious.  It's become more and more capable over time.  And there's more and more Chrome extensions.  There's now Chrome apps, which act pretty if a Chrome OS has become in many respects a full blown OS.  You've got apps, you've got a toolbar and all that.  But what was missing, I think, was decent hardware.  Hardware, to be frank, most Chromebooks, 200, 300 dollars, they're junky.  There's not they're net.  They're tinny.  Yeah.  So I now having played with the new Google.  Let me log into this before you show it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The new mindset, I'm so I can log in with my watch.  That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have if you have Android 5 on your on your device, your watch will do it.  I mean, my phone.  God, if the watch did it, that would be really awesome.  But if you have Android 5 on your smartphone, yeah, it'll just log in automatically.  The screen is spectacular.  As good as any retina air.  It's weird.  Three, two still.  In fact, it's in any every way.  That's the same except type C connector now, which I really like.  And there's two of them.  So you could put power on either side, video on either side, USB still there.  It still has an SD card slot, which is kind of kind of a bad tease because I can't really do anything with it.  I shoot raw.  So it doesn't there's no point in putting a card in there, although it does mount flush, which means you could use this as extra storage.  You put on a 28 gig SD card in there.  That's like a second hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you wish, I try to go to Best Buy and Apple to buy a C to HDMI connector and you can't get it.  Not yet.  Really?  You can get it from Google, but you can't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can get and get them online.  And Apple sells a seventy nine dollar dongle, which really is overpriced.  So there's a couple of needed accessories.  That's certainly one is cheap type C interfaces.  And I'm sure Monoprice will do them because it's not proprietary.  It's not the MagSafe adapter.  It's everybody, you know, Intel, Google and Apple all involved in type C.  It's a standard.  So as far as I can tell, I've been doing a lot of inquiries.  This is a standard, standard, standard power and everything.  You could, for instance, have a type C power adapter from another manufacturer, plug it in and it would work fine.  Even if the wattage isn't the same, it will trickle charge it or fast charge it or not, you know, not use all the all the power available.  It'll work.  The other accessory that's needed is Steve Gibson came up with this.  And if anybody wants to steal this idea and do a Kickstarter, I encourage you.  He says you need a type C condom because there is this issue that type C is not just power, it's full USB data.  So the bad USB hack, which means that you can use this to modify the firmware on USB drives and make them very potent malware transportation devices, is a potential problem here.  Somebody could put a charging station in a coffee shop that would infect.  Now, the good news about Chromebooks is you can't.  There's nothing really to infect.  In fact, right. These are very, very secure.  But nonetheless, certainly for the MacBook, you'll want this.  It would be simple enough to make a type C male to female cable that just carried the power lines, not any of the data.  I see.  And you carry that with you.  You'd use that all the time.  Then you could safely connect to anything.  So that's a good market.  They shouldn't be more than a buck or two.  There's no special stuff in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm figuring 59 bucks on from from Apple before you know it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, it is March 18th today.  Jason just not much.  Ah, good catch.  I am really impressed with the keyboard, the screen, the trackpad.  Everything works very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The hinge is more solid.  The hinge was good before, but it's really good now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't mind the screen that it's three to it's weird, but you get used to it.  And it's fine for me.  One thing that that has really improved in the Chromebook is the ability to handle different size screens.  And I'll use that with this.  I'll use this example.  This is a new this came out today.  This is a new Acer Chromebook with a 15 inch screen.  And one of the things that's made it hard for me to recommend Chromebooks to its natural users of Chromebooks are older people, right, who really don't need anything more complex than a book.  More complex than a browser and email program, things like that.  Chromebooks are perfect for them.  They just can't get in trouble with them.  But the screens have been so crappy and small.  It's hard to recommend it.  Even I have a hard time reading it.  Can you hide the screen real quickly while I log into my Google account on this?  This one.  I'll show you what I've done.  I've made it.  Because you have 15 inches now, you can make this very easy to look at.  Because you now have two things you can change.  You can change the standard browser's zoom size.  And you can change the standard text size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's not the small type problem of the other Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is so easy to to to use.  You see how big that I can make it even bigger.  See how big it is.  And on a 15 inch screen, which, you know, it's 1080p screen.  Potentially, these could be very small.  But they're actually quite usable, I think.  So I think Google has solved a lot of the kind of little things.  And how much is that Acer?  300 bucks.  Amazing.  So I've customized the fonts to be very large, but you can even go more in here.  You can change the kind of font.  There's a lot of information there you can use to your heart's content to make it legible.  And then you can set the standard page zoom, which I've set to 150 percent on here.  Just kind of as example.  Now, so these icons, some of the icons on the Chrome, the user interface are still small, but usable.  And it's not touch.  It's not nearly as good a screen as the Pixel.  The thing that's great about the Pixel is it feels so fast, so fluid, so easy.  And this isn't even the LS version.  That you kind of some of the kind of qualms about using a Chromebook go away.  It feels like it's a real computer.  The speed is already impressive.  I got the LS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You did?  Yeah.  Both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so the Acer is my only machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might as well.  You know, it's where I live with.  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  200 bucks, 300 bucks more.  The Acer boots in seven seconds.  This thing, let me just do a reboot.  It feels like it's almost instant, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what's so great to you mentioned this last week, too, is the setup is nothing.  Every time I have changed machines, oh, it was a day.  I forgot that.  And you turn it on and give it about four minutes and it's done.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's see how fast it takes to boot.  I just shut it off.  Just tap 1001, 1002, 1003, 1004.  Did I tap it?  No, it didn't shut off yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It takes a second to shut off.  OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is it off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you even know?  No light on the front.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  1001, 1002, 1003.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the screen back of 1000.  That's it.  Like almost instant, like four or five seconds.  Yeah.  This is kind of fun, too.  The rainbow little doohickey here.  You double tap it and you can see how much battery life is left, which is great.  So I'm 100% charged.  And the battery life, you haven't experienced this yet, Jeff.  Nine to 12 hours, easy.  Oh, really?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So it's legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's legit.  And same thing with this Acer because it's so big.  It's all battery in the inside.  Right.  That is fabulous.  These are heavier than Ares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are heavier than Ares.  That's the one thing.  They're not, you know, skinny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it feels, you know, it feels like something, it's a utilitarian air.  Yeah.  Solid.  Square edges, you know.  It's very googly googly.  I love it.  I'm very happy with it.  I think you're going to like yours a lot.  I'm curious what you say with the Ludicrous Speed version.  And there's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead, Bethany.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There's nothing you want to do on a computer that you can't do on there?  Yeah, there's a few things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like to do computer programming.  I can't do most kinds of computer programming.  You can do App Inventor and stuff like that, web-based programming, but I can't do the  stuff I want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could dual boot.  You can dual boot to, not dual boot, but dual build to.  I played with Linux on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I decided not to do that.  The one thing I have done, I have SSH on here.  And so the one thing I have done is I can SSH to my Linux box and have a Linux command  line easily.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Matthew, the only thing is you don't edit video on it.  You can't video or photo.  I mean, you can, but you can't do what Leo does with his raw files on photo.  But for what I do for, you know, let me get a photo for a medium post, easy as pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can also use remote desktop.  So I'm going to remote desktop into my Mac Pro at home.  And don't look.  You have a security pin, which I've just entered.  And now I can use my computer at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Is it one, two, three, four?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Shoot.  You saw.  You saw.  So I'm having some screen issues, but this is probably because I have my computer at  home set a ridiculous screen resolution.  But basically this is, that's my computer at home I'm looking at.  This screen is my Mac Pro.  So you can, in fact, I guess do what you want.  But I think if you had, I think what you need is a desktop that can do all that stuff.  And then this could be your, your notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, listen, I think when you, when you get, if I had Google fiber at full speed,  you start to see doing video remotely.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a remote video plugin.  We video will do video editing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And listen, it's always taken time to download the video to the machine.  You just upload it to the cloud instead.  And as long as you can get response there and, and the rendering is going to be faster up  in the cloud than it is going to be on a local machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As more stuff uses HTML five as Chrome gets more powerful.  I love this little app drawer.  And by the way, you get this on windows and Mac now too, where you have what look, I mean,  as for all intents and purposes, this looks like the task bar on windows with all my icons here.  What's your mouth out?  Well, I mean, it's okay.  The dock, you have a start button where you have, you know, these are the apps I have.  I can swipe through them, which is great.  And these, you know, I, you know, it's pretty much everything I want.  The speakers on this are pretty decent.  Still, I think the old pixel had very good speakers.  These are still pretty good here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  And there is a lot of, you know, image editing and even sort of minor video editing that you can do in the cloud.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's something like my tweet deck app is great.  You know,

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anyway,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Just assumed it would be all about the base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I can play that.  I hate that song.  So I think in general, this is this is like 90 percent of what most people do with their computing anyway.  Yeah.  100 percent in some cases.  You can play Pac-Man if you just go to your maps dot Google dot com.  You can play Pac-Man in your hometown.  I'm playing it in Petaluma.  Oh, quickly before Blinky gets to me.  Run for the river, Pac-Man.  Oh, I just went.  I don't know where I am.  Oh, yeah.  You go off the edge.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is kind of brilliant.  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And listen to the sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Trump is I've got the sound up.  I don't know why.  Oh, I heard that.  That's not the sound you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why aren't I not sound is returned to good.  Huh?  Oh, here it is.  That little thing there.  Oh, now.  Now, how do you do you have to license that sound?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did.  I mean, it's Google.  It's exactly.  Yeah.  The sound Namco licensed it.  Must have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's like an AY 38910 chip.  This is one of the four things it can do.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  That's probably a good point.  It probably is built into the chip, isn't it?  All right, Blinky.  Come here, baby.  I'm going to eat you alive.  I was really bad at this game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So can we play this on a map of London?  That'd be much harder.  Yeah, just much harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  Sure.  Let's go back to Google Maps.  I think you can go anywhere.  I believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, what would be really hard is one of these like suburban mazes where there's no actual...  Yeah, there's no out.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dead end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It works anywhere.  So play Pac-Man.  I think this is nicely done.  Yeah.  I mean, it's probably not that.  In fact, they probably reused the code because didn't they have a Google Doodle that was a Pac-Man?  I believe they did.  Look, there's dead ends.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, man.  This is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They even brought...  Google even brought Pac-Man into the Ingress experience.  They did?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you're playing Ingress, you have Pac-Man?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is nice.  So the point about this is it's not a stupid make fun of people thing.  I know.  It disrupts people's expectations with something playable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So we got a new thing.  It's called MakerBase.  The URL is a little goofy.  It's makerba.se.  Because the .com wasn't available.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got the Swedish one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, we did.  We got the Swedish one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like it.  Yeah.  It's invitation only at the moment because it's really broken and early and we're working  on it.  But if you are interested and you want in and you're listening to the show, just tweet  at me and tell me that you heard about it on Twig and I'll get you in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's what it says.  You make great things.  Tell the world what you made.  So it's for app creators?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's for digital creators.  So not just apps, apps, games, podcasts, shows, anyone that's making any sort of piece of  digital culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would count.  You would absolutely count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Okay.  Yeah.  It's about projects and makers, not companies, not titles.  Right.  We're talking about like digital things and their makers.  And by maker, I don't mean coder.  I mean everything.  I mean, we mean everything.  Nice.  So designers, writers, project managers, legal help.  I mean, investors, everyone who helped bring an app that you love to fruition, we want  to capture in MakerBase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what will we get out of this?  Is it going to be like a crunch base for makers or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, some people have made that comparison.  I mean, one of our lofty goals, and this is me and my co-founder, Anil at ThinkUp, you  know, this conversation we've had is like, there's always like a point in your career  where you like talk to that person, where you kind of like, you get your big break,  like somebody takes a chance on you or, or, you know, gives you, gives you a job or, or,  or sparks an idea in you.  And that that's kind of when your career takes off.  So our idea is like, if we can make the, like the, the credit roll behind the apps that  you love transparent, you know, if we can have the liner notes for apps, just like,  you know, CDs have them or the IMDB for apps, the way that movies has them, that I'll make  it easier for people to say, Oh, how, you know, who do I need to talk to to find out  more about how this happened or who are the people that work together a lot?  Like you'll see these kind of power couples or power teams go through several, you know,  projects like Evan Biz, you know, we'll go through audio and medium and blogger and,  you know, and Twitter.  So we want to kind of make the, we want to make the network of, of, of creators of makers  kind of transparent to help people, you know, see the faces behind, you know, what we made  and honestly to help, you know, for underrepresented folks to find their pathways in  and make those big breaks happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To put it in my terms, it's bylines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bylines.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's, here's Gina.  I presume you made this entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I did.  And everything is editable by everybody.  So, so the show is like Wikipedia, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The show counts.  Yeah, absolutely.  The show is a project for sure.  Yep.  Medium count.  You're writing on medium, Jeff.  I think I added medium for you.  And then each person has a role in a project and a role could be like, I, you know, I made  a suggestion on how to make the logo better and the role could be I founded it, you know,  there's, there's like a blog.  That's nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gina, just put up my latest chapter from the book on medium that was not meant to be a  plug, sorry, is about what I think I'm talking about the show is, is what I call credit right  rather than copyright, the need to give credit to people for whatever deal may come down  the pike in this, in the string of creative, of collaborative creation online.  And this is a, this is a start to that.  That's really, really important.  I think I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a directory though, essentially a opens directory.  IMDB is a good example.  There's also, doesn't Mozilla have a similar kind of open database of stuff?  This is good.  I like this a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There are a lot of projects like there's this like Angel List and Geek List and Dribble.  I mean, there's a lot of communities for people who do particular things, but this is very  maker and project focused.  So tell me who made Super and what that was like.  And eventually we like to add like Q&A and, you know, ask questions.  And it's really cool.  Like we showed this to, to Williams actually.  And we had added him as like the founder of Blogger and you can see the edits that people  make to their homepage.  So he actually edited his role in Blogger to add that he had written some code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I actually wrote the code.  This guy's a billionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he really wanted to get in there that he had written some like ASP, you know, it's  like very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where did you get this avatar of me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay.  So everything right now we're doing autofills from Twitter primarily.  So when I made this entry for you, Leo, this is your Twitter avatar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I've changed my Twitter avatar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So yeah, you can click on the edit button anywhere and change and change that.  So that's your role.  So you go to your page, click back there and there's an edit button on the top right there.  And again, this is really awesome.  Avatar URL can be different.  Got it.  Yeah, we have to make obviously uploading or changing images a little bit a little bit  nicer than just entering the URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially that image.  That was my Twitter handle, Twitter image for a brief period of time.  Then people explained to me it looked like I was dying in a vat of acid or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's an amazing photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not, I'm not vain.  Let's put it that way.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that is not a flattering picture of me there.  All right, I'll fix that.  But this is cool.  I love this idea.  And you wrote this all from scratch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I did.  I did.  Yeah.  We were using a bunch of code from ThinkUp and that framework that I've written when  we learned a lot of lessons from ThinkUp.  And we want to make the data entry as we want to make it fun, right?  Because we don't want to give people a job to set up yet another resume.  But we want this to sort of differentiate itself enough from LinkedIn and from those  kind of other networks to make it worthwhile.  We want this to be the place where people go to see the liner notes for an app.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that you have these Gina touches.  Roll raised corn.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a definite Gina sense of whimsy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like, I like writing goofy copy and then somehow it doesn't get caught in those lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope you go up with a bunch that just go in there like, you know, order the tacos.  Order the tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good one.  Order the tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the taco orderer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brought the donuts.  Complained incessantly.  Added bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Heard and cast.  Yeah.  See if I can find it better.  What do you think?  Oh, you are a beautiful woman.  I have to tell you, that is a great eye pickup.  I have never seen.  That's a great photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of work went into that.  No, this is actually, actually, it's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  L'Oreal makes an iOS app that puts makeup on you.  What's that one?  And it's a little bit of a surprise.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  L'Oreal makes an iOS app that puts makeup on you.  Is that what it is?  I thought your wife was tormenting you.  No, this is done programmatically.  She just said, hold still.  And it's actually kind of amazing.  She did the same thing to herself.  But there's no, that one's not, that one's a little, obviously, creepy.  This is, this is me.  This is creepy, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, it is so well done.  The shadows and the darkness.  It looks real.  I remember that Lisa had pinned you down and did makeup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  I'm going to save the image and make it my, my, my, my new Twitter handle.  Twitter profile.  Isn't that great?  All right.  So nice, nice job on that.  Let me go back to the,  This was a 20% you said, Jane.  Maker base here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, this was a 20% thing.  What does that mean?  Well, you know, we were slogging through some like backend projects around payments and  the Facebook API changes at ThinkUp.  And honestly, it was, it was hard.  And so the, we did MakerBase as kind of a productive distraction.  We did Fridays.  Most people go to the bar, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, let's write some more code.  What do you say?  This is a Neil's idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He had this idea in 2011 and he had talked to me about it back then.  And I remember feeling this twinge of, Ooh, I really want to work on that.  And then, but we were too busy.  We were too busy with ThinkUp.  And finally I said to him, listen, let's, let's just build this thing.  It was his idea.  He had talked to a bunch of people about it.  A few people had actually started it and it never shipped.  And I was like, let's just do it.  So yeah, this was our, this was our Friday fun day.  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fairly, it looks, it seems very stable and fast and reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  From your mouth to the web server gods.  You have a way of jigsawing things, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't forget.  You know what?  We've just sent a thousand people there easily and it's handling the traffic very smoothly.  What's your backend?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, this is a straight, straight up lamp stack.  You don't run your own servers though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we've got it on the Linode box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This, this particular one, we're on AWS for ThinkUp, but we have our staging kind of play, play sandbox servers on Linode.  And we actually put the MakerBase on Linode.  Oh, neat.  So yeah, it's, it's perfectly fine.  Like I said, it's invitation only.  So people who are going to it, who are, don't have sign in rights are just giving us their Twitter credentials.  So there's not, not a lot of, not a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's probably why we haven't brought it down yet.  Yeah.  But you know, this is great because if you love Gina Trapani, you could come here and just like you would on IMDB, you'd see every movie that somebody was in.  You'd see all the products that projects that Gina's worked on in the days.  It's not exactly a resume.  In fact, because these are all direct links, right?  So that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of, it's also a GitHub for non-Gitties.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know?  This is my frustration is that there are all these communities for coders, but I just, you know, we want everybody to learn to code.  And I think that that's a good idea.  But I don't, I've really come to this place where I realize that being a coder, like doesn't necessarily mean that you're the one creating, creating this stuff.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like there's so much more to coding apps and games and, and to creating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As a coder, that's generous of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not much more, just a little more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  People think I have some sort of superpower.  And it's like, I have this idea and if I only could code and I could make it happen.  Coding is a superpower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at this.  You made this.  And you made it fairly quickly, I'm guessing.  I just, that's, that's a superpower.  That's a hell of a superpower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But without writers and designers and even people to do your privacy policy and logo.  I mean, there's just, there's so, there's so much else that goes into it.  Right.  And, you know, like, did you know that this was PHP?  Like, you know, there's part, a good product is going to make the technology behind them invisible.  And I think that that makes a, you know, a different skill set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you should say that because we were talking about AppCamp for girls yesterday on the Mac Break Weekly.  And Kelly Gumont, who's a counselor there, they may have, they have an app that just came out.  But she said that's one of the things that the girls learn at AppCamp is you don't have to be a coder.  They need, you need designer, you need all these people.  It's no application is just some person writing code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the real skill to teach is going to be working in teams.  I mean, that's what we're seeing about journalism is that we don't work in teams.  We are lone wolf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should play more World of Warcraft.  Oh, that would teach you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, there's, there's this like lone wolf kind of mythology around coders as well.  And that's true.  And that's not, that's not, it's about your ability to get the right people together and collaborate and lead.  Right. I mean, most founders, sure, did some ASP coding on blog early on.  Right. But most founders do, you know, they wear lots of different hats.  And I think there's a lot of invisible aspects to that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Having said that, you should all learn Lisp right now.  M-A-K-E-R-B-A dot S-E.  That's not hard to look. It's just, it's Swedish.  How do you say it with a Swedish accent?  Maker base.  Maker base.  All our, all our Swedish viewers and we have quite a few are just hating us right now.  How do you get a dot S-E? You just go to the Swedenic and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I think we, I'm pretty sure we just used hover.  You have to submit some little extra paperwork that you don't for dot coms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you don't anymore have to be in that country to use the country code in many countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you don't. I think you have to submit like the tax number of the organization or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I hope you don't get a Swedish tax bill now.  I think you might get a Swedish tax bill. You're doing business in Sweden.  Oh, geez. Oh, geez.  Oh, it's okay. Cause they've got great health care there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And wonderful hearing and great sonnets.  I love Sweden.  I love Sweden. I adore Sweden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it. And you're going to Finland, which I also, Scandinavia is great, but it's very different.  You know, the Finnish do not consider themselves, you know, part of that Scandinavian Norway, Sweden, Denmark thing.  They speak Korean.  They're, they're, it's a, yeah, well, it's a Russo. It's a very different language.  And yeah, it's like Korean, which is really bizarre when you say that.  Yeah, there you go. I am really close now. I held off ordering the Gear VR.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S6, but I think now I'm going to order it because it this, you know,  because it's more comfortable than cardboard. It has a strap on one thing.  It's a strap on so you can leave it on. I shouldn't.  Oh, my doorbell's ringing. I hate it when that happens.  I am a little too wired now.  So, but I think that the, you know, I've kind of come around on the VR thing.  And it's funny, it's cardboard that did it, not Oculus Rift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  Yes. It's the, it's the VR for the people and the augmented reality for the people because it's going to,  and I think one of the coolest things that they showed at the, at the event, Google I.O. during the keynote,  was this, this new program to get cardboard into schools.  Yes.  And it's such a perfect solution because it's not like, you know,  Apple's plan to get iPads into schools so that every school has to pay 600 or whatever dollars.  But wait a minute. It's cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cardboard's cheap, but what's driving it? And the reason it's cheap is you still need a smartphone.  Yes.  But you do.  Where's that coming from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Kids all got them now. They, you know, it's like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no. Kids don't all got them, and especially below sixth grade, K through six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what they showed was boxes that had the smartphones in them. So I'm guessing that people will donate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They cost the same as an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it depends on what phone you get, right? I mean, there are definitely less expensive options.  What's the minimum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the minimum cardboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just, well, like I bought my, I mean, you don't need a phone connection. You're on Wi-Fi at school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. So you could get what, what, what then?  What if it was like an Android One?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Android One for under $100.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And I'm sure that, I mean, you said that kids under the age of, you know, I've been reading a lot of stuff lately that shows that in the United States, at least, a huge percentage of even sixth graders have phones and carry them every day to school.  And so it'll be one of those things where they say, okay, who's got their own phone? Okay, who doesn't have a phone? And then they can pass out the school's phones for this purpose.  But the benefit is that, is as they, as they talked about in the presentation, is it's a way to get kids really super engaged, to actually immerse them in the content that they're talking about rather than just sitting there listening to a teacher go on and on.  I think the value is massive. And the additional cost, I think, can be very, very low. Of course, Palo Alto School District will spend a fortune on brand new phones for all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of my point. This happens all the time. The tech community gets all excited, puts hardware into schools or, you know, sets us kind of stuff up and says, hey, see, see you later. Bye bye.  And there's no curriculum. There's no training for the teachers. And in this case, there's this assumption that everybody's got an Android smart or a high end smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they'd all have to be school issued because the teacher is controlling them from the tablet, right? So they've all got to be school issued for this to be.  This is not a cheap thing you're talking about here.  If they roll this out well, they're going to they're going to focus on lower income. The kids really need it. You know, I hope we're going to see things like Donors Choose and we're going to see other programs.  Hopefully Google is going to throw money in places other than Palo Alto and figure out ways to help people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has a very compelling argument in the schools. I mean, the Chromebook is, of course, the best way to put a computing platform in a school.  But I'm not, you know, you everybody focuses on the fact that it's just the viewer is cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, but I think the viewers is the holder. Right. But the way to look at this, I think, is that the alternative to to something like Google Cardboard, the alternative to low cost VR and augmented reality is nothing.  It's not going to get cheaper than this. In order to do VR, you have to have a good display.  You have to have some sort of connection. You have to have all the things that a smartphone has.  And there's no there are very few industries that have the economies of scale, entire industries, entire countries that have been built, that have built industries around making all that stuff super, super cheap.  And so it's just it's basically the only alternative argument to if the argument is that this is too expensive, then virtual reality has no place in schools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that may be another argument. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It's the cheapest virtual reality you can get.  Well said, Mike. So a rubber waiting pool would also be the cheapest pool you could get.  Doesn't necessarily mean that this belongs to schools. And there's this whole additional thing of you.  OK, so you've got OK, let's say you figured out a way to get all the kids cardboard.  Now you've got to get the teacher a tablet and you've got to get curriculum associated with it.  You know, remember the L.A. Unified School District put said they were going to put an iPad in the hands of every student.  They made a deal with Pearson to develop curriculum. And it's been a horrible failure.  They're suing both Apple and Pearson curriculum wasn't developed.  The teachers weren't trained. Most of these iPads ended up in the back of the classroom unused.  I it kind of makes me mad because I think Silicon Valley and we tech enthusiasts love this idea of tech and schools.  But we don't follow through. We don't go the whole distance on it.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Another thing here, though, Leo, is that if you look at an elementary school, it's not like every classroom needs a setup.  Right. One set up for an entire school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're buying one per class, right? You're buying one per school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And, you know, Paulson just gave four hundred million dollars to Harvard, the last school on the earth that possibly needs it.  No, I agree. Equipping the school is probably the least of the problem.  Yeah, I don't say this is the first thing to buy at all. I agree with that, too.  Museum of Natural History was at I.O. They did one of the explorations.  You know, I'm going through the same thing in news. People are going Gaga over VR.  And I'm saying, well, hold on. It really hasn't had any impact yet.  We really have, you know, it's yes, it's the latest new shiny toy.  What's it? What's its real value going to be? Undetermined.  Nonetheless, yes, we go, Gaga, we see that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm excited. I want to build a jump camera.  That's the 16 GoPro or 16 doesn't have any GoPros, but that's the demo 16 camera rig that GoPro will sell.  But you could also build yourself and then the jump software assembles it.  And my sense is you could do this in real time, which means I could say to our audience, watch live.  You can download the show later. But if you'd like to watch live as if you're in the studio with us,  we have set up one of these rigs right where you would be sitting.  And now you can look around and participate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. You can imagine a whole different kind of talk show.  Yeah. Where it's not just a camera going one level.  It's that you're in the middle of couches of a discussion. Right.  You know, we look around as people talk. That's that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know, imagine imagine a roundtable like like the kind that Alex Lindsay built for other purposes for conversations.  And you have it in the middle of the table. Yeah, we could do that.  And and yeah, wouldn't that be great?  And then you hear somebody talking over here. So you turn this way and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very by the way, Dr. Moms saying, oh, great.  It's going to now make me barf. Believe me, I get nauseous with Oculus Rift.  Absolutely. I've never gotten nauseous with a not sure why with cardboard.  But I think it's because you're not you're not moving.  And the thing is, it's not you don't have this situation you didn't riff where you're not moving physically,  but you're moving virtually. That is disorienting to the inner ear.  That is what makes you nauseous. I think there's also latency issues.  I'm sure that that's not necessarily solved in cardboard.  But I don't I never was bothered by it, partly because too, because you can just go like this. Yeah.  Right. You don't you're not going to really say spend hours.  You're not playing a game. The games are what makes you nauseous, frankly.  Right. Thank you, Matt, for for putting this in here.  This was from the Google Google research. Oh, Jason did this.  All right. Google research blog.  It's talking about neural networks. Neural networks are a form of artificial intelligence computer software that learns.  The way you teach it is just feed it stuff, feed it lots of stuff.  And in this case, these neural neural networks, which are attempting to simulate the human brain, is being fed images.  And actually, this is quite a good conversation of how this works.  Image classification, speech recognition are two very big areas where neural networks are being used to try to, you know, get better at this.  And there's some really cool images in here of.  I don't know what are these, Matt, would you explain what I'm looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you basically try to train a neural network, a deep neural network to recognize specific things,  whether it be ants or antelopes or dumbbells.  And then you can turn it on its head and have the network sort of amplify things or given one image, kind of take that and and and sort of build on it.  And then it becomes self-reinforcing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so you're looking for the platonic ideal of fork or ant or parachute or banana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then you could feed it back into itself.  And then once it sees a little bit of a fork, it turns it into more of a fork.  And so before you know it, you get this this macro level structure like a dog on one end and a fish on the other end.  It actually looks like an object, you know, because it could be plausible.  And it's funny because a lot of people on Google are reading the comments on Reddit and Reddit was sort of saying, this is exactly what acid looks like.  Well, there's something to be said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not merely a stoner talking there.  That's kind of what happens when your brain doesn't organize information very well because it's drugged.  Well, that's what the neural network kind of is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is your Google. This is your Google on drugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there might be some learnings about how the visual cortex works.  Yeah. Yeah.  How how it processes stuff, you know, together with LSD or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But notice, by the way, these are images of dumbbells.  It seems like no dumbbell is complete if you look closely without a muscular arm.  Yeah.  So there's dumbbells, but there's also arms in here.  And when the computer sees those two linked, it says dumbbell.  Might be hard to see a dumbbell without an arm holding it, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And it only knows what it sees.  And so if it never sees a dumbbell without an arm, it's like, well, of course, it's got to be something else.  They go together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. This is.  This does look like you're on acid.  This is will to be sun acid, apparently.  Wow. That is quite gorgeous.  The Sarah paintings are pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing? So George Sarah was a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all about pixels. Yeah.  Wow. Is that neat?  I don't know. I don't know if there's anything to be learned from that.  Here's the sky.  So these are the representations internally of the neural network.  Here's that that's pretty dog snail loving you were talking about.  Wow. Oh, man.  Who needs drugs, man? Very, very Van Gogh.  Yeah, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Van Gogh.  There is. I think there is something to be said of, you know, if a brain is not doing a good job of organizing the information in the brain, it probably does look a lot like a neural network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A very naive understanding.  This is the Admiral dog, the pig snail, the camel bird and the dog fish.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I guess it also shows a little bit, you know, deep neural networks, they're going to be popping up everywhere for, you know, I think maybe Facebook did something where you can give it a caption and it will generate an image to match that.  So, you know, neural networks are going to show up in all kinds of places, you know, in the next five years, not in the next 50 years.  Is this what they're using for face recognition, for instance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Google Brain and the deep neural network stuff is used, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but this might be a sub part, a different branch of that.  Right.  Let's talk about something that I know will get everybody kind of kind of a little amplified here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai spoke with Conor Doherty of the New York Times about intrusive technology and how it impacts our lives.  I thought it was an interesting conversation.  The interview itself is one thing.  And Jeff, we'll talk about that here in a second.  The point that Pichai was kind of making repeatedly through the interview, I thought were some interesting points.  He's basically talking about how Google's aim with their products is to be user centric, to make users happier, more productive people, not to get in the way and deteriorate the quality of life.  Basically that the burden is on the user right now.  Sundar believes that, you know, that's that's not the way it should be.  The burden should actually be on on Google to create an experience to create and developers to create apps that relieve the burden of the user and actually place the information in a user's hands without the user having to kind of seek it out.  So I thought it was kind of an interesting talk.  Did you get a chance to take a look at that, Aaron?  No, I was just looking at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just trying to figure out.  I mean, what do you guys think?  I think it should be in the hands of the user.  I mean, I guess so.  But it seems like it seems like Google's in a pretty good position to do that, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Excuse me while I kill an ant.  I'll be right back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I think I think Pichai really kind of touched on what I think is probably one of the biggest challenges for Google and product design, which is like Google wants to create products that anticipate your needs.  Maybe before you even know that you need them right to give you the answer before you ask.  But they want to do that without being prescriptive.  Right.  So this interviewer, which Jeff will speak to in a minute, you know, said, you know, are we are we all on our phones during dinner?  Like, is this a dinner time with our family?  Is this a good thing?  And Pichai was like, that's, you know, that's that's not a technology decision, right?  Like, that's a that's a human decision.  That's a parent, a parent's decision when kids are involved.  You know, but how do you you know, we all know sort of the power of defaults and the power of of the way like a great app works can can can really affect your behavior.  So it was interesting to hear him talk about being user centric.  And then this interview was just really, really pushing him in the in this direction of.  But is this you know, is this really making our lives better?  I think it's clear to particularly viewers of this show that it's a net positive.  I'm pretty optimistic about technology and I think probably most most people in our audience are maybe that's up for debate.  I don't I that's not for debate for me.  But it did feel like this interviewer was just digging, just digging for, you know, how we're all buried in our screens and not connecting with each other and our present anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was writing another story that appeared as a commentary and Sunday Review in the Times about applications and hardware that try to wean you off your phone dependency.  So he was looking for a quote from Sundar. I've been a reporter.  I teach it. I get what's going on here.  It's the it's the journalistic disease of saying, I wrote the whole story.  Now there's this little empty spot there, just perfect for a Sundar Pachai quote.  And I'm going to go and get that quote.  And so then you ask Sundar the question, basically, our phones kind of ruining our lives and our dinner.  And Sundar doesn't cooperate with him and says, well, no, I don't I don't think so.  I think that we're trying to give people what they want.  So what do you do as a reporter?  You ask the question again and again and again.  I count basically six times.  You essentially ask the same question.  And Sundar is of a rank.  He can't say, you know, kid, have you?  I'm not going to answer what I do.  What I do at some point when this happens to me and I go get it off, what happens and I see it happening.  I say, listen, you can ask the question as often as you like.  I'm not going to give you the answer you want.  So stop. But Sundar can't say that because otherwise he's going to sound like he's being pissy.  So the poor guy has to sit there and just wait and wait through it again and then find another way to say, no, I don't agree with you without saying, no, I don't agree with you.  And so he said, as Gina pointed out, he said, listen, is it the phone's decision?  Is it Google's decision what kids or parents should do during dinner?  That's for families to do.  Who wants Google in the middle of that?  No.  And he says, you're not asking a technology question.  We're here to tech technology.  The other problem I have is, and I know he's on the beat, but you have the chance to sit down with the second most powerful man at the most powerful company on earth.  And this is all you do is to say, aren't the things you're making really causing life to be awful?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what drives me nuts.  It's more of the it's the it's the techno panic is the beat.  And I just see more and more and more of this going on these days where publications that I respect are just buying right in to the contrarian view of technology that would wait a second.  No, isn't this bad?  Isn't this bad?  And OK, I get the point.  And maybe a discussion would be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But she's I really I really liked how he he kind of used himself as an example.  You know, it was the reporters asking, like, do you find in meetings that people are on their laptops or on their phones?  And he said, well, one thing that I've learned about myself is that I don't multitask.  Well, some people do, but I don't.  So I don't check email all day long.  I do email separately and distinct from the rest of my work.  And that's how I work.  Right. And I felt like, you know, if he was being pissy, as you said, Jeff, he would have been like, this is a matter of self-awareness, of figuring out who you are and what your priorities are.  And you check your email, you look at your phone, not as an impulse, but, you know, as a mindful decision, because it's the right thing to do at the moment.  Right. You know, if you're just about to get born, you check your phone.  If not, then you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A couple of great moments where Sundar said, well, you know what?  We had a dinner before I.O.  We usually try to put the phones in the basket.  But the one the one group that can't give up their phones is the PR people because you damn reporters keep calling them.  He said it nicer than that.  That was what it was.  My other favorite moment was the reporter says that I found this absurd.  Well, one way that I try to tame my own evil instincts with phones is I allow it to be in only one room in the house.  You know, I so I imagine that he got grandma's telephone, the old telephone table that sat in grandma's front room.  Yeah.  And that's where the that's where the phone was.  The little chair next to the phone and the wire into the wall next to the phone.  Hey, we invented new technology that lets you carry it anywhere.  Wow.  I'm going to put it back in one room with the string tied there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, but having said that, I suppose it still falls on the user in that case.  Right. If that works for you to curb your usage patterns, then I guess more power to you.  And what Sundar is definitely saying here is it's not really up to Google to make those decisions.  And it's right. It seemed like the interviewer was trying to get that was trying to get the like Google has a master plan for how you should use your device.  And and what's repeatedly said is, as you were saying, is that that's that doesn't lie in Google's responsibility.  That's that's up to an individual to make that type of decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm on my Android Wear watch today. I have in honor of back to the future day, I have a flux capacitor.  It even has a little time.  Oh, ribbon that says shield eyes from light.  And I think you can I think you can I think you could set it to travel through time.  That's all right. Yeah, it is back to the future day.  And we're so pleased to welcome Matt Cutts to the table.  Hey, are you still home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're still at home.  I am calling from Omaha this week.  What? Nebraska.  Is this for family?  That's where the inlaws are.  That's where the inlaws are located.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they have better connectivity than you do, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be ironic?  Very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, can we get Google Fiber in the Midwest just out of curiosity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we we were talking before the show about the new Nexus phones and I guess 5X and 6P went out for review to select reviewers across the country.  Our own Jason Howell got a review unit.  He's working on the 6P review for before you buy this week.  And I just thought I brought I brought in my old Nexus six just to kind of compare and contrast.  So the Nexus six is bigger, obviously six inch screen.  This is a five point seven inch screen.  But I think in many respects, I mean, this is a plastic bag.  Shamu, we loved you.  But I think the time has come to take a look at the next generation of Nexus and boy, I can't wait to hear your review, Jason.  But I'm just impressed as any previews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason, what are you thinking so far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm really, really liking the device.  No surprise.  I mean, the design of the device with kind of the aluminum body and everything just feels really nice.  It's heavy, but that's OK.  It gives a sense of quality.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't mind a little bit of weight because it makes me feel at least in my brain.  It makes me feel like it's got a solid build and it's not hollow and empty.  The bump, the camera bump at the top that everybody freaked out about not nearly as as pronounced as as you might fear, although it might still bug some people.  It's there.  It's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's ironic because you don't this whole right side is unnecessary.  The camera, the flash and the sensor on the left.  Really?  There's stuff over here.  They packed that full of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there might be antennas in there.  That's that's where pretty much all that all the antennas reside as well as the camera plastic bottom here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, there's other places where the plastic the antenna can leak out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But OK, yeah, they put it all up there in that little window.  Stereo speakers like that speakers sound great, especially compared to the Nexus 6.  My car stereo is broken right now.  So if I want to listen to anything, it's through the speakers on full blast.  So I've actually really noticed a difference between the two.  It's not something I normally spend a lot of time with and I have on this this time around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's play some music through here.  I do love front facing speakers.  I think those are.  Oh, it's going to add.  That's all right.  I'm going to turn it all the way up.  That's one thing that's changed.  Dun dun dun dun.  Skip.  Do you don't mind?  Little Wayne.  Little Wayne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you just start?  I'm feeling lucky or something.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds good.  I mean, it's not it's not super base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're not going to get base out of any of these speakers necessarily.  But.  Oh, wow.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm feeling unlucky now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fingerprint sensor is really, really nice.  I mean, it's so fast.  It's so fast.  The only problem with having it on the back is then that's enough.  Thank you.  Oh, trap queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that is that you can't use it on the, you know, on the front.  But big deal.  I mean, I don't think that's a big deal.  And you can also do the thing, which I always do, where if it's at a trusted location or  tied to a trusted Bluetooth device, doesn't lock at all.  So presumably if it's in your house, you can use it.  With all of those extra security features that you can activate in Lollipop and Marshmallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll what I've realized is I don't enter my pin anymore because the fingerprint  is sufficient and I don't always have to use my fingerprint because I've got all the other  things active.  Right.  So depends on how comfortable you feel.  I have it in my on the on the on the vent on the car because the ways is the way it  is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have it in my on the on the vent on the car because the ways is my is my means of  getting around.  And I just fear having to take it off.  I put my finger on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  Although your car's Bluetooth.  Yeah, exactly.  That's his trusted Bluetooth.  Oh, cars.  What?  Oh, never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  You don't have to have watch.  If it works with steam powered engines, it might be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But yeah, well, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sink it to your your watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then if it's near you, I've been waiting to get a car with Android.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  I can't get any straight answers out of Audi about when the heck it's coming.  No car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want so you'll probably put a case on it.  So slipperiness is not really a big issue.  I don't think.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I spent a day without the case and the whole time I was afraid.  Yeah, it feels really it feels very slick on the back here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I put that case on this more.  I think it was this morning and actually really like the case a lot.  But it makes me feel at least a little bit more comfortable that I'm not going to do  what I did to my Nexus six with this.  Is it one of the ones they sell?  Yeah.  Yeah, it is.  It's actually, you know, it was part of the review unit package is what's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is clearly says Nexus.  This is clearly a Google.  It's really nice.  Feels really nice.  How about storage?  Enough, you think?  This is a 64 gig phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, this one's the 16.  The review unit, I believe, is the 16.  So what is it 16?  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says 12.2 gigabytes used.  Oh, you.  Oh, so it's the 64.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so it's 32, 64 and 128.  You know, I mean, you don't have micro SD, so it depends on how much you're storing  on the device.  I think 64 is perfectly sufficient for me.  Absolutely.  But you have a 128 option if you really need to go big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Main thing I care about battery life.  Battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so here's where I have a disclaimer.  I was going to be reviewing this this week.  I'm not now because this device is faulty.  Actually, there was something going on yesterday where my battery was going really wacko.  When I reboot it, it gives me before the Google logo, it gives me this big red asterisk and  it says your device is corrupt.  That's the boot protection.  Yeah, exactly.  There's something weird going on with it.  I contacted Google PR.  They're sending me a replacement device, so my review is going to be next week.  I don't want to place any judgments on this device.  Like things like that.  I'm just going to say this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This way, this way, this way with one seven a.m.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You took it off just before seven a.m.  You still have 60 percent left.  They think you're going to get past midnight.  I think that's pretty reasonable.  That's all I would ask if I could just get through the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yesterday, I took it off at seven and by three, it was like 13 percent.  But that was again yours was wack wonky.  Yes, exactly.  That's what I mean.  I was like, okay, that doesn't sound right compared to what I've heard from people.  So I'm going to get a new unit and you've been using this one or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've been using that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is that that's decent slope.  That's I would say so.  And you know, it has the fast charge capability so you can charge it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I like type C. So Matt cuts is getting the six, not the five X.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I ordered the five X and now I'm like, maybe I'll order the six P and decide  whether which one or maybe, you know, maybe I'll just have a house phone, you know,  and then one for going out, you know, that's one way to solve the battery problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have my evening phone.  I think the battery life I've been hearing from reviews on the five X is not so hot.  OK. Yeah.  So I think you want and you know what this doesn't boy, especially compared to Shammo.  This doesn't feel that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you know, it's a little narrower, but it's a little taller.  And I think between the two, I think that's the better way to go.  The Nexus six just felt too unwieldy when you're doing one handed operation.  And the six P, I mean, that small change in narrowness actually makes a huge difference.  I can't wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is I think this is going to be my go to phone for a month.  And the camera for a month. Hey, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know you well. That's my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm in leaderboard. Yeah, it's true.  It's a month. Oh, my God. That's incredible.  Well, the I've been using the iPhone six plus, which I really like and battery life on that is amazing.  But if I can get through the day, that's all I need.  That's all I care about. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It feels really premium. Yeah, it really does.  It's nice. The screen is fantastic. It's a, you know, it's a it's a Samsung panel.  You know, the latest basically Samsung panel.  So right on par with what you get in the new five.  And yeah, everything pops. It's nice. Nice.  It feels fairly swift. But is this the replacement or is this?  No, this is this is still the faulty. So it's still maybe messed up.  So keep that in mind. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oops, can't capture this. So I got to do the lens blur thing.  All right. Slowly raise your device. Keep subject. All right.  Now I can change the focus to here or to there.  I don't know. I guess not. I think you've got a little it's still processing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Nice. Now we don't have the five X in studio, but Gina, do you have what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. So you went with the little one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I did. I went with the little one.  I've had this thing for three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So give us a full review. Top to bottom. We want no details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I love it so far.  Well, this is my first experience with the fingerprint sensor.  So, you know, unlocking the phone, that's one thing that's going to be nice.  But for me, it's a last pass. Yeah.  I am always typing in my super long last pass password, just being able to tap my fingerprint.  Oh, so much better.  I also had the first time for the first time experienced the thing where you like take your old phone  and you tap it to your new phone and it's just like bloop and it just sets up your new phone with everything.  That is amazing. Have you guys done that? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's actually it's actually one of the winning features of Android, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And something you don't get with the OnePlus, too, because they left out NFC. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Yeah, that was really that was really, really nice.  I have had weightier phones.  This is feels kind of light and plasticky to me.  And I'm kind of like, it is really light. Yeah.  It's like the car door thing, right.  They try to like add weight to car doors because people perceive that the car is a higher quality.  The door is a little heavy and it has that like chunk when you close it.  Same deal with phones for me.  So it feels a little bit flimsy because I'm just used to a giant phone, but I'm really happy to have a one handed device.  And I don't know, I'm interested to see how how battery life is.  Like I said, I just charged it.  It arrived today and I just started a couple of hours ago.  I'm still kind of finding my way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm playing with the blur thing.  So I'm making that in focus now.  I'm going to make this in focus.  It's pretty fast.  I feel like this is because that's a that's built into that's in the camera.  It's in the camera. It's one of the camera settings.  So the camera is very simple, but I like that.  I don't mind that.  You get you get a timer, you get an HDR.  It's an auto by default.  You get flash.  You get a menu here that gives you photos for your panorama lens blur.  You get a larger setting, but it's a very simple camera with video choices.  UHD 4K HD 1080p HD 720p.  And you can also do slow mo, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. I haven't tested that yet, actually.  I forgot about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stabilization built in.  This is nice.  Nice. I like the way you get to video on this, by the way.  You just swipe it a swipe right, right?  Yep. Left, left to right or the other way to switch modes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I heard one complaint was that with a double tap of the power button to turn on the camera.  Yeah, that's kind of weird, isn't it?  Because it locks it and then it opens it up in camera.  But now you've locked the phone.  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's see.  Actually, I can't tell because this phone doesn't have a lock.  I mean, you're in camera. What more do you want?  And with a fingerprint reader, it unlocks pretty darn quick.  Yeah.  I wouldn't worry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh yeah, then it is locked again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lack of OIS is an issue, but...  Yeah, I would agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Google had explained they had a Reddit AMA a few weeks back.  And they had explained that basically the larger, you know, the larger pixel size helps to improve that.  That's what HTC said with the M with the one, right?  Yeah, I just feel like no matter what you get more stable images with OIS.  So that is a loss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I did order a new SIM because if you're a Google Fi user, you have to get the new SIM to use with the new phones.  Really?  Yeah. They warned me about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you want to, I think if you stay with the Nexus 6, you're fine.  But if you want to go with the 6P or the 5X, then they'd like you to have a new SIM.  Are these your pictures, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is a slo-mo of a hummingbird shot with the 6P.  Is this yours?  No, this is not mine.  This was a demo footage released before the devices hit anyone's hands.  Isn't that cool?  That is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy moly.  So Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, let's kick it off.  We're going to have to talk about Alphabet at some point.  Let's start the show with Alphabet.  ABC, XYZ, that's the page because Google forgot to get Alphabet.com.  Or they didn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Or it's BBC.WTF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's one question.  Will anybody ever go to Alphabet.com because it isn't really a destination.  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My question, my related question is, will there be Alphabet swag?  Because I want it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we'll let you kick things off, Jeff, because you wrote a good piece at BuzzMachine.com.  I know you've been thinking hard about this.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, the second day we've seen lots of people trying to find some cynical motive,  which I find ridiculous because Larry Page is I think the least cynical CEO I can imagine.  I think it is what they say it is.  This allows Larry Page and Sergey Brin to rise up to the strategic stratosphere.  It allows them to do crazy things without affecting directly the business of Google,  apart from taking Google's revenue to pay for it.  It provides more transparency to Wall Street about what's being spent on one.  We'll see how exactly that plays itself out.  It allows them to put Sundar Pichai, who's done brilliant work in full charge of the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And the many Sundar Pichais, there are many people that can be more easily retained through this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Look at NASK, look at other places.  And the thing about it is, but the anecdote I told is, and I don't know if I told this on the show before,  but I think I did.  When I met Larry at I.O. by way of introduction, I said, I'm the guy who wrote the book, What Would Google Do?  And he said, Oh, yes, I remember.  And then he said, What would Google do?  I want to know. Tell me what.  And so it makes a punch line to this story.  But I think that the point is, is that Larry Page doesn't know what Google will do.  That's exactly the point is that is that even he will be surprised.  They're looking for big problems and big solutions and moonshots and all that kind of stuff.  And there's been efforts also to make analogs here to call this Berkshire Hathaway.  But that's not it's not even close.  It's brilliant as Buffett is.  He doesn't invent things.  I'll call it close to the old AT&T Bell Labs, but it's not that either.  That was pure science, pure research.  Amazing things happened because there was that freedom to do that and the monopoly to support it.  But I think that in this case, this is about invention and entrepreneurship and its purest form and the ability to to go and try big things.  And that's why I'm delighted with this.  The final point to make is the question about what this impact this will have on dear old Europe and its regulators from the from the old world.  And one argument says that this will make it better because part of the problem Google gets into is when it shares stuff across divisions.  But the truth is that everything we've gotten in trouble for sharing across is still in Google Inc.  And I'm afraid that I guarantee you will see just saw the cover of their spiegel a few months ago about the world government of Silicon Valley.  This will probably I guarantee you it'll get it'll get cited as see Larry Page wants to take over the world and do all these huge things.  Yeah, he does.  And they're good for it.  That's what we should be supporting.  That's what capitalism is for.  So I don't think Europe's problems will go away at all for this.  I don't think there's some gigantic secret agenda to this.  I think it's what it appears to be, which is freedom to innovate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You take the post that Larry put at ABC.  XYZ at face value.  It's exactly as he said it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't see because because why else do this?  Right.  You know, there's a lot of efforts to say it's funny how many posts if you look, I just wrote a I just started a new column minutes ago for the Observer in New York on media.  And I wrote about all how we all write the same story over and over and over again and how I hate that.  Yeah.  How many blue moon stories we have?  Well, in this case, how many times do I see the headline?  Why Google did this?  As if everybody knows exactly why Google did this.  Well, Google said why Google did this.  And you can believe them or not.  But yeah, I think, you know, if listen, if Comcast did something like this, Verizon did something like this, if companies like that did something, would I be cynical or at least skeptical?  Better put of their motives.  Yeah.  But I don't think we've had the cause to be skeptical and cynical about Larry Page.  I think that he's trying to do good things and make good products and, yeah, make a lot of money along the way.  And so far, that's what he's done.  And the crazy stuff that mean who else?  Who else would have the audacity to say, let's save thousands of lives on the roads by embedding self-driving cars and the entrepreneurial vision and technological vision to make it into a business?  That's the kind of audacity that made this country great.  Damn it.  Not Donald Trump's hat.  And and that's what we want to encourage.  You agree, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, I mean, sure.  I mean, I, I don't see any ulterior motive.  I don't see the, you know, I don't see it being some vast evil plan.  But I must admit, I do wonder whether there are a bunch of different motives.  I mean, obviously, freeing Larry and Sergey up to do whatever they want is one of those motives to get them away from the sort of humdrum day to day Google, which which turns out all the cash, but but has become quite boring.  But I wonder if some of it isn't a little bit of not slight of hand, but a little bit of a shell game to try and keep the regulators eyes off what, you know, is happening with Google or to keep Google part of this.  How does that happen, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'd have to be pretty dumb to be fooled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's alphabet.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Matthew, you're talking about you trying to figure it out.  Play it through for me about how this puts fences around things in a way that I'm not asking this in a hostile way.  I'm curious to try to figure out that obviously that's a factor in what Google does right now is to try to have that.  So they don't want anything that's going to make it worse.  How do you think it could make it better for the regulation question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't think it necessarily puts fences around things.  But when you think about the public entity, you know, the traded one, the one that has to report its results is going to be alphabet now, not Google.  So to some extent, and I'm not saying they're going to confuse things deliberately or in an illegal way, or I'm just saying it takes the focus off Google to some extent and puts it on this other thing called alphabet, which is going to have multiple different things doing multiple different, you know,  businesses and markets and business models.  And there's going to be things flowing back and forth, none of which alphabet will have to talk about it if it doesn't want to.  It won't have to report anything that those underlying operating subsidiaries do if it doesn't want to.  Right. Including Google. So Google was the reporting entity before.  Do you see what I mean? Whereas now Alphabet's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, but when it comes to the activities of, let's say, privacy, you know, my contention is that Google is a personal services company.  And as a result, it needs to know me as a person and serve me across all divisions.  So it serves me still across the browser and Android and Gmail and Docs and so on and so forth and maps and ways and so on and so forth.  So all that's where they've gotten in trouble lately in the one sense.  The other way they've gotten in trouble, that's other privacy.  The other way they've gotten in trouble in Europe in the current antitrust is they promote their own products.  Well, they're still going to promote maps within Chrome and within search.  And it doesn't matter whether they promote self-driving cars and say that or not.  Fine. They'll buy ads for that, whatever that'll make a corporate exchange.  So I think the areas where they've gotten in trouble in Europe, and let's be clear that's mainly in Europe,  is still the case within Google and it's not about financial reporting.  It's about behavior is what they'd say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But I am. But I'm also thinking they're probably thinking about the future.  They're not just thinking about the things they've gotten into trouble for already.  In fact, many of those things are have become irrelevant or are becoming irrelevant.  I think they're thinking about what they may do in the future, which includes acquiring other companies, Twitter, whatever else, you know.  And they will become presumably operating units of Alphabet.  And then they can do whatever they want within those operating units.  You know what I mean? They can they can not not I'm not just talking about the sort of public facing promotional aspect that they've gotten into trouble for.  I'm talking about the actual structural aspect of the company itself and the things it owns and the things that those businesses do between each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, I was on Bloomberg about this yesterday and the other guy who was on the show said that the price jump that came from this announcement itself was just enough to buy Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It was. Yeah.  The market loves it. Yeah.  It went up five percent in an hour. That's enough to buy Twitter. That's twenty billion dollars.  Yeah. And which is odd in a way, because, you know, Wall Street typically hates holding companies.  It hates giant things that you can't make sense of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The argument is there'll be more transparency here because they'll have to report results for these other divisions.  Will there? Yeah, they won't.  But you're saying it's the same. They'll be expected to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, they've said they will. They don't have to.  In fact, they could say, hey, Alphabet's doing great. Here's all our operating units. Google made this much. Thanks for stopping by.  Yeah, they could. They don't provide it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? Is that the case? I mean, isn't it? Isn't the so the Google stock is being transferred to Alphabet stock.  So if you're a stockholder, don't they have the same responsibility now to report Alphabet results that they had for Google results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, the point Matthew's point is exactly right.  They don't have to say just as Google never had to say exactly what YouTube was making or not.  They could say Alphabet as a whole. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  That's all they have to report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the arguments I've heard all around is there'll be more transparency rather than less. That there will indeed be transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  There could be. And it also, I mean, one of the benefits I can see is this structure makes it a lot easier to say in the future,  spin off or spin out part of YouTube, for example, spin off or spin out part of Nest.  Take that. Which is a danger, don't you think, Matthew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If Europe starts to think about about saying, let's break up Google because it's too big, which we hear all the time.  Then then then does this beg that question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike, you haven't had a chance to weigh in. Let's let Mike tell us what he thinks.  And then I'm going to tell you how you're all wrong. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, first of all, first of all, this is a groundbreaking move because I think I believe that Alphabet right now has three employees and their valuation is Larry, Sergey and and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yeah, and Dave, Dave Drummond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think maybe it's five or six, even if it's ten billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But they have all the valuation of all the companies.  And so from a valuation per employee or an employee, it's very high.  It's very high. So and that's a completely irrelevant point, but interesting nonetheless.  I think there are other reasons that make that I agree with both of you, actually.  I think that this makes a ton of sense. I don't think there's reason for cynicism.  And there are reasons they didn't mention.  I think one of these, for example, is, for example, when they bought Nest, they told Tony Fidel we would keep it independent, like a completely separate company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's been a little bit of a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's a challenge because you have a CEO under a CEO.  Exactly. And also there are other divisions within Google who would like that status.  But just because they weren't acquired under the same circumstances.  And so this sort of normalizes all this.  But I think one of the least appreciated benefits of this is the timeline issue.  If you compare like two extreme examples like Nest and Calico, OK, Nest is selling products right now.  They have two point three point products right now.  They are actively shipping and developing new products. It's a going concern.  Calico is like in the year 3000, we will alleviate death.  And so the timelines of those two enterprises are so out of whack with each other that each of these organizations seems to be based on timeline to a very large extent.  What is the timeline that these initiatives and projects and products are going to come online and be developed?  And so I think that's a very liberating fact.  And we talked about Google's gigantism.  Jeff mentioned it.  But this is a company that not only doesn't know how big things are going to be, they want things to be as big as they can possibly be.  And every container I've been farm sitting this week.  I've been taking care of somebody's farm.  Imagine a farm then.  So let's say you have chickens and you have cows and you have goats and pigs and everything and they're all in the same cage.  That's one thing.  If you right size all the cages, then you have a much healthier ecosystem.  All the animals can be free to do what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sunder Pachar was about to pick Ruth Porat's eyes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yes, I am.  And it was really getting bad.  We're going to have to slaughter one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But at your point, but I think you like your point about the CEOs, but those operating units having CEOs is a big one that a bunch of people have made that it makes it easier to retain people.  It makes it easier to offer people things because they're going to be a CEO of an actual operating subsidiary, not just a part of Google, you know, the thing that makes all the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And I think that's a bigger problem that people appreciate.  It's not just CEOs.  It's CFOs.  It's it's all right now.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But eventually, I presume though, it will be the division will have its own C levels.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And it's and they have been bleeding employees over the last year or so.  Google has been losing.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd rather be the CFO of Calico than a low level employee at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They're they're basically saying, you know, they're, you know, they're implying that if you want to do a startup, don't leave Google and start a startup, start a new company under Alphabet and and will retain the talent.  So and I think it's brilliant all the way around.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  One thing I wondered about, which I which I wrote about, I'd like to get your guys thoughts.  Why didn't why didn't YouTube become a separate subsidiary like Nes?  I mean, it's because they don't want to report you to YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  YouTube from from a business perspective, YouTube very much belongs with Google because absolutely because it's an algorithmically based advertising business.  Exactly.  The signals are harvested and from YouTube and signals from search and other places are used in YouTube to provide relevant results and stuff.  It's all about the algorithms and the advertising.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I absolutely agree.  I think you can make just as strong an argument that it should be its own thing.  I mean, it wants to become much more than just the search engine.  It wants to become much more, I think, than just that.  Well, it's free to do that within.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, isn't the regulatory issue that Google faces most strongly the issue of promoting its own properties in search?  One of the issues, I mean, from my point of view, I'd love to see Google get I've said this many times, get out of the content business.  Why not spin off YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I have this argument regularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not really in the content businesses in the content serving business.  It doesn't own the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wants to be in the content business, though, doesn't it?  It wants to be in the content business.  It knows what the conflict is.  I totally agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It wants to be in any business can be generated with algorithms.  But the weird thing, the reason people are concerned, you know, it's not crazy to think that YouTube would have been spun out as a separate company because it was already a subsidiary.  It already has a CEO.  Right.  You know, so it is surprising in that sense.  I think I think you guys are overthinking this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what I think this is all about.  We're professionals, Leo.  This is what we usually under think.  Here's what I think this is all about.  And I do believe them when they say this has been something.  The story is that Salman Kamengar came to the board years ago, like several years ago, and said, you know, you guys should think about this.  And then they've been chewing on it.  And something like this doesn't happen overnight.  It's probably been in the works for a year or so.  But here's what I really think is happening.  I think what really happened is that Larry wants to give wants to step down, wants Sundar Pichai to be CEO.  And because I think Larry's tired and he even kind of implies is tired of taking meetings about search and ads.  Yeah, he didn't want to go to those meetings anymore.  But he knows it would be a big hit if he said, I am this I'm going to become executive chair.  And because truthfully, then this is my question.  Couldn't you do everything they've done without this?  This compartment.  You totally could.  This is just what this is a reorg.  Many, many companies have done this.  Google themselves have done this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Larry is too big for the normal route.  The normal route is you become a VC.  I think this is hand waving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is all saying, pay no attention to the fact that I'm going to step down and Sundar is going to be the CEO.  I think you're right.  You're right in the tactical view, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But in the strategic view, I think they're also trying to build a company for the ages.  And if Larry gets a great proverbial boss.  I'm not saying that there aren't subsidiary benefits.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're absolutely subsidiary benefits.  They're also subsidiary negatives.  Risks.  Risks because they've said specifically they're going to provide Q4 reports for every segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this makes Larry, as somebody said, a capital allocator.  That's really his job.  And that's what he says his job will be.  So to your point, he is a VC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We will rigorously.  This is the salient paragraph.  Alphabet is about businesses prospering through strong leaders and independence.  In general, our model is to have a strong CEO who runs each business with Sergey and me in service to them as needed.  That means not running it.  I mean, service means, oh, you got to you.  You need some money.  Let me get the checkbook out.  He will rigorously handle capital allocation, rigorously handle capital allocation.  That term rigorously is interesting.  Sounds painful.  And work to make sure each business is executing well.  We'll also make sure we have a great CEO for each business and we'll determine their compensation.  In addition, with this new structure, and this is interesting that you pointed out, this doesn't have to be done, but they've said with this new structure, we plan to implement segment reporting for our Q4 results.  Google financials have been provided separately than those for the rest of the alphabet businesses as a whole.  They don't have to do that.  Sounds to me like there may be this will facilitate spin outs by doing spin offs by doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  When you say risks, Leo, when you say risks, think about this.  So now you have Larry and Sergey sitting there with a big pile of money that Google has produced on the jet.  That's still the growth engine.  And and they've got all these CEOs.  They're no longer VPs of such and such a unit.  They're now CEOs of operating subsidiaries who have to come and say, I want X percent of Google's money to do this.  And then Larry and Sergey have to slice up the dough and hand it out to those CEOs.  It could actually create a lot more problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right, but here's the real risk is that is that I don't think we will be past the idea that Larry is a one hit wonder.  But let's just say that his hits are behind him.  Just just for the sake of argument here.  Then you're right.  Is he 43?  I don't know.  I'm just saying he has no great idea.  If you were in the NBA, maybe.  OK, go ahead.  I believe fully that Larry Page doesn't matter.  He's going to live forever.  It's let me be clear.  He has many more huge incentive.  I'm just trying to say structurally.  But then then Matthew's point is right.  Then all you're doing is divvying up Google's money for the future.  But the other pressure on Google, which has been tremendous, is to diversify.  And that's a key part of this is 96 to 98 percent of their revenue is advertising.  So by taking Alphabet and by getting into new businesses, which may take a while to grow, but new businesses that are not ad supported purely.  Then that diversifies the corporation as a whole.  And that's been another huge pressure on them.  But it only works if they create new businesses.  And that's highly risky, like all entrepreneurial ventures are.  And that's where they really are.  So they're going to allocate capital.  But unlike just a Warren Buffett, they're not going to just buy things.  They're going to build new things and build entirely new industries.  High risk.  I return.  I growth.  So so I think that's that's the audacious goal.  Then the divvying up of Google's money shouldn't be an issue because there should be lots more money to be made by all these other divisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  In the meantime, in the meantime, instead of having operating VPs of this and that, they have a bunch of CEOs who are all now who all now think I'm the CEO of this damn thing.  I don't have to, you know, I should be running X company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My guess is that if they're going to get good CEOs, they're going to let them do what they want.  They're going to give them total autonomy.  Right.  And if they make money, then they'll have it'll be known as it's it's serfdom.  It is it's a feudal system.  It's a feudal system.  And he's the lord of the manner.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's listen, that's guys.  That's I've worked in many companies where newspaper chains where you had 20 newspapers each had a CEO.  But you know what they did every month?  They give a bag of money to HQ.  Right.  HQ decided what to do with that.  That's quite normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, good.  That's what's going to happen.  And will Larry have to go to meetings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Only if he wants to.  Only if it's on the jet.  Oh, Leo meetings come to Larry.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So my point, do you do you do not think that this is retirement for Larry Page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, because I think that I think retirement from the day to day from Google.  I think it's I think it's Larry returning to his youth to build the new Google.  Yeah.  It's a promotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Retirement means you get to do what you want.  If you want to putter in the garden, you get to putter in the garden.  Yeah, but he's going to have higher goals than that.  He's going to build.  Of course he is.  But it's to me it was it was I mean, if I'm Larry Page, I'm sitting here.  I'm going, God, I have to take another meeting on what color the home page banner should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or your regulators up our ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Sundar, could you take this call for me?  He doesn't want to run it day to day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  But who's going to referee between all those CEOs?  Who's going to decide where that Google money goes?  Ruth Korat.  He's very clear.  They are the allocators.  That's Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  George Bush is the decider.  Larry is the allocator.  Isn't though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's Sergey's role in all of this?  What's his role now?  Project X. Big ideas.  See, Sergey, in my opinion, Sergey did this a few years ago.  Yeah.  And Larry's looking at Sergey going, man, he's got this Project X.  He's having fun.  He's zooming around.  Doesn't wear shoes.  Rocket ships.  And me, I'm sitting in the meeting about what color the Google banner is.  Can we pay for his flood?  So he's I bet you he's you know, he's going to watch his philanthropy, see what happens with his philanthropy.  He's got a foundation.  Watch what happens with Project X plus one.  The Larry Page version.  I think this and but what would have happened if if instead of this Google went through some sort of reorg and Larry said, I'm now I'm going to be the go join the board and Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google.  How would the market have reacted to that?  Now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I agree.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why don't I take twit and spin off?  Operating unit.  Actually, it is not an unheard of thing.  For instance, if we're considering and we have been considering buying a building, you wouldn't buy it as twit.  You would buy it as a separate operating division.  You create a new LLC and then why do you do that?  And then you rent another company.  You rent back to twit.  I see.  Right.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You could you could get the URL ABCBFD.  And it's the great building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The building would be owned by a numbered company listed in the Cayman.  I'm typically this is this is not unusual at all in business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, Lisa's prior job, which was working for a massive development company, every development they did was a separate LLC.  At one point, she was managing well over 100 LLCs.  So so that's very it's not a bad way to do things because it does kind of separate the structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Come to think of it, that's how Trump runs his business.  That's right.  Everybody else is a loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're all stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The reason why people kept thinking of Berkshire Hathaway is that Berkshire Hathaway started with the thing that makes the money.  Right.  And so there's this core business that just spins off vast amounts of cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's very different, right?  It's just a holding company, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Right. But so Warren invests that cash in other things.  He doesn't build things.  He doesn't not trying to cure cancer.  You know, he just buys a bit of like Coca-Cola and a bit of Dairy Queen and a bit of whatever.  But it's it's a similar strategy.  You have a money spewing thing at the core and then that he gets stalled out to different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been great to watch everybody from Danny Sullivan to you, Matthew, to you, Jeff, kind of try to piece tease out the meaning in all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  My favorite was when it first happened, when the when the announcement first came out, I happened to be looking at Twitter.  And of course, and because my eyes were happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Happened. Yeah.  Or is it just something you do all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The first was the first things I saw were literally WTF with a bunch of exclamation marks.  Just people as the first response was, what the hell is going on?  What does this even mean?  What? I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was my reaction.  We were on the air when we got the word we were doing iOS today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  My first reaction was that it was a joke or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I got a reporter coming to me saying, I presume you've heard this.  We want to talk to you about about this.  I thought, what?  And I was driving.  So I literally pulled off the road to go look at this.  It's too big to just ignore and get to it.  Ten minutes.  See how much we need self-driving cars, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You could have just kept going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.
