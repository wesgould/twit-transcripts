Hey, Stacey is going to be on a Ask Me Anything this Friday. We've been doing these. This is our  third one. It's kind of fun. Just a way to get together on Fridays. I won't be part of this one  because I did the last two. But this week is Florence Ion from All About Android, Renee Richie  from MacBreak Weekly, Paul Therotte from Windows Weekly, and our very own Stacey Higginbotham.  1130 a.m. Pacific Friday, April 3rd. You can join us. Ask Me Anything. The stream is at twit.tv  slash live. You can ask on Twitter. You can ask in our chat room. Stacey, you're going to have a lot  of fun. It's really fun. Relaxed. Couple hours talking about, you know, whatever. And then I  think next week we're going to start doing game night. We're working on the details of that. We'll  probably move the AMA from 1130. Well, we might still do it, but we're going to do game night,  I think, 5 to 7 p.m. Pacific. That'll be 8 to 10 p.m. Eastern starting a week from Friday. That's  going to be a lot of fun. I am definitely playing in that one. It's time for Twig this week in  Google, or as somebody said, we should call it Google Gaga, the show where we cover everything  having to do with Google, Facebook, Twitter, the Mediaverse, all of the verses. Stacey Higginbotham  is here. Stacey on iot.com. She does the iot podcast with Kevin Toffle. We love having you on.  You look chilly. You look chilly. You're wearing down. Oh, it was super cold today. Yeah. I mean,  it's like 36 degrees. It hailed yesterday. Spring has been interesting. Locusts are coming next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes. My daughter is very upset about the locusts, Jeff. There are locusts? In Africa. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but they had them in the, didn't they have a grasshopper infestation in Las Vegas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they did. There were locusts. There were those goats taking over a Welsh town. Have you  seen that video? No. Oh, it's the greatest. A whole herd of goats just took over the town  every night. They're there and they're just eating the bushes and having a high all the time because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's nobody to bother them. So it's related to the coronavirus. Yeah. Yeah. There's nobody on the  streets. That's Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at CUNY. A goat, an old goat. And an old goat with me.  He is of course at buzzmachine.com. He's also at the City University of New York, the town night.  Craig Newmark School for Entrepreneurial Journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First, first, how are you guys doing? How are you doing? Good. That's good. I think we should

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  start a show like that. How are you doing, Stacey? I'm, you know, I chant, Jason Howell was so helpful

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  when I was anxious. So you already know this is going to be bad because I'm like, bring it anxious.  But today I woke up and I was feeling pretty anxious and I'm chanting Jason Howell's  anxiety is a wave. You just got to ride it. So I am a little down today, but I am glad to be here  with y'all. And I, someone actually said that they found the show helpful and they sent me a DM telling  me that. So for that person, I'm like, Hey, I might be doing something good. So, you know, that actually  got me out of, not got me out of bed this morning, but it makes me feel good sitting here. So I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  both your shows, I think podcasts in particular right now are, I think valuable because we're the  people, if you've been listening to our shows who've been with you all along and now we're all in it  together. And I think that that's, that's certainly my goal. Jeff, how are you? How are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of melted yesterday. I wrote about this last night. I think the nine, it was, it was 9 11  19 is the name of the post, you know, COVID-19 9 11. And it, it, it, the death toll passing 9 11  just kind of brought back the PTSD of that. Well, and you're in New York, you're, you're, you're,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you're in New Jersey in your home, but you work in time. Yeah. And it hurts to see my city brought  down again. And to see the pictures of, and it's on the 9 11 site, the whale, the whale terminal, the,  the train station that you go into, right? When you come into town, empty was, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wow. I mean, just empty. Yeah. I almost want to drive into the city just to drive around,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but I think that would probably depress me. That'll make you set like, that'll make you sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll feel like a Charlton Heston planet of the apes movie. Like you damn dirty apes, you did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But of course we did it. We did it. It won't be totally empty because there are still people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  running around and then you'll get angry. Yeah. Yes. That's true. I asked Mary Jo because she  should meditate and stay home. Mary Jo Foley has an apartment. It's roughly midtown, I think. And  I said, do you walk around? Cause I'm fascinated by the, the pictures of the empty empty streets  in Manhattan. I thought it'd be kind of cool to walk around. She said, you can't really  walk around with it and preserve social distancing. There's still too many people  out in the streets and the sidewalks themselves, you know, you're not going to walk in the middle  of the street. It's not that deserted. If you could walk down the middle of the street, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other thing I heard- A friend of mine lives on the Upper East Side and said that he just put on  Facebook, pro talk for walking the dog, go the wrong way on a one way street, the middle of the  street. Cause there's hardly any cars. Then you can get out of the way. Right. So people are trying  to figure out how to do this. Right. So how are you boss? Oh, I'm, you know, my,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the funny thing is my routine is pretty much the same as it was before. We're doing this out of a  little bit different studio, but I'm still, I, I'm glad I, I can't, I decided to come to work,  A, because I do better psychologically if I'm out of the house, poor Lisa is in the house and it's  really hard for her. She's just sitting at the kitchen table all day. Working too. Working. And  so one of the reasons I come here is to get out of her hair. And then, but also by coming in,  I eliminate the need for another technical director. So we're trying to keep the staff  requirements as low as possible. And because I'm working in my own office, nobody else here,  and I'm switching myself, I feel, I feel relatively safe. It's psychologically difficult,  but not, I don't, I don't feel like I've been too challenged yet. I'm worried as this goes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have at least another once. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. At least Cuomo said today that we'll hit  the peak in the model. Most of the average of the models at the end, the peak. So it means we still  got a long way to go down from there at the end of April in New York and it's going to hit other  parts of the country later. Do you think that San Francisco really did? Yeah. I think, and again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, it's hard to tell cause we don't test, but, uh, that Kinsa thermometer that I showed you,  the internet connected thermometer, and there are millions of them out there.  You can look at a county by county breakdown and they're not measuring COVID. That's one of the  benefits of this. They're merely measuring temperatures, but they have what is considered  normal this time of year based on flu and other infections. And they have what's a, for a while,  San Francisco is trending just above normal. And then you can see where shelter in place started  and it is now well below normal in terms of the, of, cause they're so damn chill in San  Francisco. Well, no, but just cause there's no, you're not also not getting the flu. You're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  getting other illnesses. Yeah. You're just, when you're home, you're home. I will say. So I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that that's happened in the, in this area, although our, our cases and numbers are going up, but we're,  our numbers, you know, Sonoma County where we are, it's like 44 people have it one death. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's very small numbers. Go ahead, Stacey. No, I was going to say Seattle seems to be,  we social distanced earlier and apparently we're never social to begin with. So we're doing,  I am, I'm gratified that our numbers seem to be,  our increase in numbers seem to be leveling off. So you were, you were the first hotspot.  You were, but man, New York is, I think if you, a lot, Jeff, I'm, I'm very concerned for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I saw a map today that was interesting that, that, and there's many interpretations,  but if you look at the, at the spots in New York city by zip code, one theory is that it's people  who have to, to travel the farthest way on the subway. Another theory is that it's the lower  income spots, but you can see where the Queens is the, is the hotspot on the hotspot. And,  uh, you know, the, the, the big fear here is, is how dispro, I'm, I'm so lucky as hell. I'm out here  in the burbs. I got, you know, grass and trees around me. That's what I'm sorry. So I've got,  I've got social distancing, um, thanks to nature around me. I'm very lucky. I'm, I'm fortunate,  but, but people in New York who have to go to work still. Um, yeah, it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The, I think some of us think, oh, well, how am I doing? And because my situation like mine,  and really kind of yours too, cause we're all, you know, we kind of work at home, isn't so different  yours, maybe Jeff, cause you don't go into class, but, um, there's more to it than that. And I think  this is what's going to start to hit us. It's what's happening in New York as we see those  images and we see those numbers. And there was an article in the Harvard business review. I've not  referred to it before. You've probably seen it, uh, by Scott Baronado, uh, that discomfort you're  feeling is grief. And, um, yeah, he, he, they talked to a guy named David Kessler who is the  world's, they say foremost expert on grief, co-wrote a book with Elizabeth Kubler Ross on grief and  grieving. Um, and he is his, his latest book adds, you know, the stage, the five stages that Kubler  Ross talked about of grief. He had a fifth, a sixth stage, which is finding meaning. Um, and I  have to say, having gone through something very slightly similar in San Francisco in the eighties  with the AIDS epidemic, that was one thing that, uh, AIDS activists told me was that it was also  as horrible as it was, um, um, there was meaning at the end of it and that there was learning at  the end of it and that the community, uh, going through that suffering got something out of it.  The Kessler has founded a site called grief.com and in the interview he said, we're all,  we're feeling grief and some of his anticipatory grief as, as a, as a country and even as a world  about what's happening about the people who are dying, about the illnesses that are happening.  And that resonated with me. I don't know if that's how you guys feel too, but that, that kind of  explained why I have this kind of lump in my stomach all the time. It's, it's, whoa. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's, I think that was, I was complaining earlier about having my chest be constantly tight. And I  think part of that is I just constantly feel like I'm about to cry. Yeah. Yeah. But I can't quite  cry because it doesn't, it doesn't feel, it's a whole, it's a whole bunch of what I, what I wrote

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  last night is I just realized this is nine 11 in slow motion. Yeah. And worse, you were at nine 11,  you were in it. I was there and I made decisions, some bad like staying there. Um, and now I feel  like, you know, if I've gone a few feet one way or the other, I wouldn't be here now. Yeah. Um,  as the tower came down, you have PTSD and you have a severe, well, I actually got, I got diagnosed  with it recently at Bellevue of all places. Um, and, uh, but it was, it was attenuated,  but now I, now I know what's happening. It's coming back. And I, you know, every decision you  make, you, you touch that door knob, you, you go to that grocery store, you take in the mail and  don't wash your hands, which I got in trouble for yesterday, you know, Oh God, I just did it. Um,  and it's not just me, it's my family and my community. And, and so that's, that's with us  constantly. There's a responsibility, uh, and uncertainty, a powerlessness. Um,  and, and do you report a meeting Leo? I think that one thing, you know, we can get things out  of this. If we try, we can get caring for our healthcare system. We can get caring for communities  that aren't being cared for. We can figure out how to be better connected with the world and share

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  more, or we'll screw it up. We'll see. We have, you know, as a society gone through the stages  of grief, there was denial in January, February, there was a lot of denial. Uh, there was anger.  There still is for a lot of people anger at the government for not acting fast enough or anger  at authorities for saying, you're making me stay home. I don't want to stay home. There's bargaining  like, Hey, if I do this for two weeks, can I go out next week? There's a sadness,  there's acceptance, there's meaning. He also talks about those are the traditional stages,  the Kubler-Ross stages of grief, but he also talks about anticipatory grief, which is more  like the anxiety that you were feeling. Stacy are, he says, our minds begin to show us images. My  parents getting sick. We see the worst scenarios. That's our minds being protective. Our goal is  not to ignore those images. Don't try to make them go away. Your mind won't let you do that.  It's painful to try to force it. The goal is to find balance in the things you're thinking.  If you think, if you feel the worst image taking shape, make yourself think of the best image.  And I think that's why it's nice to think that maybe, maybe our society will come through this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  wiser, maybe even more equitable. Um, I think we should be starting to talk. And Kevin and I,  we introduced a segment on our show. So this, this said tomorrow show will be the second one  where we talk about what we want the world to look like. Perfect. So the first one,  oh, now I don't even remember. Oh, we talked about privacy and medical devices. The second one,  we talked about broadband. Next time I'm going to talk about electrification, but we do have,  and especially with the administration talking now about it, sure investment, we do have a chance to  build maybe not a new world. I mean the old world, but that things are going to change.  And I think it's really important for us not just to say it's going to change and, you know,  it could be awesome. We need to start taking tech like the steps we need to articulate what we want  that look like and try to find concrete actions to take for that. So yeah, that might be something  as simple as saying, you know, writing to your Congressman about the importance of  taking the FCC's e-rate program and making that, using that to run broadband access to people in  rural areas. Or it could be something as difficult as trying to electrify your entire home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's so many options. Yeah, it's, yeah, I think that's a good way to handle it is  I'm really pleased that you're doing that. I have to start listening to that segment because  that's a really good way to think about it is, well, here's the opportunity.  I should probably write these down. Yeah, yeah, it'd be great.  I have one thing I wish, no more April Fool's jokes ever again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amen. I screamed this morning and said, don't you dare today. Don't you dare pull that crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you could make a case on the one hand, maybe we all need a little levity, a little laugh,  but there's nothing funny about April Fool's jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, I will tell you, and this is not technically an April Fool's joke, but I tweeted this out.  Let's see what, if I can find it, you know, Janelle, oh, what's her name?  I'm going to come up with it. Ah, Janelle Shane. So at Janelle C. Shane on Twitter,  she did, I use the neural net GPT two to generate some April Fool's pranks.  Oh. And it is quite delightful.  So here, let me, what's the Twitter handle? Could you spell it?  At Janelle. Here, I'm going to drop it in the  spell the last name. Jane's. Oh, Shane, S H A N E. Janelle C. Shane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Janelle C. Shane. See if I can find her. Yes, I think I did. She blogs at AI weirdness.com.  Is she like, yes, her thing is like, yes, this is, do you not follow her? She's so  fun. Following right now. Yeah. It's a needed laugh.  So she's an expert in artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence and her stick is using

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  GANs, generative adversarial networks. So she feeds things to neural networks and then  she, some of it's. Here's a few. This is her wild prank

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fest based on GAN AI. Colorfully wrapped pasta with sweet pickles in a hot bath.  Ha. Skittles. Apparently she did it too, which is hysterical. Skittles on wood skewers luring  yet more skittles to their skewery doom. Red fridge spiders.  And she did them. That's the funny thing. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Or this, this woman did them. So yeah, these are delightful. Like tear up a roll of  toilet paper and make toast out of it. Oh, I see. This is another woman, Mika McKinnon,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who actually made them. Yeah. So like, oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My favorite is put your fear of insects in. Put your fear of insects where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Into a lemon. Toilet paper toast with shredded toilet paper toppings.  Uh, radishes festooned with part of my inexplicably enormous stash of plastic bread  clips. Okay. This is good. I don't know if, I don't know if all of these are GANs,  but they're very funny. That's cool. Yeah. So there is some value to April fools. I just,  I always know there's not those of us in this business wake up with dread. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the dark mode of humor. It should be eliminated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Google decided not to. Yeah. Google decided not to. Normally,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  civilization. Normally Google, as you know, really kind of goes over the top. And of the  last few years they've, they've calmed down. According to an internal email obtained by business  insider, Google will quote, take the year off from that tradition out of respect for all those  fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Our highest goal right now is to be helpful to people. So let's  save the jokes for next April, which will undoubtedly be a whole light brighter than this one.  We've already stopped any centralized April fools efforts, but realize there may be smaller projects  with teams we don't know about. Please suss out those efforts and make sure your teams pause  on any jokes they may have planned internally or externally. Don't you dare. I am much relieved  because I wake up with dread on April 1st thinking I, what do I have to sort through  before I do the shows today? Didn't see any, anything. I saw one. I did one. Which one,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey? Josh.ai did one. It was silly. Not silly. It was just dumb. Silly's okay. I don't want one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's plausible or breathtaking. Well, that's what happened to me is, because we're huge Roger  Federer fans of the house and I saw one report that said he was going to announce on Twitter  that he was retiring. This, that would be huge news. I couldn't find anywhere else. That's so  annoying. So why is this happening? My wife said, you idiot, it's April 1st. It's not right. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  want to see any Apple buys Microsoft or anything like that. Is it, so this is Josh.ai, is this real

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  or is this the April fools joke? It's a voice control for homes, but their AI or their joke was  something about politics. Oh, so maybe they took it down. This is the mistake Josh made,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because I thought there, there's this, this was sophisticated AI for the luxury home was the joke.  No, that's what they do. Okay. See, this is why you shouldn't do April fools. Yeah. Cause now I'm  going to think of them as a joke. What do you mean AI for the luxury home? What the hell? They provide

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  voice control for Crestron. Oh, so you have to have fancy stuff. We're calling the butler. That's  what it's for. Jeez. That little button is just like that button old homes used to have under  their dining room tables where they would bring the servants orders. I just want, I want to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, I want a nice taffeta. I want a carpet belt chain, belt chain, belt pole,  ball pole. That's it. So they apparently they took their April fools off. They may have,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they must have. Yeah. It was something about like you call your politician. Yeah. It's not on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. I think it was showing some taste. It's gotta be hard. In fact, it's gotta be hard to be the  onion right now. Doesn't it? Oh man. Are they, they know how to do it. That's set. You know,  it's not, you know, it's the onion. Yeah. And there's room for satire in this world, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm, I'm now in, I'm like, Oh yeah. Yeah. I used to have the same one. I saw you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. So I rest my case. No, I don't go there. No, I won't go on screen, but I gotta go see what  you're talking about. Oh dear. Okay. That's pretty funny. That's pretty funny. Cause it's the weighted  blanket thing. Yeah. Have any of you tried that weighted blanket for anxiety? I have one. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My daughter sleeps under one. She loves it. It gives her reassurance. Yeah. I will, I will sleep  under one too. And they're nice. How heavy is it? Hers is only 15 pounds because when I got it for  her, she, there's a ratio like you, you want to keep, right? I don't want to kill anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mom, mom, I can't move. Mom. Exactly. Although there's some parents probably would like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, probably right about now. Mommy's on a conference call. Mommy's busy. Have you,  well see you work at home anyway, Stacey. I do. Yeah. So this is not incredibly different,  but it is sad. Like I cannot, how many meals must I cook? Good Lord. You need a thermomix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you used it Leo? I did. I made risotto. Oh good. Okay. It's a miracle. Cause as you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you've ever made risotto, it's a time consuming, dare I say annoying process. Yeah.  You have to add a little bit of water at a time and stir it constantly for like 45 minutes.  This thing is, it looks like a blender, but the thing heats up. It does other stuff. So in the,  it's got a scale in it. So this recipe says, okay, put 30 grams of shallots in.  Okay. You put them in and then you put the lid on and it says, turn the knob to one.  Put a pound of Parmesan or whatever in it. It grates it and it wasn't a pound. It was,  it was few ounces. Put some Parmesan. It grates it too. It grates it. And then you put it aside  and then you do the shallots. I did that at order. Then you put the butter in and it says,  now turn it to this and this and it's sautees. It heats up, sautees the shallots. It's all in there.  One pot. And then it says, do this, do this. You add the arborio rice. You add a little water.  You turn, it's got a mixer thing. You turn it on to dial three for 12 minutes. 12 minutes later,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got perfect risotto. Isn't it amazing? How hard is it to clean? It's easy. It's a bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a bowl. It's as easy to clean as a bowl. It has blades in it. So it's a bowl like a  blender, but it, but like a blender, like the Vitamix, you puts a little soap and water in it  and you go and it cleans itself. So it's actually, okay. So that's the one thing I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  done. So Stacey, you can't have it anymore. Oh, that's right. I made the deadline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey was going to get it if I didn't use it. I need better puppy dog eyes. I just, I can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me your puppy. Give me your puppy. Oh, now I really do want to give it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now he feels guilty. He's not getting that. It's still not getting it.  No, the risotto was just too good. Stacey. Well, with the pound of Parmesan,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  maybe he'll leave it to me and as well. Good Lord.  10 by thermomix poisoning. Yeah, please. Please don't eat a pound of Parmesan in your risotto.  I mean, I'm sure it would be delicious. Just don't do it every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, uh, yeah, I've been doing all sorts of weird cooking experiments. So that's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Y'all, I baked my first loaf of bread and we should probably talk about Google. I'm sorry.  Is it flat? Did it come out good? No, no, the first one, it came out pretty well. Um,  and then I did my second one today, but I grabbed the wax paper instead of the parchment paper. So  it's stuck. Yeah, it's stuck and we're lucky the kitchen is not on fire. So yay, silver lighting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fun to bake. Everybody's doing it now. All of a sudden it's very, uh, I guess it's, it's  attempt to feel more grounded, I think. And if you eat enough bread, you will be grounded.  You won't be going anywhere. Um, and that, now Zephyr's saying I can't get yeast. It's sold out  everywhere. That's right. You go to the stores, there's no flour, no yeast, but make your own,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  make your sourdough starter. It's only going to take you five days or so. Um, just mix water

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and flour and it starts bubbling. Oh, I have this, I have a lovely starter. It's really good.  And then as I get extra stuff, yesterday I made sourdough waffles with the starter.  Delicious. Oh, delicious. Yeah, I'm going to do it. Doing all sorts of stuff. Cause you make,  every time you had flour and water, it gets bigger. But the other thing you can do is share it. And I  did, I've shared it with friends, which is nice. People get, you know, anyway, it's fun. I did a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  puzzle exchange with my neighbor and what do you do? You put it on the porch, wipe it down.  We put it on the porch and then ran away. Uh, we didn't run, but. Who would it, was there any way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there was a way of predicting this. In fact, I read two books in the last 10 years,  Gina Coladas Flu, which is about the 1918 pandemic and, um, and the plague within  Lori Gerrits, uh, the, what did the coming plague, the coming plague says this is what's going to  happen. Exactly. And, uh, so this is not a surprise. And yet who would, who would have thought we'd be  putting puzzles on her porch and running away for our neighbors? I mean, it's just,  didn't seem like we'd get to this point somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But we're all together via the great internet. Well, thank you. And the internet says you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  welcome. And I've been going around shooting zoom backgrounds. We're going to post those  from our different studios. So you, and that's one of the, that's kind of one of the fun things  people are doing, isn't it? Zoom backgrounds. Sesame street on Twitter posted today, uh, some  Sesame street backgrounds. Let me see if I can find it. They're really nice. I downloaded them  because zoom lets you put a different background. Is anybody worried about using zoom? There seems

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to be a privacy concern with zoom. Well, there's a couple issues. There's one zoom bobbing. So I am  worried about like now posting accessible links on zoom. So I've, I've locked down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you can avoid that. Yeah. This is Karen Swisher. I got burnt by this. She had Jessica  lesson on, but you can avoid it by going to the settings and say, don't let, you know, make it a  private or I don't know, there's ways to have a password. You need to have user control. Yeah.  It's just that the fault isn't, isn't the most private. Right. And part of this is because this  is a business product and people weren't, uh, you know, this, they're now using it for other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it was used for health stuff. I think the one thing that I think is legit is that they said that  it's encrypted and, and, and it's not, and I don't care about that. But if you're, if you're  health oriented, then you do care about that. No, they've been notorious for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They relaxed HIPAA rules though, around this stuff. That's right. But still you might want  privacy when you talk to your shrink and probably my therapist over zoom. I was like,  maybe they shouldn't be using zoom. There are other choices. There's Jitsi, J I T S I is open  source and end encrypted. You can even, if you're, if you're Andrew, you can run your own server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. My therapist is not, I'm going to be like, hi, you need to set up your own server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jitsi is easier to use in zoom. You don't even have to set up a server because it's a link and  they do it in their browsers. No software. It's a web RTC. So it's actually the easiest choice.  The old web RTC. I haven't heard that in a while. Yeah. That's a Google technology. Yeah. It's  IP diddle. It's a Google technology. It's just in the browser with a link. Most people will find  that easier than zoom. In fact, part of the problem people have with zoom is zoom has always tried to  make it really easy. They click the link and zooms up and running. And so in order to do that, they  do all sorts of things that are, would, you know, malware would do to stay persistent. They got in  trouble with apple because they, even after you uninstalled zoom, they left a web server  running in the background on your system at all times. But that was the thing that would catch  the link at the, you know, do the right thing with it. So I think the original way back when media

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  player, real player, real player. Yeah. Real player was the one that notorious for that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it was just the name of the one you just mentioned, Leo Jitsi it's open source.  And as long as we're doing that, Sesame street has some sunny day backgrounds. This is for zoom.  So there's the stoop. Wouldn't you love that for your zoom background? And the trick with a zoom  background I've learned as I've been doing these, cause we're, you know, we're taking these pictures  is nothing can be in the foreground because your head, Stacy's going to go right there.  So if you had something in the foreground, it would seem weird. There's Mr. Hooper's shop there.  That's a little cluttered for us. Yeah. I don't like either of those, but the first one,  the stoop is great. And then there's just this with Oscar going, just, do not do that. You would?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would a hundred percent psychedelic. Yeah. I would have them move back and forth,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  little rotating cookie monster heads and Jeff ballistic. You need what Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  can I mention what you mentioned? Prezzy video? Oh, you bet. Yeah. Yeah. It's public. Yeah. This  is really cool. So Prezzy, I don't know. Some people know about Prezzy. It's a great presentation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  tool. It gives you, I love it, but it gives you motion sickness and people give presentations  because things swoop this way. Yeah. But it's, it's, it's a great software. It's just wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an antidote to PowerPoint. The anodyne. Oh, I like it, Stacy. An antidote to the anodyne.  So Prezzy video lets you be in the presentation, which is wild. I'll show you, I'll just give you  an example from the Prezzy site of what a Prezzy presentation looks like. I've used these and it's  nice if they're not expected. Problem is now I think people know about them. Well, the other

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thing great about Prezzy is that it's not serial. You can, you can go from here to there and you can  change the paths in something. So it doesn't presume that everything is just linear. It swoops

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  around, but that's how you get seasick. So you have to do it judiciously. Yes. I think. But you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going to also organize the stuff. So I've done presentations back in the day when I did them,  where I would change the pathways, the same material based on who I was talking to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other way I've used this, which is nice is you can in real time annotate the presentation.  You can modify it. You don't, you know, most presentations are on rails. You know, this  slide is followed by the next slide by the next slide. Prezzy, you say, well, let's go down this  path so you can make your presentation. I've done that really big with lots of stuff you don't  necessarily want to cover, but as you're interacting with your students or with your listeners,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you can change paths. And the founders are really nice people. I think they're Hungarian. Yes. The  negative is it's expensive. There's a free version. Yeah, there's personal usage. Yeah,  there's personal, my students use it. Okay. That looks pretty good. Yeah, it's pretty good.  Maybe they've gotten, no, they've always, but they've always had a, they've had a free  rendition. That's pretty good. Okay. I forget what the preview was, but now, but now,  they all, that was a queue, but now, but now video could do with video. Yeah. So the one you're,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you know, you're going to want, it's either $7 a month or $19 a month. I don't give enough  presentations. Yeah, that's the problem. To really do that. But the video, see, I mean,  just if you're doing zoom conferences, do these, can I do this on zoom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or yeah, yeah. I was, I was on a conference call where some, I don't know if he wants me to say  who it is, so I won't, but, but a person you would know, there was a brainstorming call about things  to do around COVID and suddenly he just had a Corona beer bottle came up and he said, this is  brought to you by Corona. Right. And we all were just wowed. How do I get that? How do I get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's good. I'm going to do it then. Cause I, I'm so sick of these calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We ever switched to zoom for, for what? No, we've never used zoom. We use skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let you split your tracks out. Right. For recording, which is a pain. I thought it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey. I thought I just, I just started using it because I just did some, I just started  recording some stuff. It does. Yeah. Zoom lets you split your tracks. Each speaker,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  each speaker can get a track. Yes. Oh, but then the other people have to send you their tracks.  Cause when I recorded them, I don't think so. I don't, I give you wrong. I didn't, I didn't use  this, but I saw it was in the options. I looked at it because I was, I, but it was under duress.  I was, Skype was behaving badly and I needed to record a podcast and I was trying, I just ended  up recording it and having to edit without splitting tracks, which was kind of a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The other weird thing is, so I'm the host. So I talked to an amazing Yale epidemiologist named  Greg Gonsalves, who's been a trenchant critic of media coverage of the, uh, the crisis.  Oh, yes he has. Oh boy is he, oh, is he great. So I talked to him for about 40 minutes.  One weird thing is, so I'm the host. Leave it on there if you would, Leo, where it is.  I'm the host. He's the guest. I would think that the host should be where Stacey is,  but it always puts the host where I am. Minor thing. Do you think, don't you think that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  host should be on the left? You're saying as I am right now. Yes. It would be crazy if I were on  the other side. It would just be very well. I'm usually in the middle. Yeah. I don't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, Jeff. Maybe it's yeah. I don't know. You know, in countries where we go left to right,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  maybe you're right. That's what I was thinking. There are countries where they go right to left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it's British. So on the rundown under other, I have a Siva body in Athens zoom backgrounds,  which I think you're going to want to show because there's a whole series of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Let me pull those up. And then we will. We do have some non-covid news. There's actually  quite a bit of it, but I will, I will talk about that in a little bit. Just a second. So you put  it, where did you put it under other other other other other other other other other other other  where I put everything. Yes, I see it. I see it. Newsweek. Yeah. Right. From Newsweek. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What the hell is what is Newsweek these days? I don't know. It has some stories that are okay,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but then it's otherwise kind of weird. I am. Yeah. I can we so in my youth, I think I've  mentioned this before. You were either a time magazine family or a Newsweek magazine family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Colgate or Pepsodent. Yeah. Or Kelly. It was a little more. It was a little more political

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because time was a little more conservative and and Newsweek a little more liberal because it was  the Washington Post company and time was Time Inc. But we got life. So I'm confused when I grew  confused. But I love Newsweek. I read it, you know, from the moment that it was a real magazine  where every week it was a great weekly magazine. Then it got sold and then I don't know some strange  company owned it and all that. But so you're saying some of this is okay because all I remember is  the horrific cover story when they went back to print saying we've discovered this creator of  Bitcoin. It's this guy named Satoshi Nakamoto. It wasn't was just some random guy they found  me ever retracted and they never retracted it ever. Not that I saw it. They didn't do it publicly.  Maybe they did it in their secret thoughts at home at night. So journalist wins zoom.  Is this it with the struggle? You scroll scroll that's all done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's not a journalist. Oh, I love what he's doing. He used to be. Here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So Siva is on the left as all presenters should be. And he's using that very famous now  meme of the guy walking with his girlfriend, but checking out the hot girl going in the other  direction. And of course his girlfriend's not too happy about that. But Siva is the hot girl.  Honestly, it looks like the guy's checking out Siva's rear end. So I'm just saying there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  whole bunch of them there. There's more than one. I want this. Isn't that great? Brilliant. I love  Siva. If you go back to the newsweek, they put them together. There's more newsweek. Okay. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Journalist wins zoom. Oh, this is this is from Bohemian Rhapsody. He is Freddie Mercury.  And notice by the way, the touch to detail attention to detail Siva put on a black t shirt.  So that he'd fit in with the black background. Oh, that's brilliant. And there's more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Below. No, is that it? Is that all? This is how to do it, I guess. That was all I say.  And then I put another thing right, right, right below that in the rundown. Yeah. Which  just made me giggle a few minutes ago while we got on the air. I'll let you read the tweet yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Man turns himself into a pretty read. So my boss turned herself into a potato on our Microsoft  teams meeting. I can't figure out how to turn it off. So she was stuck as a talking potato.  So the meeting, by the way, apparently data data has not been dug up. She's underground,  but she does have lipstick. Oh, my God. Okay, we got a whole new thing going here.  We got a whole new thing going here. I didn't know you could do some news to teams. Yeah,  let's take a break. And then there is there is, and I don't know if you read it, the funniest  story of the week is the guy who is trying to invent a device to keep you from touching your

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  face. Oh, it's the greatest story is the greatest. We will save it for later. Come back. Oh, it's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  greatest. You go stay around. You want to come back to that. You definitely want to stick around  for that because that's goes from from bad to every line of it. It's perfectly written.  Our show today brought to you by Mint Mobile, the Fox. In fact, I'm proud of Mint Mobile. They  are doing a very good thing, at least through April 14. I suspect they're going to extend that.  Mint Mobile is providing all current and new customers with free unlimited high speed data  add on. So no limit to your data. If you want to know more about that, if you're a customer  already mint mobile comm slash unlimited. I am a happy Mint Mobile customer. Mint Mobile is what  we call an MVNO, a mobile virtual network operator. They resell the connection from one of the big four,  but soon to be the big three. In fact, in this case, it's T-Mobile. So you're going to get the  same service you get from T-Mobile, but you're going to get it for a price you may not actually  believe. This is no April Fool's joke. The reason is your bill, your wireless bill, your 70, 80, 90,  $100 a month wireless bill pays for a lot more than just your wireless connection. It pays for stores  and marketing and overhead and thousands of employees. Mint Mobile has reimagined how you  buy wireless. They've made it all online, no stores, and the savings go right into your pocket.  Every plan comes with unlimited nationwide text, nationwide talk, crazy fast 4G LTE. You choose how  much LTE you want. You can bring your own phone, but port your number over. It makes it easy. They  sell phones too, but you can bring your own phone and port your number. That way, you know, even your  contacts go over with it. So it's a painless transition. They'll send you the SIM for free,  no charge for the SIM. And of course, if you're not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has you covered  with a seven-day money back guarantee. Here's the introductory plan. Three months, $15 a month,  unlimited nationwide talk, text, three gigs of data. And right now, no limit, unlimited data.  So that's pretty awesome. I liked it so much. I did the trial and I said, this is good.  So I bought the most expensive plan they have, which gives me unlimited nationwide talk and text  and 12 gigabytes of data a month. Most expensive plan they have. I bought a year for 300 bucks.  That's $25 a month. That's less than a third when I'm paying T-Mobile for the same thing.  And it's guaranteed for 12 months. I love it. Cut your wireless bill down to $15 a month with  their three-month introductory plan and get the plan shipped to your door free at  MintMobile.com slash twig. You got to check it out. MintMobile.com slash twig. Do what I did.  Start with the $15 a month, three-month introductory plan. Then you can decide if you like it.  Okay. Maybe you should go for the, you'll know how much data you need. MintMobile.com slash twig.  Really awesome. And it just makes me wonder, why am I paying so much, you know, to Verizon or  Sprinter, T-Mobile or AT&T when you get it for so little? $15 a month with their three-month  introductory plan. By the way, this just crossed the wire. Thank you, Jacob, in our chat room.  John Ledger has now resigned as a T-Mobile CEO. So that's the end of an era. Yeah. I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  now, right? April 1st, the deal was consummated. He's done. I guess consummated is probably the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right. There was a rumor he was going to go to WeWork. I think that was put to rest. He's not  going to WeWork. What does he do? You know him, right, Stacey? What is he going to do? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Slow cooker Sundays. I don't know. I mean, that's what he does now. So I really like the guy and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  think we owe him a debt because I think with all of this crazy marketing and the magenta and the,  he really did force the other companies to say, okay, we could be better cut our prices. He was  a good marketer. He was hard on them. Great marketer. And boy, his social media team,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  their lives were hard because he was, I mean, he was filtered like I'm filtered, like not totally  crazy, but he's kind of like, yeah, let's be real. But I think that's why people loved him. It was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  real. Oh, yeah. That is one thing I'm hoping we get from all of this. When you see the anchors,  when you see, it's so funny to see them in their homes. I love it. I just love it. And I mean,  some of them, they're all trying to look like they have nice places, obviously. But when  Anderson Cooper is sitting in his book line, Gloria Vanderbilt Library, you know that he lives just a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  little bit better than the rest of us. So my favorite was Casey Hunt, who I think is really  great in hers. I tweeted, I said, I never would have thought Casey Hunt would have been one to  organize books by color, because she has a red shelf and a blue shelf. And she laughed and came  back. I read voraciously. I can tell you exactly where every book is. But I also like design.  Then she showed me pictures of her other bookshelves around. Michael Beschloss  has the killer office that I would die for beautiful blonde wood and stone and oh my  Lord is it gorgeous. He's a history must pay well historian. Oh, and then there's Bill Crystal. Did

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you see Bill Crystal's office? No. Okay, he's sitting in front of the requisite bookshelves.  Apparently, if you're going to do it, you got to have built in bookshelves. And one side is nice  and neat over here. And the other side, it looks like he just stuffed. He stuffed everything possible  in every which way. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It was an even even I think it was  Anderson Cooper even said, your books. Oh, no, it was was MSNBC. It was Brian Williams,  your bookshelves look just like mine said Brian, which is typical Brian Williams.  Because I doubt very much Brian Williams bookshelves look like that. But the other one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that you use Claire McCaskill was getting horrible, horrible video when she was on a major thing.  And obviously, she must have been too far away from from the router. So she's now in her kitchen.  Just kind of nice. She's got the sink right behind nothing wrong with that. Nothing wrong with that.  And that's what I'm thinking. Yeah, is the man who in this state are putting on a suit and tie,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  maybe no pants, but a suit and tie. I know, but only from here up because you know, they're wearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  sweats underneath. Yeah, don't you think? Usually I wear pants for this show. You get dressed up.  Today I wore sweats. Oh, I wore sweats because it's like, well, pants are not dressed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're not standing up. Although you did just stand up. So I will see. I said I constantly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  stand up because I'm running off like to do things or get coffee. So that's my hope is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  finally, we can see people, all these people on TV, as normal people living a normal life and kind  of take them off. I don't want to take knock them off the pedestal. I have respect for them.  Let them be human. Because it's not healthy for us to look up at them. And honestly, people on TV,  all it takes you know, you get a reality show, you can be president United States, it's not a good.  It's not a good value to have always on TV must be he must be good. She must be great. So long ago,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was one of the first to do webcam live on MSNBC. Really? Many, many years ago on on connected  coast to coast, I think it was called with Ron Reagan, Jr. and Monica Crowley. And I used to do  the blog segments. Hello, Jeff, what are the bloggers? Well, Jeff Jarvis joins us from his  basement to talk about blogs. So I had to go into the studio every time every damn time. And then  one day they needed me, they had me open the segment. And it was a blizzard and I couldn't  get in. I said, guys, it's time we could do it. And so I had it set up in my in my office in the  house with books on tops of things and all kinds of stuff. And of course, it was jerky. But but the  the CEO at the time went into the control room and said, I love it. It's just so real. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so it was hot for about a month. It didn't hurt that MSNBC was at the time owned by Microsoft,  I might point out. Yes, yes. I did quite a few of those hits later as well, because they wanted to  show off Skype and they want to show Microsoft products and stuff like that. Well, this is long  and be techie. Yes. And be techie. Yeah, they want to be techie. So we had some news. Yes,  I actually wanted to ask you about this. You promised people something. Oh, no, I'm saving

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that for later. We got to do that. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no. I'm not using all the good stuff up front. Okay. You got to get me wrong. The news magnet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  boys coming later. I've got to do at least three moral panics before you get that reward. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've got to earn your dessert and one Gutenberg. And Facebook did it. Stacey Stacey Stacey's a little  giddy today. I like this. It's good. You know what? This is why Jeff, this is it. Yeah. She's  laughing at the potato. We're cheering her up. Yes. We're making her feel better. Yeah. Y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  are probably the most interaction I've had. Well, since Kevin this morning, but no, that's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's two of y'all. This is my hope. Initially podcast audiences plummeted. I have to be honest  with you when this first started, I think because everybody was so concerned. They were listening.  I'm sure the daily went through the roof, but, but I thought it was, I kind of liked it according  to PodTrack who does measurements for this kind of stuff. The number one podcast to really get hit  hard. My nemesis, the true crime podcasts. Oh, it got so bad for a while. When we were talking to  people, they said, well, do you have a true crime podcast? It got so bad. I said, Lisa, look, I got  a, I have a treatment. I just got to go kill somebody. No, I have a treatment. So I got,  I said, I got a treatment. This is a great true crime podcast. It would be wonderful. It has to  do with tech. We'll never do it, but I wanted to do, was it the Broadcoms? No, it was not nothing  to do with Broadcom. Remember Adrian Lama? Yeah. The hacker who died. It was supposedly serious,  a suicide, but there are some real questions. And I thought it would be a very interesting series.  What happened to Adrian Lama? Cause as you go through the story, it's fascinating. He's the guy  who kind of turned in Chelsea Manning, was reviled by the hacker community, but he,  I don't think he did it. He was on the spectrum and I think he just said,  sometimes people on the spectrum do, this is the right thing to do. They don't,  what do you just do the right thing? You always do the right thing. You don't consider the  consequences or there's no shades of gray. It's black or white. It's the right thing to do. And  I think that's what he did, but he died under mysterious circumstances. His family and girlfriend  never thought he committed suicide. And furthermore, and this is giving away the best part,  there was, they found taped to his thigh, a name and address.  Ooh, it's getting to the good part. See? True Crime Podcast. I got it. It's all ready to go.  Never going to do it now. Anyway, True Crime Podcast down, but the podcast's audiences are  starting to come back up again. We're noticing this anyway. And it's my hope and feeling that  people are looking for their friends to join them. I went down also because people aren't commuting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Right. That's when it was broken, but then people needed to go back to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but we're here where your friends were going to keep doing the show. And I think it is somewhat,  I hope it's somewhat reassuring to have your friends in your ear and talking about stuff,  stuff that's going on in our lives, but also the news like this one. And I thought of you,  Jeff, when I saw it, because you've done some work with Facebook. You're all about journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's be clear here. I've been in a way paid by Facebook. I raised some money for the school  from Facebook, which I disclose, but I don't work for Facebook. And you had an advisory role at

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  some time, right? No, no. According to the Wall Street Journal, they have pledged $100 million  for news outlets hit by Corona. And in fact, there's been some talk about kind of how do we  save local news. Now it's not all, you know, it's $25 million in emergency grant funding for smaller  news outlets with immediate needs. $75 million in ad spending. Is that ad spending on media? I  didn't look right. That's my question. It would be fine if it's ad spending on those newspapers.  But if it's on Facebook, this is what Google did, basically $800 million. But it was mostly ads.  So $75 million in ad spending to help news outlets of all sizes make up for expected revenue  shortfall. I think that means they're going to buy ads in those newspapers, which would be great.  Which would be great. Mark, I don't know, whatever Facebook's selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For saying, see, remember when you loved Facebook? We're not so bad. Are we now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wall Street Journal quotes Campbell Brown, who of course is the face of Facebook news,  former, which was at CNN, right, Jeff? Yep. Former CNN journalist. Every business is suffering now,  but the news industry has really been struggling and we are in a privileged position to be able to  help. She says Mark Zuckerberg feels that getting accurate news about the virus is vital and he has  a real responsibility here. It's obviously a public relations. Of course it is. Of course it is. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a good thing. But you know, I actually, I emailed them today, not in any official relationship,  but I had, I know what they were, just, I had a couple of ideas about how Facebook could help.  And, you know, I think that we all got to pitch in and they got some power here and they've got a  good moment when people are reading. So Facebook traffic, I think we said last week was up 50%.  Yeah. And then there's another story out today. I didn't put it in the rundown. Maybe it was on  the right. I mean, sorry, maybe that's where I read it, Karsten, that traffic to news on Facebook is  up considerably. Yeah. So they're benefiting from the crisis. And news is benefiting. Yeah.  This is an expansion. But no one wants to advertise against it. That's, that's absolutely true.  A huge, huge problem. And the advertisers should be ashamed of themselves because everybody's  treating it now. Every story is Corona. You saw YouTube is demonetizing any YouTuber who just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mentions it. Yeah. Which is ridiculous. That's really ridiculous. That's bad. Yeah. Well,  there's, there's lots of brands. I mean, you'll see things like in, I see in my Twitter feed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and on Instagram, brands putting out like, you know, like soap, Procter & Gamble telling us to  wash our hands and saying like, you know, I can't think of their soap brands right now, but Downey,  Ivory soap wants you to wash your hands, la la la, those kind of ads would play just as well on a  newspaper. I mean, it's brand advertisement, as opposed to like something specific. But it's  basically saying, I give up, I give a hoot about the world that we live in. And I think that's  the world that we live in. You know, associate my brand with not Coronavirus, but information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not unusual for the marketing departments to take the wrong direction initially, you know,  at a panic, get off of this. But one hopes now as this is, as you mentioned, a slow moving train  wreck. Over time, they'll realize, no, no, there's, you know, the right way to do this. And I did hear  somebody say, I'm sorry, I'm quoting you without attribution, but it was really right on.  This brands are going to have to remember people will remember what they do in this crisis. This  will resonate for your brand. You know, when Disneyland says, Hey, sorry, you signed up for a  year pass, you got to pay us every month. Doesn't matter if the park's closed. That does not result  or down well. Yeah. Some airlines saying, I can't give you your money back. We'll give you a credit  where you want to go next month. And it's like, so these things will be remembered. And I have a  feeling most brands will realize that and do the right thing. They should. And also how you treat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  your employees and Walmart is not going to take the temperature of everybody coming in and Amazon  and good foods how they had a strike yesterday. And, and then Amazon fired the guy who organized

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a strike, right? Saying, Oh, he broke, he broke social distancing rules. Not smart. That is really  bad PR. Yeah, that's just terrible. And they're going to suffer from that. And that's mishandling  it because there's an opportunity here to really, they, you know, they're hiring 100,000 people,  Walmart's 150,000 people. Who was it? Was it door dash 300,000 people? I mean,  these are the only jobs out there. These people, they could come out heroes here and they,  it's stupid to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think we're going to be in this for a full year and not, not quite at this level,  but at some level here. And so I think that, that we're going to, to, to be able to tolerate the  brand's behavior is not just a one month and it's over. Stacey, you seem to have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  news. News.  Microsoft announced that they're going to keep their events virtual through the end or through  the first half of 2021. Sorry. I don't know. I almost said 2018. So all through next year. So  tying into what you're saying about this lasting a long time, this is a, I mean, Microsoft,  their executive leadership, intelligent, very good at processing information and fairly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  conservative around these things. So that's a, I think it's also an, maybe an indicator that  even after this is over, even if after you don't have to do that, a lot of conferences are going

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to go virtual. Oh, education is going to change tremendously. We're talking about that, you know,  every minute now, by the way, I tweeted today that that I'm not the first to do it. I'm sure,  but I have a reason I'll be clear about in a second that Apple is the new Microsoft and Microsoft  is the new Apple because Apple bought dark sky and it's killed the app and pissing me off

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  bad. I, so I tweeted about this because it's, I am so frustrated, not actually at Apple. They're  just doing what they're just Apple in along, you know, Apple's going to do what Apple's going to do.  They're not far from their tree. I will say Google, I fault them for not kind of, I guess,  anticipating this and to making the acquisitions to make their ecosystem look good and then building  an ecosystem that mainstream users can appreciate and enjoy because it is too damn difficult to do  anything within Google. I mean, Jeff, your favorite complaint about G suites, I pay Google and I hate  the service, right? This is just constant Google. They're like, we have the coolest stuff. We have  created a brilliant tech solution for the world. It will make everything better. They throw it out  there. They don't make it accessible to people at all. And then they wonder, they wonder why people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  turned to Apple. Maybe they don't, they don't care. By the way, in defense of Google, they only did  that demonetization of COVID for a week. They kind of back, they realized that was, oh, they did.  Oh, okay. They backed down on that. And not all, obviously you don't want to monetize part of, you  know, what they even said at the time is we're, as advertisers, we want to protect advertisers from  being associated with videos about bad things, global health crisis. What's happening too is the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no matter what Google does, Google was probably just responding to the advertisers. The advertisers  are putting COVID on their do not buy list. We did in fact, from our own average, some of our,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not all, and in fact only a handful, but get queries about that. Are you going to talk about  COVID? Cause we don't want to be on those shows. Oh geez. And I think that that's the knee jerk

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  reaction. Well, we said it is, it is immediate, but it's life now folks. We're living it. If you,  if you've got to be there with us and, and give us empathy and care about us. And that's the  opportunity you have as a human, especially on podcasts like this. That's our opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Globally, this is our chance. All of us to be human, be more human and then in the good part  of the human, not the bad part. Daily usage of hangouts meet 25 times this month. What it was  in January, 25 times sucking for us at the school. Oh, are they sucking bad? They're having a hard  time day over day growth, 60% over the last few weeks. It's bad. Now, now everybody's fuzzy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but now what happens is you've got five people in the hangout. Everyone is not speaking gets frozen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  until they speak again. Oh, wow. Yeah. I, I am super frustrated because I'm getting,  what year are we 2020? I still get, I'm like, why am I still having to argue with people over what  on conferencing software I'm going to meet you on? Like, Hey, let's FaceTime. And I'm like,  can't FaceTime. Let's do, let's Skype. Let's zoom. I'm just like, what do we, what do we settle on?  I revert zoom cause I have a zoom account. Zoom is a default. I, I subscribed to zoom

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this week cause I'm doing these interviews and I needed to do it. All of our sales calls are done

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  on zoom. Well, so to get back to this dark sky, cause I'm upset as you are Jeff, but there is a,  this is almost as bad as tiger King. There is a dark side. Where, how are you? Okay. Stacy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  can you possibly guess how he's going to do this? Can you possibly imagine? There is a, you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know. There is a seeming underbelly to the weather business that you don't even know.  Actually, John Oliver, the only reason I know is cause John Oliver did a great piece on it in,  I think November of last year. I highly recommend it. You saw on YouTube, but what's happened,  and I'm going to get this wrong. So I'm going to have to, I'm going to have to, I'm vamping a  little bit and correct me if I'm wrong, Chara. But what's happened is so there's the U S weather  service. Every nation has a weather service. This is an important part of government for farmers,  for disaster prediction, hurricane prediction, that kind of thing. It's important. You know this,  you went through Sandy. This is important. So we have a U S weather service and really all the  other weather services are just icing on top of the data provided by the U S weather service,  which is provided freely. We pay for it. Taxpayers pay for it. So everybody can get it. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  fix it. Weather creates their own models. So does dark sky, but the data starts with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the underlying data. The underlying data starts with the weather service with NOAA.  Is that not right? Okay. Does AccuWeather? Because if you say AccuWeather doesn't have their set.  Okay. Well, this is the underbelly. This is the see me underbelly because everybody wants to  pretend they're doing something different. And they are, because you know, you get different  forecasts. Whether underground gets it. They have weather stations, but weather stations alone are  not enough. You know, home weather stations are not enough. You still need the satellite data that  you get from the U S weather service. But the U S weather service is now run by the former CEO  of the weather channel. And furthermore, IBM bought weather.com and is using Watson now.  And I think what really happened here, dark sky was a Kickstarter five years ago,  was a Kickstarter. And they said, we want to use AI to do hyper local. That was going to be their  special sauce. Hyper local using AI still had to use the NOAA data. You can't get around that,  but maybe they use weather station data or something else. And they were very successful  Kickstarter. And then they, I think they got sold. I can't remember who bought them. Remember  forecast.com and then either they merged with or they bought dark sky and forecast.com became  dark sky. Remember there was a little thing and a lot of programs now use the dark sky API.  There's kind of a battle because there's the weather underground API, there's the dark sky  API and there's the weather.com API. And I think what Apple was doing with this now there's,  first of all, they didn't need a weather app. Right? No, you don't need a weather app. So  we're not sure why they bought them. Right? Did they want the engineers? Is there something  special dark sky is doing? I don't think so. So why did they buy this? And I think this is part,  there is some political battle going on that we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg in the weather

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  biz. So the Washington Post has a story on this from November. And they say until recently,  AccuWeather, Earth networks, the weather co and other private weather providers relied on the  firehose of data from Noah's national weather service and satellite arm as well as NASA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The CEO of weather service became the guy from weather.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, now companies are finding it advantageous to produce their own data and using analytics in  business savvy ways, tailoring their forecast to specific real world problems such as wildfires.  And now that they have their own ability to launch satellites and supercomputers and to harvest data  from semi-autonomous vehicles and wearables, these new arrivals are leapfrogging the information  gathering capabilities of federal databases, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was the CEO of AccuWeather and he is Donald Trump's not weather.com, but AccuWeather.  And he's Donald Trump's Noah director. He's not a scientist. He is a businessman and a lawyer.  And I, I'm telling you, and I watched the John Oliver bit, there's some, there's some serious  stuff going on underneath the surface here. All these guys pretend we got something special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, in the 2020 budget, President Trump is asking Noah to buy data from private companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, what private company might that be? I believe yes, it could be any of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  interesting. Oh, that would be interesting. So Apple's buying this because for the same reason  that, I mean, when IBM bought the weather, the weather, weather channel, weather channel,  thank you. That was very much about, that was in the same timeframe. No, it was actually about  the benefits. It was a realization that weather data is key. This was about the same time that  climate core was purchased for like a billion something by Monsanto. And it was a coming  realization that climate change was affecting the weather in increasingly disruptive ways for  businesses. And we needed to be able to anticipate that. And businesses pay a lot of money and they

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do, they pay a ton of money. I knew, I knew I'd get this wrong. Which Leni is the old guy, Barry  Myers, whose family owns AccuWeather is now the director of Noah. And the concern is this  intermingling of business interests and taxpayer scientific research and scientific data.  So it's a, I don't know. I watch the John Oliver thing. I'm only dimly remembering this,  but my point is I think the dark sky thing is part of an overall play for this data and the  and concern about this data. And because for one thing, Apple doesn't want IBM to own it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and weather is one of the most essential and important and it doesn't have the  weird privacy connotations that health data has, which is the other big area where having data can  actually really impact your bottom line. Both of those are ways to use data to make money in  accessible and easily accessible ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's complicated. I'm sorry that I botched this. I should have done some research before I brought  this up, but I just feel like I've been watching Tiger King and I think the same thing is happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in weather. I still don't understand the Tiger King thing, but that's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Where are  you going to watch Tiger King? Have you watched Tiger King? Have you watched Tiger King? No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to be prideful that I'm never going to watch it. You should watch Tiger King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's one of those guilty pleasure free to watch on Netflix documentaries about the weirdest  subculture ever. The culture, subculture of people who collect big cats. They're all over Texas, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Well, the Tiger King was in Oklahoma. Don't you feel sorry for the cats, the whole thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to watch it. He's in jail now for a murder for hire scheme against the woman who runs  Big Cat Rescue out of Florida. Then there's this guy in Carolina. It's just, it's the Tiger King  had, I think at one point three husbands, the guy in North Carolina has at least eight wives. The  whole thing is bizarre. Then the woman who runs Big Cat Rescue, her husband, the millionaire,  disappeared mysteriously some years ago. In fact, that cold case has now been reopened because of  the documentary because the Tiger King, Joe Exotic says she fed her husband to the tigers.  No one knows. I'm just saying there is some similarity between the machinations  in the big cat community and the subterfuge in the weather community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's happening with Twitter this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hold up. You may have had an error. Hold up. I had many errors. I know I did.  Oh, okay. Pack Northwest says that Meyer has withdrawn. He withdrew and now it's Uccellini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I think I don't know. I don't know. I'm confused. Yeah. He was withdrawn. Sorry about  that. Carson. Yeah. It's just like, ah, yeah, I'm, I know I went all over the place on that one. And  I know I even said, didn't I not? Did I not? I'm going to get this wrong. So I apologize for  bringing it up, but I do think there is some subterfuge in the weather community that we need  to look into, including the selling of this data, this taxpayer data that is so important, frankly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for farmers for prediction. Yeah. Whether dark sky, dark sky doesn't use our data though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they have to. Did you not read the article? Did it say they don't use any? No, no.  You said that they have their own secret sauce. They also use some. Yeah. But I think they also,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they, okay. Do they have their own satellites? They're using satellites. There's a company  called Spire that provides satellite data to these companies. Oh, so there's private data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, shouldn't we all use Noah's data? No, no, it's actually the Europeans get our,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  our data is wrong a lot. Well, I think that's why I use innovative alternative weather  forecasting industry. Maybe that's it. I use Norwegian weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yt dot n. So what do I use now instead of dark sky? So I'm so angry. Well, I buy an iPhone, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Isn't that, that to me is really terrible when you say, oh, and by the way, no more Android.  Yeah. They also shut off their API. That's what's going on. That's a year,  more than a year from now. It's end of 2020. Even then they're still shutting it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still a thing. It's a shiv up the back. Exactly my point. I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly my point. There's something going on. It's too,  maybe I should, instead of true crime, we should do true weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're all just like, there are some real weather geeks out there. Oh my God.  Other people are geeks. They're like train washers. Oh yeah. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Best smart phone thermostat for weather geeks. Yeah.  Ecobee. Because the chat room in Ecobee is just full of weather geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'd be a fun crowd. What kind of cloud is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The good news is there are other great weather apps, even on Android. So there are many choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. We're going to talk about Google. Let's talk about Chrome updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're back. Do you want to do that? Yeah. They only put that off for like a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So I thought they were going to, I couldn't understand. I guess it was just, hey, we're busy  this week. Okay. I get that. They said that we were doing stories. Oh my God. The Chrome updates  were stopping because of, okay, we got weak. That's it. Yeah. And we can talk about Google using AI

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to design chips that will accelerate AI. This is the beginning of the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once they get in that loop, you know how that goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the apes. The apes come over the Golden Gate Bridge and that's it, man.  With the Golden Gate Bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Are you talking about the new planet of the apes?  Yeah. Let's do the change. No, let me think about this here. What time is it? Let me do an ad and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  then I'll do the change log. How about that? Yeah. I'm out of here like 7 15 latest. Oh my God.  That's my time. That's my time. That's minus three. So we got four hours. Okay. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by LastPass. I am a LastPass fan, but now more than ever, you need  the security provided by LastPass as you take your workforce home, as you prepare  for your employees to work at home. You've got to figure out a way to keep them working,  keep them productive, but also keep your most valuable private resources private.  And that's why we use LastPass. I've always used LastPass at home ever since it started for 10  years. My favorite password manager. But LastPass is so much more than a password manager, especially  in business. LastPass can make the transition from work in the workplace to work at home  a lot easier without in any way impacting security. For one, there is an uptick already,  an uptick. It's people are horrible in coronavirus related phishing attacks,  spear phishing and regular phishing. LastPass reduces the risk of phishing because it won't  auto fill passwords on suspicious websites. And in most cases, your employees don't even know the  password, so they can't do it either. Love that LastPass. If you are using a VPN, you probably are  for your remote employees to access the office. LastPass adds an additional layer of security  directly to your VPN through biometric multi-factor authentication. That's great.  That's great. You don't want just anybody logging in. You want to make sure that's really the person  you expect it to be. That's where LastPass does such a good job. It's all about authentication.  Regardless of where or how your employees need access, LastPass ensures they have secure access  to workplace applications using of course their great password manager, but also single sign-on.  If you haven't checked out LastPass Enterprises single sign-on, you owe it to yourself. It is  amazing. Employees love it because it's easier. It's just an app. They say yes and they're in.  There's no password at all, at least as far as they can see. And they have 1200 plus apps  all ready to go. They even have training videos and everything. So your employees will be up and  running fast. Employees love it and you'll love it because it's more secure than passwords.  That's, I mean, this is the amazing thing about LastPass. They do what seems obvious. They square  the circle. They actually make it more secure and more convenient, which normally you can't do. It's  one or the other, right? More security means less convenience. Not with LastPass. There's an offline  mode. So sometimes, you know, we're experiencing it right now. Bandwidth is spotty. LastPass doesn't  stop working. Password management and multi-factor authentication will work offline.  So even if your employees are in spotty areas or even offline completely, they still can get into  stuff. That's important. It's great for collaboration. In fact, LastPass has that built in.  You could share passwords. You can have shared folders or share them directly. We have folders  for the ops department, for engineering, for business, for bookkeeping, for sales,  and only the people who need those get those. But it's very easy to, you know,  onboard somebody and say, all right, you're doing sales. You have access to this folder now.  It's really great. It's great for the users, but also great for the admin.  You can get up and running in minutes. They have a globally dispersed, ready to respond  support and success team. So when you're doing LastPass Enterprise, you have dedicated people  to help you with your deployment. And your IT team will love it because they are in complete  control. Over a hundred policies they can enforce to make sure your stuff stays safe.  We use required two-factor. We have minimum requirements for master password, things like that.  Increased security does not have to be complex. It's easy with LastPass. Start your journey today.  Visit lastpass.com slash twit to find out how they can help you. Lastpass.com slash twit as we come  to you from the LastPass studios. Thank you, LastPass, by the way, on a more personal note,  thank you, LastPass. Because because of LastPass, we're making payroll this month. And so I'm very  sincere. Let us all. Yeah, thank you, LastPass. And thank you for using that address so they know  you saw it here. Lastpass.com slash twit. And now without further ado,  I'm going to pull a Karsten and I'm going to, I think if all the buttons are correctly pushed,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can do it. I can do it. I think Karsten does it faster, but okay. Well, he's pushing the buttons

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  while I'm doing the ad. He's, I can't do two things in one. I couldn't do that. I was too

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  distracted with impeachment. I couldn't put the buttons right. Yeah, I know. I've heard that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google duo can now support 12 person group video calls. I don't know what the limit was before,  but that's a lot of people. I have to say we, yesterday we tried to do our staff meeting for  the first time. I think we're doing it on zoom and Lisa's going, I can't, there's too many people  in here and that's only 20 people. It's hard to do these big conferences, right? Yeah. Yeah. I will

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  say though, I use Google duo to talk to my parents and I have the, oh gosh, nest hub max display,  whatever. So you have it on the, on the screen. Yeah. So I had it on the screen and it was auto  focusing and it did such a great job. Like I didn't, I mean, it was a very good experience  and I appreciated the hands free thing until my mom started yelling at me for making noise in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kitchen. We are all using this stuff like crazy now. I mean, um, my daughter's on Android, so I'd  use duo with her. My mom's an Apple person, so she prefers FaceTime. She could use duo, duos on iOS

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and Android, but I do FaceTime with her. Have you tried to tell an Apple person to download?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the funniest thing is I'm talking to my dad who's on FaceTime. My daughter is on duo  and he's on the screen here. I'm holding her up to the camera so we can all three of us talk  cause we couldn't conference. So, and then I put a mic, but it worked. I wish I had a picture of it  because it was the silliest thing you ever saw, but he was able to talk to her. She was able to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  talk to him. So meanwhile, I need your advice. This is like, this is a radio show level question.  My father who's 94, um, he's deaf as can be. His hearing aids aren't working.  And then now he's so I said, can we email you pot? Oh no, I can't get all the internet.  So we're going to be in no communication at all with him at some point. So here's the question.  I asked, I asked son Jake yesterday, uh, whether it was a Chromebook or a windows machine, he's,  he's windows. Is there a way for me to set up the machine here, change the name of my SS ID  and password? Cause I know what his password is. Set it all up and have one button, just one  that he can use to go and get email from us. Any advice about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's going to be fragile. That's the problem. Can you send him a hot spot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What would you pay for and send him a hotspot? So he, does he have internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has internet. Yeah, no, he has internet. Just he did something wrong with his laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He screwed up his life. He uses AOL still. So you have, yeah, well that's problem number one.  Yeah. So what you would want to do is set up a dedicated Gmail account that he could easily

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  write and get to. That's the only thing the machine can do and he can get to it. And that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish, you know, you could send him an iPad because you can, you can pin an application.  This is more parental control, but you can say, and Android will do this too. I think you can pin  an application that's just the only application and without the parental code, they can't ever  exit that application. So basically it's a dedicated iPad. I don't know if you can do that with

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a Chromebook. I wish you could. Well, in Gmail, doesn't it now, I know that mine asked me for a  new password, like me to reenter my password every month. Oh, that's right. So we actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're getting an advertiser that does a senior PC because this is a,  oh, that's brilliant. This is a really common problem. I get this call on the radio show  all the time. And this is exactly what you want. You want big buttons, you want a few functions,  you don't want any way they can screw it up. I think it's called Serona because I remember  we were going my Serona. Let me see if I can, I can find it. I got a little bonus here. Yeah,  well, cause they, I don't think they've even signed up yet, but I was talking to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find it. No, how do you spell that? That's the question.  It's not S E R O M A that's breast reconstruction or barbed ribbon for tension closure. I've seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hematomas and no, I got it right. I got it wrong. Maybe I have the name wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Well, next show. Yeah. Oh, telekin telekin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've seen the telekin and I've seen the wow. And I think both of them are a little more complicated.  Both of these require monthly subscriptions, just so you know. But that's the idea of these  is that they are very simple. Most of the time they're running Linux because you can  completely configure it. Cause you can control it. Yeah. And have a new user.  Windows would be the worst cause there's no way, but you're right, Casey. You'd have this issue  of Gmail every once in a while saying, well, just for security, what's your password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't know if that is that us. I mean, like obviously I have mine set up for,  you know, MFA and all kinds of things. So I'm like, is there a, don't ever ask me again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  saying on like there might be Gmail. Let me ask Lisa, see if I can. What's the name of that  senior PC jitterbug? No, no, that's, that's the, there's a jitterbug phone. Yeah. Yeah.  Somebody's saying jitterbug PC, but I don't know. I don't know if that's,  all right. We'll keep going with the change log. I do think, I do think that by the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an iPad is probably a really good choice for, but the idea of not having a keyboard and typing on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the screen will throw him a keyboard. You can, you know, they, they, they also offer keyboards.  It's not, it's not inexpensive, but they're $400. The new one is 350. This one's and I just said,  I don't like Apple. Yeah. Well, maybe it's time to get over that. Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to let y'all argue about that. So my father gets dark sky and I don't. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dad'll get dark sky. Google. What the weather's like.  It doesn't matter. You know what your dad's gonna say? Just look at the window. You lazy son of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  gun. Google rolls out. The apartment is always nine, literally 90 degrees. Literally the thermostat  accepts a 90. Well, does he like it? Oh, he does, but it's torture visiting him. Well, but he likes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it. He likes it. It's fine. It's like the big sleep, the Humphrey Bogart movie where he goes  to visit the guy and is he's the guy lives in a greenhouse where it's humid and hot.  These old bones need to stay warm. Google has, I'm a little worried about this one and I'm not sure  what it's going to look like, but Google drive is about to change a little bit starting September  30th. It's not, it's not imminent. All your files will live in one folder. Oh no. So now you have  access to something called Google drive shortcuts. You know how shortcuts work on windows and  Macintosh? Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. So this is the drive folder structure is going to  change in September, which I think is potentially a disaster. All your files will be in a single  folder. It's no longer possible to place files in multiple folders, but you can use the shortcuts.  And I haven't seen this new setup. So you're not, you don't have one folder for everything you own.  Just a file can only be in one folder. All your files will live in one place. Yeah. One place.  Oh no. So they'll say this though. That's just a bit of clarity. You could have 25 folders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope so. Oh, okay. I thought you were saying you really have one folder. A file shortcuts.  So right now I have a craft could only live in one place. Yeah. Right now I have a Twitch shows

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  folder and it's kind of like shortcuts. That file lives in one place. Yeah. So I'm not sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you like shortcuts that file lives there and in other folders, which is not how file systems work  in the real world. So maybe it won't be so confusing. Shortcuts will solve that. That's  how we do it in the real world. All right. You did mention already Chrome updates coming back. Good.  Bloomberg had a story. I don't know if this is a problem or not. I'm curious since you hate Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Get me in trouble. Why don't you? Since you hate it, you're an Apple hater.  Thanks a lot. Mark Gurman, who writes a lot about Apple on Bloomberg,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  points out that App Store rules prevent Google's Stadia and similar services, the upcoming Microsoft  X cloud, NVIDIA's G force now from working on iOS. You cannot get the Stadia app on iOS  because Apple's rules prohibit services that rely on streaming from the cloud.  Uh, so you could, I guess one could say it's anti-competitive. Apple's got Arcade. They don't  want these other services on there. I'm going to guess. In fact, we asked Mac break weekly yesterday,  asked the folks and they said, and I think that probably agree with them. This is just an old rule.  And at some point, especially if Mark Gurman and others start talking about this, Apple will say,  yeah, yeah, yeah, the way, of course you should be able to have gaming services on there. But as of  right now, Google Stadia is an Android, you know, you got to use Android if you're going to do it  on a mobile device. No red dead redemption too, for you. I don't know what that is. I, nobody,  nobody knows. Nobody cares. Uh, when asked, uh, G force now, uh, a spokesperson said, you know,  ask Apple. Apple said, of course, customers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers  and gaming services that can absolutely launch on the app store. If you follow review guidelines,  I suspect Apple changes. But for right now, that is a little anti-competitive Stadia, not on iOS.  And you wanted this story and I'll let you do it, Jeff.  Or maybe it's, maybe it's, maybe it's Stacy Google using AI to design chips to accelerate  AI. Yeah. She's the chip. Maybe it's a very Stacy story. That's not a, no, I just, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just brought it up as a possible story that actually dealt with Google. I think it's  interesting. It's, it's basically saying, Hey, neural networks are so inexplicable. Let's let  them design their own hardware that will optimize. And Google actually tried this out and they built  a TPU that, and then we really won't know how it works. Yeah. I mean, we do because you can,  with a chip, there is a physical process that you can break down. But the idea is that this will  help. One of the challenges right now in the world of chip design is chip design from design to  actual, an actual functioning chip. It can be like as long as two years, maybe 18 months,  if you're really awesome, right? But having, and part of that is because a human being has to figure  out how to put all the pieces together and make sure they work together. AI can do that much faster.  And with neural networks, they change so much. The workloads are not staying as stable as they  used to be. Right. So this can get you from design to hardware. It speeds up the design process.  So it gets you from design to hardware faster, which is a good thing. So that's, and they're  using reinforcement learning for this, which is basically the same type of learning they use to  teach deep mind how to play games, which is like, here's your goal. Go meet it. I love that. Because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's real AI. That's not some programmer saying, well, if this happens, you do that.  That's the AI teaching itself. Finally, you may remember that last fall, Apple banned Infowars,  Alex Jones app from the app store, but inexplicably Google continued to allow it,  despite the misinformation. I guess they, Alex Jones finally went too far. Wired says that  Jones disputed the need for social distancing shelter in place and quarantine efforts.  Google finally snapped and banned the Infowars app from the Google Play store. So  it took them a little while, but they finally realized this is a bridge too far. And that  is the Google change log. Oh, darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Play the drums, Stacey. Play the drums. I was like, we're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was so good. I thought it was so good. I had it all queued up. I had it in preview,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just had to press the right button. That's the Google change log. In case you didn't notice,  I'm doing this all by myself. Karsten's at home. Kevin's at home, our technical director's at home.  We have one engineer in the studio at any given time because we don't want to take any chances.  We're trying to protect our team. We don't want you to infect anyone. Or for them to infect me.  Wouldn't like that. I know you're a wise fan, Stacey. Is this a big story? They updated their  firmware to allow you to turn a wise security camera into a webcam? I don't know if it's a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  story. It's a story. I actually was going to do it. And then I got distracted by going outside

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  while it was sunny. It's interesting that they could do that with a firmware update. That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All they did was change the zoom. So the zoom, it's closer now. And I think they changed your

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  field division. So that's all they did? Oh, well, nevermind. I thought it was something more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  complicated than that. And we just zoomed in a little bit. Yeah, I think it's in, and they narrowed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the field of view. So it's not, you know, it looks better. And it's really because there are a lot of  people working from home may not have a good camera. And now they do. Yeah. There are tons of  people. Cameras are sold out. Yeah. Oh, really? Oh yeah. I'm taking this home because I want to  play with the idea. A lot of people have point and shoots. And so in many cases, your point and  shoot can be modified to become a very good, a better than usual webcam. So this is a Canon

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  point and shoot. Oh, I was wondering why you grabbed that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why I grabbed it. So what do you have to feed it through to make it a webcam? So it's actually not  super complicated. We had seen this at CES, Ant Pruitt and I had seen it at CES because  Canon was pushing this as a potential for a webcam, you know, because it has zoom and  it's got better optics. Maybe I wouldn't be pink. Maybe you wouldn't be pink. It's the M20.  But there are a couple of things that you got to do. For one, you know, you have to have an HDMI  cable. It has a mini or a micro HDMI. I don't know what they call it, but there's a small HDMI  out. So you have to have a cable that'll go from that to something else. In this case,  this is HDMI. I'm going to take an HDMI cable and plug this into a switcher, but you could also  plug it into your computer. So there's a little adapter. And then there's one other thing we had  to get, which was a battery. Most of these, most of these guys, you can't run them live  because the battery in the battery will die. So we had to get a special adapter that, and you  can buy these on eBay and I bet you, you could still get these on eBay. So it's a dummy battery.  This isn't a real battery. It's the same size and shape as a real battery, but notice it has a hole  in the end so that you can put a power adapter into it. And now, now you can run it continuously.  It doesn't go to sleep. It does have, how much does that little, oh, these are like 10 bucks on  eBay or less. No, no, no, the whole thing. Oh, the whole thing. I think this is a $200 point and  shoot something like that. But it's, but it's a, it's a real camera too. I mean, it's a,  it's actually a very good. So I wouldn't be pink. Well, I can't promise you that.  Nobody can promise you that. I don't want to be. Yeah. This is maybe not easy being pink. I have  to look at the price. It might be 400. This is the EOS. It might be a thousand. I don't know.  The EOS M 200. So, but you can, it has what you're looking for at any camera.  All right. Nevermind. Forget it. Which it's pretty good camera. What you're looking for is  live HDMI out live video out, which means that while the camera's on, you can see what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then if I put that HDMI into this nice little Mac, you gave me here. Yeah. How hard is that?  Well, I don't know. We'll see it as a, as a camera to put in the sky.  It should see it as a camera to put in Skype. Yeah. And, but you may already have,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, but you may already have, I mean, if you, if you take pictures at all,  you probably have a point and shoot that might be able to do that. You're looking for live HDMI.  It just needs the HDMI video. Yeah. And you may need a battery with this  power battery adapter, the dummy battery. Cause I'm tired of being pink.  Well, what are you using right now? The, the, the, the lodge tech.  Okay. It's not the, yeah, that's not a bad camera. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love this camera. Like I look great. Cause you look really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Easy for you. Better looking than you are, Jeff. I know I have to, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have to wear very much makeup at all. I think it's a great camera. Jeff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's something wrong with Jeff. We don't know. You know what? You know what? I think the problem  is I think my hair causes a weight balance problem. I'm serious. It's so light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's a, that's a good thought. The camera is balancing on your hair.  Oh yeah. I don't know. Why don't you dye your hair brown?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Do it for us, Jeff. You could be purple like Stacy.  I'm not purple. Well, you were, weren't you briefly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was blue. Blue. I was blue for four years, five years.  Not so briefly. I felt like it was a long time. Sorry. I dropped my worry bird, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's your worry bird? Let me see that. What is that?  Oh, it's just a little Wren that you squeeze. Is it going to kill it?  No, it's wood. Does it have much life left in it? Oh, I'm thinking of mouse and mice and men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's dead George. This is not a Lenny. It's not a Lenny moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Can I ask you about a story? Cause I don't subscribe to the information because I'm poor.  Yes, I have the information. Yes. The Amazon story. So Amazon,  Walmart suspend commerce marketing deals. Is that affiliate sales that they're getting rid of?  Like I can sell cameras on my blog or is that, publishers are,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so. Publishers are bracing for a pullback in advertising. Amid a COVID-19  pandemic. We've been speaking about that. And one big shoe has already dropped. Amazon and  Walmart have temporarily suspended commerce marketing deals with digital media firms such as  Buzzfeed. Okay. Keep going. That's the paywall. I couldn't figure out what the next. So I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's affiliate links. It is affiliate. Jesus. That's why I've been pushing publishers to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that as a whole new revenue stream. According to this, the information gets 20% of its revenue from  affiliate links. Ouch. Ouch. Well, okay. But only half of that. So 10% comes from Amazon and Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's a 10% haircut. Because Buzzfeed has its own bespoke products like the Stone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With some deals, including the ones with Buzzfeed, the retailers guarantee a minimum  level of payment regardless of traffic. So when I do an affiliate link, I get a percentage of the  sales. But apparently they've got a richer deal going with some of these guys. They're guaranteeing  a minimum level of payment. That's that according to the information explains why Amazon and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Walmart have suspended payments. Now the publisher kick to the gonads for the news industry. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Buzzfeed says we think it's going to be short lived. Once lockdowns ease and people's lives return to  normal, the publisher says they're going to start buying things again. So I think that's the issue  is that the affiliate revenues dwindled, but the guarantees mean those payments have to keep up.  And they're just saying, look, we can't guarantee it. We don't have such a deal, but we do affiliate  links from time to time, I think. So, okay, thank you for that. That's the story morning glory.  And that made it well worth buying the $400 a year subscription. Very sad story. And I am not,  I do not know Jack Schofield, but I know many people do. He was, did you know him?  I think I met him. Yeah, it was the guardians tech guy. Guardian is a great publication,  the guardian.com. He did the ask Jack tech column. He was kind of like their,  Walt Mossberg or me. Yeah. He started covering tech 35 years ago. He had a, you know, one of his first  stories in 1983 was how to buy a home micro, which is what they, they call them in those days.  Probably the, he recommended the BBC model B, the acorn for 400 pounds or for a hundred pounds,  the Sinclair spectrum. Those are great classic computers. So he did not pass away of COVID  though. It was a heart attack, but he was only 72. And surf has COVID or is recovering. Yeah.  Very, very worrying because of course, Vince, an older gentleman, the father of the internet  responsible kind of co-author some of the key protocols for the internet, including TCP.  Did you see whether he is seriously ill? I didn't, I didn't think he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it doesn't sound like he's recovering. So we'll hope that that continues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to, this is just the beginning. This is the anticipatory grief.  This is just the beginning though. And I don't know if you watch the obituaries and CNN that  Anderson does every night, but it's just devastating. I shouldn't be watching it.  Nope. Not going to watch that. But I also feel like these people need to be remembered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will remember them later. Yeah. So speaking of the guardian,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  their story astrophysicist gets magnets stuck up nose while inventing coronavirus device  caught my attention the other day. Shall I read it to you? Oh, it is an excellent story.  Please. An Australian astrophysicist has been admitted to hospital after getting four magnets  stuck up his nose in an attempt to invent a device that stops people touching their faces during the  coronavirus outbreak. Dr. Daniel Reardon, a research fellow at a Melbourne university,  was building a necklace that sounds an alarm on facial contact when the mishap occurred last  Thursday night. The 27 year old astrophysicist who studies pulsars and gravitational waves  says he was trying to liven up the boredom of self isolation with a four powerful neodymium  magnets. Stacy, how powerful are those neodymium magnets? Very powerful. They can rip your  intestines in two. If you've ever had them, they're really fun to play with. But boy,  when you put them close to each other, they go, wham. He says, I have some electric electronic  equipment, but really no experience or expertise in building circuits or things. I had a part that  detects magnetic fields. I thought if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field,  and we wore magnets on our wrists, then it could set up an alarm if you brought it too close to  your face. A bit of boredom and isolation made me think of that. However, the Guardian goes on,  the academic realized the electronic part he had did the opposite and would only complete a circuit  when there was no magnetic field present. I accidentally invented a necklace that buzzes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  continuously unless you move your hand close to your face, he said. So after scrapping that idea,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was still a bit bored playing with the magnets. It's the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears,  clothespins to your ears. I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils and two on the outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was hoping I could get through this. When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the two inside stuck together. Unfortunately, the researcher then attempted to use his remaining

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  magnets to remove them. At this point. Having research, having like called somebody and said,  what do you do when this happens? Oh, you use a magnet to get a magnet. Oh, okay. At this point,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  my partner who works at a hospital was laughing at me. He said I was trying to pull them out,  but there is a ridge at the bottom of my nose that you can't get past.  After struggling for 20 minutes, I decided to Google the problem. There is his mistake right  there and found an article about an 11 year old boy who had the same problem. The solution in that  was more magnets to put on the outside to offset the pull from the ones inside.  As I was pulling downwards to try and remove the magnets, they clipped onto each other and I lost

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my grip and those two magnets ended up in my left nostril. While the other one was in my right.  At this point, I ran out of magnets. Probably a good thing. Before attending the hospital,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reardon attempted to use pliers to pull them out, but they became magnetized by the magnets

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  inside his nose. Every time I brought the pliers to my nose, my entire nose would shift towards  the pliers and then the pliers would stick to the magnet. So he put them there and they were,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  uh, it was a little bit painful at this point, he reports. My partner took me to the hospital  that she works in because she wanted all her colleagues to laugh at me. The doctors thought  it was quite funny making comments like, this is an injury due to self isolation and boredom.  At the hospital, a team of two doctors applied an anesthetic spray and manually

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  removed the magnets from Reardon's nose. By the way, it's not over quite yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they got the three out from the left nostril, the last one fell down my throat, he said.  That could have been a bit of a problem if I swallowed or breathed in, but I was thankfully  able to lean forward and cough it out. Needless to say, I am not going to play with the magnets anymore.  It is the greatest story. So just a word of warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kids don't try this at home. These are the same injuries that small children have.  Yes. And they're very serious because again, if they swallow, it will rip through your intestines.  But put for a grown astrophysicist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You should never let kids play with these super magnets. They are really problematic.  Here's a picture just to complete the story. Here's a picture.  In his full humiliation.  Of Dr. Daniel Reardon in the hospital after removal of the magnets from his nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I give him a lot of points for confessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is one of the funniest stories I've ever, and then also they have the medical discharge summary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Denies further magnets.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Magnets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two hours ago had two neodymium seven millimeter in diameter strong magnets up bilateral nostrils  stuck to each other via septum bilaterally attempted removal tried using two other magnets

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  up left nostril ended with three magnets up left nostril one upright all stuck together

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  via septum denies difficulty breathing denies further magnets.  We needed that. Let us wrap things up with Stacy's pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are the only Stacy in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't have a pick. I'm so sorry. I can come up with a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what are you reading? That's or, you know, it can be these days, a TV show, a book,  anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I bought Ken Lou's, hold on. I'm going to tell you what it's called. Girl, girl, hidden,  the hidden girl. What is it called? So I love Ken Lou as a writer. He wrote the paper tiger,  which is a collection of short stories that was phenomenal. It's really good. I think it works up.  Does he work at Microsoft? He's very similar. He's just he's in the tech industry. He writes  very well about near term issues in short story. They're science fiction stories. So his new book  is out or it was out last month. I don't remember, but I bought it and I just started reading it.  For those of you guys who like science fiction that is based in fact, or could be plausible,  he's wonderful for that. And this particular book is great because it's short stories. And  I don't know about you, but sometimes I have a hard time really like it's hard for me right now  to dig into a novel and stay there. So I'm appreciative of the fact that I can escape  for a little bit and then come back up and cook more food for my family because they're eating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all the time. The problem is right now life is a squirrel. Oh, I was like, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it could be worse. It could be a tiger king. I think that honestly,  this is one of the benefits of this reading, cooking, all of the humble things that we're  doing making face masks, I think are good. I think it's, it's not so bad. It's hard. I understand.  And for a lot of people economically really bad and for others, health wise, really bad.  So I'm not, I don't want it anyway, diminish that. But if, if you know, the upshot of this is you  get more cooking and reading time, that doesn't sound so bad. Oh yeah. And I have a, we're having

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a lot of fun. I know I told, I tweeted about spraining my ankle. I thought I had broken my  foot playing just dance with my family, but it was just a sprain. We were fine. There are risks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, here's a Ken's website, by the way, it's Ken Lu, L I U dot name. And here's the  hidden girl. I appreciate book. I always appreciate book recommendations, always looking for new books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and if you haven't read it, the paper menagerie has some wonderful stories. There's  a story about, it's very poignant. It's about somebody who works in a tech company. His child  died in basically recreating her in software and holograms. And it's, it was just so moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh wow. Yeah. Anyway, thank you. That's a perfectly legitimate recommendation. Always welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I read a lot. Yeah. And now Jeff, your pick of the week. I'm not going to cheat like Stacey did.  Um, Stacey cheats, I can cheat. So the number is two, as it takes two to make a couple.  Even in, even in this time of coronavirus, a drone can bring love together. Romance via drone.  It's a kind of nice little more panda story of a guy who sees a woman in New York on the,  on the roof across dancing. Oh, and he says, uh, he says a story about a quarantined cutie,  not so sure about the cutie thing, but we'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  So she's over there and they kind of make eye contact. And so he then gets a drone out  and sends the drone over with his phone number. Okay. Stacey, what do you think? Creepy.  I mean, does the drone have a camera? That's well, they're visible to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He could have wadded it up in a paper ball and thrown it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they're across the street. Okay. Can I put a rock in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Rock through your window is very creepy. That's that. That is if you do it once and you acknowledge  that it's a little over the edge, it's probably okay. And this particular time. And she could  have just said, you know, the thing is she's, she could have had a drone jammer and then been like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  shut it down. That's the way, that's the way you want to end the story. Cause it's moral panic.  Yes. So he does that. And then she texts them and they get along with the texting. And then they  have dinner together each on their own roof, which is kind of sweet. That's sweet. It may not be sweet  after the quarantine. No, it may not be at all. Yeah. What if it smells bad? Yeah. Right. Well,  it is a price, Stacey Stacey. You got a point in the story. The first picture of him without a  shirt. Oh boy. The problem. I was talking to some professors the other night in a happy hour and  they said they have, they've had to tell a few people, put your shirt on, wear a shirt, put a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  shirt on. Really? Why are people not wearing shirts? Is that in their conferences and video

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  conferences? Yeah. Oh, those are like all those shirtless runners. I don't see them up here  because it's too cold. But in Texas we had a lot of those. Yeah. I don't like that. I don't like that.  I don't like that one. Cotton picking bit. I mean, even if you look amazing, I feel like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you should have, it's not the right thing. No, it's not the right thing. Yeah. Okay. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  actually there's quite a few drone stories. I was just looking at USA Today. There's the  minister who married a couple from the fourth floor window via drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How could he just not stand six feet apart and just say, hey? Because it's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The quarantine cutie is actually a TikTok thing. So,  he's posting it on TikTok. According to USA Today. Yeah. Eight million views on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's weird. I don't really want to date anybody who's in their own hamster ball, but that's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a very modern story. You got to acknowledge that. I'm just going to eye roll. That's  what you get there. I know both of you have to do a lot of research. And when I saw this,  I thought of you. Have you ever heard of Zotero? It's an open source project, a research assistant.  That person is going to be organized in a box, Mac, Windows or Linux. You can copy  research. It'll actually automatically pull the article from JSTOR. What is it? Archive.com.  You can scan ISBN numbers. It will automatically pull in the references.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It creates an automatic quick bibliography. Chicago or MLA style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your choice. It supports over 9,000 citation styles. I didn't even know there were 9,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. They're awful, these academics. That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is why I didn't go into an academic career right there. Bibliographies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like it because it's free. It's open source. You can buy storage from them or you can run it  yourself. I just thought of you guys when I saw it. I don't do research. I don't need a research.  As you could tell with my weather story, I don't research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My research is basically clipping things into a Google Keep document and putting them in folders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of what this is. You'd have a central store for all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mine is Google Keep. I used to actually have folders where I would print things out,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which then felt very serial killer. You don't want a big stack of paper. Z-O-T-E-R-O.org.  I thought it was a very nice edition. It actually was.

And as we have to say now from now on,  stay safe, wash your hands and go home. Snort maggots. No, don't snort them.  What? Was it snort them or don't snort them? Don't snort them. Don't snort them. Very important.
