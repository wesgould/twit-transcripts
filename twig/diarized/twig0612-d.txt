Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Anne has the day off. He's got his second injection.  He's not feeling too well, but Stacy's here and Jeff's here.  And guess what? A special appearance by Kevin Marks.  We will talk about the Google I.O. keynote.  We've all got lots of thoughts about all the things Google announced and didn't announce.  Kevin will talk a little bit about the problem with the AI demo that Google did.  And it is a pretty big problem.  And then a $40,000 bed.  It's all coming up next.  Plus a DVD screensaver from Google.  It's all coming up next on Twig.  This is Twig.  This week in Google, episode 612, recorded Wednesday, May 19th, 2021.  Way more confused.

This week in Google, Ant Pruitt just got his sequel injection.  So he's taking the day off.  He's not feeling 100%.  Bless his soul.  But Jeff Jarvis and Stacey Higginbotham and I are fully inoculated and feeling fine.  Stacey Higginbotham from stacey on iot.com.  Her great newsletter there.  You must subscribe in the iot podcast with Kevin Tofel.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  I had a caller ask about helium.  We'll talk about that in a second.  But I do want to introduce the other guy.  What's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got my moral panic shots.  I am inoculated against moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's about time somebody did that.  He's the director of the town night center for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newark.  School of Central, School of Graduate Journalism at the City University.  Where did that come from?  Lob Opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What show did I miss that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You missed yesterday's fantastic Google I.O. keynote.  Keynote.  That's what you missed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the music beforehand was actually better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's hard to say because it wasn't.  I mean, it wasn't bad.  Is the keynote.  Oh, you missed the blob opera with y'all.  Oh, OK.  Did you see the blob opera stuff?  Do we have some of that we can play?  That I guess blob opera has been updated to feature more music and they had a performing group.  Here it is.  I have a tune yards performing with the blob opera.  And this was the pre show.  It's a machine learning experiment.  And I guess that means they modified blob opera so that it would work with her singing.  So there she is in her socks, rainbow socks with the drums.  She's got a bassist who's.  So I'm going to zip ahead.  Way forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just ahead of time, I want to apologize to the listeners at home for this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So this is a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, that's enough.  That's enough.  OK, more than a moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It worked more than ample.  Well, it was just the pre show.  So it's although I have to say, I skipped that.  Yeah, rightly so.  And you made I think we were all disappointed, Jeff.  I you want I know a new Chromebook.  Well, even that aside, you didn't get that.  You didn't get a pony.  There was no mention of any new products except the return of Wear OS, which puzzled everybody.  Samsung has apparently decided to abandon Tizen, its own operating system that it adopted for its watches and said, you know, it's going to be the next big thing.  Probably because they want to be an Android house or an Android warehouse.  And now they're going back to wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I thought it were in Tizen were going to become the same.  Like they were going to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I thought so, too.  It was unclear.  But then I read some reviews and various things.  And it apparently seems well, let's let's go to the let's go to the verge.  Chris Welch, let's go to the tape.  Let's go to the tape.  It does say Google and Samsung will merge together their Wear OS and Tizen platforms into a single operating system called Wear.  But no, it's where it's not.  I don't I mean, what does that even mean?  I've read this in several other places that basically it's where it's not Tizen where or tie where or where's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we were calling it.  Let's see.  What were we calling it?  I wear tie bit.  Wear tie bit.  That's what we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because there is fitbit in it.  Yeah.  So they say they're going to continue to support Tizen for at least three years after this new product launches.  There will be some features from Samsung like the watch face designer tool that will make the migration.  According to the verge, the unknowns is is the underlying operating system closer to Wear OS or closer to Tizen?  I'm going to tell you right now, since it's running apps from the Play Store for Wear OS, it's Wear OS.  Tizen was a very stripped down.  I don't see this really as being anything.  I said wasn't for smartwatches, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tizen was for it was basically Samsung's OS for everything.  Yeah, they were going to replace Android with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Android, they were going to run it on their smart televisions, appliances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they realized really the big problem, at least for a watch, is if you don't have the apps, it kind of the watch isn't, you know, it's limited to what Samsung ships with the watch.  So and it is the case.  We were wrong.  Well, it's unclear, but I'm going to.  Well, we'll see when they ship.  I guess given that it's running apps for Wear OS that it's Wear OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Wear OS sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not to put too fine a point on it.  Well, no, it really does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Kevin and I, we talk about this a lot because I've been a Fitbit user forever.  But Wear OS, we can blame the lack of hardware.  Qualcomm didn't update its silicon for a while.  So maybe that's why.  Yeah, you absolutely could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And maybe the advantage of Tizen, because Tizen runs very well on the same kind of basically the same kind of chips and Samsung Gearwatch is the same.  Samsung Gearwatch is it runs fine because I feel like it's a smaller, simpler OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what I was kind of hopeful for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, yeah, but if it's going to run Wear OS apps, that's the chief.  By the way, the chief purpose of an operating system is running the apps.  I mean, it's not like there's a big file.  Yeah, it's not like there's a big file system to manage or anything like that on your watch.  I have to think that it's basically going to be where maybe Google, there's probably two things happening.  Google is letting Samsung save face because it is a little embarrassing.  But also Google realizes people like Stacey hate Wear OS.  So that by saying we're merging with Tizen, they're maybe giving people hope.  And you're right.  Fitbit was a big part of this story, wasn't it?  Because this is Google is now officially owns Fitbit.  And this is kind of the debut of whatever it is they're going to do with Fitbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a terrible debut if you don't know.  We're all like, what does this mean?  What's happening?  Typical Google communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't announce anything really because they didn't say we'll be shipping a watch with this new Tios, Tyewear.  Tyewear bit?  Where's I been?  In March or something, they didn't say anything.  They didn't say anything.  They literally they didn't even mention a Pixel phone or a Chrome OS.  It was mostly it was demos of products that aren't even out of the lab.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  It wasn't even well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were you disappointed they didn't mention chip or whatever it's called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because that's all part of they have a separate smart home keynote that's going to happen at 415 today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But shouldn't they if they're so proud of it, shouldn't they mention it in the keynote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Google's so big.  I felt like this keynote was more like trying to explain how Google has been and will be continuing to use AI to make it better.  So like, you know, the photo photography, the taking people out of photographs, the TPU chat, the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you watch the developer keynote afterwards?  I was busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, I couldn't say I watched a bit of the developer keynote.  I had an event yesterday.  Yeah.  So I was having a hard time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some people in our chat room who did watch it said, yeah, you didn't miss anything.  No, really?  It's possible.  And I suspect this is true that the.  This is more of a traditional developer keynote and that a lot of what we have questions about will be revealed in subsequent tracks later in Google.  Like, well, is there a WRO-S track?  Google does tend to do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's well, they've got.  I got excited about the Flutter track, but that was just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know what?  You and Paul Therod are both excited about Flutter.  The other thing that longtime viewers of the show will have noticed is now you may remember before you, there was a woman named Gina Trapani,  we much beloved developer, who wrote a book about a Google product, Google Wave, that was killed almost the same time the book came out.  Yeah.  Poor Gina.  Poor Gina.  But Google Wave.  She was the expert in something dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Wave.  But you know what?  We were all really excited about Google Wave.  Oh, we were.  The idea that you could, that a document wasn't just this monolithic word processing or spreadsheet or slide document.  A document was a container for a variety of data types.  And living.  And that it was updated.  It was collaborative.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Google announced, basically, as far as I'm concerned, and we still haven't seen all the details, the return of Wave with the new technology for Google Workspace.  And you know, I'll pull up the blog.  They're calling it Canvas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But not to be confused with Canvas, the rendering mechanism, but now it's kind of branded Canvas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is, so you can add, mention people in it.  Which is interesting, right?  It will add people.  You have, docs no longer have pages.  You could put emoji reactions, inclusive language recommendations, smarter meeting notes, connected checklists.  Connected means, by the way, that you can assign checklist items to other people and see them in Google Tasks.  Table templates, which include voting.  Your meet will show up directly within your document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So rather than embedding your document in your video meeting, you now embed your video meeting in your document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're actually in the document.  Live captioning and live translations.  Google does that very well.  That'll be built in in five languages.  Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, and of course English.  There'll be a timeline view in Sheets.  So as I remember, you're the queen of the Pert charts.  Pert charts?  So you'll like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of, you know, this seems very akin to what Trello was doing with their strategy.  Is it Atlassian that oats Trello?  Atlassian was doing with Trello and tying, having that become a way to pull in all the information you're working with into one place so you can work on it.  So that's kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we went down a little trip down memory lane, Paul Therot and I, because Trello isn't the most recent version of this, but this has been something we've been, companies have been trying since the 90s.  Oh yeah.  Apple had a plan to do something with IBM that the idea was instead of having document centric workflow.  Well, instead of having, let's see, how did they put it?  Microsoft had Olay object linking and embedding.  That was in Windows 95.  The idea was instead of being file based workflow, I guess is how you'd say it, it was it would be document based workflow.  Instead of having an operating system, it's all in the document.  This is an ancient idea.  Jeff Raskin, who was the kind of the spiritual father of the Macintosh after he got kicked out of Apple, started doing an operating system.  It was completely just all a document.  There was, remember Clarice works with an early Apple company that was a office.  But instead of having a word processor separate from a spreadsheet, you would embed those tools in whatever document you were working in.  I mean, I can go on and on.  That's enough examples.  It's been tried many times and it's always failed, I should point out.  I don't know if that's because humans is too complicated.  I don't know why, but maybe the time has come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe because when you're trying to go ahead.  Sorry, I'm like thinking about sociological reasons it wouldn't work based on how we tend to work at the type of work we do.  But I'm with you.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For some reason, what I noted yesterday is that this has got to be a window on how they work at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or would like to.  That makes or would like to.  Well, see, that's the question.  I mean, is this coming from users saying we want to do this or we are doing this and we'd like a better way to do it?  Or is it more likely coming from operating system of philosophers?  We're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I do think we're hitting a point where we're trying to work more collaboratively.  The tools have gotten good enough.  Think about like 10 years ago, if you were typing in a Google Doc, you might feel uncomfortable because someone's like watching you type.  Right now, it's inane to think that you would be if you're collaborating, not like if you're writing an article.  But if you're collaborating with someone, it's crazy to like pass a document back and forth.  You know, and so I feel like it's both a chicken and egg problem like the people.  It's a it's a process problem.  People have to get acclimated to this.  And I think we're getting there because we're used to collaborating and we're having to pull in information and things from everywhere.  Like writing is no longer the way you communicate an idea.  Think about video.  Think about, you know, tweets.  I mean, you may hate them.  But that's so I think we're we're not 100 percent there yet.  But I look at the type of presentations my daughter does, and they're very different from like things that I used to do.  And I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Name a few things here, Stacey.  What what kinds of things does she do and do they like to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like she does most of she still writes research papers.  But when she's presenting a paper, she automatically does something in Prezi.  Right. And she's actually another way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's kind of what Prezi is, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And she's she's very different paths there that make a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But you can have been a lot of different things in the Prezi to use them around.  So Prezi is it's a presentation tool that is very it's like the hippie PowerPoint.  It gives you motion sickness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just a presentation tool.  Like she uses it not just to present, but she also when she's collaborating with people, they have like flowchart software that they'll use.  Like to share and it's an organizational tool, isn't it?  It's right. I love it.  It's just a different way of working.  Yeah, I guess I just because I don't work that way.  So I'm like, I just write a memo or send an email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're linear.  That might be the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that might be the problem is the humans are kind of linear.  By the way, have you been dying for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree. No, I don't think so either.  I think Stacey's right. No.  Maybe you are boring old man.  No, Stacey said she was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think our work product is historic.  Like writing an article is linear, right?  Because the typewriter demanded it.  Yeah, but when you're collaborating to build like software, you don't actually have to be linear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what's changed is that we and that's what this is for.  This is for people working in teams, not you and me working solo.  But by the way, if you've always wanted to create a spreadsheet from within Google Chat, that is also going to be possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Kevin and I, I mean, what a fun chatter that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? I've got an idea. Let's create a spreadsheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We think about how you pull together the show.  That's a collaboration. Like right now we're sending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. Think about if we could be the show could be in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, okay. Yes, that.  But Jason's head just exploded.  No, Jason is excited.  Put some, you could pull the video from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Put a little bubble of me in the rundown.  I'm sorry, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it is possibly a better way to work.  I think it's culturally difficult.  Because we are used to linear and maybe it was just because we had typewriters.  That's all we could do.  There's also tool fatigue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, when you think about it, Leo, the typewriter, right?  So the typewriter came out in about 1880.  I'm working on this right research right now.  Right. And that was the first thing you notice of a keyboard.  Wow. And so the extension very McLuhan, right?  The extension of the brain to the fingers, to the keyboard, to the page.  And it changed our expectation for writing is now writing mimicked publishing.  It looked finished. It changed the whole nature.  And you couldn't, you know, scratching out was no, no, you had to have this, this clean thing,  this clean, continuous thing, page after page after page.  So it had a, I read a book somewhere here on how there was a typewriter century.  And that it affected everybody's writing.  And now we're breaking out of that. Right.  So now Stacey's daughter is the vanguard here of a different way to think about thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I think also that in many businesses, there are teams,  there are programming teams and there are other teams that are already collaborating in unique ways.  You know, that's well, people hated it, but that's what the idea of the open office was that you could go,  Hey, Joe, are you working on that log in screen?  I'm having some trouble over here.  That kind of thing that you could kind of collaborate that way.  I want to, I'm going to open this up to our discord stage for anybody who is currently working that way  or has any thoughts about working this way.  We were probably the worst. We're all solo operators, right?  So maybe, maybe it'd be better if we got some people who are.  Where's our stage? No, it's the East side live. It says over in the.  Okay. Right. Right. Right.  There's Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  While we're doing that.  So I just got this book too, the filing cabinet, a vertical history of information.  Oh, Jesus. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you think about that's the file system on your computer is a derivative of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Even the icons, right?  Yeah. So this is how we fought for not that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And only because the physical world was organized that way because probably it was easy to manufacture or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there's tons of articles about like how the way we think about our information storage  and retrieval systems is actually modeled on how we model the brain.  So it has like physical correlation to how we think about.  You kidding? Well, then that's. No, there's.  That's poorly for this.  Well, right now we're all into neuromorphic computing.  But before that we had different. What?  I can find the article, I guess, and send it to you because it's really fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the fundamental question though.  And in a way is are we working that way because those are the objects we could build.  And now that we're in a digital world and we can build something different, should we try to build something different?  But if you're saying it's not a reflection of what we could build, it's a reflection of how our brain works,  then any attempt to change that is going to be doomed to failure unless we could change our brains as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's a function of the workloads. Maybe not how I think our brains are pretty adaptable.  I think it's the type of work is probably more relevant there.  Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the way we work is modern work is not there's probably no analog to any kind of work.  And, you know, even I guess in the industrial era and there's been more.  I don't know if you're building a cathedral, I guess you're all working collaborating on a project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it feels like a big mistake was to think that computers would mimic intelligence and mimic human intelligence and that that made the goal entirely wrong.  Well, instead it's an aid to our work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this was the big debate Jeff Hawkins had. He was at Palm.  Computer handwriting recognition, most notoriously with the Newton, was a flop because they were trying to get computers to recognize human handwriting.  And Jeff said, you know what, we should do something else. What if we slightly modified our handwriting?  In other words, accommodated ourselves to the computer and he created graffiti, which was the.  If anybody who had a palm knew that was a slightly modified human alphabet that the computer could do much better with.  So it turned out Hawkins said it's easier for a human to adapt to the computer than for the computer to adapt to the human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Stacey, let me amuse you. I just got an academic paper from 2012. I hadn't read it. I just saw a link to it.  The by Rachel Plotnick, the case of the electric push button.  And it was a moral panic about buttons.  They use the phrase moral panic, not me, because it was kind of hid the technology behind.  You hit this button and you don't know what's happening. You don't know how it's happening.  It's very analogous to today that it's a black box or a black button and the buttons, electric buttons were frightening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People hate abstraction, but as our word gets more complicated, we have to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. Heuristics. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I know I've invited him to the stage. We're going to the stage, but he hasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I put the link in the chat. It's a New Yorker article from 2019 and it's part of their review.  Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. I hope I'm not out of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually to me. This is a fascinating discussion. I'm sure we're putting everybody else to sleep, but I find this.  Well, it's fundamental to computing.  And is it? I think you're right, Stacey. Your point is exactly right.  That the human brain is fairly plastic. We've already learned a lot of, you know, we've all gotten used to being on Zoom.  We've already learned to change some of the ways we do things.  But the question is how plastic? There is some evidence that despite the fact that computer scientists have been trying to do this for more than 30 years, and it's never worked.  Maybe Google can do it. It's puzzling to me since they killed Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is Wave, right, Jeff? Yeah, it is. And I don't think it's not a case, Leo, that Wave wasn't ready at the time.  The concepts, I think, right? The concepts could have been done then. Stacey, you're Stacey.  That's Gina you're talking about. Pre-Stacey Gina was showing people how to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She got it. She got it. But she and maybe because she was a computer programmer and had the ability to kind of not only grok it, but use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a problem. There is a learning curve. Yeah, they got mocked a lot. Yeah, I think that was part of people's, what the heck is this?  I don't make any sense to me. And they didn't see the vision in it. And then you and I, this is still when you were in your optimistic utopian days, were thinking, wow, this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've ground me down, Jeff. I just thought I took over the optimistic utopian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my job now. I used to be, in fact, Dvorak and I, when we were doing radio shows, he was the grumpy skeptic and I was the, this is the greatest thing ever, the cheerleader.  And maybe with age, I've, I think it's mostly Dvorak. Yeah, yeah, I've become much more of a cynic.  This is a great article. Thank you for the link. It's from the New Yorker. It's a review of a variety of books about consciousness.  And you could search for it. It's from December 4th, 2019. Do we have minds of our own? And like all New Yorker articles, I'm going to put this aside and read it when I have time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not one of the longer New Yorker, it's part of the back section, relatively shorter articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have currently 32 years worth of New Yorkers I'll read when I get time to do so.  Yeah. We should get, Kevin, I've asked you, Kevin, if you want to be on the show. Kevin Marks is in our chat room many times.  Hey, Kevin. Yeah, he's been on Twig many, many times. Hello, Kevin.  And I think he would probably have a lot to say about this kind of stuff. He's a super smart man.  He was watching the Google keynote and he's been watching some of the other sessions. He used to work, he was developer at Google, was developer at Apple for a quick time.  Very smart guy, currently an open web advocate. And it would be great if we could get him on.  But he probably would have a lot to say about that.  I don't know if you saw this, Jeff, during Google I.O. yesterday when Google was talking at the end, actually very hopefully, about being not only zero emissions with offsets, which they are currently, but sometime in the next 20, 30 to become, use energy completely generated by renewables, which would be remarkable.  He had an article in 2006 he wrote on his blog about people talking about how much energy a Google search used, pointing out that when you breathe, you're actually putting more carbon dioxide into the air during the search than the Google computers are.  And maybe perhaps if you really wanted to be green, you'd hold your breath every time you did a Google search. So Kevin would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And put something in the rundown later. We can try to practice that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good. A little breathing. All right. Yes.  So what else can we talk about? Oh, Android 12. And did you put the public beta on either of you yet?  No, no, I did immediately because I don't have 20 phones.  This is not my primary phone. So I could write exactly. How is it?  It's good. I like it. I you know, the biggest change you always see in these things is in the notifications panel, you know, that you slide out. And that really does look very, very different. I don't know if you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How well you'll be able to get the full design of the full design is the I it's of course the first public beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were in developer preview three. So I don't know how mature it is. It seems seems reliable. Can you can you see that?  Oh, my camera has been moved because Jason there it is. I knew I could find it somewhere.  All right. There we go. So, oh, wow, that is. Yeah. So let me just slide it down again so you can see it.  So I'm not getting the big wallpaper effects that they were talking about. I tried different wallpapers, the big clock and all that. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't know. I don't know. Maybe that's not yet shipping.  But this is the notification tray. You see the slide. This is a weird slider for brightness. It's a big fat slider on a little thin line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really need that looks like Blob Opera, to be honest with you. I don't know. Maybe it's when you're because you know when you do that, you do it when it's bright outside and you're in the sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So having a darker, fatter line. Yeah, that might be why. Yeah, you are the cheerleader. And then I just go outside. Yeah, maybe you're the only one who goes outside much.  These are the new buttons and you edit them with this big edit button and you can see there's a lot of choices now, including and Stacey, you'll like this. A lot of mode buttons like this is the bedtime mode from digital well-being. You can create.  You can already put a lot of that. I mean, a lot of that's on my smart home thingy that I just pull down. Yes, but now it's part of the system notification tray. So that's kind of I don't know. What do you call that? I can't even remember.  I'm sure they talked about this and all about Android, but you can drag these tiles up. So that's you know, there's more there's more buttons than there used to be. They still do the thing that I don't like. Samsung doesn't do this, which is in order to you know when you first let me go back to the when you first pull it down.  You don't get a gear for hitting settings. You have to pull it down a second time and then you get the settings. Oh, that is annoying. Yeah, that's it. That's an issue there. You're like, you know, you want to mess with your settings. Yeah, Samsung puts it right in the front, but not Google and the settings.  This is this is that new material you kind of look all the buttons around all the icons around. Okay, does anyone else remember? Was it our browsers? Was it Microsoft Word? I think it was Microsoft's office suite. You could customize your colors and stuff for that like in the late 90s. Did you all spend time doing that? Because I did. Yeah, and so that was my first reaction to this is nobody wants to theme. It's a lot of work. Some people do. But but most people.  Yeah, you only theme when you're like a kid and you have nothing better to do, or you don't have any. You want to go around with your phone, but you don't have anything else. Basically, yes. I mean, this is that's I spend that time, you know messing around with my super hyper intensive smart home automation. Nowadays, we have other things to do. But yeah, when you're so that's what it's for. But that's why Google said no, no, no, it's automatic, you could there's a lot more theming capability. I mean, you can just say, yeah, I can make a phone that's really good. I can do a phone that has a really good theme, and I can do a phone that can do a phone that's super good. That's a really good thing.  There's a lot more theming capability. But the idea is it's automatic, it picks up colors from your wallpaper and stuff. So that's what we were talking about. So do you want to hear what I'm excited about? Yeah, I want to nerd for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  minute. I am excited about Android introducing a new privacy friendly sandbox for machine learning data. Yeah, so is that like a secure enclave kind of or? No, it's a software based sandbox. So everyone's like, oh, it's not that secure. But wait, here's what I think is happening.  Wait, there's more. But wait, let me take you into the future. So ARM introduced something called confidential compute earlier this year as part of its next 10 year cycle of chip design, right. And that is actually going to create a separate think about like an OS accessible, hardware based  confidential area on a computer. And that's going to be where developers can put their own private stuff in no one even if you have access to the device should be able to get it right. We don't know exactly how it's going to work. And Google is part of this. Google came and talked about the need  for this. So Google and ARM are clearly talking. I think this is a beginning of that sort of segmentation. And I think we're going to see a lot more of it, not just for our private machine learning data, but for things like let's say you have confidential code as a as a enterprise that you want to run on somebody's phone like an employee's phone, but you're worried that the employer is going to lose it, right. You could actually lock it into something like that. And it will be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no one can access it basically. So Samsung has done this with Knox, Apple does it with a secure enclave. Those are both hardware based. This sort of is because it's using an ARM technology that will make it more secure than just a software folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a privileged space in the OS. So it's not accessible to user applications in the user space basically, right?  Right. But it's not like with the confidential computing, you're going to still have your quote unquote secure enclave or your trusted execution environment for like Intel chips. There's going to be a separate place on the hardware for that.  We don't again know exactly. But so I think that this is prep for that. And I think it's really good because a couple things. We're starting to realize that all of the data around us being collected and my thing of the week is tied to this is really actually kind of personal and upsetting.  So I think it's good that companies are actually realizing this and try to take steps to make it better. And you see Google getting in on this, like even with like their last nest hub, the one that does your sleep tracking, all of that's processed locally on the machine, right?  So now they're just saying, Hey, not only are we processing all the sensitive data locally, well, we're acknowledging it's sensitive. We're going to process it locally. And now we're actually going to try to secure it even better. And I think that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think I think it is a path to the block. I think that the more that they know how to do locally, the less you worry about things going up. And then the question is, in a way, that's what flock is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, but that is my concern. That is my concern, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nope, you're drawing a conclusion that is not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google certainly made a lot of noise about on-device privacy. By the way, they've been saying on-device for just as long as anybody, but they it sounded like they were a little bit stung by Apple and attempting to show that Android could be as secure as iOS and as private as iOS.  But but the I think flock is germane in this sense that Google because they're 99% of their revenue is from advertising. Let's face it.  They are going to always go part of the way towards this, but they're always going to leave a little place for advertisers because that's their business. And so they're going to always kind of preserve their role as a first party aggregator of information, even if they protect you from third parties.  And that's what flock is all about too, right?  Stacey, let me try this on you.  But let me let Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You go ahead, Stacey.  You go ahead. I don't want to try my flock theory on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. I was in a world where you're building products based on data and around context for individual users or companies. Trust is the most important asset that you have.  And I think Google's realized this and is taking steps to try to say, you can trust us.  There's a difference.  There's a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the most important thing to your customer.  And for Apple, the customer is the buyer of the phone. For Google, the customer is the advertiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Google's recognizing though that their customer, they have to serve two masters. They may not be able to do it well.  And I also think they recognize that eventually search and advertising, they're going to have to have new business models.  They can't do that forever.  So they have to, they're kind of like, you remember when all like this was probably in 2008, 2007 when all the carrier, the ISPs were like, oh man, we are going to have to make money on data somehow because voice and long distance and all of that and landlines are not going to help us.  And they did this very fine balancing act for quite some time before their revenues went over to wireless.  Google's in that same position.  What are the Clayton Christensen and the dude?  Yeah, yeah.  Innovators dilemma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, they're going there, but only kicking and screaming only if they have to.  And I think what they're trying to do is to do enough to appease us who are not the real customers.  We are the product.  Everything Google does is about gathering information about us to sell the advertisers.  That's everything.  Right.  From Android on down.  And so their problem is, yes, there is a tension now and their product, us, is starting to wake up and say, hey, wait a minute.  I don't want you to chop me up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So are we the free range chickens in this situation?  We used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all right.  They're trying to do it.  Actually, that's an apt analogy because there is a place between keeping a chicken in the dark in a tiny barn if it's whole life and having it run around on the prairie.  There's this intermediate place where chicken producers who want to say free range are putting chickens that allow them to be as if they still get their heads chopped off.  They still get the production up.  So I think Google's trying to hedge their bet and kind of have it both ways.  They understand the consumers are getting pissed off, but they also know they have no business model if they appease consumers.  So they're going to do just as much appeasement as they have to.  That makes sense.  Yeah.  They're going to do more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they might do a little bit more only because they're right now stuck in kind of a three or four way race.  And you can't be worse than Facebook.  It's unclear how much like where Amazon's really kind of drinking from the ad Kool-Aid and people are starting to trust it less.  So I think Google's kind of if I think about the way my feelings about how my data has been used over time have shifted, Google is looking better to me than Amazon.  And I used to be like, well, yeah, Amazon's taken all my data, but they're never sharing it.  And now I'm like, Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Amazon's in the ad business now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're in the ad business, but they're more specifically, they're not just advertising.  They're actually using my data to make me want to buy things that I don't think I want to buy.  So it's not just like advertisers.  They're not just selling my data to advertisers who want to advertise to me.  Amazon's using my data for itself against me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's I guess my fear is for you, Stacy, for your interest.  They know best.  They're paying lip service to privacy because they know they need to now.  But I don't.  It's not just lip service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're actually taking steps that do benefit a user's privacy.  Oh, no, they are because they have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he's talking about the motive.  Leo's talking about the motive more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know about motive.  Let's not forget who is Google's customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where to to where does the money go come from that Google spends?  It all comes from advertisers.  We know that we look at just look at the quarterly results.  So their their customer, their business is selling advertising.  So we can't forget that.  And that's, you know, for people who defend Apple, I don't think Apple, by the way, is as clean either.  But to people who defend Apple, they say, well, all you have to do is look at the business model.  It's clear who Apple's customers are.  All their revenue comes from selling hardware and services.  So I'm just a little skeptical.  But I was. Yeah, I agree with you.  I'm very gratified that Google is paying more attention to this.  They've always said on device and stuff like that.  This is not new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the capability to do that has gotten greater.  That's the point. Yeah. Right.  And the greater it gets and the more it gets exploited, the more you have some control over it.  Other than the question is, what's the transparency of what happens on your device versus elsewhere?  What faith do you have in that?  Lots of other questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also think Google is watching carefully because there's people like us who are beating the drum for privacy.  But I think they're also looking at normal people and saying, have they noticed?  I know Facebook's doing this. Do they notice?  Do we get away with it?  They're trying to figure out how much real people care.  But it's become more and more apparent when you see a statistic like the fact that 96 percent of people with Apple's iOS 14.5  checked the box and said, do not track, 96 percent.  That sends a chill down Apple, Google and Facebook's spine and makes Apple think.  Which Apple?  Well, Apple doesn't yet have a real advertising business.  I mean, they're working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're working on a services business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But the services business they charge for.  No, no. But they charge for it.  Look, I don't pay for almost Google Mail, Google Docs, almost everything I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I got that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I do and I get worse service.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually our company does. We have a workspace account.  But most people don't.  And so there's another.  Look, if you're using Gmail for free.  Yeah, I know Google's not looking for stuff in your mail to advertise to you about anymore.  But you've got to figure there's a there's a reason Google's given you all of that for free.  I mean, and by the way, YouTube, you think YouTube doesn't know everything about you when you go watch on YouTube?  It really it really frosts me because we have a lot of viewers who say, oh, you put ad tracking into the feed.  We don't. It's not exactly ad track.  But anyway, you oh, you're logging me.  So I'm going to watch your shows on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like, dude, you think Google's really tracking you on YouTube?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course they are.  YouTube's free for a reason.  Anyway, I don't I don't want to belabor this point.  I think it remains to be seen.  We're doing the change log. This is going to be like a change.  The whole show is going to be the change.  The whole show is like a change log.  Yeah, I will take a look.  Yeah, there's a lot of new stuff.  I want to talk more in just a second about that.  Actually, there is a lot of new stuff and a lot of nothing.  But right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there's there's a something you want to hear my favorite something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stay tuned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacy's favorite favorite something coming up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Nureva.  If you're going back to work, you're going to get back in the conference room.  But of course, social distancing still is in effect.  It's got big implications for meeting room audio.  For instance, you know, not only going to have to keep six feet apart,  but it may be that you can't place people the same way you could.  You're going to need good mic coverage.  You're going to want people to be able to hear what you're saying in this meeting space.  But the traditional way of doing it is not going to work.  Yeah, you say beamforming systems. What about that?  Nope.  They often require adjustment from an expensive technician.  Plus, you'll have to sit in a specific spot.  Tabletop systems require additional mics.  They have to be sanitized between meetings.  Both systems require participants to change behavior.  They can only face one way.  They have to sit and, you know, you're going to mark the spot where they have to sit with a piece of tape.  Wouldn't it be cool if there were a way to get clear, reliable audio,  let your team act naturally and still feel safe, still socially distanced?  Socially distanced? That's called Nureva.  And it is a scientific miracle.  N-U-R-E-V-A.  They've got four patents for what they call their microphone mist technology.  It's the first socially distanced mic system.  Microphone mist, in effect, puts thousands of virtual microphones in the room.  And there's no adjustment or adaptation necessary.  The audio automatically adapts to however people are sitting, wherever they're facing, whatever your room configuration.  And they have systems for big, little, and giant spaces.  Their HDL-300 system is the first microphone and speaker bar to be certified for large meeting spaces up to 15 feet by 28 feet.  And by the way, it's Teams certified.  It fills a room with thousands of virtual microphones.  You get true full room coverage.  People can be heard from anywhere, no matter where they're sitting, no matter where they're facing or how they're distanced.  That is really nice.  And you don't need to bring in a technician.  It's just like installing a sound bar.  Frankly, the microphone and speaker bar are a single unit.  You put it up on the wall and you're done.  With Nureva, you get a console that puts device management into your hands and on your terms adjust settings, install firmware updates.  Look how nice that looks.  Check device status and more all from a secure cloud-based platform.  And of course, consoles included with every Nureva audio system.  By the way, when you enroll your system, I found this out, you'll get an extra year of warranty free.  So enroll your system.  Nureva Audio Products have won numerous awards.  Top New Technology Award at ISE 2020 for the Nureva HDL-200 system.  No matter the size of your room, they have a full line of systems for small, medium, and large spaces.  HubSpot uses Nureva.  Their principal collaboration engineer, Jimmy Yan, said, quote, We were so impressed with the sound quality, ease of install and ease of use of the HDL-300.  It was a no brainer for us to adopt it.

He's an expert on all of this stuff.  So you watched.  I saw your tweets.  You actually been watching a lot of Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I watched the opening yesterday with you guys.  And then I watched that particular episode today.  So the Chrome episode.  There was a weird tease that happened halfway through the morning.  Oh, the morning for me, which was we're adding feed reading to Chrome.  I'm like, really?  Adding what?  Adding feed reading to Chrome is like you're doing what?  RSS feed reading?  RSS in Chrome, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I saw this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm interested in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything old is new again at Google.  They killed Google Reader.  They killed Google Wave.  And now they're bringing them both back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus is next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think what's happened is that everyone who's old enough to remember has left and they've got some new product managers who come in and they're like, you know, it would be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Had some sort of I don't know, could be XML or JSON format where you could know what was on the page.  It would get updated whenever there was a new post.  How can we do that?  She's Louise.  I love to see his blog rolls.  Yeah, they're coming back to.  So they're going to put there.  You don't need a special app.  You just use Chrome.  Yeah, let me find.  Hang on.  Let me find the book.  That's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Please do throw that in the chat.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Used to be you could actually go to RSS colon slash slash.  I think or maybe not.  You just go to the XML.  Let me go to Twitter TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think that was the fire that would render actual crime.  It's the fire and Firefox both rendered it.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is our is it feeds dot XML?  What is our I can't remember what our RSS is.  Well, that didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I find it.  Hang on.  I'll just get in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's fair.  There it is.  Jason has posted it in our IRC.  RSS power.  No, not this.  That's the did not find feed RSS.  Let me see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what they what they what they.  They didn't.  Well, they said did say RSS, but they were very much saying it's about we want people to be able to follow people inside Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's a follow button.  Chrome RSS powered follow button and feed that keeps the Google reader dream alive, writes Abner Lee and nine to five Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I stuck the the actual blog post in from Chrome team.  Yes.  Okay.  From Janice and the Chrome team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the I guess this is kind of like follow in a podcast app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like following the podcast sense of follow the feed.  Yeah.  So they picked up the follow over from Twitter and I suppose Facebook has it now too.  So it's a general verb, which is better than subscribe.  Really?  Yeah.  It's kind of clearer.  Yeah.  And what the what happens is you click on this and it adds feeds to the blank tab you get when you open Chrome.  So when you open Chrome and get a blank.  There's a little thing next to it that says you can see the screen shot in the in the blog post.  Here it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's it.  So there's a little follow up.  You can't quite see this bit fuzzy, but there's the little following thing there.  Bottom left.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the new tab page here and it has a for you and it also has following and these are blogs you followed.  And this is the most recent post in the blog you follow, just as it would be in a podcast client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's reverse chronological ordered across the posts.  They didn't say they were hand waving about filtering, but they didn't say we're going to filter anything.  And you click through and you just read the original post in the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's like Twitter for posts.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's like the things that they put on the if you swipe left at the front of Android and you get a bunch of stories there.  It's basically that.  Yeah.  Mobile.  It's mobile only for now.  Yeah.  It's going to be on Chrome Canary in two weeks, they said.  So something for Chrome Canary.  And then they'll there'll be an experiment.  You can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be curious to see what it does with podcast feeds.  I wonder if we'll put a little play button in there.  That would be great.  They said it wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't a podcast and it's not using the same engine as the podcast engine.  So this is classic Google don't do itself again.  Because obviously because Google podcast podcast, you can Google search and there's subscriptions in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in a couple of years, Google will announce a Google I.O.  And now you can follow binary files like podcasts, like audio shows.  They will have reinvented the podcast.  It's going to be a very exciting time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With AI.  You forgot the AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  I forgot AI and blockchain.  That'll be in there.  That in there too.  Yeah.  What?  So we have yet to find anything we're too excited about.  Stacey was excited about Tizen and Wear merging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we know.  I did.  Oh, yeah.  What else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The actual future.  OK.  Project Starline.  OK.  You are excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is real.  You are so wrong on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But go ahead.  I thought it was neat because I think it was neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I won't deny it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You I saw the infrastructure.  There's a lot happening in the background to make there have like no background to standardize  this.  But I still thought this was like, oh, it's like a vision of the future where you're like,  oh, this could be the future.  That's kind of fun.  So show people.  It's a 3D rendering or it's a 3D version.  Here's the picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's using something that's well known called a light field technology, which gives  you it's the only way to do 3D without special glasses or headsets.  And I've actually seen it in action at CES last year.  They had a number of people.  Sony was doing it.  A number of people were doing light field displays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I haven't seen that size before.  That is never been this big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was much more like a little box you put your face in.  That's what I've seen.  That's interesting.  But there's reasons for that.  For one thing, it's not very bright.  So this is misleading.  It would have to be a darkened room if it's going to work.  And because, you know, this is a prototype, we don't know how much it's going to cost.  But I think that size, I bet it's not cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it reminded me of remember when Cisco was launching all their fancy telepresence  stuff and you had to go to like a hotel to use it.  It reminded me of that.  It's light field projection.  These things come down in price.  It also, I mean, the way people were, it was like talking to someone like who's in jail,  like through the clear plexiglass, you know, where you're on one side with the phone.  It did, but it was still neat.  And I get excited like about commercialization of technology that could do something like this,  especially as, you know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the only reason I'm skeptical is we've seen a lot of attempts to do these kinds of things  and they're always disappointing in the long run.  It's probably very expensive and it's only marginally better than a screen.  The fact that you could kind of turn your head and see a little of a 3D effect  does not make it somehow magical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is not the 10X thing, but I will say we had thought about video call.  I mean, AT&T had a video phone back in like 1960.  Yeah, that really took off too, by the way.  It took a long time, but we're there now.  Think about things like this.  I saw that too at the World's Fair in 1965 at the New York World's Fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And here it is.  Let me do some quick math.  Fifty-five years later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would argue a little sooner.  This is the perfect Stacey Optimist versus Grumpy Leo.  I've turned into a grump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A 65-inch light field display is Google expensive, I think, but maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're right.  And remember, you have to have one at both ends.  Anything that normalizes new technology, I get excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. You do need one at both ends.  And a piece of wood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. Kevin and I were talking about it.  I just got a fax machine and I'm like, haha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's being transmitted over WebRTC.  I don't know how you feel about WebRTC, Kevin Marks, but I...  It's not too bad.  I mean, it's not too bad.  There you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's standardized.  I mean, 20 years ago when we were doing it for the first time, this stuff was hard.  It's now everyone's doing it.  And I was trying to sign and say, it's like, oh, I haven't got that video chat app.  We've got six different ones now.  Because we pretty much standardized it and we know how to do it.  So I'm comfortable with being able to do that.  It's just that there's going to be checking a bit more data over it.  So they're going to have data issues.  But I suspect what they're primarily doing is using this for, you know, inter-Google conferencing.  Lauren Good did write...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're actually not using it.  They're not using it.  They're just playing with it.  They're just showing.  Lauren Good got to try it.  She's writing in Wired about it.  And she said it.  It was pretty amazing.  So, you know, she actually...  I met with three separate Googlers in Project Starline, all of them men.  And some of the surreality faded each time I shifted in my seat, moved to the side just a few inches.  The illusion of volume disappears.  Suddenly you're looking at a 2D version of your video chat partner again, similar to the way a sporting event looks great on your big screen TV  until you move too far off the sweet spot.  There were also, and I think this is WebRTC, a few random artifacts fluttering on screen,  broken bits that served as occasional reminders the person in front of me was not really there.  And when one of the demonstrators started casting a web page onto the light field display as an example of how two people collaborate in Starline,  we both just stared over each other's right shoulder at a not quite interactive page.  There seems to be work to be done.  She asked, will it take five more years?  The Google men did not seem inclined to answer.  Google says around 100 employees have used Starline.  It has been tucked away in secret offices in Mountain View, Seattle and New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could go play with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure we could get you an invite.  I'm not against it.  I just think that, remember, this is prototype.  This is not a Google announcement of a product at any point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, look, I don't feel like I'm going to die within the next 20 years.  So I'm excited.  Maybe that's my problem.  Maybe that's my problem.  We're just pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not going to get it.  I'll be dead by the time that comes out.  So screw it.  Did you see anything that we have overlooked that was really exciting, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, anything was.  I mean, a lot of it was, um, it was like retelling the things that we really knew about.  Yeah, that was my thought.  And it was a little bit, because it didn't seem that themed.  It seemed a bit Conway's Law-ish.  It was like, here's the guy in charge of this department.  He's got his demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It totally felt like that.  I even said that, didn't I, Jeff?  I said they sent out a memo to all the departments that who wants to present a Google I.O.  And then they had a lottery or maybe they had a, you know, they had a battle royale and the survivors got to present.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because the Apple keynotes were very much that.  The Apple keynotes were like, OK, bring with your best demos.  And if they're good enough, Steve will do them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, but they were in any.  And the difference is Apple was announcing products.  Google is not announcing products.  They're just talking about their work.  It was announcing thoughts.  Thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, Apple wasn't, you know, at WWDC, the developer day, I mean, they announced hardware there now.  But the developer thing was, hey, here's what we built this year for you to get involved with apps on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what you're saying is this is like an Apple keynote from 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Except that it's not as coherently themed, you know.  They did bring in lots and lots of people.  I mean, there was a theme.  The theme was AI makes things better.  And we're working on AI and we're trying to be private about it.  And we're not going to mention the elephant in the room about the people who've quit.  They made no mention of the AI ethics issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Timnit Gebru mentioned it, but they didn't mention the people who worked on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They mentioned about improving things for improving.  It's part of that, do you think, because AI advances are implemented in software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one, you don't get a lot of shiny new devices.  But two, AI advances are usually fairly incremental, right?  So I'm just wondering if we're going to enter into this era of meh features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Casey Newton called this the biggest changes to Docs in a decade.  He was quite excited.  And he also said it may not be enough.  But Docs has not been a sexy glitzy product for Google ever, probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We want it to be a sexy glitzy product.  No, it was good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It got the job done.  It's authoritarian.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's the point.  I mean, the thing about Wave was that Wave was, oh, we're going to do it a whole new way.  And Docs was, okay, we quite like the editing together in parallel thing.  We'll take that and we'll keep the document model we already got.  And a big chunk, Docs used to be a bit more radical in that it was very web-like.  And it got more document-like over time as they showed it to more Microsoft users.  Microsoft users said, I haven't got this little thing I wanted.  And of course, Microsoft Office now has caught up with Docs pretty much.  I mean, it's not quite as clean, but you can edit in Word and it'll appear on the web to other people.  And the curses will appear and stuff will work.  And it puts little warnings up saying, don't join at the same thing.  Bad things will happen.  But they're sort of there.  So I think Google said, okay, what can we do that rebuilds this in a different way?  What can we bring in that we've already got?  And I think part of what you said is also them, it's solving the problem that they have,  which is we're trying to collaborate with eight people across six time zones to try and agree that the product release,  which is like, okay, that's a problem that you have.  That's not a problem that many of us have.  I mean, okay, I guess we're across four time zones here and we're having a conversation about stuff in a spreadsheet.  So I guess we're doing it too.  But the particulars of the demo was a bit weird.  By the way, it's a Google Docs spreadsheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to make sure you...  Yes.  Yeah, I've been trying to get that moved over to Notion or some other more modern thing.  That's one of the problems Casey raises is Google here has to deal with the picky you.  He uses that word, the picky you needs of Microsoft Office users.  And so it kind of unfortunately keeps them.  It holds it back.  Tamps down.  Whereas there are a lot of startups like Rome and Notion, you know,  and I can go on and on that are doing really interesting things with Docs.  I get such tool fatigue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got one colleague who is brilliant, absolutely brilliant at knowing every tool.  But then he presents 50 tools to the faculty and we all, our heads explode.  And we just think, give us Docs again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what happens, I think.  I think you're right.  I mean, Airtable valued at $5.77 billion.  Notion raised $50 million.  Coda raised money at a value of $600 million.  These are all companies that are innovating because they don't have the innovators dilemma.  They don't have to preserve any incumbency at all.  They can start with a clean slate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's also, I mean, Google was preserving Microsoft's incumbency to some extent.  Docs ended up with a floppy disk button originally because people were scared that it wouldn't work.  So sad.  So sad.  But no, but that was it.  They built this thing that's like, we're going to edit stuff on the web.  And they gradually converged on Office because everyone was used to Office.  And I've been editing a long doc in Word this week.  And I forgot how annoying it was.  And it's still like, I'm switching between outline mode and print view mode and web view mode.  And the images disappear in outline mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin, have you tried any of the more modern tools?  I've been using Roam and Notion.  I've tried Roam.  I've used Miro.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Miro.  I think someone mentioned that as well.  That's a sort of collaborative canvas thing.  So if you were doing like post-its-on-the-whiteboard type collaboration, it's designed for doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's much more kind of graphical whiteboard-y.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So you were talking about, it's like multiplayer Prezi.  You're basically arranging visual things in a space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can show it, John.  I have it on the screen here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you will get to be in the box and move things around and collaborate on a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This actually looks like what Google demonstrated, to be honest with you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it may be a bit like that.  They may have learned something from this.  But it's very canvassy.  So what I've done with...  I've used it in, you know, the sort of places where you'd have the big meeting with the  company and you'd put post-its-on-the-whiteboard and come up with strategy.  This would be less desirable for a text presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  You wouldn't want to write in this.  No, you wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, this is more like, I've got a bunch of ideas.  Yeah.  I have come to hate post-it note meetings.  I see post-it notes and I run.  Yeah.  Oh no, brainstorming time.  Design thinking.  Break out time.  How do you plot out your books, Jeff?  Oh, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do you plot out your books, Jeff?  Oh, Stacey.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  I'm not sure.  Do you use an outliner, Jeff, at least?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Nope.  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nope.  No.  Nope.  I use what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I use?  What?  A pile of whiteboards.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  To hold the post-it notes.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well like, because you're like, this is an idea I care about.  This is an example of that idea.  You know, throwing things up there.  Yeah.  And then you ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's the point.  You arrange them spatially.  So you put right things on index cards or post-its and spread them around and then say,  oh, these ones belong together.  And doing that kind of thing is actually quite hard in a word processing type interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think outliners do a very good job.  Dave Weiner, the creative ...  That's Dave Weiner.  Yeah, Dave Weiner, the creative RSS, is the kind of prototypical outliner guy.  All of the best outliners, including Moore, are going way back to when on the Macintosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, they're okay, but they're very hierarchical.  That's the thing.  You can put things inside of things and collapse them.  You can drag things around though.  But you can't put them off to one side.  Side to side.  And then bring them back later.  So the thing about arranging index cards on the thing and saying, okay, these ones definitely  belong together.  I'm not sure which order this story goes in.  Oh, that one goes there.  Sort of the storyboarding thing or that kind of arranging the ideas part is easier with  the spatial thing.  So that's why I like Notion.  That's why I like Pressing as well.  Pressing is good for that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Notion is another ... but this is what happens.  You get tool fatigue.  Notion is another way to do that kind of thing with cards.  It's pretty and you can drag stuff around, but you can also dig into it.  So you can get text.  You can also ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you put three cards on the screen and put them side by side?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, totally.  So here's an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use whiteboard, eraser and arrows.  Oh no, that should be up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't do that freeform annotation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're not doing that ... what was the other one I was playing with the other day?  So here's ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think there are so many tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is interesting.  These are trips you've taken in a text list or table, but then you can also do cards.  Yeah, everybody has a different way of doing this I guess.  This is Notion.  It's not the perfect tool, but I think there's really interesting stuff being done frankly  in these tools.  Oh yeah.  Rome research is really interesting too.  I don't know if you've played with that at all, but these are all ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it Rome as in moving or Rome as in the city?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  R-O-A-M.  R-O-A-M.  And it's a note-taking tool.  It has a ... you know what it really is and Kevin will recognize this immediately.  It's a wiki.  But it's a wiki with backlinks.  And I mean if I say that it minimizes it.  It's really a note-taking tool, but because it supports backlinks it ends up being kind  of a wiki in effect.  It's very powerful and there are people doing some amazing things with it as well.  So that's what I'm saying is that ... and that's what Casey Newton was saying is it's  going to be tough for Google as an incumbent, especially an incumbent that has to appease

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft Word users.  Is that where this new model works though?  You can embed the Microsoft Word document in your Google document.  Fine, it's there.  You can see it.  You can change it.  You can get to it, but you can have all this fancy stuff around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think I like the model.  I thought Wave was great too though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I did too.  I thought Wave was changing the way we worked.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well sometimes you just got to wait till that comes around to that.  Don't I mean ...  It could have been ahead of its time.  ... just because Wave didn't succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think it was.  So I stuck another link in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, this is how we would work if we were in a collaborative environment.  You would just put that on the show and it would appear in the screen.  I'm really, actually really intrigued by the idea of doing the kinds of shows we do in  a much more kind of, you know, with text and images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's another screen here that you can cut to.  Kind of an integrative environment.  This is what we do in class, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or your dude that you had on.  He did Evernote.  What's his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Phil?  Phil Libbon.  Yeah.  In fact, Maggie in her article mentions ... This is her article at maggieappleton.com.  The linear oppression of note-taking apps.  She mentions Evernote, but also Notion, also Roam, also OneNote, Bear, and Obsidian, all  of which I used and have used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was thinking about his next thing with the video cameras where you can throw up the virtual  camera so you can throw up things like you do on a TV news show, but you could actually  integrate that into the actual performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You like the coda of Maggie's blog post, Jeff.  Surely Gutenberg has something to answer for.  Who's to blame for our linear textual predicament?  McLuhan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The line, this sentence is an example of it, becomes our organizing principle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cool with Gutenberg.  That goes back to our original conversation, Stacey, of is nature a nurture?  Is it learned or is it representing how our brain actually works?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or let's get us our favorite gift.  Why not, Bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do feel like the thing that is most interesting, and I'm sure Kevin, you feel the same way  about the technological world we're living in, is that it does kind of take the cards  and throw them up in the air and say, well, it doesn't have to be this way.  It doesn't have to be a linotype or a line of lead.  Watch it.  I know, Jeff.  It can be something else.  But ironically, we're still, I mean, honestly, we're still doing typewriters.  They're just digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's exactly the point.  Yes.  And what are we doing on our phones?  We're trying to replicate the keyboard sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe it's time to think outside the box a little bit, except the human brain is so  boxed that you got to think outside the QWERTY.  Outside the QWERTY.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's why Stacey's daughter is the key person here.  You know, that's right.  I said, when we watched yesterday, what struck me was that Google is the language company.  More than any other company, it knows how to try to understand what we're saying.  It's about words.  It's about words.  Yes.  To translate that into other languages, into actions, into conversations.  It is really a language company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Words are the atom of Google's matter.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing is, they do images too.  They've done a lot of work with processing images, partly to attach words to them, you  know.  And they can be a little bit literal.  I was searching for a picture.  I was searching for my son.  So I was searching for Andrew and Christopher at the beach.  And I didn't find the picture.  I said, Andrew and Christopher at the sea.  And then it found the picture because the one I wanted, there wasn't any sand in it,  so it didn't count as a beach.  So it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How interesting.  That's really interesting.  Google has clearly never been to the Pacific Northwest.  Look at this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All our beaches are rocky.  Yeah, there's no sand on those beaches.  This is something Kevin put in the chat.  This is kinopio.club.  This is really interesting, Kevin.  I've never seen this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is the...  This is a fun idea.  You can create cards.  You can move the cards around.  You join them together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look, they even have audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're pulling those cards in from other sites and services?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you can create them.  I'm not sure you can insert pictures and things, but I'm not sure you can import them for something  else.  I suppose you could.  I'm not sure.  I have to play with it.  This is one of the things that I looked at and thought that could be fun to play with.  But again, it depends...  Part of the reason that we haven't had these recently is that you need a big screen to  do this stuff on.  So when you're out on your phone, it's impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we're sitting at home on big screens again.  Suddenly these kinds of tools...  And a mouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a mouse.  Maybe you could do this with touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you could do it with touch, but it would be fiddly.  You could do this on an iPad, with a pen or with a finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For Stacey's kids and others in that younger generation, a touch is important.  And iPads maybe are the future.  Or is that too linear still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they can do...  My daughter will definitely come in and try to touch my monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does she use an iPad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She uses an iPad.  She uses a MacBook.  She can do anything.  She doesn't care probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She cares less than we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She uses whatever tool gets whatever...  If she's writing a paper, she's going to write it on a keyboard.  But if she's doing a presentation, she will often do it on a tablet type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I think part of this is we're still trying to articulate these kinds of flow things as  well.  Because programming is, again, we're trapped in a linear code.  But actually what we're building is lots of things that interact and plug into each other  and wire things up.  But you still end up having to express that in code.  If you remember, Yahoo pipes was like the thing where you say...  I knew you were going to say pipes, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was so excited.  We should point out the late lamented Yahoo pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's gone.  Yahoo killed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But a lot of the way you write code these days is you are saying pull this thing from  here, wait for this thing here, and then if it works, do this thing.  So you're doing flow charty things, but you're still writing them in prose.  The programming tools...  Well, there are programming tools that do behave like that, but there's...  What about hypercards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, Bill Atkinson thought about this in 1984.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Kevin just gave us the bridge though, which is the language piece.  What was that whole conversational thing yesterday with what's called...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, think about all the no code, low code things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  It was language becomes code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but the problem is that the language is...  You've got to make it accessible to more people, right?  What we're doing is we're basically bridging all the...  If you think about APIs and services, which every company should be building, right?  So if you think about that, your whole mission in life is to pull together these services  easily for people.  And we have to be able to do that because we're relying more on computers, we're relying  more on data from so many different places to just do our jobs.  So yeah, this is where we're heading.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Google hears your words, understands your intent, takes an action on your behalf.  That's programmed.  And the question is, do we have to speak its language or can it start to speak our language?  It will start to speak our language.  When this happens, do that.  That's programmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I have to point out these days, I mean, if you're using Prezi, you're programming.  Admittedly, somebody has written all the code underlying, but by any time you're putting  things together in a space, you're writing code.  This is in effect, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, think about it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kevin's the only programmer here, so I shouldn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think about MacGyver, okay?  When you're putting duct tape or when you make something work, I'm like, oh, this doesn't  work.  So I wrap a rubber band around it or I fiddle with it and I kind of...  I'm technically engineering, right?  And I'm not engineering at the high level actual engineers do, but I am.  I'm solving a problem with physical tools.  And with programming, it has been historically a very complicated esoteric thing, but what  we're doing is we're again putting in layers of abstraction.  So we're now using our digital world just like I would use tape to fix something in  engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  And for yourself, not for scale, not for everybody.  You're not trying to make something that is productized.  You're trying to accomplish something for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So it's a business.  I mean, maybe it's a business task.  I think I need to pull in data from five different places to figure out if whatever I'm doing  in my job works out.  But yes, exactly that.  And we're just learning how to manipulate digital files and digital services in ways  that are accessible to everyone, not just programmers.  Also, the programmers are going to hate it if we call it programming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think they know though by now there's low level programming, there's high level  programming, and then there's assembling that is anything that's creating something new  out of life hacks.  Yeah.  I mean, all of that is coding.  It's just at different levels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But most of coding these days is connecting different things together.  Yeah, it's pasting.  And also like spreadsheets are that.  What you just described is pretty much a spreadsheet.  Spreadsheets already have lots of little boxes that connect together.  Except you can't see them because the forms are kind of hidden.  And Microsoft has just shipped lambdas in Excel now, which is like Lotus Improv from  30 years ago.  But it's the same kind of idea of the formulas can exist outside of the boxes, which means  they can be a bit more broadly applicable.  So there's something there.  But sort of a spreadsheet where you can see the little wires like in that Canopio thing,  that would be interesting.  Which of these cells are connected to the other cells?  Could you explode it out into the sort of guy in the room with the red string diagram?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think a lot of work is being done around this stuff right now.  I think what Google is going to do with Canvas in Workspace is probably going to be the least  innovative of it because they're tied down by all sorts of constraints.  But I think there is some really interesting stuff going on.  Nothing quite does it yet.  But there are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also a data visualization thing.  I was trying to show you this book, but of course if I try and pick a book up, it's  going to disappear because it will seem it's not...  Just make sure it doesn't go to your green screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go.  Oh, too late.  Seeing with fresh eyes.  Every 50 states book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he's been sort of banging this drum for 30 years as well saying what matters is arranging  things with enough density of data and information to explain things to you.  And that was a thing that...  He was originally talking about print a lot and then he started talking about displays.  But now we actually have screens that are dense enough and have enough pixels that  they're better than printing these days.  So you could potentially do the kinds of really dense visualizations that he shows in these  books as part of this.  But we're sort of stuck in a model where we're assuming people are on their phone or on their  screens.  So the things we build tend to have to work on both of those.  They end up being sort of small as well.  That was the weird thing about the feed reader that they were showing.  We're building a feed reader on the phone first.  It's like, well, OK, but I'm only able to see one thing at a time on that.  It's not going to be as useful as a feed reader where I have a long list of things I can pick  on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't want to look at.  Right.  Have you ever been to an Edward Tufte seminar, Stacey or Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I wanted to go to one and I think I got sick or something.  I had signed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really would like to go.  Have you gone, Kevin, ever to see him?  No, I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've bought all the books and I...  Yeah.  This is his latest scene with Fred.  Do you read them?  They don't just sit on the shelf?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I do read them.  Yeah.  No, Kevin's the kind of guy who would read it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is the newest one.  This is actually really good because it's sort of something...  He's the king of data visualizations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's been teaching this for 30 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's super dense stuff.  It's got some great COVID graphs in it and things.  It's very up to date.  But it's also, he's got lots of things about explaining this thing I said in book one,  I was wrong.  You should be doing it like this as well.  So he basically says, the key thing is to plot every point of data that you have and  then in a way that people can look at it and get a good stint of it rather than simplifying  things down to averages or just plotting the lines or those kinds of things.  So it sort of pushes back against the whole ideas of statistics, which grew up because  we couldn't possibly plot all the points.  So we have to come up with some summarizing numbers or whatever.  So he has this, well, there's a great way he starts dissecting a classic PowerPoint  slide and says, okay, so here's the thing showing the growth over the last two years,  but there's only three numbers here.  What if we look at all the numbers that are really there and go through like that?  That stuff is like, yes, that makes a lot of sense to me.  And if that sense of data visualization can flow into the tools that we're using to collaborate  as well, I think that would be powerful.  So my sense is that's the piece that's kind of missing.  And it's something that Google should be good at.  Google is, you know, if anyone's good at moving large amounts of data around, it's Google.  But I haven't seen those kind of tough, deep, dense visualizations coming out of Google  recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm now going to buy this book, by the way.  And then I won't read it.  Oh, Kevin, you won for the day.  He just did his pick.  That's great.  That's great.  Signed one.  Yeah.  Did you get the signed one?  Oh, look at that.  That's spiffy.  Spiffy, man.  You can actually get all five of his books autographed if you want on his website.  Let's take a little break.  I wanted to show you something.  Okay.  Oh, a tattoo?  No, but how do you like this shirt?  This is a linen shirt.  It's nice.  It's a beautiful shirt.  This is my new Untuckit.  I am in love with Untuckit, our new sponsor.  In fact, I was talking with them and of course I got some polo shirts and Untuckit, our shirts  designed not to tuck in.  And it's always been a problem because either shirts have these long shirt tails and if  you walk around, you look like a slob or they're too short, you know, and they have the square  bottoms.  Untuckit has always designed shirts that are just exactly the right length, halfway down  the zipper, actually, technically.  If you're looking for a Father's Day gift, speaking as a father, this is the gift to  give dad.  A shirt from Untuckit.  They have shirts for every occasion.  I'm going to Hawaii in July and I thought I should get some nice linen shirts.  I love linen, but linen is wrinkly as heck.  That's I guess one of its properties, except they have wrinkle-free linen.  I don't know how they do it.  It's kind of magic.  They make these shirts, as you can see, all of them designed to be worn untucked, casual.  It's a tough style to get right, but they figured it out.  And by the way, they have a huge variety of fits, all shapes, all sizes.  We fit everybody from Jason Howell to me to Aunt Pruitt.  It helps you look sharp even at your most casual.  They have performance shirts.  I have a bunch of these at Wicks Sweat.  Polo style shirts.  Short sleeve button downs.  They have slim, relaxed and tall fits.  Sizes all the way up to triple XL.  We call it programmer size.  There's something just right for you.  And I have been getting, I started off with the kind of the casual Untuckit shirts, the  polos and stuff, and now I'm starting to get some of these dress shirts because they're  so beautiful.  And look at, I've worn this several times.  It was actually in my closet all balled up when I, and it's not wrinkled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else can I tell you about Untuckit?  They, oh, here's, this is great.  They test every batch of fabric to ensure the best possible quality and consistency.  So all of their button downs, their polos, their tees, their henleys have just the right  length.  They fit perfectly.  Best of all, they have outstanding customer service.  So if there's anything wrong, anything you don't like, they've got you covered.  And if you're thinking about going back to the office or dad perhaps is thinking about  going back to the office, check out the Wrinkle Free Collection.  I've worn them several times and always get compliments.  You just look sharp.  And long sleeves.  Untuckit does have stores, 85 stores nationwide.  So if you want, you can go and try them on.  Honestly, I've been very happy just ordering them by mail.  There are of course free returns and exchanges.  So there's no risk at all.  I think you're going to love it.  I think dad's going to love it.  If you've been looking for something for dad for father's day, and I'm one of those dads,  my son's always saying, now dad, we got to sharpen you up.  You can't be wearing those cargo pants to come visit me anymore.  I wore an Untuckit the other day.  He said, where'd you get that?  That looks sharp.  So maybe for sons too.  And grads don't forget, Untuckit for the dad, the grad, the son in your life.  Use code or the daughter.  Twit is the code, T-W-I-T, 20% off your first purchase.  You don't have to tell that.  Untuckit is U-N-T-U-C-K-I-T, Untuckit.com.  So go to Untuckit.com.  Again, the offer code is Twit for 20% off your first purchase.  Untuckit, shirts designed to be worn untucked.  When I found out they had linen, I thought, oh, man, I'm getting a bunch of these for  Hawaii because they look nice.  They look dressy.  The colors on these are incredible, but they're also very cool, very relaxed.  Cool with a capital C in a lowercase as well.  Untuckit.com offer code is Twit.  Thank you Untuckit for your support of this week in Google.  Anything else about Google I.O. that we should talk about?  We have a Google changelog, but I think we've probably gone through all of the changelog  already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the sweatshirt that they sent out to the press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's a fascinating story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't notice this.  I wouldn't have noticed this at all because it's-  Russell Holly.  It's gray on gray.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if you can even see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a number on it.  Yeah.  It's literally gray on gray.  You can barely notice it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Russell Holly has a picture at CNET where you can kind of see it.  The number is what?  What does it say on yours?  Same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What does that mean?  But it's far.  Read down.  You'll see what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He coded it.  The characters run down the full length of the left sleeve.  They contain the following information.  Oh, so 8,800 is just part of it.  Parenthesis 162137, 8,800 ampersand ampersand G, closed parenthesis, question mark I slash  O colon left bracket, right bracket, semicolon.  So the semicolon indicates maybe it's a little bit of a line of code, maybe some Python.  I don't know.  What do you think?  Let's ask Kevin Marks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Python doesn't have semicolon, so it wouldn't be Python.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, Python doesn't use those.  They use tabs.  Okay.  Let's enter into the Google search and see what we come up with.  Oh, I find a bunch of articles explaining it.  I'll let Russell Holly explain it.  It's actually the Unix timestamp for Tuesday, May 18th, 2021, 4 p.m. Pacific.  Did something happen at 4 p.m.?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's so silly.  We thought this is when they'd announced the new Chromebook or something, but no, it  didn't happen.  The Pixel 6 is coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, nothing.  Oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's kind of weird.  And you didn't notice it even though you have the sweatshirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well mainly, both Jason and I were noticing how it won't fit either of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's really small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's tiny.  This is the largest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At 4 p.m. it'll expand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need some lessons with Untuck It.  Google Untuck It will be a good thing.  It is the Unix epic time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except they don't provide shirts for women.  So that would be terrible.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to hear Kevin on Lambda.  Yeah, Lambda was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to ask you.  Lambda and Mom.  Lambda is the next step after BERT.  But these are all...  And it's kind of like GPT.  These are all models for speech technology, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But weren't they built using the same technology that built BERT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They mentioned BERT.  Lambda was built using transformer learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's based on transformer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Correct?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  So it's the next iteration of the same throw a large number of large corpus at a large  machine learning thing and persuaded to come up with a simulacra of speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the demonstration they did, which was having a conversation with the planet Pluto and then  with a paper airplane, implied that it's more than just a text-to-speech simulator.  It's almost like ELISA.  It's a conversational AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can do that with GPT-3.  But you can say, I'm having a conversation with Sherlock Holmes, me type of thing, Sherlock  Holmes, and it responds to Sherlock Holmes or whatever.  You can...  Contextually, it's got enough backup that it will generate something that's vaguely  plausibly that kind of thing.  But it's doing the same thing.  It ends up being like really bad improv.  It's like, okay, I'm kind of bored with this thing pretending to be Pluto.  And it was pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know if that was a canned demo or...  But it was really impressive in its understanding of context and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's plausible bullshit is the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's my stock of trade, Kevin Marks.  I don't know why you would do that.  That's exactly the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like, if you can get it to sort of freestyle a bit about pretending to be Pluto, that's  something.  If you actually ask it a question about something that you care about, it'll start making up  random details, plausible sounding random details that are wrong.  So it's not a Google Assistant replacement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unfortunately, they don't have any way you can play with it.  You have to just take their word for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not yet.  But this is literally what the Stochastic Parents paper was about, which is the one  that they got grumpy about and refused to publish because it was saying, these things  don't have enough context, but we will fill in the context from what it's saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  That's interesting, Kevin.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you read the paper?  I don't know if you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On the dangers of Stochastic Parents, can language models be too big?  This is Timric Gebru along with Emily Bender, Angelina McMillian Major and Margaret Schmichel,  who is actually Margaret Mitchell.  I'm not sure why she says Margaret Schmichel.  So their complaint is what?  That the training sets are biased or which we've heard before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's lots of things.  Basically, the size of it is so big you don't know what it's doing.  It's trained on concept for the internet that hasn't been vetted and contains a lot of bias  and historical stereotypes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the issue.  Right.  They say size does not guarantee diversity, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  But if you go down to like section 6.1, around there...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Coherence in the eye of the beholder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So basically what they're saying here, I'm trying to find the sentence.  I dragged out of it yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is such a shame that both Gebru and Mitchell were fired over this paper.  Is frankly stunning and unacceptable.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So risks and harm 6.2, this is it.  The ersatz fluency and coherence of language models raises several risks, precisely because  humans prepare to interpret strings belonging to languages they speak as meaningful and  corresponding to the community of intent of some individual or group of individuals  who have accountability for what is said.  So basically we fill in the gaps in its nonsense.  We project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we always do.  We project.  That's what humans do.  And that's why your child thinks that echo is real as a person or that they're talking  to somebody with a Google Assistant.  And more than projecting personality on it, we project authority on it.  And that's the risk.  Especially because it's coming from Google.  Well, Google knows everything.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And to some extent, Google doesn't know everything.  But it doesn't, you know, it can't actually make sense of things all the time.  And it makes and it's making more.  I'm not sure it's making more errors than it used to, but it's making different kinds  of errors than it used to.  So I was, if I search for my name in the UK, I've searched my name in America, there's  now a professional footballer called Kevin Marks.  So the results are all him now.  I hate it when that happens.  It was probably annoying for him when he was searching before just getting my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My father hates it when he searches for his name and gets me all the time now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is contextual now.  It used to, it used to, you know, this was when we were working on the Google profiles,  one of the business, one of the cases was people should be able to find other Kevin  Marks' than me.  Or you shouldn't, you shouldn't get a blog post for everything, but blogs were what was  made up the internet at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that was all there was.  Yeah.  And if you were a blogger, you were overvalued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was the most leaked stuff and therefore it did very well in the American paper.  Well how do you think as a podcaster, I've felt about that all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't index into podcasts.  You damn bloggers getting all the attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can now.  I know you can.  I don't know if they do.  You should post transcripts.  You do post transcripts.  It's too expensive to make them.  Yeah.  Anyway, good.  Anyway, sorry.  Digression.  If you search for Kevin Marks in the UK, there's someone in Scotland called Kevin Marks who  horribly murdered his wife.  And so it says Kevin Marks programmer, Kevin Marks murderer, whatever.  There's the headlines.  Oh my God.  But in the sidebar, there's a little thing of maybe it's just for me, but there's nothing.  Did you mean this Kevin Marks?  Cause there's a knowledge pad for me.  Right.  People thingies, widgets you go on the side.  Click here for more about this Kevin Marks.  So I click that and it keeps some of the murder bits as well.  So it's basically saying I murdered.  Oh, yeah.  I've got another friend who's an academic who's got a fairly, well, she's not, she's  got a unusual name, but a fairly common name.  But she shares a name with someone who was kidnapped as a child.  So when she searches for her name, it shows a sidebar box for the kidnapped victim, but  with her photos, because there are no photos of the kidnap victim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the problem is because it comes from Google, it's given weight that it doesn't deserve.  And this is what this paper says.  I'm going to quote another line from that same section.  However, machine training systems can and frequently do produce output that is inaccurate,  yet both fluent and again, seemingly coherent in its own right to a consumer who either  doesn't see the source text or cannot understand the source text on their own.  When such consumers therefore mistake the meaning attributed to the machine MT output  as the actual communicative intent of the original text's author, real world harm can  ensue.  And they bring up the case of a Palestinian man arrested by Israeli police after a MT  translated his Facebook post, which said good morning in Arabic to hurt them in English  and attack them in Hebrew.  Because the police didn't understand that that is not an authoritative translation and  it's based on faulty machine training.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But also a lot of the training that parallel language training data for Arabic was based  on defense department sources and things like that.  Translation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So MT is machine translation.  LM is learning models.  So yeah, this is a good paper.  Actually I had not read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's definitely worth reading.  I've put a blog post I wrote 11 years ago, which said the same kind of thing, but I found  a bunch of literary things that refer to this.  Basically these language models are sort of stringing bits of text together.  And there's a great thing in Michael Frayn's Tin Man book from 65, which is literally describing  how this could work in his imagined future.  He wrote this sort of parody of people who were building computers to write prose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when you see these, so here in our innocence, Jason and I and Jeff are watching this lambda.  We think it's dopey that the planet Pluto is talking, but we didn't really understand  the greater underlying hazard of this.  Did you watch it and go, oh boy, there they go again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that was it.  This is the thing.  They didn't get it.  Well, they got it, but they were saying this demo as well.  They probably know it's bullshit.  He was trying to juggle the moon or something.  He did give some little caveats after he showed the working demo.  And a lot of these things is you run it three or four times and you pick the one that's  good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what GPT, if you looked at all the output of GPT, most of it was garbage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But there were occasional gems and it would be, yeah, it's, it's, it will give you some  pieces, but this is the worry of it is not only is the corpus drawn on the web and the  web is full of lies and nonsense and, you know, QAnon, whatever.  But also as these things start getting built, people are going to start using to generate  more web pages to, you know, create sites about something that Google will find.  That was always an issue.  That was an issue with before.  People do it all the time.  It's called Google bombing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they'll, they'll feed it into one language and back to a different language, get a different  bit of prose, or they'll run it through an adjective dropper or whatever.  And it tends to look nonsense, but it's, it can be good enough to fool the search engine  now.  Now, as the search engine gets better and these other things get better at making up  nonsense, you're basically building a distributed generative adversarial network.  You're building a network that's trying to fool one computer with the output of another  computer and iterating back and forth.  And basically that's, you know, we're filling the web with more and more of this stuff and  these generators are generating it and the indexes are finding it and they're feeding  it into the next version generation.  And we go.  So, yeah.  And, you know, the fact that so much of, so much of the sort of public discourse is QAnon  like nonsense now is a worrying part of it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The researchers say we call on NLP natural language programming researchers to carefully  weigh these risks while pursuing this research direction, consider whether the benefits outweigh  the risks and investigate dual use scenarios utilizing the many techniques of those from  value-sensitive design, for example, that have been put forth.  You know, this is actually, this is something that needs to be heard and it's shameful that  Google fired these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I still don't understand, you know, forget they violated a rule or didn't violate a rule  or anything.  Obviously Google's a bigger company than that, no, it's smarter than that.  What was the danger to Google in this?  That this is the essence of a language company?  This is the essence of the problem?  It's kind of an indictment of everything they've been doing.  They do?  Has danger?  Is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they're basically saying, they're saying this large thing that you think is a significant  part of your business is potentially dangerous.  And I think that the row was you need to turn this down a bit and say, but we're working  on it, wasn't it?  That was the gist of what Dean was telling them.  And then that got escalated into firing and endless ridiculousness, which was probably  almost certainly them treating people differently for their racial background and so on.  That was sort of a clear part of that.  Yeah.  But yeah, no, it's and so it does worry me and it worries me when Google is sort of making  trying to make that the centerpiece of what they're showing and sort of sort of sweeping  this aside and not discussing it.  So I think we need to we need to keep reading this stuff and thinking about it very carefully.  Bruce Sterling wrote a thing in Wired yesterday as well, which was his worry is we're starting  to teach the AIs how to sort of fuzz code and experiment with code and hack.  And so they're going to they're going to start when you do that, they're going to start doing  things that people wouldn't think of because that's what they do.  If you if you give if you give something like DeepMind a constrained domain like a game,  then it knows what the rules are.  It knows what the win condition is.  It can do very well.  If you don't specify that very clearly, if you give a real world problem, then it will  probably find loopholes in the rules you didn't even realize were there because you wouldn't  even think that that could be done.  And there's lots of examples of that from AIs and don't know if there were any things  like that in the past.  So there is there is the worry that if you start getting to getting them to debug code,  write code, run testing, they're going to end up end running the financial system or  creating even more non scalable financial panics than we have at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, yeah, fascinating.  I guess we I hate to move on because it's such an important topic, but I think we can  move on. It's it's you know, I think it's fascinating and is I'm glad we could get you,  Kevin, we should have you on more often, I guess is the best best thing I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem was that I was traveling to London a lot, which meant it was I wasn't  anywhere near a good connection.  So that may be less of an issue at the moment.  Good. Where are you living now?  I'm in North Yorkshire. You can still in Yorkshire behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There there there there there.  Those are the Moors, the famous Moors of Yorkshire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that's the top of Rosby Topping, which is just around the corner.  Be careful. I think those are the Moors.  Oh, it's the edge of the Moors.  No, the Moors are flat, but they're on top of the hills.  So that's the edge of the Moors.  So this is like a this is like Rosby Topping, which is a local hill that is like Moorland  and then looks down over the field.  So I'm looking from the top of that across the sea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's like a plateau.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't know that either, Stacey.  I thought they were flat, too.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry. Like, oh, my gosh, all my all my reading of British literature has just been upended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I know. Stay away if you hear any hounds.  Stay well away.  OK, that's all I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, they're kind of like they're like the Chaperone you get in California, except  that it's a different climate, so it's not as dry.  So, you know, when you get the hills that it's they're high enough that they don't have  trees on, they've just got scrubby.  But they're green.  This is a difference.  But they're green because it's wet.  And so, well, they have Heather on and they have like scrubby little.  Would you have Peat Boggs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would Peat Boggs appear in The Moors or would they be on ground level?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'd be lower down.  OK. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just didn't know Moors had height.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But basically, our entire knowledge of Britain comes from literature written in the 19th  century. I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can watch All Creatures Great and Small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love it. And that's in Yorkshire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's certainly here.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I watched the original, which I love many, many, many years ago, and they've remade it.  I wish they would make more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all know my opinion on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. That's because you know what?  This is a deep personal childhood trauma not related to the quality of the of the  literature or the TV show.  I'm just saying it wasn't trauma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was just like a realization that my chosen career path was not the right one.  You weren't. I don't like sticking my hand up orifices.  Yeah. Well, and there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, admittedly, you should be grateful for learning that.  There's quite a bit of that in All Creatures Great and Small, but it is not, in fact, the  most the best part of it or anything.  It's not the thing I tuned in for.  It's just the part she focused on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was very distracting.  I was like, oh, no, oh, oh, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. More problems for Waymo.  I'm going to I'm going to go with the chat room on on this one.  ScooterX posting this historical story from earlier this week, a driverless Waymo got  Waymo's Google self-driving enterprise, got stuck in traffic and then tried to run away  from its support crew.  This is in Chandler, Arizona.  It got stuck at an intersection.  The company sent a roadside assistance team to extract it.  When the crew arrived, the vehicle started to drive away before pulling over and  completely blocking a three lane road.  It lost its mind.  And in fact, if you want, you can you can watch the video.  It's on YouTube. I'll turn the volume down on this one.  This is I guess there was a guy in the car at the time.  Isn't there an off switch?  So he's he's this is a construction show.  He he at one point, he says, well, this is interesting.  I actually have seen this guy's videos.  He takes Waymo's and send and then posts on Reddit and elsewhere videos of his  experience in the self-driving vehicle, which most of the time is pretty, you know,  normal, banal, freaky, but occasionally terrifying.  I don't know if we want to watch the whole thing.  Let me see where let's first go to.  The the more the difficulty that it that it found an unprotected left.  OK. Right lane change.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Traffic cone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it stops at a traffic cone, apparently.  So he called support.  It the rider called support and it said our roadside assistance team is six minutes away.  See, there it is. It's stuck.  It's not moving because of this.  Apparently, this orange traffic cone is confusing it.  And then when the roadside assistance, there's the cone, by the way, there's the cone.  Yeah. It gets stuck behind another cone.  Here's the roads. You could turn up the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now it's blocking the entire road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This poor guy.  Now, what happens if you're the passive driver?  If he gets out to get rid of that, then it drives off without him.  You feel some responsibility.  OK, here's.  Car makes a turn.  Our team is working to get you moving, figuring this out.  God, this would be really kind of.  We're going to have to edit this to make this interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it backed out and now it's blocking the whole lane instead of half of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, now it does look like it's roadside assistance finally arrives.  I like this.  So now they're going to be that.  They exit the vehicle and.  The autonomous specialist side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, exit on the autonomous specialist side.  OK, so there's a probably known as the driver.  Look at the wheels doing something.  I'm a little nervous about the wheels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't want to get out of the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to see it. Oh, oh, it's the guy got out of the van.  And now the vehicle's leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he got.  Uh.  Car took off again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is exactly what I'm afraid of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't they have a control button where they can shut it down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think you just say apparently they don't.  How? How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't this the Silicon Valley thing where it drives into a container  and goes into an island?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just like the TV show. Exactly.  Yeah.  It's like you're at the mercy of this thing that's lost its mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It actually reminds me of how old people drive.  No, in the sense that like,  now, when you throw something or a very young driver,  right, you throw something new and they get frozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we're experiencing that right now with Michael.  He's our 18 year old.  The thing is, the people of Chandler, Arizona are so used to these  idiot Waymo vehicles just doing dumb things that they're just kind of driving around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I assume they have like instead of student driver, they have like AI driver

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  stickers on the big things on the roof.  Waymo, you know, it's a way.  Oh, yes. It's Waymo on the side.  You know, it's. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I guess he's got to do the full walk around to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can see behind him, there's an emergency truck.  I don't know if you can see it, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  should be able to get into that car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. The Waymo operators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just what I've seen them do in the past is walk all the way around the vehicle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then, yeah, apparently it's happened to before.  Anyway, that you should watch the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the car should not take off.  Shouldn't should not move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Should not should not move.  Should is the operative verb.  He owes $30 for this ride.  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And when when this happens to you, do the does the service team  take you where you were trying to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. You certainly don't want to call another Waymo, do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I probably would not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah. So the the he's actually blurred  the picture of the support driver and won't play his voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello. Good afternoon. My name is.  I'm with the Waymo Roadside Support.  He's going to try and get you out of the situation as safely as we possibly can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should have left the guy's voice and the guy's going, why did I make him do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Now he's trying to drive the car.  I just need to make sure that you have drop off destination for Joel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just got in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, anyway, this is yeah, at least it didn't get in an accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm pulling it up right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Miss Miss Miss fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I do have it. So to speak. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fine. We've had enough. Thank you very much.  We're going to we're going to wrap this up because Stacy's got a thing to go to.  So you don't have to. No, I insist.  Besides, two hours of this is more than enough.  Believe me, I don't want that.  TPUs. Do we care? They updated their TPUs.  No, I like it that they're going better.  I like it that they're going for carbon free energy.  Good. That's a good thing.  Yeah, that was kind of it.  That's kind of kind of the whole strike.  Should we play the changelog music and I'll just run through it?  I want to make it the fastest, the world's fastest changelog.  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, the very first item on the changelog is something I'm pretty excited about.  Google Photos got updated. They did talk about that.  They've added a new locked folder so you can put all your nudes in there.  Unclear who it's locked from.  Is it locked from Google?  Does Google have the keys?  We'll have to find out.  Seems like they probably do. I'm just saying.  Historically difficult to do encrypted cloud.  They have new memories and they previewed something which is extremely creepy.  And I think it's really to get parity with Apple.  So Apple has the live photos feature.  When you take a picture with the iPhone, if this is turned on and it is by default,  it snaps many pictures, picks the best still out of that.  That becomes a still.  But if you press and hold the still, you can see a couple of seconds of video  before and after. Very nice.  So Google pointed out that a lot of times you take pictures of the kids or the family.  You take a bunch of images, trying to find the best one.  Well, they're going to take those images, interpolate frames in between them,  basically turning these images into a morph,  which, if you ask me, always looks creepy.  So this is called cinematic moments.  Deep fake.  It's not a deep fake. It's a it's a morph.  But, you know, morphing.  What's between the two things is fake.  Yeah, well, it's definitely you're right.  What's there is not real.  They're going to it's interpolated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a fast fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a fast.  Actually, if you've ever done morphing, which has been around for decades,  it's going to be very slow.  The nice thing is it's it's a pretty quick morph, I guess.  Well, it's doing it in the background.  So we don't know how fast it is.  Presumably, it's quick.  Google has also added a way to unlock your BMW.  Again, parity with Apple, which also can unlock your BMW from the phone.  But so far, it's only BMW that's adopted these  phone is key car key solutions with your phone.  I think that's about it, Kevin.  I'm going to I'm going to give you an opportunity to bring up anything you think.  You brought up a lot.  So I appreciate your appearance here today on a very short notice.  And Pruitt taking the day off because he got his second COVID vaccine,  his sequel injection, as we call it, and and is a little under the weather.  And it's working for any working for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's working. Yeah, that's good news.  Good sign. Yeah. Google did announce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My wife said she couldn't wait to feel bad for a day.  I know I was disappointed. I didn't.  I think I thought, did I get the placebo? What happened?  Android now powers three billion devices.  Google I.O. two years ago was two and a half billion the year before.  Two billion. So they're growing three billion devices.  And of course, they say that to remind everybody  when Apple says a billion phones in your pockets, y'all, that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's important about this is Benedict Evans in a tweet added it up  and said that there are three billion Android device devices,  about 90 percent of which are phones. Apple has a billion plus.  There's another seven to eight hundred  million Android phones in China.  So the total base is now four point five billion out of five point  seven billion adults, which is to say that we are finally now  at the fabled last billion.  Wow. Last billion.  Billion. Yeah.  Well, in the next billion, it's the last last billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. That's pretty amazing.  And those people probably don't ever want a smartphone or can't afford one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or they're just too young for them right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, he's talking about adults.  There's adults, there's more children in the world.  A lot more. Yeah. A few more. Yeah.  I think we can wrap this sucker.  You haven't played any drums yet.  Oh, wait a minute. I was doing the change.  Like I was right in the middle of change.  Like I only did one thing. Sorry.  God, I'm an idiot.  Thank you for keeping me on the track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because otherwise, the universe ends up in disorder for a whole week.  Oh, and bad things will happen.  It's like a nice, like a nice thing.  No, you open the portal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to remember to close it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got to close it.  There are five new Google Maps updates.  Count on one, two, three, four, five.  We're still in the jail.  Reduce heartbreaking with routing updates.  Walk this way with enhancement to live view.  Spot busy areas at a glance.  I thought that was kind of cool.  Although the Spanish steps are always busy.  A map tailored to you, which means if it's the morning, they'll show you coffee.  If it's night, they'll show you a burger.  Of course, immediately the folks in our Discord said,  but what about breakfast for dinner?  What are they going to show you then?  And that's the new stuff in Maps.  We talked about Google's new workspaces, the smart canvas.  We talked about Lambda.  Better Together is kind of Google's response to Windows, your phone,  that allows your phone and your computer to pair together,  to talk to each other, move between your phone and Chromebook with ease,  unlock your car. We mentioned that.  So that's the Better Together segment.  Google is now using Duplex to fix your stolen passwords.  What?  They I didn't I missed this one.  This was in the Chrome segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is where they can take on your passwords and then they can fix things  automatically for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. This is something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is something else. Oh, this is the calling thing.  Duplex was when you called people and they had, yeah, they called.  I called on your place on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Assistant takes over the tedious parts of web browsing, scrolling,  clicking, filling forms. It is what you thought it was.  It is fixing your passwords automatically for you.  So I always thought Duplex was about voice, but me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's just about AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just about AI. So there we mentioned the RSS follow button now in coming to  Chrome and Canary soon.  Google search has added a new Easter egg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You ever know? Stop.  I want to show this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go to google.com, then you can play the drums.  And enter DVD screensaver.  That's really everybody loves the DVD screensaver, right?  The game where you watch the screen.  Oh, maybe. Oh, there it is.  There it is. I'm watching the results and there's a Google.  Remember the DVD screensaver.  You're playing the game where you're waiting for it to hit the corner.  Of course, I don't, and that's because it's a,  it's kind of more of a squarish thing.  I don't know what it'll look like when Google,  should we just watch this till it hits a corner?  It'll be just about as exciting as this show.  Just missed. Just missed. Yeah, really.  This is, this is amusing, isn't it? So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three old guys and Stacey watching a Google go on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, did you, I'm actually scrolling through Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, did you ever, did you ever do this or is it just us old guys watch the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  game? I didn't know there was a game. I mean, I know I had DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And you remember that the DVD, if you left the TV on the DVD screensaver  would come on, bounce around. Yeah.  I didn't know there was a game until fairly recently. So,  but apparently there was, I think it came from the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think calling it a game is a bit of a stretch, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a game for people who have, I think if you've been smoking a lot of special  cigarettes, it's a much more fun game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it feels like something a bunch of people who smoked weed or a bunch of  people who were drinking would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. We've seen it. And that's now you can play it.  The Google change log. All right. Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's next? Our picks of the week, ladies and gentlemen,  let's start our picks of the week. Now, Kevin,  you came here at short notice in the middle of the show. So, oh,  you do have a pick. You're amazing. What is your pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My pick is the map of the internet. So,  are you remember the XKC did this a long time ago? Someone,  someone's made a current map of the internet. If you, there's a link to it,  it lets you zoom in. So it's this like, it's this huge,  huge map with like different land masses with, with,  it looks like a real map, but it's websites.  And their scale to approximate number of users, I think.  Um, so you can see,  so you might find Twitter in there if you look really carefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you think it's in there? It should be. I would hope so.  You're on the internet. Oh, wow. This is, uh, is this,  this is from HalcyonMaps.com. Actually, I'm gonna,  this is one of those places where I'm going to spend more time, uh,  browsing their catalog cause I love maps.  Look at the bottom where Antarctica would be the dark web.  Wikipedia is a, is like Greenland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I think basically they want you to buy this and put it on your wall,  which is, which would be fun. I may well end up doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the queue zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really what you need is something that actually changes over time.  So you need a display that links to software that's continuously updating  this. Yes. Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cause that would be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want the, I want the version of this in SVG.  So I actually searched the text in it rather than actually.  Oh, wouldn't that be nice? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it were a touch screen, you could zoom in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Vcontact,  the Russian version thereof. Duck, duck, go.  Zoom is a pretty big island out of the ocean.  Zoom Island. It's a big old one, but not as big as you know who.  The Island of Google. It's actually a continent. Google Stan.  Yeah. Wow. That's really fun.  Error correcting plateau, Google Contacts, Android TV.  Google has a lot of, somebody put a lot of effort in this. There's TikTok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Major effort. It's a bit of a wrench. I think I will get a poster for the wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's pretty cool. And it all looks like one of those old,  old timey maps of the new world.  And then here's a list of major websites blocked in China. Very handy.  Top website languages, internet users, percent of population.  It is now greater than 90%. Oh no, this is, I see here. This is based,  this is a smaller map and Canada is the only one,  Canada and the UK are greater than 90%. We're actually only, I don't know,  down in the lower numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Canada looks like it's at 70 to 80%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, it's kind of a darker blue. Who's 90% then? Who's the darkest blue of all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think that's up there in Scandinavia. Norway. Norway. Finland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. Largest companies by revenue, highest selling video games,  Tetris number one, Minecraft number two, Grand Theft Auto five, number three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is the same chart only now. So it was 2006 versus two. Okay.  Yes. It's a, it's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Created by Martin Vargik of HalcyonMaps.com.  Good pick of the week. I love this.  I love the colophon, which features 4chan, Google, Susan Wojcicki,  Piyaromi Dar. That's great. Stacey,  you're a thing this week. You teased it a little bit earlier.  I'm dying to see it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. I'm very sad to tell you that right now the site that I was going to send  you to is offline. So I'm going to punt that for next week.  I know I'm really sad. Like I was just on it yesterday.  Boo. So now I'm going to send you to something just bonkers.  I don't have this because I'm not crazy,  but it is the high interiors is making a bed.  Oh, I didn't put it in the rundown cause I suck. Jason, I'm sorry.  It is a 13,000 to $40,000 bed that also acts as a,  Oh, what's it called? A screen. So if you click on the link,  I dropped in there. It is a home theater bed. Oh no. Cause it's got,  it's got sensors in the bed that help you adjust.  Like if you're doing the television, it will raise you up.  And then you can watch things in your little, basically it's a pod.  It's at home entertainment pod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I need that. That's for parents of small children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A certain number of people will be excited by it. Oh, can you not find it, Leo?  I do not have the bed, so I cannot show it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the URL again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is, well, the site that has the best pictures is CE pro,  but that's down. I put a link in the rundown. Oh, I see here it is. Line one 88,  $40,000. Wait a minute. Well, it's up to $40,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Depends on this TV probably. Oh Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you scroll through, you will see. Let's view the slideshow, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Smart home theater bed. You want to come over to my place?  I have a smart home theater bed. We can Netflix and chill. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been fascinated by beds lately. There's been like, I was looking at, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it automatically adjusts the temperature. Look at that as voice control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fancy. It's actually kind of cool. Yeah, it is. Yeah.  Still I know y'all are making fun of it, but  if you had a studio apartment, it'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you spend a third of your life in bed, you deserve a smart bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you spend more like half your life in bed. If you had this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you might look at that. It's got a nice, uh,  it also has a concierge service that starts when the person wakes up  but providing a small clock,  weather updates and traffic information right there on the, on the screen.  So it's more than just a bed. This is maybe where I'm going to retire to.  I was thinking Seattle, but maybe this bed would be, uh, maybe, yeah,  maybe this bed would be my retirement home. It costs enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, wow. You've heard about tiny homes, right? Yeah. Tiny, tiny home, big bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a home, it's small, but for a bed, it's huge. That's my pick.  I love that. That's your pick, but I like it too. I like it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I can get you to buy it, you know, feel free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ampruitt has sent us his pick of the week. He couldn't be here.  He apologizes. He's feeling a little under the weather, but he sent us this.  $15. If you would like to buy this, uh, it looks like, um,  it looks like a quarter or a token.  It's round made of wood and burned into it are the letters T U I T.  So if you want to get around to it,  you can go to a weird guy.com. Get it?  I'll get around to it. You know what?  I probably shouldn't have mentioned it cause now my wife's going to buy it.  And every time I say I'll get around to it, she's going to say, Oh no,  I already got you one number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, number of the week, number of the week, number of the week. Okay.  I'm going to go with five.  Numero.  The only New York times New York time. No, no, not five numbers.  Just the number five. Yeah. The New York times. And it's, um, uh,  I think expose on Apple in China.  So there were five takeaways about what Apple does there.  Oh, this was kind of mind boggling. Yeah.  Apple stores customer data on Chinese government servers. Yes. Two,  Apple now shares customer data with the Chinese government. Yes. Three,  Apple proactively removes apps to placate Chinese officials. Yes.  Four Apple banned apps from a communist party critic and five,  tens of thousands of iPhone apps have disappeared in China.  So this is the price of doing business in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we should mention in the article, Apple says, well, okay,  we had to take those apps down cause they were illegal, but we, we don't,  we don't, we, we, that data is encrypted.  So there they kind of denied it sort of was a non denial denial,  but they kind of denied it. Yeah. But I, you know,  kind of truth in advertising. Got to mention that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm waiting for the two 95 take a Twitter blue, two 99 per month,  whatever it is. That's so cheap. I'll do it. I don't care. Meanwhile,

You can watch us do it live at twig.tv slash live.  There's also an audio feed there.  Chat with us while we're doing it at irc.twig.tv on demand shows  available at twig.tv slash twig or on YouTube.  There's a twig channel or subscribe and your favorite podcast application.  And that way you'll get it automatically. The minute it's done.  I would appreciate it if you leave us a five star review.  If your app allows that it's always nice. Helps us with discovery.  I'd also like to mention that we have been having great fun with club twit,  which is our brand new kind of way to support twit.  We've always had a tip jar, things like this.  Club twit gives you some additional benefits.  You get ad free versions of all of our shows, all of them, audio or video.  You get a great discord and we're where we always have fun in the discord.  We've got a stage here. We allow people to converse with us.  There's chat subjects on everything, all of our shows,  but even many other geeky things. And Stacy, don't forget,  we're going to do a book club with you. We want to do that in the discord too.  So don't forget that. Let's, let's get that happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. Next week I will announce a book for you to read.  And you could probably read it if you start right now between now and Friday.  I'm going to be interviewing Andy.  We are the author of what I think is the already a science fiction classic just  came out this month. Project Hail Mary. He wrote The Martian.  He wrote Artemis.  Andy has agreed to join us for a special version of triangulation.  It'll be our third time interviewing him this Friday, 3pm Pacific,  6pm Eastern 2200 UTC. You'll be able to watch it on our live stream.  When the show is done, we'll put it out as a additional triangulation.  We haven't done a show in a while.  We'll also put it out on the Twitter events feed cause it is an event.  But there is a special deal for club Twitter members.  You'll be able to ask questions of Andy.  We'll set up a stage and give give Andy and you a chance to converse.  So if you are not yet a club Twitter member, there is still time to join,  find out more at twit.tv slash club twit. There's the discord,  the special feed at twit plus feed. And of course all the ad free feeds,  seven bucks a month. I think it's a good deal.  And it really honestly helps us do things like this,  like this Andy we're an interview. Thank you everybody. Again,  twit.tv slash club twit. We'll see you next time on this week in Google. Bye.  Bye.
