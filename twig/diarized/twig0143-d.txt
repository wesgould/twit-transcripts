Howdy.  I just upgraded my SmarterWear to 1.04.  My ThinkUp.  Oh, yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ThinkUp. ThinkUp upgrade.  Yeah, my ThinkUp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, ThinkUp is one of the SmarterWears.  One of the Smarterer.  One of the SmarterWears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't tell anybody else, Tom, but you're one of our favorite users.  Oh, thank you.  Perhaps our favorite.  Stop.  Just you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We could go on forever, but we have to introduce Jeff Jarvis, too, of BuzzMachine.com, author of Public Hearts.  I'm kind of here.  You are.  You are definitely here on our end.  I know we're fuzzy to you a little bit, but I'm screaming about University IT department.  If you hear screaming in the background, it's probably the IT department visiting Jeff and our guest on the panel this week, Kevin Marks.  Tumblevision.tv always braving a new frontier to bring us his video.  You're in a conference room or a conference hallway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a conference hallway.  My neighbor was woodchipping an oak tree, so I came over to demo and sat in the hallway.  That always makes me think of the movie Fargo when I hear a woodchipper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't look too closely at what he's throwing in there.  All right.  Well, let's get on with the show, starting with the Gmail downtime yesterday.  Got everybody all panicked.  Google at first said they were investigating, then they fixed it.  It was only down for less than two hours.  They said it affected less than 2% of users.  Then they revised that up, said maybe it affected less than 10% of users.  And they said it's possible that some users may still experience delays with the delivery of certain messages while account access is restored.  I never ran into it.  I used Gmail for all my email practically.  Did anybody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.  Yeah, I saw the outage.  I just sent a couple of pictures from my phone, and I was waiting for that sent sound, and I didn't hear it.  Then I went in Chrome and got the error number 739 retrying again, and it counts down in seconds.  Even if it was just 10% of users, that's a lot of users.  That's a lot of people.  I was sort of amused by the panic on Twitter.  Gmail is like breathing.  It's like you can't get through a workday without having Gmail for a while.  But it came back for me within like 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes.  It wasn't a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Either I wasn't affected or I just never checked email.  Jeff, were you lucky enough to dodge it?  I didn't notice it at all.  Yeah.  What about you, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't notice it, but I was on my phone and traveling a lot yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you weren't really in the best test case for it.  Well, I had problems with Google Docs in the afternoon, but I don't think that has anything to do with this.  And who knows what it had to do with it.  It's always weird the way Google Docs works with Chrome.  And I've got a solution to one of my problems that I had with Chrome and Google Docs.  So we'll talk about it in the tools at the very end of the show.  How's that for a tease ahead all the way?  Don't stop listening.  Don't stop watching.  But let's talk about the World Series of Intellectual Property Trials going on.  That's actually what Judge William Alsup, who's presiding over the case in San Francisco District Court,  called the Oracle Google Trial.  And it's the trial of two Larrys as well, Larry Page and Larry Ellison, both taking the stand.  Larry Ellison took the stand in person first.  Larry Page had his deposition played.  Then Larry Ellison took the stage.  Or took the stage.  Took the stand.  It is kind of like a stage.  It's like a mini tech conference, isn't it?  They both have their PowerPoints.  It sort of is, right?  Larry Page, in his deposition, was asked about some particularly damning emails involving Andy Rubin.  They tried to get him to admit that Andy Rubin ran a presentation called Must Take License from Sun.  Page said he couldn't confirm that.  He didn't know if that was true or not.  Larry Ellison followed on the witness stand yesterday afternoon.  Was asked whether or not it is expensive to develop APIs.  He sort of sighed dramatically.  Said, arguably, it's one of the most difficult things we do at Oracle.  Then he discussed the licensing.  Stated Google is the only company he knew who didn't take a license, even a GPL license, for the APIs.  Which, what Oracle is trying to do here is say that Google is using the APIs, 37 APIs, without permission from Oracle.  And therefore they're violating copyright that Oracle has over there.  Even though the rest of Java is open source.  Larry Page then took the stand after Larry Ellison and he continued this morning and basically said,  Look, if there were no APIs, we would only have a language.  You would be able to write basic computations that never did any input or output.  Had any communication with the outside world or the underlying platform.  It would be like trying to call Jeff Jarvis.  You just get that so.  The person you're trying to reach is not available.  You don't have an API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was so elegant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Jeff dropped off.  We're trying to get him back.  But that's what this all boils down to.  Is Oracle is trying to say that Google ripped off the APIs from them to make Java work on Android.  Because they didn't use the official Java machine.  They made their own with Dalvik.  And therefore they owe Oracle money.  Google is trying to say, No, this is an open source operating system.  And the APIs are included with that.  Because no operating, not open source operating system, but open source programming language.  Because no programming language is worth anything without APIs.  Gina, where do you fall on this?  I mean, it's going to be up to the court to rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.  I mean, this whole case seems like quite a bit of theater.  It seems like these two companies probably could have worked this out or settled sooner.  And I'm surprised that they didn't.  But at the same time, I'm kind of enjoying this conversation.  You know, how is this going to turn out in the end?  I mean, to tell you the truth, I kind of take Google's side here.  And I think you said on TNT yesterday, the metaphor you used is like saying, you know, here's a language.  Here are the letters, but you can't use the nouns.  I mean, the core APIs that they're talking about, from what I understand,  correct me if I'm wrong, are like core Java objects.  Like object and like number.  I mean, it's really kind of basic.  And 37 objects, I think, in, you know, 15 million lines of Android code.  So it's a very small part of Android code.  And I'm a Java programmer.  Java was really my first language.  And I would consider those APIs part of the language.  I mean, Java doesn't do anything without them.  So I tend towards thinking that Google, you know, Google's assumption that this was just part of the language seems reasonable to me.  At the same time, other companies, according to Allison, no other company is didn't take the license.  And, you know, these companies should have been talking.  It sounded like they were.  There's a lot of back padding when Android decided to use Java.  But now it sounds like, you know, Oracle just trying to get some money that they shouldn't have.  And we're getting this kind of fun, fun try out, fun to hear about and watch.  I really liked Google Slides, which I think was posted maybe on the verge.  The verge has been doing really very well to this trial.  But I'm kind of Google on this one, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, Google Slides, key points of evidence.  Sun gave Java language to the public, which is true, but they didn't necessarily give the mobile implementation of it to the public.  Google built Android using free and open technologies.  Sun publicly approved of Android's use of Java.  And they make use of quotes from CEO Jonathan Schwartz praising Android after it was released in the utilization of Java.  And Google made fair use of the Java language APIs in Android, which is their big argument is that we were not violating copyright law,  that APIs have to be used to make a programming language.  Programming language isn't copyrightable. Therefore, it's fair use.  Kevin, what do you think? Do you agree with Gina that Google's probably got the better argument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's true. I think they definitely have got the better argument.  And it's notable that they're backed away from the whole patent thing that was wrapped around in this to begin with.  And it's now they're now trying to argue copyright, which is a much weaker thing to argue.  You can defend copyright on many other grounds than for infringement.  You can argue that it's fair use and so on.  So I think that this is I'm not quite sure why they're persisting with this.  I really don't understand what Oracle is trying to gain from this.  That all they're likely to do is make people aware of using their technologies in the future because people may do this.  You know, Oracle owns another big chunk of open source technology or owns the company that built it, which is MySQL.  And there's definitely some nervousness there that people will say, wait a minute, if they're doing this with Java as MySQL next,  will they suddenly use Oracle databases instead of running MySQL?  So there is I'm not quite sure what Oracle's game plan is and what they're trying to gain from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Judge William Alsop agrees with you.  I mean, he has tried over and over again to get these two companies to sit down and settle this because that's usually what happens in cases that are similar.  And he warned them at the opening of the trial yesterday, unless it's equivalent to the secret formula for Coca-Cola, what you say here is going to go public.  And so are you sure if you want to go through with it, go through with it.  And here we get Larry Page and Larry Ellison in sort of a little bit of a circus getting up on stage and accusing each other of things and sighing and Oracle saying,  oh, we spend so much money to make these APIs and they just want to steal them from us.  And Larry Page saying, you know what all Oracle's trying to do is get some money out of us because they couldn't succeed in making their own smartphones.  And there's been some some quotations that Larry Ellison had said that they had tried to buy or considered buying RIM or POM or that sort of thing.  But in the end, it's really kind of an obscure bit of programming law, which could be precedent setting and damaging to both companies, no matter who wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, I mean, there is a sort of the world has moved on, I think, from the licensing situation as it was the time of that languages creation.  And the modern languages are presumed to be created in an open source environment.  I don't think there's any language that's come out in the last 10 years that hasn't been open source.  I could be wrong there, but I'm fairly sure that that's that's the way that the world has moved now.  Certainly, if you look at Go or Dart that are Google's two languages, new languages they promoted, or even the iterations of JavaScript we have now, there's there's no presumption that anyone owns chunks of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, do you worry that if Oracle were to win, you would have problems with programming programs that you've written using APIs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, absolutely. If the ruling is that that that API is core APIs like the ones we're talking about in Java are different than the languages themselves, then yeah, I mean, that's that would be really bad.  And I hope that doesn't happen.  I think I mean, you know, then it just becomes open to interpretation.  Anybody can sue anybody for using the most basic APIs or objects in new languages.  It just seems absurd. So I hope this doesn't go Oracle's way.  I am concerned about what that would mean for developers and for future lawsuits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, explain a little bit about why that is, because we talked about this on tech news today and we got a couple of developers wrote in and said, well, look, if I write in Apple's operating system, they've licensed everything.  So I don't have to worry about it. If I if I write for somebody else's Java runtime that's licensed through Oracle, I don't have to worry about it.  It's only on Android that I have to worry. Is that but but if APIs become copyrightable, what what is the increased worry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's true. I mean, for indie developers kind of making making things that they are from a company that have already paid the licensing fees is not as big a deal.  But this but what's the difference? Is this just because Google's has this huge you know, is this juggernaut and has the money and like I Android's been so I mean,  you know, what's what's the line? You know, there's always that concern as soon as something gets popular starts making money. Everybody wants a piece of it.  Right. You may be fine now. Right. But label later if you're successful, you know, it's that that being a target.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, I know you're struggling with your technology. Am I am I know I am I on now? You are on sir. I think we finally figured it out.  What's your take on this whole world series of intellectual property trials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's the question I have. And it's really as is my one and ignorant question. Were other industries like this or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You went mute. I don't know if you muted yourself or if you are or what, but we can't hear you now.  You're still you're still talking, Jeff, but we can't hear you are talking about something long and thin.  Looks like he's saying something really intelligent. You got muted, Jeff. You got muted. Right. Right. When you were starting to ask the question.  We could see it just fine. So I feel like something just got muted on the computer or something like that. Adventures in Skype audio.  Right. This is Oracle and Google. They don't want us to talk about this. They're doing everything. It's a conspiracy. Yeah. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's it. They've copyrighted Skype APIs. I think I think Jeff's face there was was saying everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's going to do Pictionary pretty soon. I want to hear what Jeff's dumb question was. He said it was because Jeff doesn't have such a thing as a dumb question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Draw something, Jeff. Draw something. OK. He's going to toss that computer out the window here in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, now I can hear you. There you are. It's not the computer. It's the whole building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, we can hear you. It's a big building made of metal. Wait, he doesn't know that we can hear him. Yes, we can hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. OK. I got it. I'm just having to. OK. Did you hear my dumb question or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we heard you start your dumb question and then then that was it. All I saw was was this. There's something involving involving that. That was all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the guillotine in which I'm going to put the head of corporate IT here. All right. My local people are wonderful.  But the chancellor's office, I'm ready to scream anyway. Here's my dumb question. We're in a world now not of vertical industries, but of ecosystems.  And so I wonder whether this is becoming more prevalent. You know, this is my question. Was it always like this? Was it like this in cars and refrigerators?  Or the fact that you have companies, gigantic companies now that share technology, that share business relationships, that are interdependent, that have all kinds of more complex relationships than they used to be.  Is this a sign? Is all this this this litigious hostility, one-up spaceship and patents, which we'll get to again later with Twitter.  Is that a sign of a new corporate infrastructure or am I just being ignorant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin, I think we've had some back and forth on this before. There was the long running Apple Microsoft look and feel lawsuit.  There was the Canyon lawsuit where Microsoft actually found was found to be much more and Intel had a subcontractor who'd pinch code from that they'd used for Apple and so on.  There are some precedents for this 10, 15 years ago.  But the usual detente was that you would then come to an agreement, cross slice the patents and move on.  And it was only the sort of patent trolls that basically taken a patent from a small company and were using that to extract money directly like Acacia or like EOLUS that were actually going around and extracting money from each other.  And in the last year or two, there has been this outbreak of big companies suing each other.  And some of it is is potentially arguably fading companies suing the new ones because they're worried about what's going on.  But from their point of view, they see these people as as steeping their ideas.  You know, even the Steve Jobs quote about that is quite shocking in contrast with his quotes from the mid 90s where he proudly says that great artists still.  So there's it's interesting to see the dynamic there.  But it's but the other thing is that I think that the culture has has changed.  There was there was in the 80s, the presumption was that you would reverse engineer things and there was a presumed way you could clean room something.  So you would you would take someone's code and establish what the API to it was by having a set of engineers derive that.  Then you have another set of engineers write to that API, which was ridiculously time consuming.  But that was how you could you could create a clone of something.  And that was a presumed good faith way of doing it.  So they're arguing even against that question here.  But since then, there has been this sort of this outbreak of trying to cause vexatious problems later.  So but the other half of this, I spent the weekend at the The Wall Street Journal, their transparency hackathon.  And I so I was OK, I got to build something from scratch.  That's that's I make it half myself by using an environment I haven't used before.  So I set myself up with no JS on Heroku and built stuff in that.  And the thing that was fascinating to me about that was how much that presumed that the world existed in GitHub.  So with with no, you just say require this thing and it goes and pulls it down from GitHub and installs it for you and puts it there.  And then when you go to deploy it, the server at the remote and does the other end.  You can say, you know, get the latest, get version X, whatever.  And there is a presumption that all versions of everything you might want to use exist in the set in a repository you can get you can get at.  And you can just you can just pluck it out of the net and have it working.  And that was, you know, I knew that I knew that the world had moved in that direction for programmers, that we had this presumption that everything's available and can be fought and adjusted.  But I think no, it is the first language environment that's been built after that and therefore takes that as its basic presumption doesn't have to build a separate repository of libraries that you then have to deal with.  In some ways, it's it's the Java legacy of having all these libraries that are bound up to it and a de facto part of the language, if not de jure, is is is what's being fought over here.  And in a sense, it makes that less relevant to modern development as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think, you know, when I when I'm trying to answer Jeff's question about has it always been like this, I think it goes in cycles.  And I think, you know, what what you're talking about, Kevin, is identifying people who are who are reacting to a certain part of the cycle that was beneficial to openness.  Right. This this idea that, you know, we can reverse engineer.  And I wonder, I don't know this, but I wonder if a lot of that attitude was fostered because a lot of the base technology was developed by government and military and therefore made available on a more open basis.  The Internet protocols were made available on a more open basis.  The the Web was developed at CERN where they decided to release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I see. So you're saying you're saying that the the the norms of this new society were set by that.  Then commercial interests came in with different with with more and reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe we see it more in mobile than we see it in regular platforms is because mobile is operating in a different arena.  They're not based on that same legacy.  And so we see something that's more like the eighteen hundreds where the Edison's are all fighting against each, you know, all the other innovators to decide who gets the patents and who gets to innovate.  And particularly, I thought about FM radio, which was fought by RCA in the courts for decades because they were afraid of it.  They didn't want it to roll out.  And so FM radio didn't get cleared of all of its patent issues until the 60s.  And that's why we didn't get FM until that late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The media industry has a long history of patent fights back and forth.  Television was the same. There was there was there was lots of stuff there from and there was the canonical lone inventor story with Farnsworth fighting back against.  Right. I think it's RCA again there.  So that there you know, there is some history of that.  But I think, you know, there were generations of that in computing as well.  There are there are there are chunks of stuff that was that was built and patented and fought over.  But the model then was that you would have a sort of license cartel.  You'd put together a trade group that would gather the patterns up and put an agreement together like the like the MPEG LA, for example.  And that that model held for a while.  And that was that that was the presumption of how things worked.  And it was often a way for the, you know, the larger companies to extract rent from the smaller companies potentially because it meant that you had to at least you had to pay that license.  But because there was some mutual agreement around it, they would they would they would get the rates to a sensible level.  And, you know, there was there was grandstanding that when I was at Apple when we were releasing QuickTime six, I think it was which which incorporated MPEG four.  We held back the release until they changed the MPEG four license terms to make it possible for people to use it without paying the money.  And that was a that was a fairly large piece of corporate grandstanding by Apple, if you like, because basically the current MPEG four.  A licensing model has a floor and a ceiling to it.  Right. If you're sending streams less than a certain amount, doesn't cost you anything.  If you say if you're implementing more than a certain amount, it's capped at several million a year, whatever it is.  So that was the rule set that Apple helped them establish to actually make sure this stuff was usable.  But that's still quite, you know, there's still quite a lot of money to to to Microsoft or Google or Apple.  You know, five, five, ten million a year is not that much.  But for a small company that wants to compete with them in building a video streaming network, that is an issue.  So there is the historic way has been problematic.  One of the things that's interesting about Google and it's something that Sergey Brin was saying this week as well was that they were built with the presumption of an open Internet.  And their corporate culture has that as a basis.  And I think he walked back a bit of his discussion of that in The Guardian.  But he was he was basically saying that one of the threats is that the new companies are not not taking that.  You know, we're not following that example.  And certainly something that I'm having conversation with Microsoft execs about this, where they were saying, what's Google trying to do here?  Is this is this is this these open source operating systems trying to destroy us?  And my answer was no, they're not trying to destroy you.  It's just that that's their presumption of how things work.  Their worldview is the right thing to do to solve a problem is to open source something or create a spec.  Whereas Microsoft's worldview was, oh, we need to add a new API to Windows.  It's just the culture you come from.  And that that may be changing a little bit at Google.  Some of the stuff we've seen with Google Plus and Vick Gondotra deliberately withholding APIs is a step away from that worldview.  And maybe that's the justification of that is that they're responding to more closely held stuff from from Apple and Facebook.  But I'm not sure that's a that's a strong response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're talking, Kevin, I think you're I think, Tom, you're on to something here in as always in a theme for the week even is is that there are presumptions about the architecture and norms of the Internet coming in.  So we see this suit going on and not to get ahead of us in the list.  But but Kevin just brought up Sergey Brandon interview with the Guardian.  And he said afterwards, it was an interesting read, but it kind of distorted his views in some ways.  What mainly he did was he walked back from criticizing the walled gardens of Facebook and Apple and after praising them heartily for the want of future suits and negotiations turned around and said, well, the problem was when when we came on the Internet, you can create an app with no toll booth.  But now basically you want to get to users through Facebook.  There's a toll booth there.  You have to give a piece of what you do.  And and so you have and then you have Tim Berners-Lee saying, you know, give us back our own data.  So there's there's the Guardians doing a week long series about the fight over the open and free Internet.  You have Brin, by the way, saying that the greatest threat to that is not companies, which you'd expect.  But I agree with him.  It is governments, both tyrannies and governments like the US on piracy.  So we have a fight now going on about the society of the net and the norms and structures and institutions that make it up.  Gina, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think you're you're absolutely right.  And I do think that there has been this cultural shift.  I mean, I think the assumption, I think the reason why I would just assume that those Java APIs are fair game is because I think just nowadays we make platforms right like the Web is a platform.  I was just, you know, make things that other people can use to then make things on top of.  And, you know, of course, Brin was going to say that the Web should be open because if it's not open, then, you know, Google can't search it.  I mean, that's the whole Google's whole premise is on the idea that all this information is going to be is going to be out there and open.  And sure, you have to sign into Facebook to use Facebook apps or to use Facebook.  But Facebook is still a platform as well.  But I forget what the I forget what the the the initial the initial question is.  Oh, getting back to what Kevin said was saying earlier about Heroku, assuming that that, you know, GitHub repositories are just available.  I mean, I think this is this is a fantastic kind of cultural shift around the idea that you create things, you modular modularize them, you make them available to the public for everyone to use.  And there's the default setting is that it is available for anyone to use.  And this kind of goes into another story not to jump ahead, but that the IPA agreement that that Twitter that Twitter put out a really important story of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But yeah, yeah. And it's not about beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a different idea. Right. It's not a different idea. It's not in the appellate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do enjoy a good IPA. Yeah, I'm not sure I well I prefer the IPA beer over this.  I think the Twitter's doing but what Twitter's doing is pretty interesting, too.  We're going to take a quick break. We'll come back. We're going to talk about that.  We're going to talk about the stock split.  We'll talk a little bit more about this battle for control of the Internet series.  But I want to tell you about Stamps.com, our sponsor for this week in Google.  Everyone knows going to the post office is a hassle.  The limited hours, the parking.  That's why we recommend Stamps.com, the fastest and easiest way to buy and print real U.S. postage for any letter or package right from your desk.  You'll never have to go to the post office again.  You'll get you'll get an easier way.  You'll get a good rate.  All you need is a computer and a printer and you can use Stamps 24-7 whenever you need it.  You don't have to work at somebody else's schedule.  Post office might be closed, but Stamps.com is always open.  We get we get all kinds of good examples from people who are using Stamps.com with their business.  One person says they're amazed how it makes it easy to access all the services of the post office, including international and certified mail.  You might think, oh, I got to go fill out those forms at the office, right?  No, Stamps.com even offers discounts you can't get anywhere else, like 21 percent off on express mail, 15 percent off on priority mail.  So it saves you time and the postage costs less, too.  I mean, what's not to love right now?  Stamps.com is going to make it even better because you're watching Twig special offer for our listeners.  Use the promo code Twig and get a no risk trial.  You see that that radio mic up there?  You want to click on that?  Go to Stamps.com, click on that microphone, type in Twig, T-W-I-G, press the go button.  And all of a sudden you saw that eighty eight dollar thing.  It's now one hundred ten dollar bonus offer, including the digital scale and fifty five dollars free postage.  Can't beat it, folks. Check it out. Stamps.com.  Before you do anything else, go save yourself some money on postage.  If you do any any amount of shipping or mailing at all, it's going to make it worthwhile and you get the free scale.  If nothing else, you got a cool scale, but you're going to save money, too.  So go check it out. Stamps.com. We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  We mentioned the battle for control of the Internet series on The Guardian.  Tim Berners-Lee in there today. Sergei Brin was in there Monday.  We talked about him being beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil companies and governments.  He made it clear today. I was mostly talking about the governments.  He's even admitted Google's got some ways to go with openness.  We can improve, too. Tim Berners-Lee today talking about how we need to demand our information from Google and Facebook.  He's like, yeah, sure, you can get your Facebook archive.  And yeah, Google's providing you more and more access to information.  He's like, but we need to have immediate access to all the data they hold on us all the time.  He says it's interesting that people throughout the existence of the Web have been concerned about monopolies.  They were concerned about Netscape having complete control over the browser market until suddenly they started worrying  that Microsoft had complete control of the browser market.  So I think one of the lessons is that things can change very rapidly.  People adopt things. He actually brought up a story about Gopher, somebody being concerned about Gopher in the early days.  He said, you know what, as rapidly as people accepted Gopher, they didn't.  They got rid of it as just as rapidly when something better came along.  So it was a little bit of a reassuring like, look, we need to demand this stuff and we can get it.  Google and Facebook won't always be in charge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. To this story, I say, hallelujah.  I mean, obviously, I work on an app called ThinkUp with the whole the whole premise of the app is that it pulls all your social data from different networks.  And I just I believe very strongly. I mean, feature zero and any piece of software should be you should be able to get out all the data that you put in.  But even beyond that, we're pumping so much interesting social, personal, intimate data about ourselves and our lives and all these disparate systems.  And we have the right we should have the right not only to have all that data, but to have it in a tool that gives us insights about ourselves that that do more than just inform advertising companies.  Right. Which is what what what companies like Facebook and Twitter and all these other social networks want to do with your data.  Nothing wrong with that. I'm not going to argue with Jeff about about that.  I mean, there's nothing wrong with that. And more effective advertising is fine.  But also, there's there are other stories about our lives and other things we can figure out about ourselves and learn about ourselves if we had all that data in one place and was able to access it and slice and dice it and look at different ways.  And I'm not going to make this into a commercial for ThinkUp. But this is I feel really strongly about this.  And this is why I'm building ThinkUp. And and I think I don't want to see a lot more tools that are kind of like this kind of layer on top of all these social tools that exist that other companies own.  Right. Like I want to see kind of I want to create actually the Uber network, which is this peer to peer network, which piggybacks on top of and aggregates all these these silos owned by different companies that help people do more interesting things and find out more about themselves in their lives and how they can make them make it better with all this data that we're generating.  Every day and feeding to these companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, I think that's that's that's so the right way to put it. The debate in the privacy terms that I often deal with is about the right to be forgotten and and to kill the data and get rid of the data.  But in which one understands the part two, because you're saying somebody else has it out of control over it.  You're turning that around one in 80 degrees and saying, well, when we create this, there's value to it. We're not able to get out.  Yes.  Yes. And if you enable applications like think up app and others and that layer you just spoke of, then we all understand the value that comes from that in new and important ways and then shows the value of sharing and goes to the things that I want to see about the Internet.  And and I salute that flag and whistle Dixie to it. Well, not Dixie.  The strong people better.  Grapes of wrath. Wait, not Dixie, not Dixie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, what did you read this Tim Berners-Lee article? Did you get a chance to take a look at? Yes, I did. Yes. No, I thought that was I thought it was it was it was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's Tim is is, you know, very good at spotting long term threats and things as well.  So his he's you know, he speaks for the authority of building the Internet in the first place of building the web in the first place rather.  But his he's warning about the the problem of things moving inside these environments, too.  And as as someone was putting out in the in the chat room, who was that?  Tully Twitter is a great example of this.  They've they've they've they've been sort of saying, oh, that's kind of hard.  We haven't got enough people for the last four years when they've the number of people they employ has gone up by four as a magnitude.  So I think that there's there's some some fishiness there as well.  And I think it will be great if they could just give you a download thing that both Google and Facebook have done at least one something towards that.  So Twitter is not is not like the shining light here, even though the IPA thing is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me ask you. I'm sorry, Kevin. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said the other thing that Tim Bernstein was talking about was the the UK government surveillance program, which is which is being discussed at the moment.  But they haven't actually put a bill together.  And there's and there's a lot of like pre noise about that going on at the moment.  There is also I'll give them to the end of the program.  But there's also currently going on by the government and open standards and patents consultation where they're asking for people's opinions on this.  And it would be really great to send us a more opinions that aren't patents are a wonderful thing.  And open standards are a threat to businesses, which is a lot of the stuff they've been getting from the the big players already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like that surveillance and the CISPA, the bill that's here in the United States have the same issues, which they're not like SOPA, where people are like, wait, do we even need this at all?  I think everyone says, well, we do need a way to catch bad guys.  OK, we all agree on that. But is this law the way to catch bad guys?  Are you know, is being able to log everyone's emails and where they were going the right thing to do?  Is it overbroad? Is it overreaching? And that's where the debate is about these things.  I feel a little more hope for these sorts of laws that they at least possibly could be whittled down into something that's usable and acceptable to civil liberties, unlike SOPA, which I felt like was just dead in the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes and no. I agree with Sergey Brin here that the greatest threat to Internet freedom is government.  And whether that is tyrannies filtering the Internet for dissent, as Sergey said, or whether it is governments of Canada and Australia going after the entirety of the Internet for child porn or the US for piracy or this UK effort for security.  We have to be very, very cautious about that.  And I think the government fancies itself as the protector of our freedom and on the Internet.  It is the opposite. And I'm not trying to come out like an anti-government person either on the, you know, on any end of the spectrum from Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street.  But I am trying to say we better be damn cautious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, when the government comes and says, hey, I want to be able to tap a phone of a drug dealer, gangster, criminal, murderer, etc.  I'm OK with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, there are principles involved.  You know, one principle involved is that our email communication is sacrosanct and our phone communication is sacrosanct to the extent that you have to get a warrant to go after.  So I think that should be the way with the email, too.  I agree. Right.  And but it's not the case that our private communication should be presumed be private by government unless there is just cause and a warrant in due process.  And so the issue here is, as always, is not technology.  It is principles. And you deal with this at the level of principles and the technology fits in that.  What we're trying to do is create new laws that deal with technology and things that people don't understand.  And principles get lost. That's where the real danger is.  I think what class G is something.  Yeah, sure. Go ahead, Jeff.  Jane, back to your point where Kevin started on this was described for me an architecture and a set of APIs and a set of things that in the in the layer you describe in the layer that you indeed are building.  What is it as a principle that you would expect of Twitter, Facebook, Google and so on?  The things that brothersly talks about in terms of green our data.  What does that look like? You know, what form do you need it in?  What what what is legitimately ours?  What is it? Because once I interact with somebody else, I don't just own the information.  So do you. I put a picture up of you.  We both have a claim on it. There's issues that get very complicated immediately.  But think up is the beginning of an architecture that I think goes exactly what it burgersly is talking about is give me what's mine.  How do you how do you describe that world at a level of principles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's a really good question.  I mean, I think data liberation is like just just kind of chips at the beginning of it.  It's just give me my stuff.  I mean, the question of of the data that you collaborate with others on, which is pretty much everything.  I mean, an email conversation. Do I do I own a reply to my to my email or comment on my post?  I believe I have part ownership in that. Right.  So so I mean, the problem with data liberation is that we just export your own data.  It's kind of useless. Right.  When it's not plugged into this, this architecture of people.  Right. It's lost all context. And it's often very collaborative.  So to me, it's a peer to peer network with full featured APIs that offer you access to your own information as well as your interactions with others and their responses to that to that information.  Right. Because because because we're not just publishing, you know, we're not we're not just broadcasting statements here.  We're having conversations online. And this is, you know, this is the publishing industry is going to this change as well.  So the biggest point is that API should let you access all of your data.  And a few people brought this up in the chat room. You know, Twitter, Twitter's API does not let you easily get get more than thirty two hundred tweets.  Right. Because they're the pulse of the moment.  I think there are scaling issues and there's a lot of tweets in cold storage.  And I understand that that Twitter is running a huge operation, but still really bugs me.  And part of the reason why I built ThinkUp is because of that sort of arbitrary limitation.  Facebook lets you download your data to a bunch of HTML files.  That's OK. That's a start.  I think that that the that that the goal that I want to get to is something much more robust and alive.  I mean, I think these have to be sort of live APIs that that run and that talk to one another on a continuous basis.  I don't think this is a one time downloads that file deal.  And and I think that it does involve getting data that you've collaborated with others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tom, if I may hijack for a moment longer, Kevin, you built pieces of this architecture around the edges of identity.  Describe your view of this of this more open architecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think I think you just put on the thing is you need to build something that is actually fungible.  You can actually move between services.  So that and that points to writing open specs about how to do this rather than one particular company's APIs.  And one of the one of the things that's been less encouraging over the last few years has been the sort of the growth of a bunch of APIs from each company that are all sort of they're all variations on a theme in many in many cases.  But they're not actually converging on protocols as much as they used to.  So part of the work we did with open social and then with other other specs like true activity streams and portable contacts was designed to converge some of this stuff.  And there's you know, there's still work going on around that area.  There's the open ID connect work that's going on at the moment is trying to converge some of that initial log in and getting your personal profile stuff out.  But most of these companies have backed away from converging on the on the on the shape of the data that they're sharing.  And I think that's a shame.  To some extent, you can you can transform it.  There's a lot there's a lot of decent work going on where people would pull stuff from several formats and munch them together.  You know, if you think about if this then that that's a that's an example of one company that one that's trying to sort of provide all the shims to translate things from one to another.  But you don't really want to have a translation between every two endpoints.  It's much better if you've got a common format in between that just makes life so much easier for everyone.  And that's the piece that we've that we see that we've moved away from to some extent in the last few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just I think a lot of this is coming back to your point earlier about the architecture and a level of principles, whether those principles are the ones that Gina described in terms of being able to have access to our information, whether the ones that are the ones that Kevin describes in terms of having the ability to have APIs to give us our tracks, the ones that you brought up in discussion in terms of government and mail and things like that.  I fear and the things that I am are on about a lot about about privacy and publicness is that if we lose sight of these principles of this society we're building and get into these weeds, we're going to lose the battles.  And that's why I like what Sir Tim was talking about.  And and to an extent what Sergey was talking about, what my colleagues here have been talking about is I think we've got to get that level of discussion up to principles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and I think the Internet has been significantly good about doing that.  We may have some some short term memory loss and get distracted from time to time.  But but when you know when it gets important, people rise up and say, well, wait a minute.  No, that's not how we want this to work.  And there is a culture built into the Internet of working around whatever is trying to get in our way, which is what Gina taught me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That hackers will hack around and we can't necessarily afford that luxury anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's always a way to hack around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you're right. We shouldn't rely on it solely and just say, in the meantime, a law will get passed that you can't hack around without going to jail.  Then you go move to sealant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, probably not.  Probably not the end solution.  But you're right.  No, you need to keep one eye on maybe one and a half eyes on what the governments are doing because they're finally noticing.  And then the other eye on building things like ThinkUp, building things like mesh networks, building the best answer, the ways to move around at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That and and not to jump ahead.  But when we talk about Twitter, IPA, that's also an effort to create a new principle.  And that's a good way to attack this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is all making me very thirsty.  We need to talk about IPA in a second, but I want to take a quick break and thank one of our other sponsors.  Go to my PC picture this.  If I can paint you a picture, you're on your way home after work.  It's dark.  It's raining.  OK, maybe it's not raining.  That's kind of that's kind of depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now let me make clear that the IT staff here at the Community Graduate School of Journalism is the one that rescued me.  I love them dearly.  They're wonderful.  It's always the next level up the line.  Right.  It causes some new thing that caused me problems.  I'm sorry to complain.  I want to make clear here.  Because otherwise my life here be miserable because I need them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, not all IT departments are the same.  No, no, don't upset the IT department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Survival tactics, number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.  I'm sorry.  Let's let's talk about this.  This innovators patent agreement.  That's what IPA is actually standing for in this Twitter situation.  It seems to be a reaction to Yahoo's suit on Facebook where they took some older patents and went after Facebook.  And some of the people who had helped them with those patents were a little upset now that they were no longer at Yahoo that they were being used in this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And a reaction to this whole insanity we're into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, exactly.  The wider patent fiasco that's going on.  So Twitter has a policy here that says we will not use our patents for anything unless it's defensive.  And you can't you get to approve how you get to control how we use the patents you're involved with as an employee.  And even if we sell them to somebody else down the line, that company has to get your sign off when they use those patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or the very clever way they did it was that was it not just that so much as that if that company tries to use it to attack if company A attacks company B and you're you had a role in the patent in the middle.  The way I understand it is you can use retain the right, thanks to Twitter, to license to grant a license to company B, thus cutting the company A off of the knees.  Is that OK?  So you're in control of that patent.  Yeah.  To that extent.  You can license the person being attacked in an offensive way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole point being that they want to make sure that the patents you work on are used as a shield rather than as a weapon.  This is something they introduced in one of their, I can't remember what they call it, but it's kind of a regular hacker meeting that they have within the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then the next argument that came out from some people and somebody some guy at Forbes poo pooed this and this little bit of pooing saying well what does now the Twitter has no business model it now has no patent value.  And you know what does this do to your fiduciary responsibility to Wall Street?  Yeah, I take the point that if you would presume that all business models are rapacious and ugly and awful and evil, then yes, maybe you reduce the value.  But I really salute Twitter here unless I'm missing something.  I majorly salute Twitter here for standing up on once again a new principle.  And it's a way to I think undercut the war and also to set a new standard.  So now that Twitter does this, we have the responsibility folks to go to Google and Facebook and Microsoft and name the company and say what about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I heard you groaning there Gina.  You know what this does to the value of the company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It makes really great talent of engineers who care about how their work is used and want to work for you.  I mean, it's just there aren't very many companies that I feel like I really want to work for this place.  This agreement makes me want to work for Twitter and this agreement gives me a moment Twitter Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can get Gina. Take it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it also sort of arms me with a negotiation.  You know, part of my negotiation of, you know, whatever next job that I have.  Well, it's not gonna be for a while as I'm trying to make my own jobs here.  But I can go to any company that I want to work for and say in my salary negotiation, say, hey, you know, I want this to if I'm going to file a patent while I'm your employee, a patent that's going to have my name on it, a patent on something I created, then this I want this kind of control.  You know, I saw a lot of people say, you know, this is just this was just a PR move to recruit talent.  They if it certainly was a great recruitment move and that, you know, defensive can be, you know, the using a patent defensively can be interpreted very broadly and it doesn't really mean anything.  The truth is, this is better than the current situation or the situation that my coworker Andy Bayo was in when his company was bought by Yahoo.  And now, you know, a patent that his name is on is being used to sue Facebook.  If he had known better, you know, his conclusion was I will never file another patent.  Okay, I can see that.  But if you have to file patents, you want to do it with this with this new agreement.  And the reason why I think that Twitter is sincere about this is that Twitter has just has been on this role.  They've just been releasing all these open source modules.  Bootstrap is my favorite kind of layout framework for making new websites.  Twitter just released a bunch of changes they made to my sequel for, you know, for everyone to use and check out.  And the IPA is I think it's like Creative Commons license or it's an open license.  It's not exactly open source, but I just love the way that Twitter is making it.  It's making a name for itself by, you know, modularizing its work, making it reusable for other tech companies and setting an example and really coming out looking like the place that you want to be if you're an engineer, except for the 3200 tweet thing.  The IPA thing. Great thing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All the support of other, you know, open standards as well.  There's definitely been a lack of Twitter people in the open standards community for the last five years since since Blaine and Co left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, every every company has their their advantages and disadvantages.  The IPA. This is something.  This is a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Definitely. Yeah.  So something something that we want to look at at Salesforce to see if we can adopt it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Peter Yarad wrote a column up on CNET.  He's a former Sun employee and he was complaining how essentially when he left Sun and started a company, he had to violate his own patents to do what at that point had become widespread methods of building web applications and that he wishes that this was the standard.  He's like, fortunately, Sun like Twitter only used patents defensively.  But here we have Oracle who bought Sun now using patents.  You know, there's at least two patents in that Oracle Google case that they're going after Google for.  Could this become a virus that infects the tech community in a positive way and and and ends the patent wars or are we always going to have an Oracle that's going to hold out and say, you know what?  No, I'm going to ruin this or a Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the problem is that that is the problem.  The problem is that, yeah, that we can, you know, we've had these sort of mutual non-suing agreements, which is what the patent licensing pools are in effect are all across licensing pools that happen.  But they're not they're not, you know, obeyed by the by the trolls.  It doesn't take many of these patents to be issued and then bought and sold through, you know, through companies going out of business and someone buys the patents from the corpse and then goes around with no actual business to defend.  I'm just a sort of shell company owned by lawyers that goes around suing everyone.  So Mark Cuban just read a post about this because he's he's getting some grief because he just invested invested in Ringo, which is a patent control company.  He's he's he's saying the biggest business risk you don't know about is your business will be sued over patents and your only possible defense is to invest in patent trolls or tell Congress about it.  And I wish he'd taken the tell Congress about it route rather than the investing patent trolls, frankly, but maybe he can do he can do both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he wants to make some money. He sees how many how much money the patrolls are making the guys.  The guy's all about making money, I guess.  I suppose that the theory that Peter Yared is putting forth on this column is that if enough employees get this right from enough different companies, then enough companies will find that a lot of the patents that they're working with or or or dealing with are controlled by employees.  And there won't be enough patents that aren't controlled by employees that want to use them defensively to to allow to fuel the wars, so to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, do you think that's you know, I do fear that that and I'm accused of being Pollyanna.  And I think that right now we're all being a bit Pollyanna ish because you have the fact that, you know, Microsoft just spent one billion dollars for AOL patents.  What are they going to say? What is that chicken chicken livers?  You know, you have Google buying Motorola in great measure to get the patents and on and on and on and on.  There's a huge investment made in these patents, so I don't know what we can do about the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, part of part of the thing is that the you know, as you said, the government is paying attention, but also the culture is changing and that people in general are paying attention.  I think that the AOL lawsuit being overturned in February in East Texas and basically having their patent revoked by an ordinary jury is a really encouraging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree with all that. I'm just I'm just matching Tom's question here as well. Are we being too optimistic to some Kevin's not because he says no, this isn't this isn't going to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This isn't going to get rid of the oracles of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's going to change quickly, but we've been I think, you know, I think that the sort of not producing anything sitting there being parasitic suing people for for patents isn't isn't a long term sustainable business model precisely because it is parasitic and obviously parasitic.  And we will eventually move against it as a society. But in the meantime, yeah, there are people who are going to continue doing that.  It's not a new problem. I had I had a I had a patent troll lawsuit against my company in 1990 that was that was completely specious but tied us up for nine months and made up made our products and not get a version to.  So yeah, this is a this is a long standing problem in the industry. It's a it's it's something that it tends to impact smaller companies more than larger ones because it's very easy to be completely put out of business by a patent troll because they will they can just tie you up in lawsuits and you can't afford to fight them.  Sorry, sorry. I was going to ask you a question. Keep going.  So also, you know, when I was at Apple, there was a steady stream of patent lawsuits against against Quaytime that was, you know, being fended off all the time by people who had patents on some video this or video that and it's something that people are still very aware of.  So it is it's a thing that's been going on for a long time. It's been growing.  It may mean that, you know, companies will move to a place with a with a more favorable environment. You know, the EU does not have software patents to the same extent the US have.  They have a much tighter test for patentability, which means that you can it's harder to get an injunction or lawsuit going there.  And that may mean that it makes more sense for people to develop software there.  Certainly, I think Skype developing in in Europe is a very good place to do that.  And possibly Spotify as well.  They assume that they could that being based there would give them some inspiration against this.  They could then then move to America once they had a established power base.  Kevin, if this is something you'd rather not talk about on the show, kick me under the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But when you were kind enough to visit my office just yesterday here in New York, you talked about a view of what you would say about patents going to the UK.  Sure. I think I certainly like to bet.  So the original goal of the patent was to publish trade secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is what patent law was invented to do.  It was to stop people using trade secrets and actually publicly built on later.  And so there was the limited term for patents was it was explicitly on that basis.  And if you read the the history of patent law, you'll see that there was a very strong need for patent law.  So there was a limited term for patents was it was explicitly on that basis.  And if you read the history of patent law in both the US and UK, which the jurisdictions that decided first, that's that's what its idea was.  However, we have a mechanism that's better than that now for sharing methods and secrets.  And that's published open source and publish open standards.  These are places where people get together and say, OK, here's my mechanism.  Here's how I do it.  So I think that, you know, to rebalance this will be to give immunity to the if you like the GitHub infrastructure of software from patents because they are fulfilling the original goal of patents much more strongly.  And the conversely, you could say, OK, if you want to patent software, fine, you've got to maintain a public source code repository for 20 years.  And then at the end of that 20 years, people could use it.  That may be a way to rebalance this.  But the current situation is that patents are written to not make sense to engineers.  They are written to be written in the most broad and nonsensical language possible so that lawyers can then use them in the future to say, haha, gotcha.  As opposed to open source software, open specs, which are written the other way around because they're designed to be used interoperably.  So reversing that presumption would be a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's a that is a really good idea.  The idea of sort of a an immunity or something being granted.  I think it might be hard to get the big boys to buy off on it.  But if it could be done, I think it would be fantastic.  Although to Gina's point, if all the engineers go and work for the companies that do the IPA type agreement, that that could put a little pressure on to either way.  I'm a big fan of IPA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's part of the thing about open source is that open source is enormously attractive to engineers because it means that they know their code won't be won't just disappear into a black hole when the company changes direction or their manager changes or they leave the company.  So if you know you're going to be able to work on open source at a company that is that is still a very attractive way of hiring people.  And that's something that's that's true of Google and Facebook and Twitter and many of the companies that are the support of open source.  We've been seeing Microsoft getting into open source now with the with the OpenStreetMap support and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're so conflicted about it, but they're like, it's towards it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're like, I guess we should set up a separate division that's supposed to be doing open source so they can try and fire off from windows.  It's not clear what they're doing that because the windows group is trying to squash it or they're doing that because they want to preserve the sort of pattern of the windows thing.  But they're trying to make it work.  And I think part of that is it's much more attractive for the engineers who are coming of age in this culture to work on open source.  And the older engineers like me who've been through patent battles or who've been through having your entire software pulled out from under you because your project was canceled or you left the company.  It is very attractive to be able to make something that's open source and therefore transcend these institutions.  And the other half of it for the from the institution's point of view is that it means that if you're using an open source project and your engineers move somewhere else, they're probably still going to maintain it.  You don't actually you haven't actually lost the investment in that that you had that you had because it was it was held behind the firewall.  So the balance of the balance of power or the balance of ROI has has shifted quite a lot in the direction of open source over the last few years.  And that's you know that's that's becoming more visible more obvious to companies over time.  And I suspect that that may be the only thing that makes this stuff more attractive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. I think taking that broad view and saying, look, you know, open source may have not conquered the desktop.  Open source may have some setbacks along the way, and we don't see big wins all the time.  But if you look at open source where it was in, you know, 1993 around the birth of Linux and where it is now, incredibly huge strides.  It is an essential piece of an optimistic point.  Tom. Yes. Yeah. All right. Let's take a quick break.  We got a we got a Google Drive rumor to get to.  We got to talk about the stock split.  But I want to thank our other sponsor for this week in Google.  Ting. I love this idea that they're doing at two cows, two cows, the folks who bring you hover.com.  Have a new mobile service.  And this is brilliant.  It's about bringing billing clarity, usability and big savings to mobile phone users.  So you only pay for what you use.  And it's built on the sprint network, which has a good solid backbone.  So you get good coverage all over.  But they have a simple plan.  Fair pricing. You build by the megabyte, the minute and the text message.  That's it. Here's the kick kicker, right?  Oh, great. So so what do I have to be locked into?  If you use less than anticipated, let's say you sign up for the 50 megabyte plan.  If you only use 20 megabytes, you're automatically credited the difference at the end of the month.  If you use more, you are billed for the additional amount, but you're not locked into some new contract.  You're not given a punitive.  Wow, you went over the agreed contract amount.  They just pay you just to pay for the higher tier ting.com has no premiums, no penalties.  You just pay for what you use.  And they offer 4G Android phones through Sprint.  Ting website has clear graphic snapshots of usage by device.  So you can keep track of how close you are to a next tier.  If you're like, I kind of need to stay under that 500 megabyte tier, you can do that.  That 500 minute tier, you can do that. Lots of control over your features.  It's about putting you in charge of what you're paying for.  There's a bunch of good tweets we've seen from people.  One from a customer back in February.  The phone bill was $22 last month.  That's almost exactly $100 less than AT&T.  Wow.  It's always about people saying, wow, now that I only pay for what I use, I spend less money.  So don't wait.  You get great customer support.  If you use Hover, you already know about their great customer support.  TwoCast provides 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time email support.  Also great offering an active discussion forum where you can talk to other folks.  You can get support by blog, by tweet, even post release notes.  It's a bunch of geeks running a company the way you would want it to be run.  And the support folks are smart too. They're passionate. They're empowered.  They know you don't have to sit there and go through a script with them.  They understand that you know what you're talking about and they get to solving your problem.  So go try out their savings calculator if this doesn't convince you.  Enter your usage and the cost for the last few months.  Ting will tell you how much you would have paid if you were using Ting.  And then you can go purchase a phone from Ting right from the website.  The prices range from $104 to $545, depending on what kind of phone you want.  But you're going to get it for cheaper than anyone else because you're going to get it by going to  ting.com slash twig and get $50 off the purchase price of a device.  Save money and better manage your mobile phone usage, folks.  Use Ting. That's ting.com slash twig.  And we thank ting.com for their support of this week in Google.  All right.  Now, stock split real quick, a bit of a financial story.  But the key thing here is not that if you're a stockholder, you're going to now own two stocks for every one stock.  What it is is that the stock split is done so that Google can issue a special new class of shares to current shareholders,  meaning that Sergey and Larry keep a firmer control, firmer handle on the company.  Jeff, do you understand how this works?  I understand the principle, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We see it a lot.  Basically, what it is is wasn't Mark Zuckerberg smart, but he still is going to go to an IPO maintaining control of his company.  And I suspect Larry and Sergey were jealous.  And so what they're doing is issuing a non-voting share.  And so I'll get both. You know, I am a Google full disclosure, Google shareholder, not much, but I got a little bit.  And I will get a voting share.  I'll get a non-voting share and they will own most of the voting shares.  They already have control of the higher voting class.  Very common.  The argument is that companies like I believe Tribune Company or I think it was it was a night ridder did not have two class voting.  And thus they lost control, lost control very easily.  And they were subject to what they would consider financial trolls to come in and shake control of the company.  The argument that I've seen basically and and and and and Ross Sorkin made this in The New York Times is that as long as we think that Larry and Sergey and Eric are smart and doing good things, well then hunky dory.  But come the moment when Google goes south, when they leave, when they hire the equivalent of Mr. Pepsi, you know, what happens?  The shareholders have no control.  It's is in the next question obvious question always ask as soon as as soon as you know if if if they eat a non-union tomato is that evil.  That's what we're going to be asked now is is is this evil to do as much as Wall Street is.  It's it's what Wall Street does.  It's what companies do to maintain control of the companies having lost control of my magazine.  I get that you try to do the things that set you up in the future to maintain control of your baby and you do the best you can use the tools available.  That's what they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I got nothing to add to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What about you? Yeah, I mean, it seems reasonable.  It seems like, you know, it makes sense.  I wasn't outraged or anything.  I accept Page and Brynn as the as having the most control.  Yes, yes, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I suppose long long term it were it may be worrisome because of, you know, what you said about Page and Brynn not lasting forever or moving on or whatever.  But in the short term, I am a big fan of if someone is competent and good at what they do, they should stay in charge of it.  And we too often move people in and out.  I mean, look at Yahoo.  You could you could argue that Jerry Yang is not the right guy to lead that that ship for sure.  But the constant swap of CEO and every CEO coming in and saying, I've got a new plan.  It's very similar to the old plan.  That's a little bit different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That didn't get fully caused by the most recent one did get a bit of caused by shareholders that got caused by not having any freaking plans.  And so I actually think that's you're making a good point, but almost in reverse in the sense that what if Jerry Yang's authority over Yahoo had been concrete?  Would they be even worse off now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and that's that's possible, right?  You could you could make that argument.  Amazing. But my point is, once you lose the founder, whether they're good or bad, you're into this sort of rotato of people who they don't really care about the company.  They're a hired gun.  And maybe they're good.  Maybe they're not.  But they don't. I get the feeling that most of the problems caused in these situations are because the CEO doesn't really care about the business and doesn't really understand strategy is to have a strategy is to have a strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Number one, and to execute it well.  Number two, it is as always a bonus like this.  Who's the best example of that?  Steve Jobs.  He did lose control of his company.  The company needed him back.  He did so well.  Stock structure didn't matter.  We're buying a stock like crazy with most valuable company in the world.  We love him because he had a strategy well executed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Let's let's go to a fun rumor.  We haven't had a fun rumor.  This has all been facts.  Are we going to get Google Drive next week?  It looks like there's some good leaks from the next web.  They say they've got sources.  They've seen documentation and it's going to launch next week with a five gigabyte for free plan.  And then you pay to add to it.  Gina, what's your odds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  This is a tough one.  I feel like we've been hearing this for a long time.  This one sounds maybe a little more authentic.  Maybe it's just because I want it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I think.  That's what I'm wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good. I think we're going to see it.  I think we're going to see it.  I don't know if it's going to be next week because literally how many times have we seen this story over the past three years?  That Google Drive.  Here's my question, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will it be the real question to me is will be better than Dropbox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that is the question.  I mean, Dropbox is definitely the leader in terms of user experience in this in this in this area.  So it sounds like from the rumored specs that it's going to be very similar to Dropbox, only that it's going to offer more space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they say it will integrate with Mac and PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Again, they being the sources, the sources as folders, as regular files, folders, just the way Dropbox does, which is which is really what's so great about Dropbox.  I mean, it just sort of sinks in the end.  You're not uploading.  You know, it doesn't feel like you're uploading or downloading anything.  It just happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What advantages then does Google have over Dropbox if there are parity in terms of that basic functionality besides brand?  But I mean, in terms of functionally, does the fact that Google owns the rest of our lives bring it great advantage or not really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it means that they can integrate results from your personal G Drive in yours in your Google search results.  Right.  So it means that, you know, when you have your phone, you know, out with you, you've got access.  I mean, the Dropbox is a great Dropbox and a bunch of other products that do some similar things to Dropbox.  But I think Dropbox is the leader.  OK, so now I predict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I was going to say, like, you have your files anywhere, but with Google, they'll be integrated with the rest of Google's products potentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I give it three weeks before the Wall Street Journal does a panic.  Google knows what's in your files.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three weeks seems long.  I mean, the truth is that Google has a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can upload files to Google Docs and store them there now.  I mean, I think, you know, the thing about Google Drive is that it'll do this auto syncing.  It'll be baked into your operating system.  And it sounds like it could do things similar to what Google Desktop used to be, the old much missed Google desktop, where you could do searches and it would inject results from your local file system into your Google search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, do you have a sense of whether this Google Drive rumor is the real Google Drive rumor?  Are we going to see Google Drive next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who knows?  It's possible.  I mean, the other thing that they put out today that was interesting was Google Cloud Print when I was sent to Android.  I don't know if you saw that.  Yeah, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Federal Express.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Federal Express as well, which is also interesting.  So I think that that may fit in with this as well.  That's more of a sort of document routing system.  But it seems an obvious thing to route it to Google Docs too.  That's what happens when you email a PDF, you can click on it and send it to Google Docs straight away.  So that fitting that together a bit more would make sense too.  That's a really good point.  I think to some extent, some of the drive stuff is a bit odd.  There's because particularly on mobile, because actually using a file system on a mobile phone is often fairly painful.  And it's certainly something Apple's resisted really hard on the iPhone to the point where they basically handed it over to third parties to build something that does that for them, which is kind of weird.  I'm sort of expecting to do a bit.  I expect them to do something a bit better around that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I would like to see better file management.  It doesn't have to be folders even necessarily.  I don't care if somebody comes up with a better metaphor, but I want to see better file management.  That'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the thing is that they've been doing on the desktop, right?  They've built edit history into the operating system now.  So the way I was talking about of the sort of the GitHub ization of everything.  Don't say wave, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't use the word wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wave did it too.  Wave was an example of this.  The point is that it used to be that storage was expensive and slow.  And so you had a copy of the document in memory and then you would be asked every time you would just save it out to disk because you didn't want to fill the disk up.  And that paradigm is so out of date now.  It's kind of embarrassing to try and explain to somebody what the little floppy disk icon is in Microsoft Word when they're sort of less than 20 years old.  So the fact that, what's that?  It's a floppy disk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the CD icon in iTunes too now.  It's going the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But yeah, that's just more recent things.  We still have those around the house.  I might have a few in the garage somewhere.  But the sort of the worldview of you have to load and save is being gradually eroded.  Google Docs, you know, ended up sort of having to put it back because people were looking for it.  That was some sort of weird user testing thing.  But by default, they didn't do that.  Apple has now changed the operating system with mountain lions such that by default it doesn't have save and save as.  It has some sense of going back through edit histories there.  So they're getting that piece.  We've had it as programmers with source code control for a long time.  But sort of the GitHub world takes it a bit further with the presumption that the first thing you do is clone it into your own repository and then you start forking it.  And then you can eventually merge stuff back later.  But there is an assumption that everything is happening in parallel.  Wikipedia has sort of put this into the public's consciousness by having publicly visible edit histories and be able to go back and forwards in time.  So that paradigm of storage is not a problem.  We should keep every version of everything ever is moving through.  And that would be something that you want on mobile, too.  And that's one of those issues of which have I got on the phone and which have I got in the cloud is the thing that makes it tricky.  But it's something that we want.  I think there will be a battle between Apple and Google about how you present that to the user in a coherent way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they'll be.  So what you're saying, too, is that we won't just save the current version.  They'll be saving your history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would assume that with the best the natural thing to do.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.  Everything's moving in that direction.  Yeah, got it.  Even sort of even to the point of sort of system design, the sort of the growth of functional programming is all about not having contention over a single copy of things, but having paths through data that are modifying things in their own in their own version of the world, if you like.  If you think about the difference between the sort of the way the way JavaScript handles stuff and the way Java handle stuff, Java still have very much a data structure being passed around.  Well, worldview JavaScript has closures that are passed around that contain the entire state of the current machine at the time of that event.  And then they're held as you go off and do something else and come back, which is one of the reasons that not to rave too much about no Jess again.  But one of the reasons that the node feels so nice when you're writing web programming is that it has the same feel that a that you that you get client side with you will do something and call something.  And then when it comes back, you do something else and you end up writing the service side stuff in the same way, which means it's naturally parallel.  It's easy to spin up more machines for it because it's because you've written stuff with the presumption that each each instance of it is wholly independent.  And not everything can be written that way.  The core of node is in C because it has to deal with that kind of routing.  But that is the spread of that worldview is also really interesting.  And there's also the other potential there about the contention between client and server.  So it's getting interesting because if you're running, if you're writing the same code in the same language to run on the client and the server, you can decide to migrate bits back and forth much more easily without having to spend so much time deciding which is which and worrying about the boundaries of the world and the different shape of the system.  And then there's also the data structures.  So if you're creating a JSON object on the server and passing it to the client, you can decide whether you do that or not and which point you render it, which point you don't.  So there's that sort of fluidity, I think, is going to become more important over time.  And that's that we sort of we're seeing the beginnings of that in various directions as programmers worldview worldview change.  And I think that that permeates out to the world as as programmers.  We make those those ideas available to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it frees us up from worrying about where our data is stored, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can help for that. Yes, exactly. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gets us down that road to that mesh.  Couple of things we want to finish up with here.  First of all, FCC has cleared Google over the Wi-Fi eavesdropping from the Google Street View.  They're not going to pay anything for that, but they are going to pay $25,000 for being uncooperative.  In fact, the FCC said they seem to be the world leader in search unless they're searching for an email that we want from them.  That's not an exact quote, but there's something pretty close to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And meanwhile, though, this thing will not die.  Now, at the same time, we think we're finally getting toward the end of it.  Ed Markey in Congress comes out demanding a new investigation of the same bogus thing.  You know, Congressman, our country's in a mess.  People don't have health care.  They don't have mortgages.  We're losing our homes. Europe is falling along.  Move on!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a little snippet of my SSID in a piece of data that Google wants to delete, but you won't let them.  It's not my biggest problem.  I'm so tired of this one.  Yeah.  I'm so tired.  Also, Eileen was very insistent that we talk about the Tupac hologram that was at Coachella this weekend.  It was what was called a Pepper's ghost, which is a rear projection that makes it look like it's in three dimensions.  It's pretty difficult to do, especially in those live circumstances like that.  But what impressed me was the fact that they had a full performance referring to Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, who are on the stage with them,  saying, hey, Coachella, just very in context from somebody who's been dead for several years.  An impressive bit of CGI, if nothing else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely. I was really impressed at how good it looks.  I've been hearing about it, but I didn't watch the video until just before the show.  And I was like, oh, wow.  I was kind of went, you know, I listened to TNT yesterday and I think Sarah said that she just thinks it's weird.  And I agree with her.  But then you said, but it's such a great technology.  And I went from Sarah to Tom when I saw the video.  Like, this is amazing technology.  It looks really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't disagree with Sarah on the weirdness, although we had a caller who explained that, you know,  they talked to the family and made sure that the family was OK and the family was actually cool with it.  They thought it was a good memorial, et cetera.  Still kind of weird.  But just the if you forget about that, just the ability to actually create someone.  I mean, I know I don't know what other applications you can have with this, but it just you know,  as we've gone from putting somebody in Forrest Gump in a scene that already existed to having actors  and famous movies say other lines in a direct TV commercial than the lines they actually said to this.  I mean, we're not that far down the road from just being able to create performances out of nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want the Gina hologram next to me to fix my problems in technology today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Gina Graham.  The Gina Graham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know if you want that.  You might the Leo Graham, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want my very own Gina right next to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a brilliant novel by Connie Willis that was written about 20 years ago that talks about what will happen when this is possible  and the future of movies when you can recreate people from archival material called remake.  I really recommend that if you want to sort of find someone who's thought this through once already.  That's by Connie Willis, did you say?  Connie Willis, yes, remake.  I'll have to check that out.  Probably, probably, or if you're, if you're smart, you should option it the film rights a bit now because it's actually possible.  So, but yeah, no, this is, I mean, this is something that people have been able to do to some extent for a while.  If you actually think about many, you know, serious Hollywood pictures, they have chunks of this going on where they're either repainting the leads over the stuntmen  or they're, you know, creating characters from whole cloth like Gollum.  But there hasn't been as much of this sort of, you know, rebuild, rebuild an existing person from their from their preexisting footage stuff.  There's been bits of it with there were there were adverts that had Fred Astaire and things like that.  Yeah, yeah.  But to actually turn them into a full puppet that somebody can perform or that somebody can render is a tough problem.  Yeah, that's technology catches up with that.  There's this there's a there's a bit of uncanny valley to it, but it's getting closer to being convincing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Definitely. Let's finish up with our picks.  And Kevin, let me know if you if you've got one and I'll get to you in a second.  But we'll start off with Gina.  I think we may have stepped on yours a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's it. Yeah.  Kevin mentioned it earlier.  This is really cool.  Cool. New thing in Chrome.  Google Cloud Print now supports ice cream sandwich Android devices and can print to your local FedEx office.  So if you're at a coffee shop or you ever went to a garden like Kevin usually is or you're just in a hotel or wherever and you want to print something in Chrome from the print dialog, you can choose Google Cloud Print from the printer drop down.  And in the latest version of Chrome, it offers it will show you your ice cream sandwich devices and you can say print to my local FedEx office and then you can go pick up your print out there.  So neat, neat, new, new feature in Google Cloud Print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, some people may say, well, why would I want to print to the FedEx office?  But I had a big hefty legal thing that I had to go and make a copy of at the FedEx office because it was so huge.  I wasn't going to do it on my little Epson at home.  Right. So I so I had to take it down with a file and then give them the file.  You know, this would have been so much better.  I would have just emailed it or printed it and then gone and picked it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For anything that long documents that you want a nice print out and you don't want to use, you know, your home, your home, your home, Inc.  It's great. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope you weren't turning into a patent troll.  Wasn't a patent suit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was. Well, I've got a patent for displaying excellent journalism printouts behind me in a method and apparatus for doing that in a video stream.  You'll be hearing from my lawyer.  But in the meantime, what's your number, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this one is not my number and pardon me for looking away, folks, but because I'm staffed to machine, the first number is one year of my life I lost through a fight with bandwidth today.  The second not my number is Richard Branson.  I don't know if this is new or not, but Richard Branson invested in the next round in PATH with Redpoint, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, Index, Mark Pinkus, Uri Miller, Allen and Company.  This is what Instagram hath wrought.  But the real number of the week, a nice little Accenture survey that found that I found this fascinating.  Sixty four percent of U.S. customers recall seeing social media icons while watching TV.  In other words, when the weatherman says you can find me on Twitter and a third of them interacted with the social service after seeing the symbol on the screen.  How important is that to future views of what advertising means and the connection that it creates for Facebook, etc.  Of course, led the way 42 percent say they had noticed a Facebook like symbol while watching a TV show and knew how to interact with a 20 percent.  They ended up said they ended up liking the TV program while watching some other quick numbers.  Forty three percent said obtain more information about a show product or service.  They use social media.  Thirty three percent said used it to get social coupons.  Thirty one percent in her cost us and so on and so on and so on.  It just it just really emphasize that if you wonder why Facebook is going to be worth what it's going to be worth when the IPO hits that they've not even begun to plumb and mine yet.  This is the kind of stuff it is that that the direct connection that social creates between a brand and its customer replaces advertising cost and supplants advertising functionality is better than a message is truly a relationship.  It's something that brands are starting to learn that media have not yet learned apart from the likes of Leo Laporte at all.  And so that's my numbers of the week.  All right.  Thank you for that.

Transcript:  My tool is an extension I don't think has been covered on twig that when I went from Chrome recently and switched to Firefox for a while and then I had to go back to Chrome.  One of the things I missed from Firefox is when I click on a tab, it opens all the way to the right in Chrome.  The default is to have it open right next to the tab you're in.  Tabs Plus is an extension on Chrome, not tabs, mix plus, but tabs plus allows you to customize lots of different tab behaviors.  Choose where the focus will be after closing a tab.  Choose the default behavior for a new tab.  You can pin current tabs so they won't be used for the last selected behavior.  Lots of cool stuff.  The biggest thing I do is I have it changed that my tabs open as last in the in the row.  So they always open all the way to the right because that's just the way I like it.  But check it out.  Tabs Plus, it's a good Chrome extension that I use every day.  It's a little bit wonky at first because what it does is it opens the tab and then moves it.  So you'll see it open next to your tab and then move over here.  I'll go do it.  Check this out.  You open the tab real quick.  You see it and then it shoves it over there.  But I got used to it.  So it's fine.  And it works for me.  So tabs plus.  Check it out in the Chrome Web Store.  I will finish up.  Kevin, you've got a tip as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  More of a call to action, really.  The UK government is putting out a consultation on open standards and they're accepting submissions from individuals as well as companies.  So so far, my understanding is they've had a lot of submissions from large IP lawyers saying that patterns are a wonderful thing and promote standards.  It would be great if we could send them some submissions that were more along the lines of patterns of creating a terrible problem for the Internet.  So that's that's the thing I wanted to share with people here in case that they knowing how big this audience is.  So you can find that.  I'm just thinking your is a bit long, but it's consultation.  Cabinet office dot gov dot UK slash open standards.  And they it will be it'll be good to send it.  Send that they have got a series of questions.  There aren't they're asking.  So if you can give them a sort of well reasoned response, the points pointing to evidence that will be useful just in getting them to think about this in a similar way to getting the U.S.  Congress to rethink patterns will be good, too.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, great stuff.  Thank you, Kevin.  And thanks, everybody, for watching or listening.  Leo will be back from NAB tomorrow.  So he'll be back next week on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hopefully it'll make things better.  I think.  BuzzMachine.com.  Anything and public parts.  And Gutenberg the Geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gutenberg the Geek is apparently going to get translated into Chinese and Japanese.  Wow.  Congrats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a reason to learn Chinese and Japanese.  Yeah.  Kevin, Mark's always a pleasure to have you on any show I do.  You bring such depth of knowledge and wisdom.  It's great to have you along.  Of course, Tummelvision.tv, which you do with some great folks, some of my favorite folks over there.  Let folks know what that is real quick and where they can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Tummelvision.tv is a podcast we do live every Thursday.  We hit episode 100 this week.  Congratulations.  There's a great archival stuff there.  And it's about the skills you need, the sort of social skills you need in technology.  So the tummler is the Jewish person who would get people to dance with each other at weddings and make the party actually happen.  And we think that's the skill set that's really important for social media.  So that's what the show's about.  The other thing that I would say is if you're thinking of developing stuff, use Heroku, which is owned by Salesforce, which I work for.  But having hacked on it this weekend, I can wholeheartedly endorse that as a way of getting websites up quickly and usefully.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks, everybody, for watching or listening.  We are, of course, fans of all kinds of IPA.  Here at This Week at Google.  We'll be back next time.  We'll see you then.
