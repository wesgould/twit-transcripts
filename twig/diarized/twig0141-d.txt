Welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm excited to talk about glasses.  Glasses?  Let's get through the intro first.  They're half full.  They are half full. Today they're half full.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mr. Jeff Jarvis, my friends of the City University of New York, where he teaches the new journalism to young children.  He's also a blogger at BuzzMachine.com and author of many great books like What Would Google Do? and his latest Public Parts.  Thank you for the plugs as always.  Today wearing leather so he won't moire.  I learned that term on glee.  And leather, I mean.  And then we got all the way over to the right.  We got Mr. Matthew Ingram of GigaOM, GigaOM.com.  And no one knows why his Twitter handle is Matthew I.  I guess it's his name.  For a while I thought it was Matt Huey.  Hey Matthew.  Frozen solid.  He's turned to stone.  Stop looking at your wife and keep going forward.  He's a biller assault.  All right.  Let's.  I like the boxing gloves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're in a fighting mood today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm feisty today.  I've been fighting with that's because I've been fighting with my Galaxy tablet.  I haven't turned.  It's my fault.  I haven't turned it on in a year and it's feeling left out.  But I wanted to show you something hot and new that requires honeycomber later on a tablet.  So I'm going to you know what?  I'm going to defer to you, Gina, because you were excited about talking about the glasses that we're all going to get at Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you're from your lips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll all be stumbling around.  I didn't see anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Google I.O. is going to be such a train wreck because everybody's going to be looking like this or looking like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are so Google this ice?  I swear to God, I thought this was a hoax when we first heard about it.  But now no less authority than Nick Bilton in the freaking New York Times says Google is testing these glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's the one who broke the story initially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I remember.  Now, these photos come from Google.  So this is it.  This is the real play the video or we get banned over.  I've got it here.  We go and we should mention this.  We should mention this.  That last week we aired what I thought was a great promotional video, promotional video for Google and its and its self-driving cars was a great needs any promotion.  It was a great video and it came from Google as promotional.  They yanked us off YouTube immediately.  Content removed at request of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The robots did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it was the robots because we immediately appeal is a robot, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, they say Python pulled us.  Hey, welcome back, Matthew.  So we appealed it.  So here's how it works.  Just for those who don't know.  So there is a kind of automated content filter, which, by the way, is totally being gamed because we have shows that I get flagged all the time for for violating content from Brazilian TV companies that we've never aired any content from.  So I think these companies are gaming the content filter saying, yes, I will own anything that has anything in it that says Zuby Zuby Zoo.  And then what happens is, but don't worry, don't pull it down.  Just put our ads in it.  It's a way of third parties getting ads into our content by gaming Google's content filter.  This is my thesis because I'm telling you, I get requests.  I get these notices all the time.  Don't worry.  Not your content is not going to be pulled down.  We're just going to put ads on it.  We might put ads on it.  So that's a YouTube thing that is already bugging me.  So this time they pulled it down.  Now, the way it works, it's automated.  Take you.  So if you're a content creator, you could you tell Google, here's I guess the thumbprint, right?  The fingerprint of our content somehow.  And if you see this, do something and you're given a number of choices, you can say, yank it.  You can say, put our ads on it or something like buy.  You can say, put ads on it or buy this product, buy this song.  So you have a choice.  Google in this case, yanked it.  Now, the next step is for us, the people who put the video up in the first place, to appeal.  So there's a form.  You fill out a form saying, no, no, no.  And there's a couple of things.  We own this content.  That's wrong.  Is there a fair use exemption?  Is there actually a checkbox that says, no, we say that we have the right to do this?  I don't think there is.  But that's our assertion is we're a news organization.  There is?  OK.  Tom, who does this pretty much all the time, knows.  Anyway, Alex Gumpel and our staff filled this out and they immediately put it back.  Now, it's not been taken down again.  What happens is a human then reviews it.  And at that point, the human says, no, that's a violation.  It'll get pulled down again.  Now, there's a long 10-day appeal process that is much more complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What content does Google have that it possibly wants to protect under copyright?  Everything Google puts online is promotional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's why.  Well, there's a couple of things.  First of all, and I'll pass this along.  Anybody does a podcast.  The thumb, the fingerprinting tool doesn't work very well.  So if you don't make the video full screen, if you just show it in context on the YouTube screen, apparently it just doesn't even know.  So that was one mistake I made.  I wanted to go full screen on that great video.  So I did it.  And I figured, well, how could I didn't look at the license, but how could Google complain that we're playing a promotional video on a show about Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So just do Mystery Science Theater 3000 and you can show anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but that's the other side of it is now there's this is kind of a fair use provision, which means it's never it's not you know, you have to test it in court.  It's a defense.  It's not proactive.  So it doesn't protect you until somebody says no.  And then you have to go to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As Larry Lessig says, it's it's the right to hire a lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, thank you.  Thanks, Congress.  But that's our assertion is that we're a news organization and we are protected in not to use it as a production value, but in the in the coverage of this news to show clips, you see it all the time on television, right?  That's normal.  But we're not nobody knows who the hell twig is.  And so we get pulled all the time.  Anyway, so let's so having said all this, here's a little test.  Now we're going to do it again.  Let's do it again.  And let's go full screen.  Well, we don't have to really.  OK, well, I tell you, the problem is if they pull it down, it costs us money because that's a day's worth of impressions, even if we react right away that we lose.  So, yeah, make it make it be in the window.  OK, here we go.  Then your audience and we can talk about this.  OK, here we go.  Project Glass.  One day we believe technology should work for you to be there when you need it.  So I'm going to narrate because there's people listening on the audio.  There's a guy in flip flops just got up looking at his desk, making some coffee.  And now he's looking through glasses that tell him what he has to do today.  What?  He's looking out the window.  It says 58 degrees with a chance of rain.  He's eating a sandwich and his friend, Ev Williams, says, want to meet up today?  And he talks back to him, says, maybe a strand books and it says sent and then goes back to his sandwich.  All of this through his eyes, you're seeing out his these are the glasses.  It's augmented reality.  Subway service suspended before he even goes down the stairs.  So it gives him a walking route.  And he's going to take that route from Google Maps.  Walk right into the middle of the street.  There's some puppies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surprised you didn't tell them the breed of the dog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, oh, this is interesting.  He's looking at a poster for a Mr. Gano concert.  Is that a real person?  And he's getting any book tickets just like that.  He's in a bookstore and it's showing him where to go.  Oh, yes.  This is it.  Now he's learning to play the ukulele.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Paul here yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's talking to himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He would have gotten the book out.  He would have seen the barcode.  He would have found the cheaper price at another store.  Paul's four and two feet away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's Paul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No facial recognition.  No, this is Paul.  Yeah, it's a jerk.  None of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's loading the taco truck to see if it's OK.  He's checking in on mud trucks.  This is New York.  What is mud? Coffee?  Is he getting coffee?  What do you call it? Coffee light?  Light and sweet.  Light and sweet.  Take a photo of this.  He's going to take a photo with his glasses.  Sharing it to my circles.  Sharing it to his circles.  Because he's the last person still using Google+.  Oh, I'm running late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh.  Music.  That'll get you pulled off YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Jessica wants to talk.  Hi, what's up?  Hey.  He's actually seeing video of Jessica while he looks.  Apparently he's kind of playing suicide.  But Jessica's going to...  Is he going to jump?  Oh, he's learning the ukulele and jumping.  And he's playing the Google theme on his ukulele.  He's a fast learner.  And she thinks it's adorable.  G.co slash project glass.  There, I gave him even a promotional plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We want, we want, we want, we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In that video they never show the glasses.  But this is what the picture in the times is of the glasses.  These don't look like the oklies that we thought they were.  In fact, they look particularly dorky.  They do.  She looks like Seven of Nine.  It's like a half of Jordy LaForge's visor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Kind of on one side of your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very borgish.  What the hell?  So anyway, this is...  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're not as bad as I thought.  They're not as bad as they could have been, style-wise.  I don't like that there's only one side that has the camera,  the bit of hardware that's required to have the camera and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want our audience to imagine that all of us on the show now are wearing them though.  We're all wearing them.  We soon will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, and by the way, doesn't work with an iPhone, I presume.  You have to have an Android phone.  That's where all of this power is coming from.  The glasses can stream information to the lenses  and allow the wearer to send and receive messages through voice command.  There's a built-in camera to record video and take pictures.  And there you go.  I want Project Glass.  They also say it could hypothetically become Project Contact Lens.  People are building...  Not Google, but Nick does.  He quotes a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in,  well, you know why, bio-nano technology.  Thanks to the miracles of bio-nano technology,  which is the fusion of tiny technologies and biology.  Well, then skip the lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hardwire straight in.  Where's the USB port?  I missed it somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's Professor Párez's lens.  It's a...  You put that in your eye and shove it.  Smoke it.  Whatever it is.  So these are pretty, you know, they're interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These are cool.  I mean, the chat room said, come on.  The reality is I'm dying to try this out.  Dying to try this out.  I would buy these in a second if I could.  And I really hope that they are going to be at Google I.O.  Wouldn't that be awesome?  If not the giveaway, then at least a couple of prototypes  that people can try out, you know, on the floor.  What would you pay, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least as much as you paid for your phone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I would think so.  So, Leah, you're saying that it connects to your phone.  So it's like Bluetooth connection to your phone.  That's my understanding. Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes sense.  You're not going to put all the CPU in there.  And by the way, you might want to sell some Android phones  while you're at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. Yeah, that makes sense.  I would probably pay as much as my phone,  although I'm a little crazy.  I don't know if a regular consumer would.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd pay $1,000 for these. Are you kidding?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I'd pay $1,000.  The issue is not the cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm made of money, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Gina, would you wear them all the time?  Or would you just try them out now and then?  Well, I don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I really would have to try them to see how they really work in real life.  I mean, you know, you have to think about kind of remember the Google TV demo problem.  I mean, like, you know, it's like in theory, this looks really great.  That's exactly what's going to be my point.  These glasses, that demo video is amazing.  But are they really going to work that way?  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not. Of course not.  Well, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's totally the issue. It's not the price.  Right.  It doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I wonder. So you go to the subway entrance, you know, and there's just a spinning colored ball or whatever.  You're waiting for it to tell you, should I get on the subway or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is going to change the way we build cities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, a lot of it has to do with your data connection,  whether or not you're in a city where it's going to recognize the subway that you're getting on  or if you even take the subway, if all your friends actually do share their location on Google Latitude down to the foot.  So I can say, where is my friend?  I found it wonderfully sort of charming and ironic that the demo video was of this guy going to a bookstore to buy a book on how to play the ukulele.  That's funny. How to play the uke.  And you know, it wasn't just like, hey, download a book to my Android phone from the Google Play Market on how to play a ukulele.  But, you know, I'm really interested in what the experience is for my eyeballs to focus in on the heads up display.  Versus what I'm trying to look at.  And a lot of people brought up the awkwardness of just speaking into a device, you know, like talking.  But we've done that. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Though I thought it was crazy.  Everybody's wearing these little Bluetooth things and you see crazy people talking.  And we got pretty used to it, didn't we?  Yeah, we got used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But come on, everybody might make fun of those people.  Yeah. But if you're a Bluetooth guy, you don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  You're busy driving your cab.  Hawaii Dave in our chat room said something I think that's kind of telling.  I'd buy it if it came from Apple.  Right?  Right. Isn't that the case?  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that because Google has a reputation for putting out half fake products that break and get into boot loops?  No.  Two weeks later?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd buy it if it came from.  You know, if it came from Apple would, you know, then it'd be at least to be kind of work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and the other part of it is that especially when these first get released, people are going to notice them.  They look different.  They look a little weird.  You're going to spend most of your time explaining what's on your face, you know, maybe then actually getting value out of them.  So but do I love to fantasize about a world where everybody has one of these and it's just kind of a normal way of interacting?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if somebody asks you, you say, they're my Google glasses.  Yeah.  They're my Google goggles.  And then I leave it at that.  And then I'll take it.  Now, my question is, and I'm trying to understand this.  I see the guy's eye.  Do you, how does this work?  Are you looking up through the I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think you look at the look at the video.  It was just it was just it's projected on.  So is it projecting this into my retina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then so I'm looking straight ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a heads up display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Is it reflected in your eye or is it reflective on the glasses?  So he's looking at stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is bogus.  I was not going to look.  But but that looks like look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, that's an overlay over his, you know, but if you look at these glasses,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we're not they're not looking through the glasses at me.  They're looking at me.  I think you're looking at a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  The old ones.  You have literally a little screen up here.  Right.  These in neither case, that little thing that's over her eye.  I don't know that you're not looking a little screen up there.  So you would look up to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like New York Times.  New York Times article makes it sound like it's projecting information on a screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a little screen.  You can't really set it in your eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can actually.  But I'll bet you ten dollars if you describe that to somebody, they wouldn't be, you know,  optimistic about trying it out.  It beams it right into your retina.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, as long as it's not doing it with a laser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you notice that things go kind of blurry in the background when in this video,  I realize that this demo video is just a demo.  It looks as if you have to focus on the screen.  You have to focus on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what the Times article says it's not.  They're saying it's a well-designed pair of wraparound glasses with a clear display that sits above the eye.  The glasses can stream information to the lenses.  I don't see any.  There's only one lens.  Maybe there's maybe maybe. Yeah.  Yeah, that's what's really weird looking is you're wearing glasses that actually don't have a lens.  They have a Borg piece.  Well, I'll have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A Borg piece. A Borg piece is probably good.  I am Borg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am part human, part machine.  Which part would you like to speak to today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the part I like the best was where you could just take a picture.  Yeah.  Because I know I see lots of things I want to take a picture of and then I have to get my phone out and then I have to,  you know, be nice to just be able to look at something and say, take a picture.  By voice command. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I wonder how good that camera is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's no bigger than the camera anywhere.  I mean, it could be a very good camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be. It could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the camera is recognized.  Okay. You have a combination of geo data and camera data, right?  It's like your own self-driving car, except you have feet still.  Right. So it's combining the two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The question is, do you want to be 1.0 of 9 or 0.01 of 9?  I'll wait till it's 7, 8, 10.  Then once it's 7, it'll be safe. That's 7.  I'd rather buy 1.0 of anything.  Version 1.0 of 9.  You know what? We should get Jerry Ryan on the show.  Ask her what she would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you ever heard of Steve Mann, the University of Toronto professor, the cyborg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. He was at MIT, right? He was the guy who walked around all the time.  Now he's at Toronto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When he first started, he had this huge headset and a giant backpack, and it weighed about 100 pounds.  And then eventually it was just basically glasses like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. Matthew Ingram is here from GigaOM. We love GigaOM. GigaOM.com.  What's your beat, Matthew? Do you just get to cover anything you feel like?  My beat is the internet.  The internet. I'm in charge of the internet, says Matthew.  I guess media is my thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  But everything's media, right?  Anything. You cover anything you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything and nothing. There's no mediators left. There is no media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it doesn't drop when you break it, it's part of my beat.  If it doesn't break when you drop it.  I like drop when you break it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that too.  So is Jeff Jarvis. So is Gina Trapani. We're going to talk about Larry Page.  It is one year anniversary as CEO. What's the report card? That's next.  But first, let's tell you how you never have to go to the post office again.  I'm not talking forever, Stamps.  I'm talking bringing the post office to your desk.  So that everything you need to do, you can do right here with your computer and your printer.  It's stamps.com. Mac or PC. It lets you print real US postage for a letter, a package, anything.  A postcard. You've got a USB scale that goes right into the computer.  So you drop the thing on the scale and it's always exactly right.  If you're mailing internationally, you know what a hassle that is.  If you want to mail something to England, you have to go to the post office.  They get the international postage. You've got to fill out forms.  Stamps.com does it for you. You don't have to go to the post office.  In fact, there's nothing you can do at the post office.  You can't do it at your desk with stamps.com.  Even post 9-11, I tried this. You can't mail a package more than 13 ounces in a mailbox  because they're worried about whatever.  You can with stamps.com. In fact, because it's got an indicia on it, so there's identity information,  so they're comfortable. It's got a barcode on it. They're comfortable with that.  So in fact, the mail carrier comes to you and takes anything you want.  A 100-pound packet. No problem. Yeah, we trust you. You're using stamps.com.  You also get discounts you cannot get anywhere else.  The post office will not give you up to 21% on express mail.  Up to 15% off on priority mail. No, but stamps.com will.  So, all right. So look, this is cool. You don't need special ink. You don't need a postage meter.  Get rid of the postage meter. You just need stamps.com, a computer and a printer.  You get the scale. I get a deal. Now see right there on the page at stamps.com, it says $80. Forget that.  Click the microphone up at the top there. Don't do the $80 deal.  And put twig, T-W-I-G. Eileen's going to do it right now. I've convinced her.  And then look what you get. First of all, a lovely picture of me. No?  Aww. Used to get a picture of me.  Now all you get is a $110 bonus offer, including $55 free postage and the scale.  All you have to do is pay for your shipping and handling. You get a couple of bucks.  And a month of stamps.com. This is a great deal. $55 in free postage. Come on.  That's going to get you a couple of months of postage right there.  If you're an eBay seller, this is great. An Amazon seller, it's great.  Stamps.com. Click the funny looking microphone in the upper right hand corner.  Use the offer code TWIG for a $110 no risk trial, including the scale and $55 free postage.  Stamps.com. Don't put it off. I cannot promise you how long this is going to last. You've got to do it.  Do not delay. And I'm telling you, you'll thank me.  Because I think they're changing the price of the stamps soon and they're closing posts.  Two out of the three post offices in Petaluma are slated for closing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In June, I run, if anybody's interested in this, I helped organize a conference in Washington called Postal Vision 2020.  You're kidding.  No, because some guy named John Callan read what would Google do and said, you know, he was at a conference where somebody asked the head of the Regulatory Commission in the US, what would Google do if they own post offices?  How interesting.  They'd give everybody a computer and a printer.  And he thought that they'd read the book. They hadn't. So he gave him a copy.  And I find it so fascinating. It's such a disrupted industry on the one hand. On the other hand, it's disrupting retail on the parcel end.  And so if anybody's fascinated with this, as I am, there's huge, I think, disruptive entrepreneurial opportunities in this area.  Postal Vision 2020. I'm not making any money off of it, but I just find it to be a fascinating topic.  This June.  This June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cool.  I think actually it is a very interesting area.  It really actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, because you, when you realize how much of the Postal Service is subsidized by first class and by the notion of number one, a letter.  What's that? And then number two, bills.  Right. You have to get. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Take that high, the high.  All I get now is junk mail. It's the only thing I get in the mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And so that's essentially been subsidized by first class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't want to do that. And there's no first class anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So the economics of the Postal Department, all of that infrastructure that they have that they don't really need anymore.  So what do you do? Could you put post offices in Walgreens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Put it on your desk. You just said it. Computer prayer.  Bingo. Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't need to put it anywhere.  If any. So literally, if the Postal Department gave you a constant discount to use stamps.com, not to plug the sponsor, to use them.  They do, by the way.  Right. I mean, so the constant discount. At some point, you're going to change the economics. So why would you go to the post office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The value of the post office is you've got a bunch of people running around in little trucks.  If they could figure out how to capitalize on that, get rid of everything else.  But you could they could be delivering ice cream.  Think about that. Right.  Or you get the Schwann guy to start delivering mail. Either way, one or the other.  Milkman. Bring back the milkman. You get the occasional letter.  Oh, man. But you knew the milkman was in trouble when they started adding like products, like they started doing milk shampoo.  That was when you knew there must be a must be a problem in fundamental economics of getting up in the morning, delivering milk to people.  I think the post office is mandated by the Constitution. You're right. We need a constitutional amendment to get rid of it. But they can cut it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can you can have universal service other ways. You could you could subsidize UPS. Right.  Not to go off on this week and going postal. Right. Hey, I like it. That's a good title.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So Larry Page, when did he what was the actual date that he became?  He's one year now. Right. April 4th. Right. So this is today is the anniversary.  I hope they give him a cake or something. He replaced it.  Hard to believe it's been a year that he replaced Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google.  What kind of year has it been? Matthew, would you what grade would we give Larry Page in his first year as the CEO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good one. I'd have to say probably in the B plus range. I mean, not perfect.  No. And I think, you know, there's some things he's done that that I think some people would give high marks to, like, say,  streamlining things, shutting down lots of products, lots of experiments, the labs and so on that.  You know, I kind of go back and forth on that. Is that a good thing or is it a bad thing?  I actually think you could argue it's good that he streamlined the company and focused it and so on.  But at the same time, I think a lot of those things were part of what made Google special.  You know, the like Google Glasses or the Google Art Project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree that Stephen Levy's got a good article in Wired about this.  The pull quote is when I asked Larry last September what he thought was Google's threat,  the answer was out of his mouth before I even finished the query. Google, he said.  The biggest threat to Google is Google. You agree, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, Eric Spitz gave the same answer when I asked him that. So it's one area where they were well in alignment.  And I think that's why they had the management change is that the management structure.  And they said this at the time, it fulfilled its purpose for a while, but they were standing in the way of progress and focus and so on.  And so clearly that they knew they had to focus. That's why Larry has been so perhaps maniacal about focus.  The hard part I have in judging his reign so far is separating out those things that came before it.  Right. So Buzz and the Buzz screw up, I think was a screw up before or certainly started before he was solely in charge.  You know, we can get back into the argument about whether they really screwed up privacy or not.  I don't think they have. But I agree with Matthew.  I'd say it's B plus because we're not even at the midterm yet.  We're just barely into the first working period.  It's a thank you, Professor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll finish this homework.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a mixed bag because on the one hand, I think you could say that he's done some good stuff focusing the company.  But this has been the year that Google has suffered its biggest black marks of all. Right, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. And a lot of people would say that there I mean, what's the biggest product launch that Google's had in the past year?  I mean, Google Plus Plus.  And there's a lot that that's a mixed bag.  So you could argue that that's the Google Plus is the long term play and that the classification of everything is Google, you know, moving the shifting the entire company toward being more social.  And that, you know, even though people don't love it right at the moment, they will in the long term.  So he's making the right decisions.  At the same time, you can make the argument that Google Plus was not a spectacular product that changed lives right away.  You know, that that answer to that question, you know, what's Google's biggest challenge?  Google, it's a good answer, but it also seems a little insular to me.  I think maybe an honest answer would have included things like Facebook and Twitter.  I mean, I think that that feeling is certainly a good point within the company that there.  I mean, obviously, Google Plus was a response to feeling like Facebook was dominating an area that that Google that Google couldn't or didn't.  So so while so I would say that I think a B plus is fair is a fair mark for him.  I think the focus focus on particular products, trimming the fat, all good things at the same time.  I mean, you know, somebody said I forget maybe it was Adam from Lifehacker said on Twitter that the April Fool's gags that Google did this past weekend, I mean, were some of the best product announcements they've had in a really long time.  And, you know, that says something.  It was kind of stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The we ran down all the Google April Fool's jokes on Twitter.  It made me feel like what are they doing?  This seems like more energy was put into those April Fool's jokes than they put in everything else they've done all year.  Yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm really looking forward to I.O.  I think that Google Glasses is really cool.  I'm interested.  I'm interested to see things like Google Drive finally kind of come to fruition.  And I'm not anti Google Plus.  I just don't think that Google Plus was the big blockbuster that things like Gmail and Maps were kind of back in the day.  And I was like, I think it's.  It depends on where you look at it.  It's not clear, though.  You know, it's not.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I, you know, I think it's.  Listen, they're clumsy with design.  They're clumsy with announcements.  And, you know, I'm hesitant to say that we need a slicker Google, but we do.  You just said that.  Right.  All of the product announcements done for April Fool's were much slicker than Google does.  But when it does things, Google could get too slick.  Part of what we like about it is that it's not fully slick.  But let's just say that, yes, it needs to be slicker.  And that's true in all these areas.  You know, Google Plus, I still think has the essence of something.  And I don't think that it is the anti Facebook.  My art.  I made this argument a hundred times in the show, but it's single generation.  And I say that Google Plus and Android are about in terms of their product value, in terms of separate from monetary value, product value are about bringing new data, new signals about people and content to Google.  And that Google can measure the success or failure of Google Plus differently.  Is it the new Facebook?  No, it's never going to be that.  I'll fully concede that.  No problem.  But does Google learn a lot from Google Plus?  Does it bring new services which they again to search they make, you know, clumsily designed, badly designed, badly announced, badly let out.  But is there potential there?  I think it's way too soon to call it a flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, you know, Jeff, it still it feels to me like even your description sort of feels to me like I know.  And I've said this before.  I know what Google is getting out of Google Plus.  I know they're getting lots of my data.  I know they're getting they're probably triangulating all sorts of things about me and and and my demographic or whatever.  But so I sort of see what they're getting in terms of pulling in information.  I don't actually see what I get out of it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I get and you know, there's people who are denizens of it and like it.  What I'm getting very simply is quality conversation.  I get a better conversation on Google Plus than I get my blog, which is mainly people who don't like me and Twitter, which is, hey, look, there's a fight over there, which I'm really sick of.  And, you know, there's other places where, you know, hacker news or or slash dot slash dot or or read it or you might have conversations you like.  Well, and now but here's here's the huge caveat.  Yes, I'm on the on the recommended list and I just looked just now.  This should be my number of the day.  No, go ahead.  Use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll get another number for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got one.  I just saw just now I just passed a million alleged followers on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I think you can make the case, though, that suggested user list is I think is a sign of a problem because I'm not on the suggested user list and I'm totally stalled out at 287.  Yes, I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the thing about it is that it's also rather meaningless.  I don't I'm not in conversations with people who basically don't know.  I'm in conversations with people who really do truly follow.  And so I don't know how the algorithm is working and how much I'm really shown to people.  I don't think it's much.  So, yeah, I think that kind of absurdity of the list and that number is ridiculous.  But I just go back to the bottom line for me, Matthew.  I get good quality conversations out of Google Plus and it depends on who you follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess.  Sorry.  Sorry. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say, I think that like the we're defining participating on Google Plus participating in the network the same way we define participating on Facebook or Twitter.  And I think that it's it's actually a lot more than that.  I think that just clicking plus one on a link in your search results or checking in on Google Attitude on Android or I don't know, clicking on somebody's circle information in your contacts.  I think because Google Plus like little bits of Google Plus are going to be part of every single Google product that in a lot of ways you're giving them signals and you're using the network without going to Google, you know, plus dot Google dot com and writing a post.  Right. Like that's a very active way to participate.  But there are going to be very passive ways to participate, especially when you have.  Sorry, Jeff, this is your number when you have more than 50 percent of smartphones or Android phones.  What you're signed in your Google account already, you're signed into your plus account.  Your Google account is your plus account, basically.  So, you know, saying, hey, I'm at this this great taco truck.  Check me in is a way to sort of participate in plus, especially with the privacy policy consolidation.  So like I get it.  Like if I don't go to Google, I don't go to Google Plus, I don't write a whole lot of Google Plus.  Really, I talk about Google because I know that that's my my my highest chances for Google employees.  What I have to say about Google is there are plus I'm still participating in the network in a lot of ways just by using all the different products because Google Plus is Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I totally use myself as a measure.  And that's the only way I can ever do anything.  And I just notice I just don't really feel the urge to go to Google.  I used to check it every day with my home page.  Still is my home page. I just don't feel the urge to know that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what Gina just said, I think I think it's now tie in, Gina, what you just said to the to the demo video we watched of the classes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that was all Google Plus going on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  There's no web page.  There's no text stuff.  There's no search.  There's there's the results of all that.  Right.  You're in a much higher layer of the world and technology connected.  And, you know, if let's give Google credit for this.  Let's assume they think they and Mark Zuckerberg think highly strategically.  And that they're not worried about indeed this quarter, even in Google Plus, they've got to look at it and say, what's the world going to look like in two, three years even?  And what competencies, expertise, services, data are we going to have to survive when we get there?  And I think that's the context in which you have to judge Google Plus.  Now, that's none of that is to say that Google Plus is perfect.  Brilliant. Couldn't screw up. Couldn't die.  All that's true. All that's absolutely true.  But I think it's a big mistake to think of it just in terms of going on to it to Facebook.  I think Gina is way right about this.  Yeah, I mean, I listen to Spotify and I'm sharing what songs I listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm sharing what songs I'm playing to Facebook automatically.  Right. That whole frictionless sharing thing.  That's what Google Plus is doing.  And I think we're just going to see a lot more of that.  I mean, that was a hangout.  The chat with his girlfriend in the video was a hangout.  The check ins, the checking his friends location.  So, you know, I think for all the people that say, oh, Google Plus is a failure because I don't go to plus.google.com and interact with my friends there.  Aren't taking all that other activity into account.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that's part of the problem with, you know, everybody wants to measure the numbers.  You know, part of the problem is a lot of people are engaging through Google Plus or with Google Plus by doing those other things that you mentioned.  They're never actually going there, but they're still, you know, content is flowing in and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Which means it's not a successful social network in that it's foreground.  But as you said, Matthew, it's very successful for Google in collecting signals.  It's a background social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin Marks and I were talking about this.  Why doesn't Google have more API access to Google Plus?  I mean, it would be a big difference.  I would contribute a huge amount to that network.  Other tools that I'm using already like Tweet, Tuck or whatever.  Why don't they do?  Precisely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they don't get my photos because I use Instagram or Path and it goes to Facebook.  They get all my photos.  Right.  It goes to Flickr.  I mean, they're the only argument.  Why don't they have a right API, Gina?  That's crazy.  Oh, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  It's been a long time.  I'm hoping that that's going to be announced at I.O.  That's crazy.  I'm not sure why it's taken so long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vick has said it is his fault.  And the reason it's his fault, the argument that he gives is very simply that he doesn't want...  And, you know, Facebook hates it that people put their Twitter feed onto Facebook.  They shouldn't.  Well, but they do.  And, you know, when I...  Why do they hate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they're not going to see ads on Facebook's news, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you're not going to Facebook.  You're putting it in noise.  You're not really part of...  You're enriching the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like...  But if Google wants signals from people, that's when they need APIs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with that, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think there are two things.  One, remember Buzz when...  Well, Buzz got bad.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, we just put our Twitter in there because we weren't into it.  That's all it becomes.  And don't forget, Google's at a precious moment now when people like you are saying, eh, it's over.  So if people just make it a repository for a whole bunch of automated feeds,  that will kill it, right?  And, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I go back to Facebook all the time.  I post pictures there through Path and Instagram.  And I go back to check the comments and look at the engagement.  So Facebook becomes, in a way that Path and Instagram aren't,  a form of interaction around the stuff that I post.  They're in a better position to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I actually go to Facebook a lot less than I go to Google+.  Okay.  So it's just me, then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, it's just...  Larry Page gave an interview to Businessweek yesterday.  And they asked him.  And he said, he's very happy with the success of Android, Chrome, YouTube.  Long-term bets we've made.  They've been very successful.  All of those things have continued to grow like crazy.  We've made a more recent one, which is Google+, and that's a long-term bet as well.  We're not even a year into that, and it's going very well.  Much better than I expected.  There are various worries that people have, and we'll address those.  But we have a really good start.  I have over 2 million followers now on Google+, says Larry Page.  A number of other people are even ahead of me, and that's with real engagement.  So I'm very happy.  Last time was Larry posted.  He doesn't get engagement.  Yeah, come on, Larry.  That's a little disingenuous.  That's totally disingenuous.  He doesn't post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's no engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm very happy with the growth of the core Google+, network.  It's interesting that phrase, core Google+, network.  What does that mean?  That means when you go to Google+, right?  The site.  It doesn't mean tomorrow it's going to be bigger than any other social network out there.  That's not realistic, but it's growing faster, I think, than other services have,  and I'm very happy with that.  So he's making the distinction between the core, which is the page,  and all the other stuff, which is clearly working.  Every time I go somewhere, Latitude automatically checks me in  and feeds that to Google+, and as a result, to Google.  So all those other services, I think, are working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the plus one button is everywhere.  Plus one is everywhere, yeah.  When they launch third-party comments, just think about this.  How fast will you integrate Google comments, Google+, comments on your blog  if you know that those comments will affect your search rank?  Kind of the same thing as the authorship did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no one disagrees that they have the big stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do, absolutely.  It's a carrot, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a carrot shaped like a stick.  It's a stick-shaped carrot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have, that's what's going to, they're basically force-feeding people, Google+.  They're encouraging that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Leo.  Yeah, I don't know if it's force-feeding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I happily claim my authorship on my websites now.  I mean, I know it's going to show up in the, you know, N plus one things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so you're happy to be force-fed.  No, I mean, it's true.  You want to show up better on Google.  You want to show up better on Google.  I'm saying they're using their cloud in search to encourage you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the carrot.  They're force-feeding you carrots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's fine.  That's fine.  Yes, it's part of an SEO checklist, basically.  Like, if I want my site to do well, this is a bullet point now on the list of things that  you should do for your site to do well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they're saying, Gina, you know, you have a really nice blog there.  It'd be a shame if anything happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a stick-shaped carrot, I'm telling you.  If you've ever been hit by a carrot, it can hurt.  It's a really big carrot.  It's a really big carrot.  You know what's interesting, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He says just below what you were quoting, Leo, he says, our mission is organizing the  world's information and making it accessible.  And I think we probably missed more of the people part of that than we should have.  So an admission that, you know, they're basically playing catch-up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they also haven't gotten it either.  I think what we're hearing from especially Leo is, you know, you haven't engaged me.  You haven't engaged my heart.  No.  And I think that's where people love it or hate it.  But you've got to give Zuckerberg, you know, irony of Zuckerberg not being exactly what  it would seem, the Oprah of the world.  But he does know how to pluck emotional strings with technology in a way that Google is  incapable of doing.  And so timeline, you know, yeah, every time you change, it'll be controversial.  It's creepy.  It's this and that.  But, you know, now it's virtually everywhere.  I haven't gotten around to mine yet, but it's virtually everywhere.  And it does engage you more.  It is more human.  Facebook is a human company.  And that's been that's been Zuckerberg's argument.  And Google still is not a human company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get a little insight in this interview.  Badstone does the interview, by the way, did a good job at Businessweek.  But you get a little insight into why Google Plus is important to Larry with the little  Ben Smith analogy he gives.  He says, I have a friend named Ben Smith.  That's a very common name.  For the first time, we're able to say this Ben Smith because we attach a picture to it.  And content to it.  And now you see really what Google Plus is, I think, really all about to Google is that  kind of what do they call it on Wikipedia?  Disambiguation.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The irony is when I go into Facebook and I search for someone who has a name like Ben  Smith, there's no unless I've never found this, there's no way to search for other data  points to get the right Ben Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You might get a picture.  You'll get a picture of Ben Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if there's a hundred Ben Smiths, there's no help to me at all.  There's no way to do an advanced search.  Right?  Chat room going to tell me.  Oh, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true.  It's true.  It's a real flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's very hard to find.  It's interesting though.  Like that's a search engine problem.  And I guess it's a problem that people have.  I mean, going back to what Jeff said earlier about Zuckerberg, you know, Zuck really does  know like what people want.  I mean, if you go back to the early stuff he did in college, like what he did, like a  hot or not thing where you compare it like sorority and fraternity guys and girls to one  another.  And he had done he'd done like a P2P file sharing thing.  I mean, he has a good insight, even though he's a little bit maybe robotic, his personality  himself.  He has good insight into what people really want to do online.  And that shows that's part of why Facebook has been so popular.  Also, Facebook has been at this for how many years now?  Has it been 10?  Has it been 10 years?  I'm not even sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's not.  Six or seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  All right.  Well, still, that's a long time in Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I interviewed Zuck for Public Parts plug, you know, he really sees Facebook as a next  step on an evolutionary scale after the Googles.  And he says that, you know, where all the real value comes is in the stuff that's in  your head.  And the only way to get the stuff out of your head willingly is by creating things that  are going to make you want to do that, have a reason to do that, want to share.  And so he really believes that he's enabling that.  And so he sees the value of that humanity.  And Google to this day, you know, how do you add humanity to the culture?  And I love Google.  I'm amazed with Google.  I think it's a wonderful place.  Very smart.  Brilliant.  But it is gorgish.  Well, that's wrong.  It is.  What's the right word?  It's robotic.  It's a Python.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a Google engineer who left and talked about Google's rationale and particularly,  I think he was talking about plus and he said, you know, they don't care about you or as  a person and what you want to do.  They just want the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In some ways, that should reassure people.  I mean, if they cared about me, I'd be a little nervous.  They wanted to know about me specifically.  Wouldn't you?  Isn't that what people are really afraid of when they say we're being tracked?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to have insight in what people want in order to make products that are so compelling  you can't take your hands off of them, right?  They don't have the instinct.  They don't.  They don't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't have the instinct.  It's a bunch of geeks.  It's a bunch of geeks.  They don't know people work.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that why Kevin Rose is there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe.  Maybe.  I still can't figure that out.  No.  I mean, I understand why Kevin did it.  I don't understand why Google did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love this idea.  I can see a huge whiteboard with a gigantic order chart and there's one box that just  says insert human here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kevin, congratulations.  You're our token human.  Talk to the humans.  We need a Don Draper presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody wants to be loved.  To go back to a place where you're loved.  How do these products make you feel loved?  Let's not say that Google hasn't made...  Google's made some incredible products.  Maps and Gmail in particular.  Gmail never makes email awesome and Maps also still blows my mind to this day.  So we shouldn't say blanket carte blanche that they're unable to make really compelling  products.  It just lately, it hasn't felt that way.  And Google Plus...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the people who made those things are gone.  Chased out in effect.  The Rasmussens effectively chased out to Facebook.  Facebook.  And that's an interesting question.  Paul Buhay's Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Facebook is working on search.  You know, they've got a guy from Google.  They're going to pour a bunch of resources into search.  What does that do?  They're adding search to something that's already a social network.  Google's trying to add social to a giant search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but Matthew, I'm going to disagree with you there.  That I think that only in so far as I think it's dangerous to define the fight in that  way.  I think when you go to a world where the real aim is, the way I used to put it, is for Google  to...  For either of them to intuit your intent.  And it's my single signals schtick.  But it's saying that they want to know what you want before you want it so they can serve  you, hyper serve you.  And with both content and advertising and commerce.  And so I think it goes beyond...  Search and social are merely tools toward that higher end.  And I go back to the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I totally agree.  But if Facebook has, you know, make billions of social signals already, it's got years  of sort of building up that expertise.  I agree.  Now it has to apply that better to search.  Google's got expertise in search, but they're missing a lot of that social stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're right.  It's not just the signals about you as an individual, right?  Go back to Zuck's favorite phrase, social graph.  It's about the relationships.  The relationships are what are telling.  And that's what Facebook understands in a way that Google has not nearly enough.  You know, Android will give Google tons more signals about you as an individual.  Very valuable signals.  Very valuable when it comes to new kinds of advertising and product sales and all kinds  of stuff.  But it doesn't have really the graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm assuming Facebook, you know, they've got engineers that have been working on that  social graph and how it works and how it's all connected and how you can infer certain  things from it for years now.  I mean, Google's got, you know, they've got a lot of smart guys, but that's a totally  different game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Twitter, I think, has...  If you look at the Twitter hedge fund, it has the finger on the pulse of society more  broadly.  What are we talking about?  What's our mood?  What's going up?  What's going down?  Also who we're connected to and who's seen as authoritative over topics and things like  that.  Twitter has value here too.  And I wouldn't count them out of this race.  They're not going to win any part of this race, but they have their own unique value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The most interesting part in this interview in Business Week is when Brad Stone asks Larry  Page about the Steve Jobs biography.  He says, according to the biography, when you became CEO, you went to Jobs for advice.  I know you had your differences at the end around Android, but what did you take from  him as a mentor and friend?  And then Larry says something quite stunning.  I think the Android differences were actually for show.  And Brad says, wait, what?  The fury around Android was for show?  Larry Page says, I think that served their interests.  For a lot of companies, it's useful for them to feel like they have an obvious competitor  and to rally around that.  This is actually exactly the kind of thing Steve Jobs would do.  I personally believe it's better to shoot higher.  You don't want to be looking at your competitors.  You want to be looking at what's possible and how to make the world better.  So it's a little...  So he's saying, I don't care what Facebook's doing.  I don't care what Twitter's doing.  He's worried about what they're going to do.  He says, I personally believe it's better to shoot higher.  You don't want to be looking at your competitors.  You want to be looking at what's possible and how to make the world better.  And for that, we have glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thermonuclear show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's hysterical that he...  He says that I had a great conversation.  Steve was dying.  He called me and said, come over.  We talked.  He says it was for show.  And I could totally see Steve Jobs exactly thinking in the back of his head, yeah, how  am I going to get those people to get angry?  Ah, go get them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He did say that he'd use every last one of Apple's resources in order to fight that fight,  which does seem ridiculous when framed the way that Larry framed it.  I have to say that quote alone just ratcheted up my respect for him a few notches.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the right thing to say.  Let's hope it's not just lip service.  But that's the right thing to say.  It's a very, very sad thing to say.  And let's not forget.  When you think what products does Google...  Google search is unequivocally the best thing out there still, despite all of its flaws.  And I don't like search plus your world, et cetera, et cetera.  Chrome is a great browser.  Chrome is a great product.  It's a great product.  My Android phone is my favorite phone.  I love Android.  Now, there have been people who say Google's not got to get control of this brand.  It's going to add a control.  It's not even their brand anymore.  And that may be true.  Google take this play thing and make it be the play phone and the play tablet.  Who knows?  The Play Store.  But it's still a great success.  If you think about it, it's now half of the smartphones.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  Out of nowhere.  And your list ain't over yet.  Who does email better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Email, Gmail?  Well, I will argue with you on that.  I know you guys love Gmail.  I do not think Gmail, web mail is the best web mail experience out there.  The ads are annoying.  It's kind of quirky.  Maybe you guys have gotten used to the fact that it's not folders, it's lists.  Priority Inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's IMAP.  I mean, it offers IMAP access.  Well, I have an IMAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I love IMAP.  But I mean, there's lots of IMAP services out there.  Absolutely.  I would be dead without Priority Inbox.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google is providing this free service.  I mean, for someone who just doesn't want to set up email, I mean, you can use Gmail  with any client.  I'm not going to sell Gmail.  I do happen to love the web interface and labels and Priority Inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I'm alone on this one because a lot of people love Gmail.  And I think Docs is actually kind of brilliant.  It is.  And you haven't even listed Maps yet.  Well, and then building onto what Gina already said about Maps.  So no, they have plenty of products that are first in class, best in class, right?  There's no question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's not like they're struggling.  It's just that there's and I have to say, if you're going to grade Larry on his year,  this was the worst year for the creepy factor.  It wasn't under Eric Schmidt.  It was under Larry Page, right?  The iOS hack, search plus my world, the privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, one could argue, one could argue, I'm not trying to throw Eric under the bus  here either.  Those were cultural issues that were probably already brewing.  Maybe that that were not there.  But again, but they're too sad.  I think it's a PR problem.  And I know that's sound.  I'm going to get in trouble for saying that.  No, it's no or Jarvis is more than a PR problem.  But I really think so.  There's I put up a piece on the on the list from Giga Home, in fact, from your colleague  Derek, right?  Wrote a defense of Google on on the privacy things and just said, you know, come on, let's  get back down to Earth.  Let's get back down to reality.  It's not you know, these are this has been way overblown.  And I don't want to get into that discussion five times before.  I don't want to.  Yeah, I've been saying this for months.  My point here is that what got bungled in this was not the policy, but the execution  of the PR strategy, the public strategy about it.  They could turn around and really work this hard and said, you know, we think it's ridiculous  that you have 20 things.  We're going to put this out there.  We're going to have a time for comment.  We're going to do this.  They could have made this such a plus and it turned into negative because they don't  understand it's probably Google and people again.  Not that Facebook is any better at those kinds of things.  They are in some ways worse.  And I don't want to see the purification of the world and everything gets slicked up.  There's a different kind of relationship than messaging that relationship should be collaborative  and it should be open and beta.  And they forget their own lessons when it comes to this.  And so I think the problem in privacy was not creepiness.  The problem was oddly spanking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But to use but to use an alternate example, I would argue that Google search plus your  world was all PR like it's all spin.  I mean, they're they're even the name right.  No search plus because it's not your world.  It's search plus the parts of your world that intersect.  Search plus plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll buy that, Matthew, even though I will somewhat defend the thing.  I buy that because it it did not certainly live up to the company's hype.  Right.  But contrary, it disappointed.  Whereas they didn't try to get the expectations up for privacy and deal with that properly.  I mean, Gina, you were more obviously negative on that policy than I am.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the privacy policy consolidation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Substance versus presentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually thought the substance was excellent.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I kept trying to tell people even on the radio show, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a good thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree that it was a PR problem the way that they presented it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They may not have been in control of this.  I mean, it's kind of hard when the entire world and Fox News decide that you're evil  to say, no, no, no, we're not evil.  Really, we're not evil.  This is this is showing show me another company that has as many services as this.  It has a unified privacy policy that's in English that you can understand, gives you an opt out,  gives you a way to take your data out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When have you heard people say that in Google?  I put up a thing and today somebody in USA Today from Google actually kind of wrote that.  And that's the test of raising this simply.  It's in USA Today.  Right.  But that's what they need to talk to.  That's what they have out today.  It's on the list under Google.  Yeah, I see it.  And we protect your data.  Managing, you know, they should have been saying that months ago.  And now the problem is it's probably too late to make this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A search for Google Privacy Tools points you to a dozen ways to control your information.  Yeah, this is good.  This is what should have been written.  This is from Alma Whitten, Google's director of privacy for product and engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go to the link below that, it's Derek Harris's piece in Giga Home.  Yes, yes, yes.  Which is very good.  Yeah.  And just says, let's let's cut cut the crap here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I've been saying I hate to say it, but I've been saying this long and I've kind of  get I kind of gave up because people it's this is where it's a problem.  I said it and people get upset at me.  Yeah, you're a Google fanboy.  How dare you, you know, defend them.  Everybody knows Google's evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So go back to that org chart, not that Google probably has any.  They probably have it in 3D and moving globes.  It's a pipe script.  Imagine there's a 2D org chart, right?  Where do they need help?  They need help in.  Get the word out.  It's true public relations, relations with the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that's why you see Larry Page, who doesn't give interviews, finally  giving an interview at Businessweek.  Way overdue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's part of the responsibility he should have.  He is he has to be the human face of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now there's a great interview also in Businessweek.  Actually, it's from the 92nd Street Y where Marissa Meyer, where some great little juicy  tidbits, nothing earth shattering.  But I'm going to share five things you didn't know about Google from that interview in  just a second.  We're talking about Google, the internet, the internet, the actually we're talking  about Google, the universe and everything.  On this episode of this week in Google with Gina Tripani, Matthew Ingram from Giga  Ohm and Jeff Jarvis more in a bit.  But first let's talk about Ford and SYNC.  You know, I love SYNC.  I have a Mustang 2010 Mustang, which I love anyway.  Who wouldn't love it?  You turn it on, it goes.  But it's kind of cool to have a muscle car that looks like it came straight out of, you  know, Bullitt 1965.  I feel like I'm Steve McQueen driving this thing.  And it's got Ford SYNC.  It's got like the latest 21st century stuff in it.  So here's the deal.  Ford did a lot of studies, a lot of research, distracted driving.  Big issue, right?  But people want to be connected.  So on the one hand, there's consumers saying, no, no, we want to be connected to the  world. And then there's all this research and government saying, yeah, but distracted  driving is very, very, very dangerous.  So Ford did the research and this is what they found.  As long as your eyes are on the road and your hands are on the wheel, you have sufficient  cognitive resources to listen, to talk.  But you but the key is nothing can pull your attention over down to the console.  You can't be fiddling with knobs.  Hands on the wheel, eyes on the road.  That's why they came up with SYNC, which means you tell your car everything.  You talk to it and and it's safer because your hands don't leave the wheel.  You don't have to look down at a screen.  Everything is spoken to you.  You can even say, what's my horoscope?  And the SYNC will tell you.  And now they've added this, which I love, it's App Link.  So what they told me and here it is, ford.com technology.  You can look at what they told me is, well, we understand that we're never going to  iterate our technology as fast as app developers are iterating their technology on the  Android and the iPhone.  So what we're going to do is give developers a mobile application developer network.  We'll work with them to get their apps on Ford SYNC.  We'll give you a full API.  And that's what App Link is.  It's an API platform that allows Ford and app developers to bring in vehicle voice  control at Ford SYNC to apps on your phone.  You don't have to update the software and the vehicle.  You just connect to the phone.  Now it started with Pandora and you had all the Pandora controls in voice,  thumbs up, thumbs down, next station, play my Rolling Stone station, that kind of  thing. Then there was OpenBeak.  You could read tweets.  There was Slacker Radio for podcasts, Stitcher for podcasts.  Now they've got iHeartRadio and it supports their thumb play service.  So you're listening.  You say, I want to hear KFI.  Your saved stations, you just pull them up by name.  We could skip to the next song when you're listening to their radio, their music,  you know, their Pandora thing.  You can give a song a thumbs up.  NPR has breaking news now.  You say, I want to hear all things considered.  I want to hear this American life.  Boom, boom.  Actually, I don't know if this American life's on him because that's another  public radio system.  They've got to get this together.  And they have this destinations thing, SYNC Destinations, which is an app on your  phone. So you could take the phone's navigation and bring it to the car.  I mean, this is it's simple.  It's obvious once I say it.  Make an API so the car's computer can talk to the phone apps and then your hands  stay on the wheel, your eyes on the road and yet you have the world at your  fingertips and it's updated.  This is so slick.  Try it. Go to a Ford dealer, drive one today.  There's almost mine, unfortunately, does not have AppLink, but all the new Fords  do. Tell the Ford dealer you want to take a look at AppLink.  They'll give you a demo or visit ford.com slash technology.  They've got the videos on there and more pretty cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ford wasn't there a car once that that like the Google Glasses projected info on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there still are there a number of cars.  Audi does that. I think Mercedes has a heads up display.  Yeah, Audi has something that is really wild.  They have night vision and they'll project pedestrians.  I think I'm told this that project pedestrians on the screen they had at CES.  They were there and they had they had like a simulator with with hydraulics.  So you'd like think you're in the car and you'd be driving around and they showed if  you drift out of the lane. It's kind of the car stuff is very interesting.  But I have to say, not all these manufacturers have the same focus on distracted driving.  I was stunned because Mercedes said, well, we're putting Facebook and Mercedes.  All you have to do is turn a knob and pick the message you want to send your status  message and push the button. Oh, that's a good idea.  Is it that important?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it would make an episode of Glee.  She's a cliffhanger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A car crash cliffhanger, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so it really is important.  And that's where I think I think Alan Mulally and his team are really doing a lot.  And this is not the Ford ad anymore.  But I think they're really thinking responsibility.  There's a huge responsibility.  And, you know, one of the things they're terrified about,  they don't want the government to suddenly say, oh, by the way,  you can't talk on the phone anymore in your car.  I mean, there is that risk that if they do not take it, this is always true.  If they don't take it in hand and really be responsive,  that they'll be forced to.  And then maybe in a way that's not that consumers don't like and the companies  don't like. So the new proposed standards.  Yes, the NTSP does not want you talking on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So there's there was new standards that cut down all kinds of things.  Yeah. Oh, damn, I can't find it right now.  But but a whole new set of standards that would that would cut down  what you're allowed to do in the car.  What car manufacturers can give you.  It's scary because just as they get more sophisticated, they'll get dumbed down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And it's interesting, you know, we were looking at the Google glasses  and how to some extent a heads up display makes a lot of sense,  especially if you're trying to follow directions or you're trying to,  you know, get information without looking down.  So you walk into things that that's even more the case when you're driving.  The more information you can get that's overlaid on the road  while you're driving, the less you have to look away.  Yeah. Heads up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I predict that I predict within two years it will be illegal  to wear your Google. Oh, yeah. Nobody's going to. Yeah.  Nobody's going to wear Google glasses.  But then and then within five years, there'll be calls to outlaw while walking.  Then the absurdity of that will be made clear to the to the staff that proposes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It will create a little bit of an isolating experience, though,  you know, like when headphones, you know, we go on any college campus campus,  everyone's walking across campus with headphones in and people don't greet  one another and talk as much.  If everyone's kind of sucked into their heads up display, it also, you know,  creates this other layer of isolating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm telling you, there is a risk.  But you know, this is the problem is that we as geeks, we want this.  We don't want to see people. Right.  I want to see virtual work.  We're conforming the world to our own introverted notions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the show is not called This Week in People.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh huh. Get the people out of here.  So five things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead. Imagine if you had Sonar.me or highlight  or something like that integrated into your glasses.  They could tell you when someone was nearby that you might want to talk to.  Do not or Gina's girls around me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Girls around me.  What did you think about that?  Huh? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Is that creepy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, you first. You tweeted brilliantly on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I mean, the whole point of Foursquare and location service  is that you can find other people.  I accept that. But Girls Around Me was an iPhone app,  which I don't think exists anymore, or at least Foursquare pulled it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple killed it. Foursquare pulled the API and then Apple killed the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then Apple killed the app.  Girls Around Me would launch and you'd see this lovely radar screen  with the silhouette of naked women kind of dancing on the radar  and would let you in, which would show you people who registered  on Facebook as female and their photos and all their history.  So it was a way to find women, girls, quote unquote, around you.  And I had a serious problem not with the premise of the app,  which is finding people near you.  That's the premise of Foursquare. And I use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or look at highlight, which does exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or highlight. Same thing.  But it was the design. It was a weapon.  It was clearly weaponized design.  I mean, it's like stalkers here, you know, stalkers come download this app here.  So that was the problem that I had, because a lot of people said, hey,  you know, this is the whole point about Foursquare is to find people nearby.  I don't think there's a problem with that.  It was the fact that this app was designed shamelessly and, you know,  clearly designed for people who were, you know, their chicks checking in near you.  I mean, this was like the actual ad copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that was that was really what it was, is that they were tone deaf designers.  You know, I mean, that look, Mark Zucker.  Yeah, I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's this is something that Zuck may have built when he was in college.  Let me tell you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg made Facebook to get laid and people use Facebook.  That's the primary reason people use Facebook is they want to meet people of the other,  you know, that they're interested.  I won't say opposite sex of the people that they're interested in.  That's the primary purpose of it still.  But Zuck had the good sense to obfuscate that, to make it right, to make it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it is a problem is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It only takes one bozo to ruin it, right?  This is a classic case.  The piece that I put on this from O'Reilly by Mike, if I get this right,  the Kennedy's new piece, a good a good and reasoned piece about it saying,  yeah, you might want to find car repair people around you or geeks around you  or hackers around you or other people around you.  The functionality works.  The problem is one person does this and then someone's going to come along  and try to outlaw every possible use of the same technology,  because one person do something bad.  And that's the world that we're in right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just did a search for the app in one of the latest news.  If you just read the headline right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Our apps, not for stalking women, it's for avoiding the ugly ones.  See, it's a tone deaf.  That was exactly it.  It was tone deaf. They didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They didn't. I mean, it was beyond tone deaf.  It was full on misogynist.  I mean, the title girls.  I mean, they were talking about women because an app that actually showed you  girls like girls like and I define a girl as someone who hasn't menstruated yet.  That would be illegal. OK, so the whole thing.  Sorry, I didn't mean to go into a girls around me rant.  Wow. The whole thing was just these guys are idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there but there's that larger point, which is it's not doing something  that these apps weren't intended to do.  No. Right. But it just was blatant about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was blatant about it.  It was bad intentioned. It was this way.  I would disagree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The intention is always the same intention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's been out for like almost a year.  I mean, it has been around for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It had been around for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you remember Gawker Stalker?  Gina, were you were you at Gawker with Gawker Stalker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Gina, do you have a problem with Grindr?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's exactly the same purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Grindr, you are signing in for that purpose.  You are using Grindr only for that purpose.  You're right. OK, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're opting into being grinded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're telling your buddies where you are and this place is using it for a purpose.  And that's the argument in the O'Reilly piece.  Helen Nissenbaum, who's being very influential right now in privacy, talks about context.  And it's a good concept, but I find it almost impossible to imagine an execution in all these cases.  So but the argument in this case was if you're using Grindr, the context is very clear.  You are getting laid because that's why you signed in to do it.  Right.  Whereas you're using you're giving Facebook data to tell your buddies and your family where you are.  And then it's being used in this terrible way and it violates the context.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So their real mistake was just not making a heterosexual Grindr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a student who...  There's a couple out there already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, really? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, I had a student who taught me about Grindr, who found his straight friends were amazed at this.  And so his business for my class is too bad he didn't do it, was going to do that way early on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Straight Grindr. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's one called Tingle, I think it is.  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give me a Tingle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, any dating site, right, where you say, you know, come by.  I mean, Grindr works particularly well.  The target the target demo is is gay men, right?  There. Yes, right.  Right. So, I mean, that's that's a really good demographic.  We're opting into, you know, it's pretty safe.  You know, I won't go into the queer politics here or whatever.  Those guys are pigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like to hook up.  No, no, stop, stop, stop, stop.  Stop.  I think we've made the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really want to go ahead, Matt.  Go ahead. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just one thing. I thought, Jeff, you know, Helen Nissenbaum makes a really good point about context.  How we do it is a lot more complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think when I wrote a public parts plug, I struggled with that because a lot of people admire Helen.  I admire her, too. She's very smart. She's in NYU.  I read her book and every argument makes sense.  But then I cannot imagine the execution of it.  I mean, you can. But that's what actually taught me.  So I turned it around using Dana Boyd, who this is the point that Tim O'Reilly makes in the piece on O'Reilly,  is that it's about the use, not the gathering of the data.  It's about the behavior, not the technology.  And so the way I learned from it was to turn around and say that you can't probably make a law or regulations that can anticipate context.  So they can't anticipate everything.  But you can have an ethical standard that says to these guys, come on, you know, this is evil.  This is wrong. It's misusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that's exactly what happened.  Exactly. They got smacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it worked in this case. It didn't work for regulation.  It didn't work for legislation. Right.  It worked for norms.  Morris, yes.  You just saw a new line and you're a mile over, Bozo.  Get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the chat room suggesting and I think this is going to be my next step, bacon around me.  Now that I'd spend money for.  I just want to go home now.  Let's all just go home and take a shower.  All right. Time to eat.  It's time to eat bacon.  Five things you didn't know about Google and then and then we'll get your picks and tips and so forth.  Marissa Meyer, I wish I'd seen this.  Ninety Second Street Y is great where people really go and they talk.  And she spent 90 minutes talking with Josh Tyrangiel of Business Week.  Tyrangiel.  Goose.  Terengal. I don't know.  He and Mike Luchaitis can just get together and figure out how to say their names.  Google Basics White Homepage wasn't an ode to minimalism.  It was pure necessity, said Marissa Meyer.  We don't have a webmaster and I don't do HTML.  Sergey Brin is famous for saying it's simple because I can't do anything fancier.  Marissa Meyer almost killed the idea of targeting ads against users email  because she thought it was creepy.  A colleague. Yeah, she knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was embarrassed that she even thought that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She was right.  A colleague working on an all nighter ignored her.  And of course, created AdSense.  Whoops. Google has calculated that an ad on its homepage would cost at least ten million dollars.  But it's not for sale.  This is one that just shocked me.  Most Google pages sport a small copyright notice at the bottom.  Why?  Not because it's necessary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it turned out when they tested it that users would just stare at the homepage,  they waiting for the rest of it to load.  And we're so conditioned that once the copyright loads, oh, it's all done.  So they put a copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's done.  You can now click.  And that came from user testing.  That came from showing the pages again and again and again to people.  Just love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Time, my friends.  There's lots more Facebook threatening to sue a commenter on TechCrunch.  But let's move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I mentioned just one thing.  There's a really good piece in, believe it or not, the current issue of Vanity Fair about the war.  We talk about it next week.  I love Vanity Fair. What do you mean believe it or not?  Well, it's not exactly doing, you know, compete with Wired.  It's a good piece.  That's all I mean.  It's a very good piece that goes on about the war over the net that's coming, the dangers to the net.  Cool.  Expresses it very well, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it a Tim Wu kind of a thing or?  No, it's more about the UN.  UN?  White boat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They want to take control over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, just efforts to control the net.  And so I just recommend it for reading and maybe it's for discussion next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also we should mention this, that Starbucks right now you get a Google offer deal, $5 for $10 at Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but $3 goes to creating jobs, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was just thinking about the money.  Okay.  So it's good for job stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good for the economy.  Go to Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Starbucks gift cards.  We use participants.  You know, I have a Starbucks card.  I wonder if I could like just add more, use this to add more dollars to it.  Yeah, I guess so, probably.  You're probably going to get a gift card.  Yeah.  $5 for $10 gift card.  And $3 goes to jobs.  Nothing wrong with jobs.  Steve.  Not Steve.  Some other jobs.  Jobs for USA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jobs in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jobs in the US.  Leo, have you been talking on Twitter, I missed this week's episode about the jobs bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, we didn't and we should.  It's very close to passing.  It's passed both houses of the Congress and now it just awaits President Obama's signature,  right?  It's not in tomorrow, I think.  And jobs does not stand for jobs, actually, oddly enough.  What does it stand for?  Let me, I'll look it up.  I hate these acronyms.  They're so funny.  Jumpstart, our business startups act.  Now here's the thing.  It's overturning what I thought were quite reasonable restrictions that were designed  to keep suckers from being taken by con men, getting them to invest in stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's what Andrew Ross Sorkin tried to say in the Times and I think he's right  to an extent that there are controls that are necessary.  This was a safety net.  Yeah, but there's two things.  If you use Groupon as an example, they wouldn't even be covered.  Right.  And the budget said, you know, it's not the SEC's job.  I mean, listen, any idiot could know that Groupon was a bad investment.  And unfortunately, there were a lot of people who were idiots and invested in it.  I was screaming it.  Others were screaming it.  It was a bad investment.  And you can't stop people from investing in bad companies.  Now the separate issue is, you know, if you have a fraudulent company, if you're in penny  stock land and it's just plain old crap and that comes broadly, that's an issue.  We have a big problem with capital in the country and startups to be able to enable  one early liquidity and two to enable a Kickstarter of equity, which is what the low end of this  bill does.  I didn't mean to get into a whole discussion, but I think it's an important thing for where  we go in the entrepreneurial investment in the country.  And it's going to be important to what we cover on Twig and such.  But we're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm glad you brought it up because in fact we hadn't really had this conversation.  This would be the best place to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it actually sounds to me as though there's... it's sort of two bills in one in a way, or  there's a good part and a bad part.  And the good part, or what most people agree is the good part, is that it encourages crowd  funding, it allows you to raise smaller amounts of money from more people and that's all good.  And then there's another part of the bill that kind of scales back some of the regulatory  stuff that companies would have to face, you know, filings and proving that they're not  scams.  And so a lot of people like the one part, but not the other part, but they're married  together in one bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, disclosure rules like Sarbanes-Oxley are loosened a little bit for small companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For certain companies, companies that are a billion.  And Groupon is over so it actually wouldn't be part of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also is kind of for Facebook because Facebook, remember, had to... once it had, I think it  was 200, 500 investors, it had to file for public.  Now it can go, what is it, a thousand?  And Steve Case, who was the guy who put this through really, the former founder of AOL,  made the point that, look, you can be an idiot and go to a casino and lose unlimited amounts  of money.  We don't protect people from casinos.  Why are we protecting people from investing in startups?  And things like Kickstarter, look, I got taken on Kickstarter, I keep getting taken on Kickstarter,  but you know, it's a small amount of money.  And it's huge for jumpstarting the economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it is restricted to $10,000 or no more than 10%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your liability is limited.  In the UK, this is encouraged, there's even tax breaks around this kind of crowdsourced  investment.  A company called Escape the City, Mikey Howe is one of the founders and he was nice enough  to send an email saying they were probably inspired by what would Google do, plug.  But they just put it out there because they couldn't in the UK and they, I just got an  update from him today and he said the 2200 members have pledged and they won't actually  raise all this, but they've pledged $15 million in investment in the company.  And so when it comes time to actually get the investment, you know, that's really safe.  So Gina, what I want to ask you is you're now, God bless you, a capitalist and part  of a for-profit venture.  Yes.  Would you see, how would you look at investment from crowdsourcing and members and a whole  bunch of small people like, you know, kind of Obama fundraising versus angels, friends  and family and venture funds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, certainly.  It would certainly be a possibility for us.  I think the Kickstarter model is amazing.  I also have had projects not send me anything in the end, but also seen some great projects  come through and it's definitely something that we would, you know, that we would consider.  I don't want to speak for Anil, but you know, we're trying to raise funding kind of in a  smart way, get good money, like the night application, for example.  That's something I would love, you know, it would be, could be beneficial to us and I  think in a lot of different startups.  So, I love that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it seems funny to me that you can raise money for a new iPod dock or iPad stand or  someone can raise two million dollars for back issues of comic books or something, but  you can't use the same model for a startup technology company.  Just doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So our consensus is this is a good thing.  Be careful.  But it's basically a good idea.  Be careful out there.  Good, because it's going to be law tomorrow.  By the way, today's the day and I don't know if we've heard yet, the Yahoo's laying off  a million people.  Two thousand.  Two thousand.  Two thousand.  The letter is out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just a start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just a start.  Plenty more where they came from.  Plenty more there.  And there's a really great stupid game on the front page of the New York Times.  I can't stop playing it.  It doesn't do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a story about stupid games, but I couldn't read the story.  I never got to the story.  It's too much fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't read.  Is this the first time there's been a game on the New York Times web page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember way back when the original Pong ad on Wired?  Whoa!  As an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can blow up ads.  Oh, this is great.  I wish the text actually disappeared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The best joke I saw on Twitter was, can you use it to blow through the paywall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you guys seen NYT on it?  This Twitter account, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's NYT on it?  They put all these fake trend stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The tweet on this story was, guys, Angry Birds is very addictive and the Times is on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So everything has to end with the Times is on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, everything where they find a fake trend story.  They write a trend a year later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guys, apparently clothing really does make the man and the New York Times is on it.  Oh, and these are actual stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go to the one about the iPhone cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People like to put colorful iPhone cases on their iPhones and the New York Times is on  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, this is so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Guys, New York City apartments don't always have dishwashers and the Times is on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God, this is hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very funny.  Recommend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guys, sports fans cheer for the home team and mock the visitors.  The Times is on it.  Guys, puppies are now an acceptable part of any wedding party and the Times is on it.  Wow, this is very funny.  They have so much to choose from.  It's kind of natural.  Right, it is.  Follow.  Follow.  The problem is I follow so many great things like that that my Twitter feed is useless.  But fun.  Less.  All right, so I think we've now covered everything that I...  I can't get out of this stupid game, unfortunately.  I can't close this window.  All right, there we go.  Stupid game done.  Google surveys.  Do we want to talk about the consumer surveys?  It's pretty cool.  Yeah, it's neat.  I should have made this my tool.  It's an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think the data coming through that is going to be that useful, but maybe that's  just me.  I mean, I think...  I just was in an airport and I filled out a survey so I could get free Wi-Fi.  I just clicked things randomly until it said, okay, you can have Wi-Fi now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to make a survey.  Is the New York Times on it?  Anyway, so you can see this is just Google, Google surveys if that's not a recursive search  that will get you in a loop.  And there you go.  Oh, and there's a visualization.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you're funny.  Onehourpersecond.com, a visualization of how many videos are being uploaded to YouTube  every second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just got me hungry talking about bacon, so I'm ready for lunch.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, just go to onehourpersecond.com.  It's kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if you click there, it kind of translates what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's visualize that.  Again, somebody's 20% time going to a complete waste of time.  Now we're going to get bumped off YouTube.  No, I didn't play it.  I didn't play it.  I didn't do it.  I didn't do it.  All right, Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So people who watch Twitter probably heard about this this weekend, but I just absolutely  couldn't resist because it was so cool.  It was an April Fool's gag.  It's 8-bit Google Maps, which is still up.  You can still get to it.  I think it's maps.google.com and you have to give it a parameter like UTM campaign 8-bit,  but it's really neat.  You can zoom and pan around the world.  It's all 8-bit and there's a ton of Easter eggs in there.  There's a UFO abducting a cow in Area 51.  There's the Loch Ness Monster.  There's Bigfoot.  And I included a link to some of the Easter eggs throughout.  If you didn't see it this weekend, if it was a Sunday and you're spending it with your  family instead of looking at all the online April Fool's gags, this one should not be  missed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was pretty amazing that they did this.  I mean, Street View and 8-bit, I mean, that's awesome.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Very cool.  Jeff, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, just relevant to what we talked about earlier with the glasses, we all want hint.  Google Maps now covers 75% of the global population, which, you know, again, it gives context as  to why are they doing some of this stuff?  Why is maps so important to them besides the fact that it's a good service?  If you want to be able to walk people around, you know, by the nose, then having a good  maps around the world is important and it has value.  If you want to have self-driving cars, having great maps is important.  So maps just keeps growing and growing and growing.  That's amazing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They need to attach cameras to postal trucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as we have them.  There you go.  We've been looking for something like that.  Sorry, Matthew.  Self-driving postal trucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was just going to say, I noticed over the last little while, a bunch of startups not  using Google Maps anymore.  Yes.  Open Street Map or stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even Apple using OSM data.  I like OSM.  Open Street Maps.  This was going to be, is that your number?  Are you done?  I'm done.  Are we done with the number?  This was my tool is something that no one can use.  But it's something we've been waiting for.  We had heard that Hearst, Time and Conde Nast would do some sort of Netflix for magazines.  It's now out, but you have to have a honeycomb or better tablet.  So all 12 of you watching who have that can down.  I've actually already paid for this.  It's 15 bucks a month.  But you get a bunch of titles.  Essence, Fitness, Esquire, Entertainment, Glamour, InStyle, Money.  And so you can read it in New Yorker.  You can read it at Vanity Fair, Time.  So you can read any of these, right?  Unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to hear back from you in two months how many articles you actually read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  $15 a month.  Most of these magazines are $10 or $15 a year.  So that's you could get a you know, 10 magazines.  So pick the 10 you like.  How often do you read magazines now?  No, I don't read magazines.  I get the New Yorker on my iPad and I don't read it.  Never.  Occasionally, there'll be something good.  This is their this is their last attempt, right?  At saving magazines.  They have unlimited basic.  Get unlimited access to dozens of the top magazines for just $9.99 a month.  So I guess I got the weekly plan, but it's free for the first month.  So you're right.  I'll keep it for a month and let's report back and I'll report back on whether I do  this.  And I only have it's only for tablets with a resolution of 1024 by 600.  Not greater than not less than exactly.  And that's the New Yorker, by the way, is the only one.  That's bizarre.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's bizarre.  So I don't know what they're talking about.  It's basically broken.  I'm sure Jeff would have something pithy to say about the end of print.  Hmm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's all there is to say about print.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matthew.  Great to have you.  Matthew Ingram, editor at GigaOM.com.  Great to have you.  Please.  Is he frozen?  Come back.  He's got boxing gloves.  I'll call him the pugnacious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sphinx like.  Sphinx like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's contemplative.  He's meditating.  That's very Canadian of him.  That's what they call it.  GigaOM.  That's right.  Hiptotonic.  Jeff Jarvis.  He is a journalism professor at the City University of New York.  Those lucky kids also the blogger at BuzzMachine.com and the author of a book you must read called  Public Parts if you want to understand what's happening.  Thank you very much.  Into future.
