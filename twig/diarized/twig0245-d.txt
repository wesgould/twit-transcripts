And speaking of Bobverse, to my left, Gina Turbani of SmarterWear.org. That's her blog. And of course, ThinkUp.com.  Now public. That analysis program that kind of checks in on your Twitter and Facebook feeds. Hi, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hi. We're actually at the top of product hunt today. Or we were for a little bit. Then we got knocked down by some men's fashion thing.  You know, I don't know. Maybe. It's actually a really cool app. I hadn't heard of it before today, but it actually started a pretty cool conversation.  It's a really well designed app. It's kind of like Reddit or Dig for new products.  And do you see some traffic as a result? Yeah, we did. We did. We definitely drove a few signups, which was exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Daily leaderboard of the best new products. And you can actually get this in your mail. This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty neat. It seems very skewed toward the web and says some good stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm voting up. Think out. Oh, I got to sign in first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We sign in with Twitter, but it doesn't. I don't believe it posts. It can't post tweets for you. It's read only. So I always appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's good. I'm this humble piece of Internet. This is cool. I really like this. All right.  So Jeff Jarvis is also here from the City University of New York. CUNY as it is known. Hello. Hello.  Wow. From home. He is in his home today. And we are talking about the goog.  Who wasn't here last week? You weren't here last week, Jeff. I wasn't. I was the bad boy. Welcome back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then days before that, I was on Twitter, which I always love and is wonderful. Love that.  But boy, did I get junk from your listeners. You got hate mail for what? Oh, both sides. Both sides.  Positive and negative. No, no, no. A lot of negative, but also some positive.  One because of if you dare, if you dare breathe the word Apple without without angelic tones behind you.  And then the whole San Francisco bus thing.  So on the one hand, some said that I was a capitalist pig.  Awful. Other people said that, you know, that I was a commie or something like that. I didn't understand.  I'm nasty. I'm good for you for good sense. Oh, geez. People were me long emails.  Like I have time for more emails on this stuff.  When I when I made a crack about about the Supreme Court decision, mean you could, you know, get more damn Republicans.  Somebody wrote me this long email. I was joking. Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't don't bring it all up again. We'll just get more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, that doesn't happen on Twig. It happens on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a bunch of lefties. Listen to this show. I don't know. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're all in the world. You know, because everybody knows you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we know, you know, we know what's count everything I say.  No, but we just know you. So we don't.  You know, but if it's you're a stranger, then people don't understand.  They get angry, but no reason to get angry at Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a sweet. Oh, I know why you why you avoid politics on Twitter.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But let's as long as we're talking about it. Good article.  I thought very good article on TechCrunch.  How burying owls lead to vomiting anarchists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Incredibly long people, unbelievably long.  But but really good understanding of the whole circumstances of development  and and home prices and the economy of San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really good work. Kim May Cutler wrote it.  And I'm you know, the real the the TLDR summary of it actually has nothing to do  with burrowing owls. That's really the reason that Silicon Valley can't expand  to accommodate all the new workers that are being brought in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a it's a gag. It's why it's why Google's not allowed to build  apartments next to next to the Googleplex. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the real issue is that, as she writes, 80 percent of the city of San  Francisco isn't oriented to add housing stock.  It's a NIMBY problem. It's not a tech problem.  In fact, the tech industry is only eight percent of San Francisco's workforce.  So this whole anger at Google, while I understand it, isn't is not really is  misplaced. What is NIMBY? Not in my backyard.  And so she uses an example, Telegraph Hill Dwellers Association,  which is a neighborhood group.  I used to live on Telegraph Hill. It prevents any development there  because the bulk of the homeowners, which only represent, by the way,  thirty five percent of San Francisco's.  So so let's take the first 35 percent of San Francisco residents.  They own their home. They they are benefiting greatly from this  shortage of housing. Their housing is worth a hell of a lot more than it  should be millions because of the scarcity of housing.  So they don't want development. Rent controlled tenants,  which accommodate, which account for another large percentage of this,  are paying rent so far below market rate that nothing that could be done  with construction could possibly help them.  So so she says about 80 percent of the city just says we don't need more  housing stock. Text only eight percent.  They're not causing the problem.  Then there's the issue, of course, of Silicon Valley.  Lots of people, lots of jobs created there, not lots of housing there  for a number of reasons.  So and who necessarily wants to be forced to live there, by the way?  Nobody wants to live in Mountain View. That's why Google has buses.  Yeah, but they can't anyway.  There's not enough housing by even close.  No, nowhere near.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's start with the basic fact of San Francisco that some people don't  grok unless you live there.  It's seven miles by seven miles. It is it is bounded in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can't grow because it's surrounded by water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can't grow. It's not even is it's water around three sides.  On the fourth side, it's Daly City and South San Francisco,  which is no space for expansion.  There's a big leap from there to livable places south.  Nothing livable, you know, San Francisco level livable.  Well, you know why I'm in Petaluma.  You know why we're in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We lived in San Francisco when Abby was born 20 years ago.  We wanted to buy a house. We couldn't come 20 years ago.  Couldn't come close to affording a house.  We started driving north until we could went right through Marin,  which was equally expensive and got to Petaluma where housing prices were  relatively low.  Well, when I left in 1981, my children, I couldn't nearly afford it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the coworker and I were going to buy a two flat in the neighborhood  and couldn't afford it.  I worked for the San Francisco Examiner.  I was a columnist on the San Francisco Examiner.  I couldn't afford to live there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody. I'm sure nobody watching this show cares.  I guess it was a good article and I think it really pointed out that these  are complex issues that are not easily explained on a protest placard.  It's complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And certainly not worth assaulting a reporter for his Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my, my, my. Yeah.  Well, okay. Let's talk about that.  I knew you'd want to talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I also heard you had your continuing...  I hate class.  ...idiotic opinion based on the movie theater conversation continued into this topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it's okay to beat up somebody because he's wearing Google Glass.  Guy was walking through the Mission, right?  He was on his way to 16th Street BART station.  Everybody knows that area.  It's a mixed neighborhood.  There's families there.  I like it. It's one of my favorite neighborhoods in San Francisco.  But he was wearing glass.  He actually was coming from covering the protests against tech workers.  Somebody ran up to him, took his glass, actually ran away with it at first.  So it's not clear if he was stealing the glass or what.  But then...  I think there were shouts of, Glass, Glass!  Yeah, but then he gave chase and the glass was thrown to the ground and stomped upon.  And that's all there is to say about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have decided when I come to San Francisco next, I'm going to wear this and protest.  Kyle Russell was the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're asking for trouble, my friend.  And I don't have any problem with you wearing glass, obviously.  But I think you're asking for trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the thing that also upset me about the reporter, I think, bent over far too far backwards to say,  Oh, well, I understand. It was just too gushy liberal for a Henry Blodgett capitalist site, for God sakes.  It was on Business Insider, yeah.  Yeah, he had every right to be pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kyle Russell, I was assaulted for wearing Google Glass in the wrong part of San Francisco.  They would just finished covering a protest, which I thought was kind of interesting.  So he's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is obviously never okay.  But I always...  I don't know.  It makes me wonder, even if the housing crisis isn't the fault of technology,  it's interesting to me that technologists or employees of these big companies are so easily hated.  You know what I mean?  Like, what do they represent beyond these problems?  Capitalism?  Yeah, well, capitalism, but I mean, privilege, elitism, I don't know.  It's a new 1%.  Fracturing a culture, the new 1%.  Yeah, I mean, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It comes down to a really severe problem in this country, which is income inequality.  And whenever that happens, as it did in 18th century France, heads sometimes roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, God, we're going to start beheading technologists now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you understand why the French peasantry finally revolted.  All you have to do is go see Versailles and understand why they revolted against French royalty and chopped their heads off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's a hot, though probably not terribly readable book from a French economist called Capital,  which is all arguing, Thomas Piketty, I think his name is.  I just saw a great review of it in the FT that says that when capital and income reach this level,  it doesn't stop until that happens.  Right. And then what happens?  And then you have upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I understand why people are upset.  I think in this country, maybe not uniquely, but it seems uniquely,  and our international viewers will tell me if I'm wrong, there is this notion that anybody can succeed.  If you have brains, if you have persistence and ambition, that this is a land of opportunity.  And as long as that seems to be true, I think people will put up with a very wealthy one percent.  But as soon as it feels like you don't have a shot at it, like you couldn't be in that one percent in your lifetime,  then I can understand why people would be upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think it's also the top one percent got, I think, 60 percent of the wealth growth in the last decade or two decades.  That's where the inequality really hits.  So yeah, you got a shot, but you don't have that shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a growing sense that this is not a democracy.  You saw this study from Princeton and Northwestern saying that the U.S. government does not represent  the interests of the majority of the citizens, as our mythology tells us,  but instead is ruled by those of the rich and powerful.  Using extensive policy data collected from 1981 to 2002, sifting through 1800 U.S. policies enacted in that period  and comparing them to the preferences of average Americans at the 50th percentile of income  and affluent Americans at the 90th percentile and large special interest groups,  researchers concluded that, shock, the United States is dominated by its economic elite.  That's in 1981 through 2002.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The most visible of that elite now is technology, especially there.  There's plenty of other areas where there's a lot more money, but the huge paydays are happening in technology.  And so there's a resentment of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And glass is a manifestation.  I've had my cell phone stolen on the subway before because I stood close to someone.  It was sticking out of my bag and that wasn't an attack on me as a person.  That was just a regular, I got my phone stolen.  But the glass represents a certain kind of not only disposable income, but a connection to Google.  Because up until recently, up until yesterday, you kind of had to know somebody or had to be handpicked in order to test it.  And it's very personal.  So it's on your face.  So getting it ripped off your face feels like a much more personal attack than having your cell phone pulled out of your bag.  Glass takes it to a whole other level.  Also, glass is, you know, it's an accessory, let's say.  It's a $1,500 accessory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although if you wore a $2,000 watch down the street, I don't think that that...  Plenty of those in New York.  Yeah.  I mean, that's talking about conspicuous consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, one of the placards put into that article, I think, was something from the, I don't know what it was, 80s, 90s of, you know, let's go after all the SUVs.  Right.  So it's a $60,000 car.  Right.  You know, there was a time when walking around with a Macintosh was obnoxious, too.  Mm-hmm. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, I understand upset over income inequality.  What I worry is that technology, which I, you know, look, technology is not uniformly good.  It can go either way, but it is in many respects the hope of our species.  That is how our species has advanced.  And it is very important stuff.  And I hate for it to be equated with income inequality to say, you know, we got to shut this technology.  You know, this Google stuff is bad because people are getting rich on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is, but in the end, this is an issue, very simply, of taxation.  If you want to, and I think, you know, I think as we have fewer jobs and less security, I personally believe we need a single payer health system.  I believe we need a better safety net.  But are you saying that socialism is the cure to this?  No, I'm saying that there are some that we don't have the essential safety net that the Europeans, for example, have.  And I think that if we assume that people are going to have fewer jobs, less seniority at jobs, less stability at jobs,  then having some security for mobility, I think is important.  And that's one way to redistribute wealth is you tax it.  It's the only way.  You know, it's like the fight in Europe over Google's taxes that I have a fit about because it's not up to Google to decide how much to give.  It's up to governments to decide how much to tax and what to then do with those proceeds.  That's the real fight here.  And, of course, our political system is back to your point, Leo.  It's a political fight and our political system can't bear it.  Is there an obligation as a technologist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, let's face it.  Glass really does look frivolous, expensive.  And there's a certain amount of arrogance that is imputed by somebody wearing this camera that they could take a picture of you at any time.  Should we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's power in that.  There's power.  Should we tread more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Should we tread more carefully?  And should we avoid things like glass?  Because they imply...  That makes me very uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So PC doesn't extend just to language.  It now extends to innovation.  We shouldn't innovate certain things.  We shouldn't be trying certain things because somebody might not like it.  Oh, God, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, not because somebody might not like it because it is, in fact, extremely expensive, of dubious value.  You said it, Gina.  It is a statement in the power balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think we need to do just the opposite, right?  We have to work towards...  Like you said, that technology isn't about income inequality, but it is, right?  Like access to technology is what matters.  And the fact is that not everybody has access to technology.  And that's part of, I think, the backlash to glass is that only the special folks who have enough money and who have the connections could get it, right?  So I think it's up to us not only to innovate, but to work toward opening up access to all sorts of new technologies or demystifying and explaining it.  The camera on glass, like the ability to be able to take a picture of someone by winking, that is a very powerful thing.  You can dock someone basically by winking, right?  That is a powerful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I can see how people might feel invaded by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But again, I'll say that there's nothing subtle about taking a picture with glass.  So you're still taking a picture.  The wink still...  But we're going...  I'm sorry, but I'm going to invoke it.  Going back to 1890 and the Kodak camera and the Kodakers, until we have the norms that deal with this, if I walk down the street and see...  Even on a public street, you know my views about publicness, and you see a 12 year old girl walking, and I just went up to her and took a picture.  Wouldn't we all agree that would be wrong?  It doesn't matter what camera I use, what means I use, that would be wrong.  Are norms unstated?  What if glass...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's something I'm asking the chairman, I'm asking an interesting question.  What if glass didn't have a camera?  Then it's just a display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be even less useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, but I would be less in...  I would find it less intrusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would, I think, change the perception of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then it's, gee, you're connected all the time.  Gee, aren't you obnoxious you're connected all the time?  It is kind of obnoxious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  Let's face it, it's obnoxious.  And while I'm not blaming Kyle, and of course it's wrong to take something off somebody's face and smash it, that's wrong.  So I'm not saying it's Kyle's fault.  You know, my daughter was carrying an iPhone 5S in Mexico two days ago and got mugged at KnifePoint.  I'm sorry, is she right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean...  That's serious. That must have been really traumatic.  It's a very fancy phone.  She's carrying around late at night.  It's not her fault.  But it's also prudent to take off your fancy jewelry in the subway.  Don't you...  Don't you...  You know, my first wife would always turn her ring around in the subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's prudent, but you should never blame the victim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the victim's fault, but at the same time, prudence would dictate that one doesn't flash one's jewelry on the subway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't take my MacBook out of my bag on the subway and use it.  Some people do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But as we will do on the civilized path as well.  But what we should be decrying here is not that we should be decrying is any part of society where that happens.  I mean, I lived in New York in the end of the bad days when you were constantly cautious and constantly worried.  And you know, you could say, people getting mad at you rich people moving into New York.  Well, that's just clearly wrong.  New York is so much better off now than it was.  And San Francisco is far better off than if the entire tech industry moved to Cleveland, which could use it and would be grateful for it.  I think we'd be really careful here of not recognizing whom to blame.  Now, if you're committing a crime, that's who you blame.  If that person is angry, well, all right, we can we can discuss that.  But that's no justification for the crime.  Never, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no.  And I'm not saying that.  I mean, if you get robbed on the subway because you flashed your jewelry, it's not.  It's not. It is your fault.  But I'm not. But I mean, can't we have both things?  It's a terrible thing.  Nobody should commit crime ever.  Horrible.  And at the same time, don't be stupid and walk down dark alleys in the middle of the night.  That doesn't mean you're blaming the victim.  Just don't be stupid.  But I know I mean, can we have both thoughts at the same time?  Or is it either or? No, I should be able to do anything I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's it's it's a tragic prudence you have to do.  It is tragic. Welcome to the world for crying out loud.  But first recognize the tragedy of that.  Recognize that that's wrong that you even have to think about such things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. I should be able to flash my 5D Mark II anywhere I want.  I was walking down the street in Argentina about midnight in Buenos Aires.  And somebody tapped me on the shoulder.  I jumped. He said, you know, he said, don't carry your 5D Mark II on your shoulder in the middle of the night in Buenos Aires.  Are you insane?  And I immediately went, oh, no.  And I didn't get mugged. I didn't get mugged.  But I was very lucky, apparently, because I could have easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, this is being a woman in the world.  Yeah, right. I mean, yeah, right.  It stinks that this is the case.  That's right. But of course, I'm always circumspect.  Always. Aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course. And I taught my daughter to be careful.  My wife taught my daughter to be careful.  She said, you know, don't if you if you're walking in a don't go into deserted parking structure at midnight, have the guard go with you.  I agree. We shouldn't have to do that.  But we do.  And I think it's probably a bad idea, Jeff, if you come out here to go down Mission Street wearing your glass.  That's not quite so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want I want a twit crew following me.  I'll protect you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The power of the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm taking these off now. They're never comfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And you look like a dork.  Hey, hey, hey.  No, I got nothing against glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I look like a dork with these glasses, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think how many people do you think bought glass yesterday?  Is it still on sale? Was it one day only?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was one day only. And they say they sold out.  But of course, that's I wonder what that means.  A thousand, ten thousand, five thousand.  All we know is that the white went first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've been emailing me like updates.  I don't know. I must have gotten on their PR list and from from someone at Google.  Hi, I'll just want to let you know, we're not sharing the specifics around the sale.  As many of you have asked for numbers.  They want to share the statement and the statement is we're getting through our stock faster than we expected.  And we decided to shut the store down.  So the fact that they're not sharing numbers makes me think that they're probably not very high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. If it was a million, they'd be saying a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No doubt. No doubt they would be saying that.  So I think they're making it seem like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm thinking tens of thousands.  I think they stocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now are we out? Is that it? There's no more glass ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. They're not saying that.  I said they might extend the sale.  I saw that in some quote somewhere.  I think what I think the question is, would they sell any?  Here's the question.  If they are going to come out with a consumer product.  Imminently, like I would say six months.  And it's going to be a hell of a lot less than than than these.  Then if I just bought these, I'd probably be a little pet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. They're going to make it.  I still think they're not doing a consumer product.  I think they're going to be doing a search for Android wear.  And there is no product here.  They know perfectly well this is not a mass market product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really don't think people want to wear these.  No, I listen. I own them and I don't.  Yeah. Yeah.  It's a gimmicky thing.  And I have my briefcase every day and I think I should I should I take them out now?  Should I be doing something with them?  So my problem is there's a speed bump to get them hooked up and connected and doing things.  I'm afraid it's going to go into my my my phone contract.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's I just say to me, is it safe to assume as eight bit Steve does in our chat room that this means that it'll be a while if they are going to sell them because they wouldn't like two months from now say, oh, and hey, guess what?  We got them for 200 bucks.  That sounds right.  I think that's right.  That means we got you know, this is like a year off.  If if at all.  And I'm I'm serious.  I just don't see this as a consumer product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This as it is.  No, no.  But the idea of an always on see here's here's the problem.  You you a few minutes ago said, I don't know, having a camera around all the time.  I don't know.  But the other hand, rationally, you have to agree that having a camera, you don't have to pull out and turn on is a wonderful thing.  As long as nobody knocks you in the face because you used it rudely.  So the problem there is to get past the norms and the structure and maybe it is a light on it to let you know you used it or something like that.  But the idea of having a camera on all the time is a wonderful thing.  If somebody's wearing a big old GoPro on their head, there's no I never hear anybody complaining about, hey, you got a GoPro on because you look like a complete dork and you know you're recording everything on it.  Right.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I don't think it's it's an unreasonable part of our social contract to say.  And if you're going to take a picture, you should have to pull out a device that's clearly designed to take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The issue isn't the pulling out.  The issue is the knowledge.  So if if if this thing had a big red light on it, when you're taking a picture, then there'd be no you would have disarmed that complaint.  You have a different complaint to disarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Flash or visible flash.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think glass is going to come out in 2015.  I think it's going to be for certain kinds of people, security guards, you know, for for for, you know, doctors, surgeons, teachers.  And, you know, maybe when you go to the amusement park, they let you rent a pair so you can take a bunch of pictures of, you know, while you're on the roller coaster or whatever.  I mean, I think it's very much an experience kind of accessory.  I don't think that every single consumer is going to have them.  But I think there's going to be some sort of place for them in different places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a place for glass somewhere, a place for glass.  You could wear it in your hair or ask where that glass.  No, take a word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  David, you're poking us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm poking you.  You told me you've been poked.  Let's take a break.  Gina and Jennifer here.  We're talking.  We're going to talk more stuff, more tech stuff in just a second.  But first, a word from Shutterstock, a great place to get those beautiful images you need for your blog, your presentation, anywhere where you use photos.

Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis, Leo Laporte.  It's time, my friends, for the Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google Change Log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina Trapani has the new stuff from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, after All About Android aired last night, a bunch of too big Android new things dropped.  They always do that.  It always happens. It always happens.  First one's pretty big deal.  Android's camera app got a bunch of new features, a UI overhaul, and now it's just available in the Play Store.  The decoupling of Android's core features like keyboard and Gmail continues.  It's now available in the Play Store, and it's got some pretty cool new features.  It offers photospheres, of course, for 360 views.  This new lens blur feature.  It gives you SLR-like photos with a shallow depth of field.  It does this without the extra hardware.  We were testing this earlier today.  I'm going to take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The way it works, I've turned on lens blur.  The way it works, I take a picture, and then it says, slowly raise your device and keep the subject centered.  You're going to rotate it.  What you're doing is you're giving it some parallax.  You're giving it, in a sense, two images.  This is what our HTC M8s, the ones do, Gina, with two lenses.  In this case, you have to take the picture twice, basically.  Then you can...  How do you edit it?  What do I do to edit it now, Chad?  Chad, help me, Chad.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Find the one you just took.  Next to the pencil, there's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I had to click the lens thing there.  Click the lens thing.  Now I can choose what's in focus, background or foreground or anything, which is a little bit more sophisticated than the M8.  Then I can also have a slider to reduce or increase the effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here, let go of the slider, and then it does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me take a different picture and play with it a little bit.  This one was in front of the...  Actually, maybe I've already...  Oh, no.  You were saying you could only save one image.  It doesn't save the original.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, there's some way that it tags it as, this is an image that is a blur image.  Then you can re-edit the amount of blur or what is selected at any time, but then it only saves out one.  Let's say you wanted to do a progression of blur or two different types of blur.  It really only saves one image.  It doesn't clutter up your gallery with multiple images.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does a good job.  What's interesting about it is, really, the HTC One feels like it only has two planes.  This has an infinite number of planes.  You see the twit is out of focus here, but I could have made it in focus.  I think it does a nice job, maybe arguably better than the HTC.  You also get the photosphere, right, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes, you get photosphere and there's panorama mode with high resolution.  It's just got a really nice UI.  It gets out of your way.  Of course, the UI, you have to swipe in from the left in order to see the different options,  which took me a few times to figure out.  You had to show me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't figure it out at all.  You swipe in from the left.  I kept pressing the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the HDR button.  They say it's an updated UI that gets out of your way.  It gets so out of your way that it's hard to find the settings once you get used to it.  Once you know about the swipe in.  It works on phones and tablets running 4.4, so that's only KitKat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a new feature.  He's taking a video and it is telling him to turn your camera into...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh!  That is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Portrait mode shots.  That's good.  It lets you do it, but it's kind of like a subtle reminder.  It's not happy about it.  It says, you don't have any taste.  Exactly.  Wow.  There are some UI subtleties where after you finish taking a photo,  instead of it going down to the corner in a little...  You're recording.  There you go.  It swipes off to the side and it kind of pops in just like that.  Oh, you see that?  It goes over there.  Oh, hey, here I am.  It's kind of a subtle reminder that you can swipe over at any time to get to your gallery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No slow-mo in the video.  It's kind of a limited feature set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually kind of nice that it's not so many.  It's a pretty short list.  The research blog did this great post about how they implemented lens blur  and how they're basically estimating 3D maps of the objects in your photos  to figure out where the lines are.  And I have to say, compared to some of the photos that I took with the M8  and used the HTC Change Focus app, these seem to be better, or at least just as good.  You can see in that picture up on screen, the edge of her hair,  the edge in the foreground, and then that is really kind of clean and nice  and looks more like what you get out of an SLR.  So they did a really nice job with this.  I'm sad that it's cake-cat only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that because it has more data?  You're not just taking two photos, you're taking a swing.  Is that giving it more data to really get more of the shape?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, to estimate where things are.  I think because you move your camera so that the camera can figure out what's far  and what's near based on what pixels move the most.  This is my laywoman's view.  But that's why you have to do that quick move of the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's free, why not? You don't have it in addition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  What else? For Android, another huge app drop, the Chromoting app.  This is the Chrome Remote Desktop app, which is now available for Android,  which lets you access your Chrome desktop from any Android device.  This was available for Chrome, so you could from Chrome control another Chrome device,  but now this is now available for Android.  You download the Android app, which is now in the Play Store,  and you can do remote assistance for another user, or you can access your own Chrome desktop.  I set this up just before the show.  You need the Android app, you need a Chrome extension,  then you have to install Chrome Remote Desktop host software,  you have to set up a PIN number.  I mean, of course, there's a ton of security issues around remote access on your phone,  but once you've got it all working, it shows up on your Android device  as a remote desktop that you can control.  You move your finger around, and that's the mouse.  You can make the keyboard appear.  It's a really nice remote desktop app, also free.  And then finally, Gmail got a new button, an Insert Photo button,  and this is in the web interface of Gmail.  So if you click on the Insert Photo button in your Compose box,  you will get to choose between all the photos in your Google Plus account,  which if you have auto backup enabled, which I do, and I totally highly recommend,  it's basically all the photos that are on your phone.  It's really nice. You can insert an individual photo, you can insert an entire album,  and in the Compose window you can resize the image, which is really nice,  because we all know what that's like to get an email from someone with a giant image  that's the wrong orientation.  So look for that in your Gmail Compose window on the web now.  It's just an Insert Photo button down on the toolbar on the bottom.  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's your Change Long with Gina Trapani.  I'll play with the M8 camera comparing it to the Google camera.  But at least you have the choice.  Do a face-off.  The nice thing about the M8 camera is you just take the picture and the data is there.  You keep the original and you have the refocused.  But I think you're right. I think the Google camera does a better job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and with the Google camera I definitely move the phone up,  because it says move your phone up, and I'd say, oh, too fast, too slow, not enough angle.  And you don't get any of that from the M8.  With the M8 you just take the regular picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How pissed is HTC right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they're pissed.  This was a feature that was in Nokia's Windows phones before HTC did it.  I don't think they're pissed.  I think there's other stuff that... there's no slow-motion video.  I think everybody knows that Google is going to slowly make all the apps  that are part of the Google Services module out on the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this feature, if HTC had known this feature was in the works,  would they have added in that extra hardware  and affected the cost and profitability of that device?  They could have invested in something else or made it cheaper.  I'd be pissed by HTC.  I'd say, what kind of partner are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe. I mean, I don't know.  They can say, hey, this phone takes better pictures.  Look, there's two cameras. How could they not be better?  It's sort of markets itself.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's easier. It's easier just to snap and that's done.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it has other features.  It has this 3D feature that when you take a photo,  you can go into this 3D mode. I think that's what it's called.  And as you tilt your device, you can kind of see around the subject.  It's kind of gimmicky, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a bunch more. Yeah.  I like... I'm still happy with the M8.  I mean, who knows how many they're going to sell  and whether it's going to save HTC anyway.  But I'm also glad that Google's released...  Now, they've released the keyboard.  They've released the launcher.  They've released the camera.  They've released the calendar. That was the first thing they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Gmail, right? That was also...  Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you're an Amazon...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chrome, obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, I don't think it helps you on Amazon  because Amazon has only what's in the Amazon store,  and I bet you they don't put these things in the Amazon store.  Plus, you need, as Gina said,  you need a very recent version of Android.  That's true. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the now launcher.  Yeah, the now launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo said that.  Well, Photos, I guess, ships with...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Photos is new, yeah.  Although all my friends... Hangouts, which is taking over SMS.  Yep. That's a lot.  It is a lot. It's an interesting shift in their strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have to worry about any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you have a Windows Fun.  It's all just in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you have a Nexus Fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Blackberry, I have a Nexus.  It is kind of amazing how many of my apps are Google apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even on the iPhone, people use Google apps.  Google Plus.  They did change their privacy policy on Gmail  to show a little bit more clearly  what they were up to in scanning mail.  Earlier today on Windows Weekly...  Well, that's the thing.  It's more of an admission that they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a clarification, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which they should have done ages ago.  They should have been clearer.  I'm actually going to speak to the privacy group at Google in a few weeks.  And that's going to be my point.  They've got to be the absolute best of breed about transparency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because if it's an explicit deal with your users,  then everybody says,  okay, I know what they're... I'm giving up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The complaints have died down,  except for these crackpots who are suing them  as if they didn't know what was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Paul Therop pointed this out.  A, he declared victory for the Scroogled campaign.  I don't know if that's fair, but he said,  C, Microsoft forced Google to change your privacy.  No, the suit did it.  And then I think the lawsuits.  And Paul mentioned that as well, the lawsuits as well.  So what does the new privacy policy say?  Let me get the actual language, if I can find it here.  They basically admit that they're scanning your mail for advertising.  Which we've all known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, anyone who's given any thought about this at all,  whatsoever, knows this, right?  Yeah, let's see what...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google does scan all emails. Shock!  Here's the...  We want our policies to be simple and easy for users to understand.  These changes will give people even greater clarity  and are based on feedback we've received over the last few months.  Here's the new term of service.  Our automated systems analyze your content, including email.  Now, actually, that's important.  Not including can also be not limited to.  So they analyze your content.  Is that your Google Docs?  Is that me, your docs? That's a good question.  Our automated systems analyze your content, including emails,  to provide you personally relevant product features  such as customized search results, tailored advertising,  and spam and malware detection.  This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it's stored.  So it's almost like they're scanning all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not just for ads. It's, for example, for malware.  And viruses and such. They're scanning that in your docs.  Yeah, certainly they are. They say so.  They say so.  So this is an Uber scanning statement now.  But the problem is by adding, by telling more, they told less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This hasn't been in their terms of service.  I don't understand. They'd never spelled this out before.  This is not news.  They had to have, right?  Maybe this is just clarity or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do we have the before and after?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't.  Well, that's the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a statement, but this statement may not be that different from what it was before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is the new statement.  The lawsuits are since, because there are rules about privacy.  For instance, FERPA, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.  I'm sure, Jeff, you've come across FERPA because it's quoted all the time.  When I say, can I see my daughter's grades?  They say no.  You may be paying for it, Dad, but FERPA protects her privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And FERPA are the enemies of parenting, among many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and they invoke FERPA a lot.  So if you, but Google knows my daughter's grades, I guess is the lawsuit.  You know, I don't think that equates to the same thing as a human being reading it.  Let me see if I can find, I don't know if I can find it.  It certainly doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and for that matter, your ISP knows it, it passes through, you know, it's stored somewhere.  That's an antiquated concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and Microsoft is scanning that content, not for ads, but for spam.  In effect, anybody who fights spam is doing exactly the same scanning.  They're just using it for a different purpose or a more restricted purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just posted the diff in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you are good.  Did you run a diff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, no, they run a diff to their credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that is, that is fast work.  You fired up Sedoc and Grep and diffed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they actually, they post a GitHub style, you know, that's colored.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so if you scroll down, you can see the new paragraph.  Okay, so let me read it.  That says it's a...  Yeah, the green is new and obviously the red is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The red is crossed out.  So when you upload or otherwise is cut out, submit.  No, they added this green graph.  Boy, it's hard to believe that wasn't there.  Apparently they did not explicitly say, although they say it elsewhere.  It may not have been in the terms of service, but Google has never made a secret that they  scan our mail for advertising purposes.  So that maybe just wasn't in the TOS.  Thank you for the diff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure.  Anytime.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Diff it up.  Diff it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Now is going to let you know when you, where you parked.  That's cool.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is purportedly, reportedly, purportedly, this hasn't happened yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's going to be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Google Now is going to guess when you stopped driving, parked your car and gotten out of  your car.  It's easy.  And then it pins where you left your car.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the last place we saw you after you stopped driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's all kinds of data around this that's useful.  Here's, I want to see on Waze which gas stations people stop at most, because that's going  to tell you where the cheapest gas is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they even know the prices, but you're right.  That would be even another.  They do?  How do they know the prices?  Because the gas stations post them.  So this is an app.  In fact, I reviewed it yesterday before you buy.  It's a little dongle you put on your OBD-2 port on your car and then it Bluetooth to  your phone as you drive.  And so it knows all sorts of things about your driving, including nearby gas.  And then it loads in the prices.  So it sorts it by price based on gas stations must be posting this information somehow.  I have no idea.  But this also remembers where you park because when you get in the car and start driving,  it goes, good morning, Dash is recording your trip.  And then when you end it, Dash has stopped recording your trip.  That's in the APIs for Android, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll tell you when you're driving, when you're walking, when you're biking.  It'll sense the speed, I guess, which you're going and the kind of movements.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, it's, you know, I mean, I know it's in a parking garage, so it's roughly there.  I mean, I guess I could get close enough that I could beep the horn with my keys.  But that's pretty cool.  And that's that's built in.  You see, I can even press the navigate button and it'll walk me to my car using ways or  maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that so that's just an app.  I think now should absolutely do this.  And I can't imagine why they wouldn't.  Except for all those people were creeped out by Google knowing anything about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the thing.  I want to see people's faces.  I was like, here's your car.  Google knows where your car is.  Let me take you back to your car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the beginning of a service in which Google rents out your car while you're not there.  And they'll just leave the cash on the dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and where you can get delivery made to your car and Google can unlock the car for you.  Perfect.  Just put it in the trunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google is like, OK, Google, please gas up my car.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't know.  There was a story last week that Facebook was considering buying this company, Titan  Aerospace, because they were going to remember that Facebook wanted to do Internet via drones.  It's like a battle of the loony ideas.  And I use the word loon intentionally because that's what Google wants to do.  Balloons.  So Zuckerberg says, you got balloons.  I got drones.  Well, then Google buys Titan Aerospace and says, no, you don't.  This is what happens when people have too much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So these things can stay in the air for three years.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crazy.  Is it better than balloons?  I don't know.  Jet sized drones that are intended to fly nonstop for years.  Actually, Google wants to use them for satellites, for street view, for maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see more uses for Google than Facebook.  Facebook just says they want access.  Google has maps and all this other data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Facebook was going to use it for that nonprofit internet.org idea, you know, to  give the Internet to everybody kind of thing.  Titan would work closely with Project Loon.  Google's going to take over the airspace, then see the Howells.  Solar powered aircraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll get to my German friends in a few minutes.  We'll get to that.  Yes.  The Howells have already started.  Howells.  It's a Howells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I woke up this morning and I got texts and emails looking, Jarvis, you have to see this.  You have to see this.  People are not just baiting you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's fine.  I enjoyed the herring in my mouth.  The hook didn't feel so good, but that's fine.  So including, by the way, full disclosure, Google people emailed to me.  So Matthias Düpfner, who is the head of Axel Springer, which is a gigantic media powerhouse in Germany.  It owns BILT, the largest paper in Germany, which I described today.  And pardon me for the sexist double entendre here, but I enjoyed it.  BILT is basically Fox News with boobs.  As if Fox News doesn't have boobs, you see who gets it.  I'm sorry.  I apologize for the sexist language, but I enjoyed the joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even understand it because Fox News, well, never mind.  There's plenty of boobs on Fox News, frankly.  Exactly. That's the joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the joke.  But the only difference is in BILT, they're naked.  Oh, that kind of.  You get it.  Yes.  Sorry.  Well, never mind.  So this guy went off on a huge attack on Google and Eric Schmidt.  I suppose because Eric wrote a piece in the same paper the week before, which he said  Eric-y things.  But even beyond that, it went it went completely over the top, like nothing I've ever seen.  And it's that what I say is that German business model of whining, stomping your feet, saying  it's not fair, blaming the other guy.  And so I kind of took after it and said that Düpfner practiced what I thought was public  self-economic castration because he was admitting he couldn't compete with Google.  And so he's asking government to help, which is also I got to be humiliating for the guy  who has a gigantic conservative powerhouse to be asking for government regulation, bigger  government, government intervention in the marketplace.  The truth is that they're just trying to push the European Commission to go beyond the  agreement that Google came to with them.  And so then he goes on trying to just make Google into a big bad guy because that's good  for him.  So he says that he compares Google, of course, he says the agreement with the EU, which allows  competitors to advertise on Google in guaranteed ways and guaranteed prices or price structures.  He calls this protection money like the mafia, as if the New York Times would really allow  the Wall Street Journal to advertise inside it.  Certainly the Wall Street Journal would not allow the New York Times to advertise.  Then he says that Mark Zuckerberg's view on privacy would come from the head of the Stasi,  which I find offensive.  These German secret police.  Then he says that Google, quote, sits on the entire privacy of mankind like the giant  Faafner in the ring of the Nibelung.  How's that for a German insult?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I can tell you right now, you're not going to hear that kind of literary reference  in American poland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you're not.  Faafner.  And then he says, forget Big Brother, Google is better.  So he complains about all kinds of things, including the fact that Google's self-driving  cars will compete with Volkswagen.  What?  And Nest going into homes.  I got to Google Faafner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tried to understand and I can't understand it.  I can't.  I tried to go through the plot.  It was like trying Game of Thrones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Faafner was the son of a dwarf king, Redmar and the brother of Regan and Otter.  He became a dragon and was slared by Sigurd.  But before he was a dragon, he was a dwarf with powerful arms and a fearless soul.  And before he was a dwarf, he was a giant.  So basically, I have no idea what's going on here.  Apparently, he'd sit on his golden hoard like a dragon wants to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's where he goes on and says that he frets about Google planning, buying drone  companies and planning huge ships and floating offices operating stateless in the waters  around the world.  Come on.  And one needn't be a conspiracy theorist, he says, to find this disturbing.  So the bottom line is he's trying to egg the EU into pushing Google farther.  He makes some really ridiculous proposals that he knows are ridiculous.  He's a very smart guy, and he says that Google should erase all cookies immediately after  a session and hold no IP, which would enable it would mean that it couldn't do any ad  targeting.  He says that Google should make transparent all of the qualitative data behind its algorithm,  which, of course, would make it gamed and worthless.  He says that we shouldn't be paying for things with our behavioral data anymore, only with  money, which, of course, is a publisher's old model.  And so the bottom line is it's just absolutely ridiculous.  So it's spreading like wildfire around the German world.  And I may have just put the entire audience to sleep with this, and I apologize for that.  But I just find it amazing that the Google hatred that exists in a different way from  San Francisco in Germany just keeps going on.  And it's a cynical act by an old dinosaur who hasn't figured out the net, who just tries  to demonize his competitor for being successful.  Thank you for that moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meanwhile, Google's first quarter earnings are in and missed analysts expectations, but  did have fifteen point four billion dollars in revenue.  So Fafner's got some gold to sit on.  19 percent revenue growth year over year, earnings per share of six dollars and 27 cents.  That is lower than the analyst's estimate.  You know how important it is to reach the analyst's estimate of six dollars and 42 cents a share.  Here's the scary part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The volume of ads was up 26 percent, but the yield, the price down 9 percent because of mobile.  Oh, interesting.  That's an extravable slide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've seen that across the board to write Yahoo and Facebook as well.  Yeah, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a big deal in numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only English translation of this letter is courtesy of Google Translate.  Is that true?  Yeah.  And that's just I'm gobsmacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My translation varies a little bit from but I wouldn't dare to.  I think your German is probably better than Google Translate.  It's bad.  Google, Google.  I become lazier thanks to Google Translate.  I'll admit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it doing a better job?  It feels like it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things I didn't know was that you can now users can can improve Google Translate  and correct it, which I was surprised they didn't that ages ago.  It's pretty good.  It gives you the sense.  Awkward grammar.  And things will always confuse it.  And genders confuse the heck out of it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Capitalized German nouns confuse it greatly because it can't tell names as easily.  So there's some stuff it'll always be weak on, but it's pretty darn good.  I mean, and I can I can go to something in language I don't speak at all and get a sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thanks to it.  Google made enough money that it can turn down government military funding from DARPA  for its new robotics contest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I also did that as a matter of principle, I think.  I hope so.  Well, it also PR to say that I think that with owning robots and drones now and given  the NSA, Google's got to stay as far away from government as it can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  These are the DARPA Robotics Challenge trials.  They were in December.  Google scored the most points.  Actually, Google's new robotics firm, Shaft.  Shut your mouth.  I'm talking about Shaft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One that go out of their way when the military was testing glass and Google go out of their  way to say they're just like any other explorer.  They bought it from us.  We didn't enable this thing in some circles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it doesn't bother me that they would be involved in military research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that came from DARPA.  Right.  DARPA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  The most this is a two legged robot that the Japanese shafts team created that won the  DARPA Robotics Challenge trials, scoring the most points across tasks that tested mobility,  dexterity, perception and autonomous operations.  That's the one that always scares me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I imagine Mark Penn now creating an ad campaign.  Don't get shafted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, really, OK, this is like wearing glass in the Mission District.  Google, do you really have to make autonomous two legged robots?  Do you do you really have to be doing that?  Let it be a little circumspect.  But here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I was reading the stuff about the and I'm jumping around the rundown.  But another patent for contact lenses that because cameras.  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK.  All right.  So you can't even see it's a camera.  And that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's where this goes.  Interesting.  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only reason I like glasses because it looks dorky and it's clunky.  Now we go back to our headache.  If you could just wear it on top.  I've always said a heads up display.  That's what I want.  So now we go back to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, now we're going to go back to our comic book days, Leo, and their X-ray, too.  So but here's the neat thing about it in the write up is that it imagined, you know,  the self-driving human, the blind person who can now get connected to data and say,  you're at the end of the sidewalk, the lights red.  I mean, all these things that could happen could be phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google is testing a way to match users, search users to their purchases at stores.  This will freak people out, too.  It's anonymous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Six advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're helping six advertisers as a pilot program to match the anonymous tracking cookies  on users' computers to in-store sales information.  How could they possibly?  I don't know how they could.  It's anonymous.  How could they?  Hmm.  Does it explain it, Ricky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It involves AdWords.  Google gets played when users click on an ad, visit the advertiser's website, blah, blah,  blah.  They want to get paid when these shoppers enter a physical store.  That's the Holy Grail.  Yeah.  So, yes.  Wow.  That's a $200 billion nut, according to Google ad executive Neil Mohan.  The $200 billion nut that's sitting out there basically ready to come into the digital sphere.  He's not a wordsmith.  It doesn't say exactly how they do this, but so much for anonymized cookies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I'm signed into Google.  I get an ad for Michael's Craft Store.  One of the participants.  I click on Easter baskets.  Yes.  I look at them.  Yes.  And then later that week, I walk into a Michael's and I'm signed into Android with the same  account.  I was signed into Chrome.  Oh, that's how.  Bingo.  And then what happens?  Do I get a notification?  Oh, hey, the thing you're looking at is on sale or just Google get a ping?  You don't get crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google gets a ping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Michael's gets a ping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Michael's gets a ping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Michael spends some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google says cha-ching because I got a ping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw a company this week at Greycroft called Nomi, N-O-M-I, and they have beacons in stores.  And so the first level of this is so they can just track traffic and find out how long  people spend at things and so on and so forth.  And then they just recently bought another company that does tie to unique IDs.  Wow.  And that's the holy grail in a whole kind of ways, because then if you go to showrooming,  I go after them.  I say if you're in showrooming mode, the presumption is if I walked into the store, look at the  thing that's left.  Yeah, because it can't tell if you bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a lost sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can only tell you showed up.  Now you do the reverse too, Leo.  You go into the store, you look at the item, then you go home and buy it online.  Now that gives the opportunity to give the store some level for credit for being part  of that sale.  Yeah.  And stores become marketing space.  Yeah.  That's so, so, so.  Oh, so if you go both ways.  It's the reverse of what you just announced.  You go both ways.  It goes both ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes.  So here's the ARPA, the shaft vehicle.  This is autonomous driving.  And this is the two-legged robot.  This is not good.  This is very bad.  Oh, why not?  The Terminator is just around the corner, I swear to God.  We'll see one of those.  Oh my God.  Look at that.  It's climbing up a ladder.  Wow.  You can't even run away upstairs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That thing looks top heavy too.  I notice those legs are working well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's building a house.  Oh no.  If they made it the shape of a cat, no one would complain.  Yeah.  This is search and rescue.  Moving stuff out of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Friends, what you are now watching is the beginning of the end of the human species.  Oh, sure.  It starts by cutting a small hole in drywall.  This is, these are all the, there's like 31 tasks.  These are all the tasks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that jazz music or their music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's their music.  That's their music.  And by the way, I think that is, if I'm not mistaken, Wagner's rings.  So it's all true.  It's far full.  Sitting on his shaft.  I don't want to see that coming towards me in a dark alley.  Geez, Louise.  There's a reason.  Apparently, apparently just blew everybody away at the DARPA challenge.  People could not believe one robot did all this.  Geez.  But notice it is tethered.  Well, batteries.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just to make sure it doesn't become sentient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, sentience is what you need.  When it does become sentient, we can at least harness it back.  That's what the tether's about.  We had, who do we have on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They look like the aliens from District 9.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they do, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they're allowed to contribute to presidential campaigns, then we know that they're not  in trouble.  That's a given.  Robots are human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who are we talking to?  Oh, it was Jeff Hawkins who founded Palm and now is doing thinking machines.  He said, it's all fine.  It's not a big deal.  Artificial intelligence is fine.  You just can't let them replicate.  Just keep that in mind.  Oh, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just as long as they can't reproduce.  He said, if they can reproduce, it's over.  That's really not comforting in any way at all.  Did he really say he was serious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like saying, just don't give them water after midnight.  Everything else will be fine.  We've seen this movie.  Just whatever you do, don't let them replicate.  I'm just going to go home and watch Battle Star go out again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good thing robots can't manufacture more robots.  Right, because if they could, it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then you're dead.  You might as well go home.  Amazon's App Store has 200,000 apps on it now, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This week in fear and loathing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why did they remove video calling from Glass because nobody used it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the experience just wasn't that good.  Air Go, not a lot of people used it.  They took it out.  This is where I am at a disadvantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never did it, so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other issue was, in terms of just calling a contact, you had a list of 10 contacts and that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just wasn't a great experience.  I think they pulled it because people weren't using it.  Maybe it will come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bookmarked this because I just thought this was so good.  I don't know.  There's really not much to say.  This will be our last story and then we'll get to our picks of the week.  Internet trolls really are horrible people.  Science says,  New research conducted by Aaron Buckles of the University of Manitoba and two colleagues  sought to investigate whether people who engage in internet trolling are characterized by personality traits that fall in the so-called dark tetrad,  Machiavellianism, psychopathy, sadism, and narcissism.  Turns out not so narcissistic, but really sadistic.  What they did is they polled, they surveyed these people and asked if they enjoyed what they enjoyed most when online comment sites,  when on online comment sites, debating issues that are important to you, chatting with others, making new friends, trolling others and other.  Among the people who said they enjoyed trolling, it was a small number, only 5.6%.  They really had personality traits for sadism, particularly.  You can read the study.  That's why you don't feed the trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't feed the trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both trolls and sadists, they wrote, feel sadistic glee at the distress of others.  Sadists just want to have fun and the internet is their playground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm working on some curriculum, which I'll not talk about today, but talk about another time, involved with engagement in journalism.  I had the great delight of including in the required reading, if I may use this word, asshole's a theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a scholarly paper?  Yes, it's a book. It's a very good book.  It's a book.  Yeah, it's a book.  What is the theory of assholes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just why they do what they do.  Yeah, well, this fits right in, I'm sure.  It does. If you're going to deal with the public, you have to know this stuff now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because the behaviors are, this is the conclusion of the study, because these behaviors are intrinsically motivating for sadists,  comment moderators will likely have a difficult time curbing trolling with punishments, for example, banning users.  Ultimately, the allure of trolling may be too strong for sadists who presumably have limited opportunities to express their sadistic interests in a socially desirable manner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, is sadism ever socially desirable?  No.  It's more like socially acceptable. You couldn't do in real life what you can do online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Soon now you can do it.  And it's drawing them in.  Machiavellianism, a little bit.  Machiavellianism is the willingness to manipulate and deceive others.  Narcissism, not so much egotism and self-obsession.  Psychopathy, the lack of remorse and empathy.  But the big one was the pleasure and the suffering of others.  That's really the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why if you are suffering at the hand of a troll, you do not let the troll know that that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that's what they dig.  Exactly.  That's what they're going for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it also says that if you...  And I was the big defender of comments early on in newspapers.  And I've said this on the show before, where the first problem with comments is it's inherently insulting to the public to say,  we will allow you to comment after we're done with our work.  We should be more collaborative.  But the other problem with comments is that it is just an open space.  It was true of forums before. It was true of Newsnet before.  An open space, you know, trolls will go and find it and find the opportunity to have this behavior there.  And if it doesn't have a purpose, you're going to have this trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, and we've talked about this before is why I bring this up.  And I was of the opinion that these are people who are seeking negative attention because they received this as children.  And this was... They misinterpreted it as love.  I was giving them a lot of benefit of the doubt.  No, it turns out they're just cruel sons of bitches.  Mm-hmm.  They're really... No, no, they're not.  They're just... They're nasty people.  In their study, they found that only about 41% of Internet users...  Actually, 41% of Internet users don't comment, don't engage online at all.  Of the remaining, what is that, 59%, only 5.6% are trolls.  So it's a small... You know, it's a few percentage points.  It's maybe one or two or a hundred.  That's all you need. That's all you need.  And we know this. We know that part.  Yeah.  But, boy, those one or two percent are really effective because they just push those buttons.  Mm-hmm.  They have a test they call GATE, the Global Assessment of Internet Trolling.  And then they ask things on a scale of one to five, do you agree or disagree with this statement?  I have sent people to shock well websites for the lulz.  Anybody ever? Anybody in the chat room?  Have you ever sent people to shock websites for the lulz?  I'm not talking Rick Rowling. I'm talking Goatzee, that kind of thing.  I like to troll people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, somebody we know and respect once famously did that.  Who was that?  Anil.  Anil? Anil Dan?  He wore a Goatzee t-shirt that appeared, I believe, in the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, in the New York Times. Yes, well.  And typical for Anil, anything he does, even that, turned into an intellectual discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, of course. Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, but the New York Times photographed him with the t-shirt on, not knowing what it was, and published the photo.  I mean, that was the prank. It was a stylized, it was not clear.  It was. It was. It was not the actual photo.  So then that's when the prank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fortunately, some people typed in the URL. Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, did that cause a discussion at the time.  It did.  Oh, my Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first time I did a live tweet, we did it at the Apple Store,  and somebody sat down in the audience and hijacked the Wi-Fi router so that all web searches went to Goatzee.  Oh, jeez.  And it was really interesting.  And if you don't know what Goatzee is, just ask your mom.  But it was really interesting because you could see the waves of horror and disgust propagate through the audience as people...  I shouldn't laugh.  But we found him because he's sitting there chortling.  It was very easy to figure out who it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, aren't their whole blogs dedicated to taking a photograph of the moment a person sees?  Right? I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like to... True or false, I like to troll people in forums or the comment sections of websites.  Trolls, it turns out, are pretty forthright. They say, yeah, I'm a troll. Yeah, I like to do that.  I enjoy griefing other players in multiplayer games.  Here's one. This one. This one.  The more beautiful and pure a thing is, the more satisfying it is to corrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm thinking about Weave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Poor Weave. He was a... Now, he self-declared troll, right?  He's off. He got off, but on a technicality.  But he was the guy who was downloading email addresses of iPad users by discovering a flaw in the AT&T database website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's also the guy that trolled Kathy Sierra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he is? Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And he was horrible. He was horrible to her.  And that's what that last sentence made me think of. The more beautiful and pure a thing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So no wonder there's such mixed feelings about him getting off. Now I understand.  He's a self-proclaimed troll, and I guess he really, really is.  I don't want to make this a depressing show. Let me find something funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, here's the one about the comics.  Comics roast generic techies in SF.  You can just read a couple of the gags there.  Google was going to be involved, but they kind of didn't like the language about it.  Things like, you know, I don't know what the joke was, bring your vomit for the bus or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google isn't known for its sense of humor, at least not when it comes to tech backlash.  This is from San Francisco Chronicles site, the SFGate.  That made the stand-up comedy event on Saturday night the roast of a techie a bit complicated to execute.  A real-life Googler, web developer Rico Rodriguez, not famous,  sat on a stool on stage to be roasted by a group of comedians at a San Francisco bar.  I guess the idea was, let's get it all out here.  Right. Here's a Googler.  It's a good idea. It's a funny idea.  They should have done it. Kevin Rose. They should have done it to him, at least anyway.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And a Google acapella group had planned to perform, but when employees double-checked with the company,  organizers claimed Google didn't take kindly to the language.  They didn't, you know, bring your best protest sandals and a carton of eggs, said the flyer.  They were concerned for the Googler's safety.  You know what, I like it that Rodriguez had a sense of humor and said, I'm going to try this.  It was just jokes, you know. It's like a roast. Most of the jokes were, you know, like...  Below, some of the jokes were tame.  Do you ever stay awake at night thinking about the death of Ask Jeeves?  Yeah.  Your perfect 10 in binary.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  A pern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the Google bus is making a Darwinian U-turn.  I don't think we should be genetically selecting for Asperger's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, okay.  I'm not trying to kick you guys off the bus.  I'm trying to get in the bus. It's nicer than my studio and has a better Wi-Fi connection.  That's probably true.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think Rodriguez then had the best line of the night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, the funny thing is, I'm a front-end developer, which is the equivalent of a beautician.  I make buttons look pretty. Yeah.  Making buttons look pretty for the sake of humanity.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it wasn't that funny, sorry.  It beat Goatse, but not by far.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see the blood moon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought that was something on Game of Thrones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lunar eclipse a couple of nights ago.  Blood red moon.  And it was. It was right after Game of Thrones.  So I ask you.  Oh, coincidence.  Coincidence? I think not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Silicon Valley right after Game of Thrones?  Yeah. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think? Now you've seen two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm in. I'm watching it.  I like it. How about you, Jeff Jarvis, television critic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was down a bit. I don't know.  It's a little broad. There's some broad stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then there's apparently, okay, so there's some really in stuff.  And I didn't know this, but Mike Elgin told me that if you watch the second episode,  there's a picture from Playboy on the wall in the apartment, in the house.  And it turns out, and I don't know how Mike found this out, that that, it was the, it must have read about it,  that was the very first JPEG image.  To test the form.  Right. And I remember, if I saw it now, I would recognize it because I do remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, the first JPEG image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's very geeky, right, to have that, you know, I mean, there's, so apparently,  well, we'll have to, we'll have to go through it with a fine tooth comb looking for geeky references like that.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't dislike it. I'm just not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not, I think it's smarter than I thought it would be.  It's not that reality show. It's much better than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that reality show is like, yeah, not even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a sitcom, but it's funnier than that roast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frankly.  Sorry, I tried. You wanted to lighten it up. It's all I had available.  You want me to go on the Germans again? Huh? Huh, I can do that.  I would prefer that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No more Germans.  Do you, since you make a Twitter analysis tool, what's the story with Gnip?  Is that a big deal that Twitter buys Gnip?  That was the last company, one of the few companies that had the fire hose, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. That's true. I'd forgotten that.  Yeah.  I don't think it's that big a deal. It doesn't surprise me.  I mean, I think that Twitter has sort of has peaked on clients and is now, I think that they're definitely interested in analytics.  Does it threaten you?  No, no, no, no, no, not at all. I don't I don't know. Maybe to my detriment.  I really don't pay attention to what other people are doing.  I have a pretty clear vision of what we want to do and we're different. We're totally different products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think Google would do what you're doing. I mean, Twitter would do what you're doing.  I think they should know analytics, but it's going to be for advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was an independent third party.  Yes.  It has feeds of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It had the fire hose. It had the total feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of many players too, not just Twitter.  Now that Twitter owns them, what impact does that have in terms of sources of social data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, don't know.  I have the chat room is, of course, sending me the image of the first JPEG.  Let me see before you show this.  No, yeah, you can show this because they didn't show the nudity.  But look for this picture on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, God, yeah.  Remember that?  How many times have I seen that? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no nudity. It's just the first JPEG.  It's a November 1972 Playboy.  It's their best selling issue ever. Sold seven million copies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the picture is of a Swedish woman named Lena Soderberg.  She's now married with three kids and has a job with the state liquor monopoly.  She's pleasantly amused by what has happened to her picture.  So I was just looking to think up and this is Ben Grubb, a verified user just followed me.  That's great news. He's deputy tech editor at the Sydney Morning Herald.  Hello, Ben. Thank you for following me.  I retweeted Dr. Kiki and three times the people I guess you're instead of just raw numbers now, you're just giving multiples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we changed it up.  In fact, there's a huge bug on your stream here, Leo.  One hundred and twenty six thousand three hundred and nineteen times more people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this guy doesn't have many Twitter followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that is not something that one would say in conversation.  Like our our our goal with the copy is to make it very human humanize it.  It makes me feel damn fine.  But no one would say that in conversation.  So we have to change that copy to more than one hundred thousand times more.  There you go. More than one hundred. See, see, that's why I'm a beta tester.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two interesting people followed me last week in my tweets.  Wow. Look at this one. This was the tweet that I did.  My number one tweet was my verification tweet for Keybase.  Keybase.io. Did you did you do you know about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I do. I actually I'm a terrible person.  I have an invite and I haven't set it up to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really easy. Yeah. Did you like it?  Yeah, I'll show you real quickly.  We were giving you a plug, but I'll just quickly deviate.  Well, that's fine. So it's Keybase.io.  It's founded by the two guys who did OK Cupid.  But this is not a monetary proposition.  The idea of this, let me just log in real quickly to my account.  The idea of this is to make it easy to do a few things.  One to do PGP crypto open public key cryptography,  but the other to find people's key public key in a auditable, verifiable directory.  So when you sign up for this, and I'll show you my page,  when you sign up for this, you publish as I did that tweet that verifies that it's me.  And also you put a little GitHub gist up and you can also put a link, put some text on your on your website.  And that proves that you're this person, the person who owns that Twitter account, that GitHub account and that website.  And then that's my public key.  So if you wanted to send me private stuff, you could actually use their website because it uses JavaScript.  But you can also install Node.js on your terminal and then do all of this from the terminal, which is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very nice. Yeah. And I can send you an encrypted message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I said I use Pastebin and send an encrypted message, a link to an encrypted message on Twitter.  And that was kind of fun. Yeah, that is fun. Yeah.  They're just little things you can do. I like the idea. It's very beta.  You have to get an invitation right now.  They say, you know, we don't recommend you you you encrypt stuff using in browser crypto.  But if you're sure that we haven't been tortured into serving you custom targeted JavaScript and your browser is clean and your life doesn't depend on it, you can do it within the browser.  But you can also easily do it from the command line.  Installing Node.js turns out to be a very simple thing to do, at least on a Macintosh.  And and then you have this command line capability of encrypting and decrypting and verifying.  But most importantly, this is a directory.  So once Gina is in this, I can search for Gina and I could get her public key.  Now there are existing directories like that.  MIT runs whether PGP runs on there's quite a few.  But this is kind of kind of pretty.  And they do verification. See, part of the problem with PGP, Oregon New Privacy Guard, which is the open source implementation of PGP, is that anybody can create a key.  People have created key with my name and email in it.  It's a phony key. You can't you know, it doesn't do you any good.  But it's a way to grief somebody because keys are unsigned.  So you're supposed to have signing parties where you all get together and you sign each other's keys.  But this what this does is use these public verification procedures to create a key that is somewhat trustworthy.  So I think that's a good idea. It's very easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I'm going to get up off my behind and sign up for.  And then I'll track you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one of the things that happens is you track people and then that then it will let you know if people if something goes wrong and their keys change or whatever.  So it's kind of a way of like following them.  Cool. I think it's a neat idea. Back to think up anyway.  So that was that was my most popular tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was your big tweet. So you were you were verifying by tweeting.  OK, so you were getting a bunch of replies or favorites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at Chad got a big tweet. What was that? Yeah, that was that was at the convention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, at PAX.  And I knew that that that was going to have some crazy stuff.  So I ran quickly to think of to think that fun to see some.  Yeah, it was really fun. And I also got a lot more followers like people, a lot of followers, you know, have retweeted and I gained some some more ones.  And it was it was really cool to run over and check think up every day and see what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's also very positive.  It rewards you for whatever Leo Laporte said the past week must have been memorable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, we have that one insight where it's how much you've been talking about yourself.  And it's a it sort of implies that you're a narcissist or an egotist.  And we get a lot of feedback about that because it's kind of out of line with the rest of messages are pretty positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just reminds you to stop using I, me and mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's a positive impact on the did you take that out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We didn't take it out. We did reword.  We added in a few different headlines because each one of these headlines are sort of not not to do the sausage making.  But each of the headlines kind of alternates and not rotate.  So we added in a few others that were both positive and neutral.  And then we still have the but enough about me.  But there actually is when you post this on our blog, I mean, there is some research that shows that people who post status updates about themselves the most get less engagement.  Like it's a lot. People find it a little off putting.  So there is a reason why we pointed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is that your goal a little bit with think ups to make you a better Twitter user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah. Yeah.  The idea is that like these networks give us these amazing superpowers, right?  It's just like technology. Technology gives us these amazing superpowers and you can use them for good or not so good or not use them well at all.  And so, yeah, the idea of ThinkUp is really just to become more mindful about how you spend your time in these networks and what sort of messages you're putting out there and what's happening with your connections and what your impact is.  So when you retweet Dr. Kiki, you know, what does that mean?  Really? That kind of thing.  So it's just it's it's not to get all like woo woo and Zen, but it's it's about sort of mindfulness and awareness.  And it is kind of about behavior change, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's worked because I've tweet a lot more than I did before I started using ThinkUp and I'm constructively.  Yeah, I'm glad you've got a huge audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis replied to Arctic Tony 12 times last week.  We were having a conversation.  Then it says time having good conversation is time well spent.  Thanks, Mom.  And then right below that, it has a big three minutes.  What is the three minutes?  You know, we just we we did sort of an off the cuff estimation of about how long it takes to post a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We guessed about 15 to 20 seconds and we should add them up.  Oh, it's not the aggregate time the conversation.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny.  If you click that link, it takes you right to go to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's kind of a little Easter egg in there.  Oh, my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Neil has buried a goatsealink somewhere in the source code and it passed my code review.  That would be amazing.  He's obfuscated.  It's an obfuscated goatsealink.  It's all in hex.  So you would you won't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that site still around?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even I don't even what are you laughing at, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like it would it would disappear like someone would delete it from the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They delete the goatsealink image from the Internet.  I don't even want to look at you're Googling it.  I don't want to look at your screen.  I actually tried to what I tried to find recently that I couldn't find classic Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, the dude who was like dancing in front of his webcam.  I was a new kid.  The new kid.  You can't it's hard to find because there's so many.  Yeah, that's that's pretty much always.  No, there's goatsealink is not doing goatsealink anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  They've got a Doge address.  They want Dogecoin.  I mean, it was always taking a chance showing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just an image.  Yeah, it used to be just an image.  It wasn't like a URL.  No, it is a URL.  Well, I mean, it could be.  But no, it always wasn't a URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess you know what the SE stands for.  I guess I just didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I just didn't know.  No, no, I guess I experienced it in like Second Life and like other other other instances where it didn't have to be.  It was a URL.  Yeah, I mean, you could do it.  You do it on an image forum.  You do it on.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  There was a site which is no longer goatseeing.  Right.  In fact, it seems like it has an ad.  It says a message from the goatsealoyer.  I think maybe it was taken down.  Should I play this?  It's on YouTube.  It can't be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Turning to goatseed.cx.  I have some good news and some bad news for you about goatseed.cx.  I just got out of a meeting with the goatseed.cx.  I have a feeling there's going to be something.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's something on this.  It's on YouTube, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They couldn't do that on YouTube.  That's a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The goatseed image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He just said handed down by the island of the domain registrar.  Where is cx?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The case simply cannot be taken to a higher court of law.  Because there is no higher court of law.  It was devastated by this news.  Okay, that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, as our chat mods are saying, please do not post links to goatseed in the chat.  What's wrong with you people?  Leave it to the professionals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, so Numa Numa is a while ago.  Now I'm going to look for Numa Numa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you do is you search for original Numa Numa right on YouTube.  Or like that.  If you put original, doesn't that work, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, sometimes.  The thing was that it existed before YouTube.  And so I think Albino Black Sheep is probably the most reputable.  Here's a digitally remastered ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it has an ad for Sharefile on it.  So you know it's good.  Yeah, no, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right, you guys.  It's totally the first result.  It's like the top, the best top of the Google search results.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But see, like this is a this is a rip from some other splash like Dancing Baby.  That was pre YouTube, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to get pulled down because of this song.  I'm just really what's impressive is that you could have a viral video before there was a YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Imagine how much harder that was in the old days.  Kids today, you got it easy.  The Dancing Baby was a was a gift, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so.  Yeah.  The whole idea of the Dancing Baby was it was myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I almost said Jeff.  It's OK.  You say it anyway you want.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Josie.  No, the it's good.  It's high.  It's high.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  The.  It's high.  It's high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's high.  It's high.  It's high.  It's high.  It's high.  The Dancing Baby was a project file on one of some 3D program way, way, way, way back when, like in the in the early 90s or the mid 90s.  And I remember we played it on the site in 1992.  I mean, this is like almost before the Internet.  I remember an alley McBeal, the TV show on Alley McBeal.  Yes, she kept seeing the Dancing Baby dancing baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Is Ali McBeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it but it predates it was it was early 90s.  That's for that to be viral.  I mean, what did you had to send it around on a video on a VCR tape?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How does let me run this DVD over to you?  This floppy disk over to your house.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So go ahead and try to find that on YouTube.  I think there are quite a few dancing babies, but the original I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google search now does public transit directions like right in the search results.  Of course, this works mostly well in big cities like here.  But if I do a search for two four oh nine Fulton Street by train, that's the Brooklyn Shake Shack, by the way.  Google Google search results will know my current location and will tell me that I need to get on the train and go, which is pretty cool.  Right there inside the knowledge graph.  That's cool.  I guess.  That would be considered the knowledge graph and it'll give you different as you can see in a screenshot here to give you different routes, tell you what time you're leaving.  It's pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  Good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I want to go to Shake Shack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now Google knows where you're going.  You know where you are, where you want to go.  Oh, shut up.  Too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want Google to know everything about me so I can get Google Now cards all the time.  You know, it really frosts me as people who complain about Google is invading their privacy and then say and Google Now just really isn't useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on.  You got some numbers, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got one.  I'm going to buy one of my favorite apps in the whole world as ways I depend upon it greatly.  I use it to drive into work.  I think for those of you in New Jersey, the Bridges of the Delaware crowd, the Pulaski Skyway is closed for two years and it's torture.  It's hell.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  So I'm really using Waze now, but it also is a social act.  You share things on it, which I think is really important.  It's how we should think of news.  So there's a feature on them here.  I found just two numbers here, which I found interesting.  There are 80,000 active Waze users around London.  So on that basis, it's enough people to get a lot of really good data.  My other favorite number here.  Pardon me.  I should turn off my microphone.  Is that Waze has a thousand times more map editors than it has employees.  It has one hundred forty thousand volunteer map editors and one hundred forty employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that mean somebody like I mean, I'm a map editor.  You're a map editor.  Every time you see an accident or a cop hiding behind a billboard, you press that button.  I think it's actually trying to fix the map.  Fixing the maps.  Wow. That's even.  Wow. Wow.  Yeah.  That's a lot.  That's a lot.  That's not including the people who report accidents and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because that's so easy to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I would expect every Waze user does that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love Waze.  Especially with stock.  When are we going to see more of it in Google Maps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google owns it.  Let's get into that map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They talk in the story about how they still really are independent to great measure.  Silly.  I don't use Google Maps when I'm driving.  I use Waze.  I use Waze to find stuff, but I use Waze to navigate.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I am a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to Florida.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the Google Maps will tell you to get in the ocean and swim south.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Swim south.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will take with me, I now take with me not only my charger, but I also take with me the  little thing.  I got this great little tiny thing.  You know, the things you used to have to use to plug in a phone to your car, or these huge,  gigantic things that look like those robots.  Yeah.  What I have, I bought the Apple Store.  It's a simple little thing.  It has a rubber thing in the back you put into the vent, and then it has this one little  thing that squeezes out like that, and you put the phone in it, and that's that.  So, I take it with me for rental cars now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because every car has a vent.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you find that's...  I've seen those.  Is it pretty solid?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very solid.  It's so much better than that other kludgy stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the suction cups you put on.  Those are, in fact, those are illegal in many states.  You can't, you know, put something suctioned on the window and all that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if it's illegal in Brooklyn.  Nothing's illegal.  You could put anything you want in your windows in Brooklyn.  You got a problem with that?  Large sugary drinks.  Dingle balls, fuzzy dice, whatever you want up there.  Just decorate those windshields.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Godfather horns.  What is it?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How would that go?  Yeah, it's the song.  It's the song with the Godfather.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  Godfather horns?  Oh, yeah.  See here, it's La Cucaracha, La Cucaracha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My wife is truly freaked when we first moved here.  She was like, Whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a weird.  I want a Godfather horn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, out of the way.  It's good.  It's threatening.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's threatening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the case.  Let me show you my tip and it's really not for everybody.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I've talked a lot about Sonos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We love Sonos here.  We have Sonos everywhere.  It's a wireless sound system and they have a lot of different music things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They finally added Google Play, Music, and they have a lot of different stuff, which  is awesome.  They have a music system, they have a music engine, they have a music player, they have  a music system, and they have a lot of different music things.  They finally added Google Play, Music.  I'm so happy.  Google Play, Music, I guess now it's $10 a month, but $7.99 a month for all the music  in the world, but it also uploads all of your music, so every song I have is on Google Play,  and now I can play it through my wireless speakers.  Plus, Google Play, Music has a really, I think, a very good radio capability.  In fact, I was listening to this the other day.  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame winning songs.  I pumped it to my Sonos, played it throughout the house.  It was so great.  I love it.  So if you have Sonos, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They worked with Google.  Google white listed them.  They're not using the casting protocol.  No, they're doing something interesting.  Yeah, which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On iPhone, you can play any content that's on your iPhone into the Sonos.  You can't yet do that on Android, and I don't know what's holding that up.  That would be nice.  A Sonos looks like a castable device.  I've never tried casting to it, but I see it all the time in all cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, now it's a castable device with this update, right?  Does that make it castable?  Yeah, because in Google Play Music, you tap the cast button.  Is it only play music?  I can't imagine that they would limit it to that.  Oh, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe not.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I think that it is the standard implementation.  I don't know.  I don't have a Sonos, but I think it's the standard.  It's just the cast button that you tap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this one's tied to my Sonos at home.  But yes, so you're in Google Play Music, and you can cast to your Sonos, which is wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Love it.  Hear your neighbors and start playing music now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were rocking out today, and I don't think our neighbors complained.  The peacocks might have minded it.  Friends.  Well, wait a minute.  Pauli Walnuts, Godfather Carhorn, ladies and gentlemen.  Andy Williams does it?  Wait a minute.  No, wait a minute.  Let's Pauli Walnuts, who was on The Godfather.  Let's check this out.  After this ad in four seconds.  An ad for Bitcoin.  Wow, I've never seen that before.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
