Transcript:  You know, that is a new york times publication you east coast elite snob. I I do I do  Well good congratulations on the the new house. What do you do?  What do you use to print your floor plans? Is there some special software we should know about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Y'all I have been playing with software from let me get the name of it, right?  So i've been playing with modz modz modz  modsy  And then i've also been playing with software called icovia  Icovia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh this modz looks pretty sweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So modz is really interesting. It's a venture-backed company in san francisco  And they actually have done a lot of deals with  Companies like I think west elm  Creighton barrel and cb2 and all of those. Oh and wayfair look

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But some companies so like cb2 and I have a lot of pottery barn stuff. I like the pottery barn stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can go to if you go to modsy through one of their sites what you'll do is you'll pay them  49 or 99 and they'll do a room for you. Oh my god. That's good for an interior design. Holy cow  well  caveats here the caveats. Yeah, if you go through one of the  Companies, they're gonna obviously put  Stuff from that company a lot of west elm stuff. Yeah  Yeah  But you get in you get a credit towards merchandise  that pays you back from the design but  They put other stuff in there and there's there's different price categories and it's lovely so  I see my daughter. We're doing my daughter's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is really interesting modsy. So you you haven't decided yet if you're going to use them or their design or you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you just play with it? I use their design for my daughter's room. I'm probably going to also use it for my study  I've been I've been thinking about paint swatches, but this is probably not this week in stacy's interior design

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is perfect for the show because what this is, I mean normally you would hire somebody to come in  and  She it's usually a woman would say well  You know tell me about your vision and she'd do a design interior design for you. It'd be great expense  They have deals just like modsy. They have deals with the  furniture supplies in fact, we have a  Furniture store in town. You can't go in unless you're an interior designer. They won't you know, I don't want  Riff-raff off the street  And uh, and this is this is like a much more I think obviously much more affordable  Way to do it and I bet you it gives you as as good a result  Maybe even better because you have more control over it  I'll tell you in two weeks when they're they're apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Redesigning spaces right now. So hot everybody's in there. They're like, yeah, yeah  This is the contact-free interior design. The other thing we found out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is our we have a second freezer in the refrigerator and the in the garage it died

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You cannot get freezers on any sort  Right  Everything bought out. Is that weird?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, everybody popping their crowd cow meat in there, which by the way good service. Oh wait crowd cow  Look, I'm giving crowd cow  You it's sustainable crowd cow  You it's sustainable or crowd cow cow crowd cow your crowds your crowd sharing a cow  Oh, I see  Um, it's a local  Meat and they they deliver they deliver beef, but they also deliver chicken and other  Fish I was gonna say food  Yes, but it's it it's local is the thing it's  Local and sustainable  Um  I don't know. It's local to us in seattle. Oh, maybe it's local based on your zip code. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me put my zip code in and see  Because the truth is we have a lot of farms in our oh, yeah, so here's the local farms delivering to us kagoshima japan  floorsville, texas  cordova, alaska  Charlottesville, virginia  So it's not that local but okay, this is not small farms small farms  Tenants haba fisherman's co-op tenants haba main  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of cool. So I remember when I was when I was a youngin we went to visit my grandmother  Mabel lee in louis town, illinois and she had a farm. She didn't live on the farm had a farm  And her side of beef that she'd get for her share of the beef from the farm versus the farmer  Would go into augie's meat locker  And we'd go up there on a saturday and say augie  Uh, well, I feel like a few tenderloins can cut those off my beef and augie would cut it off and then  Wrap it up with the best sausages warm sausages over. Thank god. So yeah, you had you had shared community  meat storage

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meat and meat store. I'm sending this link right off to my lovely wife for both mod c and crab cow  Yeah  Well, it's you know nowadays and we're very fortunate. I want to say this is  You know, this is obviously upscale but we're fortunate that we don't have to go shopping that everything can come to us now  you know, yeah, we don't have to go out at all and uh, you know, I i've I hope you all are equally fortunate because  It's scary to go out there now. We we were walking around town last night  It wasn't exactly lake of the ozark  But there were  There you know, there were there were places were open and people were dining and uh, there were really. Yeah. Oh, yeah  People were excited and happy and and you know, it was memorial day and close  And breathing on each other, you know, I think that what they're trying to do and I guess this would be safe  First of all, for instance, there's one restaurant weirdly named ayahuasca  that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go there and throw up i'd be careful about what i'd eat there anyway, they have uh indoors and outdoors  There was no indoor dining was all outdoors and it looked like they had spaced the tables out sufficiently  But the waiters coming to your table there are lots of I mean there were maybe 40 people in a  In the outdoor patio, maybe not that many but there were quite a few 10 tables were filled  so  I don't it makes me i'm just maybe i'm just chicken  I just listen I like that and go let's go home and have dinner. We just I couldn't bring myself to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, i'm i'm i'll get my wife's tool. Let me go to taco bell drive-through. That's shocking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe she likes you jeff and wants you to survive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe she just has good taste

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. There's making my own  So google it's not hard to make a bean burrito. Let's be honest. So bean and cheese burritos

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could probably do pretty close to the yeah, it was taco tuesday yesterday we have uh, you know, we do our taco night  It's not that hard  Google will be reopening offices july 6. That seems a reasonable time frame  However, not everybody will have to come in  Sundar pichai says we're not going to be entirely remote but they have offered workers a thousand dollars  for uh home equipment  Not not specifically computers they all have that but for like furniture, uh home office supplies things like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that enough tell you my well I was gonna say my steel case  So I have a steel case office chair that I love and  I sit in for like 50 hours a week. Um, and that's like a 700  And then my sit stand desk was  I don't know like maybe 500. I can't remember now doesn't seem like that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  It's expensive to get office furniture

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because I mean this is not like going into office depot and buying a chair that you're gonna  you know  curl up in and get

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back problems from I don't know. I have a steel case too. I love it. Actually. It's a really nice chair

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I yeah, it's heavy. Yeah, but good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, and here's a comment on that fox business story by mr. Trump is the best mega  That's awesome. Well done google happy to see american companies doing right by their employees  And then google's founders were jewish. Okay. I'm just gonna stop reading fox business

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like why why are you reading that that's like don't read the comments especially not on fox business news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think i'm hyperventilating now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um  Oh, that's true scooter x points out that lots of chairs are easy to find and or use chairs. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cheap now you can get an aaron. Well used to be in san francisco aaron chairs. You'd find them on the street free  Because all of these startups have gone out of business  um  I expect us and our pachai says I expect us to need physical spaces to get together. I think that that's not  unreasonable uh  While probably many of the engineers and coders  Are perfectly happy to be you know introverts and happy to work at home. There's a lot to be gained from  Collegial exchanges of information  And I think I would bet you we've been talking about this too because we have a lot of workers at home  that in time will maybe like some people maybe can stay home, but we'll have like  Friday everybody will come in  Or something like that. We'll have a lunch date or something like that. So I watched the entire

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Zuckerberg and we'll get ahead of us  But I watched the entire zuckerberg announcement about working because they decided to make the town hall public and I just happened upon  Okay. Yeah, what did he do and and and so it was very interesting because it was very mark very serious  And he was trying to be open about things and some you know, everybody's headline was you move you they're going to lower your pay  But they pay now based on location

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's the set was to me that that they would take an engineer making  $150,000 a year in mountain view and if he moves to boise they'd cut him to 75. That seems so weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was thinking about it today preparatory to the show and and and it wouldn't be hard as ever with facebook  Just just say it differently. Here's the salary for this work, but if you live in a place that's expensive  We will give you more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  More rather than saying we're gonna pay you less. Yeah for people are smart enough to figure that out  I know but these are engineers  Let me because I am very curious  So as someone who's been a remote worker for over a decade and i've worked for three different companies that way  there are  So there are tax implications for workers and I that we're not talking about that  But like for example when I worked for the deal, which was a new york company and even for fortune  When timing was in new york  To avoid paying new york city taxes on my earnings. So state and city taxes  I had to be located in austin for the benefit of my employer  Not just me  So there's some really interesting your choice  Right. They had otherwise I would have to pay taxes. Wow  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Living in the new york freelance taxes are awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was like I do not well. I was a salaried worker, but yeah  So there there no one's really talking about this but I am really interested in how that changes  You know like the internet changed state tax laws, you know how we we've had this big debate and there was this period of fluidity  There are lots of sales tax  Yeah, sales. Sorry. Yes sales tax  There are lots of states who tax workers who tax, you know a company based on their workers  And they will tax you if you're just floating around in idaho because it's fun for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so zuckerman made a big point stacy of saying very he went at some length of saying that  You have to say where you are. There's going to be like an audit of that  This is very serious otherwise you could get in trouble with the taxes  We could get in trouble with the taxes and you have to you know, you can't  Say you're you know, I guess you can't say that you're living in  Um expensive new york when you're actually living in inexpensive maine  Um, and so he made a point of saying that they're going to audit you on that and verify and it's a tax also said  You see, you know, he tried to argue that we may not save money  With this and and I know people are rolling their eyes  But but he had made a few points first in the short term  He said definitely we're gonna you know, if we're gonna fill the 25% and have more space  Our space is very inefficient  But then secondly, he said some people will end up traveling more because back to your point a few minutes ago stacy  Um was that people will or maybe it was your point leo  Um, it was your point leo that people will want to come they'll be expected to come in on a regular basis  Rather than having off sites. They'll have on sites  Yeah, he put it. Yeah, right  But I think I think that will be the case. You'll need to because facebook does off sites constantly  constantly  Um, and so I think that the people's  You might go live in vermont, but you're going to be flying to california a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's that's true, um  when I was  Editing at giga ohm we had to plan an off site and I was in charge of that as the editor  Um and  We were remote first operation. So  Yes, we had people in california, but we had most of our editorial staff was actually in different places around the country  Overall, I think it was cheaper  But yes, my people in and house them but we just turned basically we then turned the diets into retreats  So then everyone just went to a place and you can do room blocks and things to make that less  expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yes  Was it considered a uh benefit or an oh no, i'm gonna go to the damned off site

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know it depends on how we were doing and where the and where the off site is  Yeah, we we used to do them at like caramel a caramel by the sea caramel by the sea. So that was nice  We never went to hawaii, but and we did one in new orleans and that was probably inexpensive but good  Um  And we'd like to I mean it was nice  To see each other because otherwise we didn't ever see each other. We were just all virtual on slack and we were tight  like that's one of the tightest groups of people i've ever worked with but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the tax the tax stuff is really interesting because  This you know, I mean states and localities are very and the federal government for that matter too  Very good at getting their their  Quote fair share of taxes and they know, you know, that's a really interesting issue  I hadn't really thought about it, but i'm sure that there are tax consequences to facebook as well  And and california will want to tax those employees even if they're living in idaho  Because they're working for a california company. It's complicated  Yeah, it's complicated. It was no fun  And you know, i've been seeing ads. I don't know if you've seen these you know, you haven't because you're not california  But there are ads all the time  Uh on cnn and other channels  To fight the california freelance law. They have an area. Yeah, there's a woman who uh, she said i'm a real estate agent  but I but I deliver for door dash and uh, and or uber eats or somebody a grub hub and uh,  It's great because I can set my own hours and uh, and then a tight close-up in dramatic music  And in this time, this is the only way I can make money  And the california state legislature has decided I don't deserve to have this freelance job  And then there's a big long disclaimer at the end paid for by uber grub hub door dash  And uh, I don't know what I don't know if there's a petition or they're going to do a ballot  I would suspect they're going to try a ballot initiative  Uh to to it's terrible for the news businesses. Yeah  Well, we you know ant pruett we hired a guy  Uh, who was a freelancer for tech republic  He was living in north carolina when he moved here to california tech republic said i'm sorry  We can't use you anymore because this california freelancer's law

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, because he was in california. He was all right. Yes, but you hire is ant not he's full-time for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he also had another sidekick. He wanted to freelance for tech republic. Oh, okay. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought all of us I was like, oh no, this is the worst way to find out this so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What that he's not that he's not working for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's what I thought. I thought you were trying to obliquely reference. No, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's an employee and that's you know, we're in california. We play he pays california state taxes because he's in california  But I guess he was I don't know if he was filing more than the 35 articles a month or what it was or maybe just  My my sense. I don't know  But I mean the tech republic loves ant as we all do my sense is they just didn't want to deal with the the mess  The california created  Kentucky

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, so they have wow  So as as someone who hires  Well, okay the mayor phrase said I don't hire freelancers. I have I have kevin as a contractor  The way that  Employment law is structured is really hard for small businesses, especially if you're hiring someone from another state. Oh, I know  and as a  When I want to hire people like or like pay freelancers for things  Luckily, I i'm not impacted by anyone's i'm too small of a job for those people but like I totally believe in paying  good rates for my writers because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, and i'm sure tech republic was paying him well, but the california freelance law has nothing to do with how much you're getting paid  It doesn't refer to that at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's no I know but a lot of them a lot of them paid like I mean it can't go  Oh, I was so embarrassed to quote our rates to people. It was horrifying. No, I know that yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's what what's the doctor morpheus in chat says? Oh, so tech republic was exploiting him. I don't I don't think so  Uh, and that's the issue and that's the same issue with this woman the real estate agent who's driving delivery for grubhub  If the worker doesn't consider themselves exploited they say for various reasons. I want this freelance job. I don't want a real job  You know, maybe her spouse has the health insurance  And she likes to set her own hours you could think of lots of reasons why that'd be legit  Why should the state of california assume i'm being exploited?  And i've talked to tons every time i'm in uber

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't make laws around individuals who happen to be at the  I don't want to say protected who are less at risk. You don't you make laws to protect people  That are falling through the cracks that are at risk. Absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're making those laws was to protect uber drivers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean uber right it's to protect people who don't have access to health insurance and who are being exploited  The fact that this one poor woman who may or may not even be real  feels  Pissed off because she happens to be in a great position  well good for her, but she has to recognize that there are a lot of people who  Aren't and if we don't fix this at a  bigger level at a state level  Then you  Then those people continue to fall through the cracks and we're stuck where we are today, which is not awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, that's fair. But what do you do about the harms that that creates?  For a whole class of people like say, uh freelance writers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  though, so those should be addressed individually in the law or  Maybe you look at those harms and you say well, here's here's what we're trying to do either  We adjust the law or it forces people to  To adapt I mean forces companies to adapt in that space or they say we don't want to hire anyone from california  And then a bunch of freelancers leave california  Yeah, well, that's a risk too, right? I mean laws are always it's always a trade-off, right? It's always gonna piss someone off

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  In fact the thing that really pissed people off. Okay. First of all, these ad campaigns are paid for by uber and lift  So  So it pissed them off and and rightly so because it was to protect their workers who are gig workers and are not given  the courtesy of real jobs, however  They did in the law make exemptions for just kind of randomly for certain jobs like they attempted to address the harms  But they left out journalists. So yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because the journalists don't have great lobbying power apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my real problem is it all has comes down the publishers do the journalists don't well, there you go  Now meanwhile, let's go to switzerland  Uh the land of this of the what is that the land of I don't chocolate chocolate cows cows watches  The german language  Taj's anziger i'm sure jeff would do that better  Tagus anziger anziger tagus anziger reports that switzerland's top court has ruled  Employers are required to contribute to employees rent payments if they're working from home  I mean honestly  What we have we do in fact do this we don't pay their rent, but we help pay our employees internet  We actually have a stipend for them. That's good of you to cover  Additional expenses that they may incur because they're working from home plus that's our fair share now  We didn't think about helping them with the rent  We didn't go that far  Uh, I mean they still got to live  You know, even if they come I don't know what we should I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they they didn't they didn't change their situation because they're working at home except you wanted to have good access  I mean the problem with the like way way way way way back  I'm old enough to remember when you could uh charge for some space at home off your taxes and not go to jail for it  Yeah, you could still do that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey do you do it?  Um, I used to now it's my own company  So it's a little bit different but when I worked for a company at their behest in a dedicated office with a door  Where it was only used for work? Yes. Yeah, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you and you what you do is you like that square footage off the total cost of your home square footage  That's fair. I think that's fair and that's it's an audit flag  Is it it is an audit? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I never I never got audited never never got audited  Always knock wood stacey. No one's gonna get audited now. There's not even anybody home anymore  awkward  Lisa renewed we renewed lisa.

We got the passport  Oh, they still have his birth certificate social security number and she's been calling and ready. There's nobody there  They're all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's crazy as they say unprecedented times

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These are unprecedented times but it is kind of hard if you're 17 years old  You don't have a social security number to take you get your first job. I mean she hasn't has a number doesn't have a card  So now she has to go get a new card  Google's ceo gave everybody a day off  So that you could become the best version of yourself  A well-deserved day off he sent an email  To his staff, I know many of us have been running hard non-stop for a weeks now  And it may be he was he was even even he has got the covids  Uh and may be experiencing some burnout. So I used tgif a company-wide meeting as a chance to announce an official day off  On may 22nd take the time to do whatever you need to do to prioritize your well-being  So there  That is a nice thing to do

Transcript:  Like that. Thank you sundar. In fact, i'm gonna take this show off

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, i'm like well wait, I have  Now it's like we have things to talk about. Oh good like google. Hey, let's talk about google  All right. Oh we have been actually I lied. I I just got so engrossed in the conversation about remote  We had a point it related

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we were supposed to get we talked about this last last week  We were supposed to get our pixel 4a's at google io two weeks ago  Obviously, there was no google ios. No pixel 4a's now john proser  Who has become the go-to rumor monger?  He says it was originally the pixel 4a was originally made then pushed to june. It's now pushed again  They will come in just black and barely blue. It doesn't sound good  Sounds baby sounds like an snm punk band current plan for announcement july 13th  No 5g  Seems like they're ready to ship the decision is mostly based on market analysis  So they want the stores open again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe  How many people go into a store to buy their google phone? I just feel like everyone opposite online

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think us google people don't but yeah, but to find somebody who's not a google person  They've got to see iPhones  I mean is google really going to convince those people well that that's why they're there instead of buying a motorola phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want it when the person comes and doesn't have a strong prejudice one or the other to the verizon store and says  I need to get a phone  And there is sitting next to the iphone a pixel 4 at a good price  Or 4a I guess not a 4  In barely blue in barely blue and just black and blue  and uh  Doesn't seem good. Uh, and then uh, you want it to be sitting there because honestly  I know we all order them online  But but I think the vast majority of phones you have to be in a phone store  I know that because why the huawei representative when I asked well, you could sell them direct you just because  We lost the verizon cutter. She said there's no point in marketing or doing anything else  For a cell phone in the u.s. Unless you're in stores. There's just no point you won't sell any  And uh, and I think that's probably true. I think that that's one of the reasons that's one of the things that killed  Microsoft's phone ambitions is that even though they could get them into the stores  They were always in the back and the store employee would never say oh, yeah  We got this microsoft phone maybe be interested in that no  And that really killed it killed a very expensive business for microsoft  So I think that that's the market analysis as we want. I think you're exactly right  Actually, let's see what android central says  uh  Andrew mart tonic  What here's why google is delaying?  Well us consumers spending in marches down by seven and a half percent  Uh economic impacts amazon pushing its annual prime day from july to september  Uh google's hardware business  Is insignificant so there's no scramble to get the pixel 4 out and start making money on it  To put it simply google can afford to wait another month the optics of a slow launch  Are in some ways more damaging than a whole month of lost sales on the balance sheet that makes sense  Yeah, it's like having it's like don't open a movie today because you'll have the first weekend sales will be bad and then  You sink without a trace

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we think that things are going to get better by fall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We live we all live in hope don't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I mean, honestly I sit here and I i'm like, I don't know. I'm really thinking about this because i'm like, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, well, you know who's really thinking and i'm sure this one of the reasons you're thinking about it  What do you do with the kids? Are they going back to school in september?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes by uh here where i'm at they're looking at  All the way back which no one actually thinks is possible and they say that  Or all the way remote or some weird hybrid and everyone's pretty much going for weird hybrid  I mean, it's like where like  there's variations on like  a certain percentage of kids will go back to their classes and then  They'll do online like  You'll be in the building for some amount of time and then online the other time while other percentages of kids are in the building

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that makes sense at 25 percent of the time and that way they could separate them out. Yeah, that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's one option and then the other option is  Have them come back some of the time  And do something like that but also recognize that we're going to have to shut things down again periodically as cases rise

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The truth is we have no idea  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I don't think I mean anybody who's looking at this and says hey  We're going to open the economy back up in it's all going to be hunky dory  I mean we  We've lost is it 25 percent of jobs or 20 percent of jobs now  I can't even remember where we're at but like those people aren't going to be buying new things  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And how many of them will be going back to work? I mean a lot of these businesses are gone  Yeah, and that's just gone they're not coming back  It's scared I mean it's really scary half of all of hurts's employees have been fired

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some huge number. There's 14. I had no idea hurts was in bad shape before

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh my gosh, they're like a financial engineering

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wonderkin, well, that's the thing what you're going to also see is all of these heavily leveraged companies and that oh, yeah retail  Especially are just they have no resiliency  So it's just gonna go boing  a lot of newspapers too, yeah  The hurts had 24 billion dollars in debt before  covid

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I do like what is this going to do to private equity and I used to cover private equity, right?  So i'm not like I don't think it's evil  The my my knee-jerk reaction isn't private equity is evil  However, the way that it's been handled from a financial engineering perspective of the last 20 years or so  It's definitely skirted like the edge of you're definitely pushing a business to the edge and  You know if they teeter off, that's all right. It's not your responsibility. I'm ignorant on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're the expert someone is it the fact that they're so highly leveraged. There's so much debt. Is that the problem?  so what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yes, the leverage is hard, but two they go in and they they they  Bring out a bunch of debt, but they also pull a lot of the cash out of the business  So there's there's the two it's the two things happening at once  and what happens is you're running it is optimized and with this narrow a  Ability to to not fail resiliency. It's you're taking away all of their resiliency. It's the equivalent of just-in-time manufacturing  Yes, or just living. I mean it's paid. It's living paycheck to paycheck

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which in good times when there are no  bumps in the road  is sensible because  You're you're very efficient  I don't think it's ever sensible. Oh really because good times are never gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know there's gonna be a bump in the road. Yeah, right. They're called good times for a reason people. It's not normal times

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now so leveraging  I  Just want to say I want to add your list, right? So they in the case of newspapers the hedgies  Sell hard assets. They sell the real estate. They sell their machines. They sell them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They um, that's the chance out that's the chainsaw al dunlap dunlap approach which is you buy a business sell it off for parts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, then you pull cash flow out which newspapers still have  And then the real killer is you don't invest right? Obviously, but in terms of trying to think  Oh, how can we save this business in a new reality?  Well, if you don't invest in rnd, you're not going to get anywhere and nobody is so those things mean  And so every major newspaper chain in the u.s is now controlled by hedge funds or families that have had it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So  Again i'll go to the business reporter here  How can you call that good business in any sense? It's not well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so it it gets to the fact that in the last 50 years we have stopped  And this this even ties back to if you want to say mark andresens we need to build right?  We have moved from a nation that is focused on building hard assets  To a nation that is really good at financial engineering a nation of value extractors

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I mean we're we're strip mining the united states economy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, and there is value in hedge funds so prior to probably the  Late 80s, I guess when we started getting into like  A hedge fund actually like they would take a family business and if the family didn't want it anymore like some the younger  Heirs said yeah, i'm not into this they could sell it  Get out of the business and hedge funds would do things like, you know, create roll-ups maybe  or  Build help build that business for a while and then resell it to somebody who it made sense to sell it to right?  They were adding value  In a way that now they're just basically extracting cash  so  Yeah  Strip mining is probably

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but but all right the heartless the heartless business person says some businesses deserve to go away  And i'm not saying which ones they are i'm not saying but they but they they are past their prime  So I just wrote a post  I wrote a piece for tortoise a week ago or two weeks ago  Which I went through all the ways were screwed in the news business  And revenue stream by revenue stream  And in the post I just wrote I said, okay, here's some sprouts from the ashes. It's got to burn down  And we're not going to recreate what we had  And we're going to build things that are new and they're coming in small ways. There's village media, which which  Google and richard jenner's love for good reason out of canada that runs good  basic local  Businesses there's a company in norway  Don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree with you jeff but hedge funds aren't picking their businesses based on things that deserve to fail, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right, right well  What they are doing stacy is there is they're buying distressed debt?  And the debt is distressed for a reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not always so not always some of the distress debt that they're picking up is from prior sales  prior hedge fund investment, so I mean  Yes, there are businesses that should be failed but or should fail one could take an analogy though and say that  there are  There are businesses that were pushed to a place where they couldn't actually make the investments they needed to make absolutely  And part of the reason they're not making those investments is because  wall street is rewarding the financial engineering and the quick  extraction of cash so  An investment does take time. It takes time. It takes money look at like it in their ways the government can actually  Encourage people to go back to that like, you know aren't it?  Making it more tax efficient to invest in r&d as opposed to you know, shareholder buybacks  There  Yeah, go ahead would you invest in jc penny?  No, but jc penny has been on the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the edge of the  Edge since like the 90s. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So at some point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it wasn't the internet. Sorry for everybody has a job there. I'm sorry for the people that are paying rent, too  I'm sorry for their suppliers  But jc penny has not been a going concern as you just said for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But jc penny was optimizing for cash extraction had jc penny been working  had the market rewarded  investment and things and  They could have done it and what will actually be really interesting is in the last  Say five years  Companies in the retail space that have been investing right? So actual forward-thinking companies have actually been investing in  Experiences in the store. So you think like it's a foray you could get like  You buy stuff there and you get the hydra facial and you go in and it's amazing or you go into like sacks  And there's the spa so high touch retail experiences has been the new thing with covet. That's all changing  So rapidly so suddenly  Do those companies should they go out of business because of this even if they were like, let's say they're all reasonably managed, right?  They're not on the they've got resiliency. Do you think that?  This sort of event means they should  Go out of business or what do you think should happen to those? You're right. You're right. I should not have used

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I complain on the other side that there's no business plan has ever built on the verb should either way  Right newspapers saying people should pay us only if you're worthwhile neither should you say a company should die  So I I retract the use of the verb  But what i'm saying is some are all but hopeless  and so it's hard to expect anything but  leeching them of their last cash and their real estate leases and such and so that's what  I worked with a guy in our business  Who warned me and I was on an advisory board from the beginning hedges will do what hedges will do  It will buy distress. They will get rid of stuff. They will do this stuff, right and  and  They're like a lot, you know, you might feel sorry for the gazelle, but the lions eat gazelles and that's what they do  And so we have to recognize that reality  So, yes, I retract my bro, do you think it's a structural flaw in our economic system or it's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, if you look at like use the lion and gazelle, right? Yeah, we have  Way more lions right now than we have gazelles and right now we're in a in a wildlife ecosystem  that  That gives the advantages to the lions in ways that maybe nature doesn't normally do  And this is we can only take this so far the lions like well in my backyard I have more deer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me wolves and the deers are eating my shrubs. So I just wanted to say that but let me just stretch the analogy a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lions have to be careful if they eat all the gazelles  They're going to die themselves  And i've always wondered why this you know this uh, I I think I don't think it's unfair to say this predatory capitalism  Doesn't understand that you can't keep doing this forever or are they just so short-sighted that  They just go well i'm gonna eat until I get mine

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because the government the government in some ways bails them out. They still have their preferred tax treatment  I mean there's too big to fail  Yeah, there's a lot happening here that i'm kind of like and and look at now at how the government is like totally stripped  you know the the the agencies in place that were put in place to help kind of  uh, yeah, the consumer  Protection board the uh, yes. Thank you that I was like god that consumer something something something

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's big things. But yes, but I think that's clear. Uh, but but it's also  It's self-reinforcing because the reason  things like the consumer protection board go away is because  These people got so wealthy that they could buy essentially buy off congress to  Make tax laws in their favor lies the problem and and so it's self-reinforcing  They they get more and more successful and then the the the bonds are released and they can get more and more successful  And what you get is massive income inequality  What you get is a situation where you are very unresilient  Where you have a nation where not only have individuals not saved money, but companies haven't saved money  Nobody's prepared for the rainy day the rainy day came and all the roofs are caving in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So who could have predicted well, obviously some people did predict this but as a manager  I would defend a company for saying  How could you have planned for every exigency?  of  This you'd been you've been killed by your stockholders if you just held cash in reserve, but stacy you were raising your hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think you could have you can plan? I mean so and this is really an interesting thing  So remember when michael dell took dell private?  Um the reason one of the reasons he did that is because he felt like this was a time where things were changing  And he wanted to make those investments  um  It's also partly my fault

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh you you talked michael dell into that. No, I I caused dell hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What we talked about this dell hell what's dell hell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't you don't oh, we never talked about this. Well, we might have I don't have much of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've been doing this for years now in the early days of blogging. I complained  I'm sorry. I just tasty. I wasn't trying to interrupt you. I was uh, go ahead and finish finish

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to take credit for michael dell's going. Well, no, I get blamed for it by the way  Michael dell took dell private, but then didn't he then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He took it back public. Yes go public again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I he came back to the company. It feels like it was a manipul a financial man. I mean, I don't know  I'm looking at the distance. It wasn't well. I mean, yes there were

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he took it private because he wanted to focus without the short term. Yeah  He wanted to focus on things. He ended up selling off parts that had been acquired  And in there  I'm not saying  That all public finances or finance is bad, right? There is a big role for capital and they deserve to make  You know money for taking on extreme risk. I am by no means against that. However  We have become so short-sighted and what I like to think of is we have optimized  far too much for  short-term returns and it makes it very difficult to build  Anything that makes it difficult to build resiliency. It makes it difficult to invest in r&d  And is warren buffett the counter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes I mean he does well talking about it. He sold off his newspapers when he gave up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He does act though that like a value investor like i'm not trying to make a quick buck  I'm investing in the company because of its fundings. I know dairy queen and it's yeah dairy queen and it's a valuable  Uh company and I feel the value will go off and he's done very well  Uh out of it. I don't know. I you know, if I knew anything about this i'd be rich

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I clearly don't well in the benefit of the market, I mean the benefit one of the challenges here is  You will all if you are taking a long term versus a short-term company  Right now you are going to make bank as a short-term investor, right?  You you will never lose playing to the lowest common denominator, right? The problem is you're going to look around one day  And this is where we kind of I feel like this is where we are. You're  You're all at the lowest common denominator like well crap, how do we get here?  And then how do we build value going forward?  and that's  If we're not already there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're close. I sold all my stocks. I'm in just sitting with a  Pile of cash in my retirement fund because I don't know what the hell is going to happen and I don't want to write it down  And I know it's going up and everybody's looking, you know, elisa saying go on. What do you what did you do that for?  I don't know. Actually she did it first. She did it in january, which was very smart

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I mean, I don't know if keeping your money in your mattress is a great way to go  I mean you're older. So yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean i'm so old that if I don't do that, I could be bankrupt before I have a chance to make  I'm worried too, but I also the taxes I would pay right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I sold everything would be horrendous, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so and that's that's part of I mean and that's part of this is like

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think we have divorced

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Real risk like actual risk in a lot of cases from the value that people are paid for also taking on that risk  and part of that is because you know, we've we've gone to like securitization of assets, which means  The original risk just gets passed up and down the chain for like a few more basis points, right? And  That's not sustainable  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if we have those complicated derivatives that all the my financial and math wizards who got out of  Harvard and mit with their math degrees instead of going to work. Well, that's why hurts is bankrupt  Yeah, they went to wall street and they created a bunch of derivatives  And no one knows how the hell is they work

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know how they work  Except stacey. Thank god. I'm like i'm like as a former bond reporter. I know how to know i'm glad you're here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't take any response. I am not I have take no responsibility at all. Just like the president.

Yeah, we already mentioned that uh  Prime day is moving to september so to you know, gives you time to save up some money  Here is um  No, i'm not gonna do that, uh  That's too depressing um  Apple's i'm sorry amazon's local podcast play

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's a podcast story. So they're trying to get I don't understand this  They want to do like local sports and things. They also want new content for their devices  So it's not just podcast it's also and then there's also an internal fight  That apparently audible wants the podcast but other parts of amazon want the podcast so they think podcasts are hot  I could see us be you know all here working for bezos. Oh, oh they're using the alexa fund

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is a venture arm tied to voice innovation to invest in local podcast companies  localized  Yeah, well localized news localized sports  News localized sports  They want to explore short-form audio content that can be surfaced when users ask echo for information about topics like news and sports  You know, i've actually experienced this there's an echo game. You could play the question of the day. It's a trivia question  I started doing it and  There's a podcast about the question of the day. They call it a podcast  And it plays automatically after you ask the question of the day. You actually have to take steps to stop it  It does not sound awesome  but it's but it shows that what they're really looking for is  Audio content to come out of the echo that's associated with what you're asking about for instance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think they would make it exclusive to the echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, why not? Sure  If it's local especially right because the echo knows where you are. This is one thing podcasts right now don't have a very good  Local story. It's one thing radio did for years. In fact, the best radio  I always thought was live local, you know, we're in your town talking about the stuff you care about  And uh podcasting could do it. I've always thought a way of doing it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know one thing i've wanted I I I tried to write business plans for this years ago and never went anywhere like any of mine  but um  Uh, so chicago city bureau trains citizens to go out and cover meetings do things like that  If you if you brought me an edit a half hour edit of the best bits of the school board meeting  In my town i'd listen  Yeah, you are the only one it has to be curated heavily. It's a lot of busy bodies a lot of busy  Yeah, you got to edit it  Make it five. That's a long time five hour meeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I know I so I watch  Three hour meetings online of my city council meetings because I find them  Fabulously entertaining you two are peeing. Oh god, you're here you go  Oh  Oh, I should totally make that into a podcast. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  see  Trademark jeff jarvis now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's called hyper hyper person. You always talk about hyper local news hyper personalized audio content  According to a person familiar with amazon's plans. Now. Here's what axios is saying local advertising local which is it would  Attract local advertising right you'd have bill's bagel shop and you know the donut store on the corner local advertising is a  150 billion dollar market totally dominated by local radio, right?  But amazon this is also why

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why facebook started the stores and this is why I wrote in that post where I put up a friend link so you can get to it  um  about village media so village media  can  Haul in million and a half bucks in local revenue for a local blog  With a few employees, you know, I want to dispute this line in the axios story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where they say it's reported that audible's efforts to invest in more original podcast shows with celebrities have confused podcast producers  Due to the fact that amazon music also has plans to distribute podcasts. I just want to say I am not confused  Just just gonna figure that out. I figured I could I could tell the difference. I understand  um, so spotify  Apple's rumor to be working on not only turning news plus into audio shows, but but actually starting a podcast division  It's so interesting how when a category gets hot  Everybody just jumps in  And I can't get a dollar fifty for this show. So I don't understand it myself  Spotify said last week it signed an exclusive deal. Yeah, that's the joe rogan deal apple wants to  create original podcasts  And this because more than one third of americans listen to podcasts every month  but  And i'll vouch for this ad revenue for podcast is still tiny compared to other mediums  That's because according to ben thompson who ought to know podcast monetization is currently too decentralized

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you listen to ben's podcast? No, he just launched another one, didn't he? Yeah, he doesn't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He doesn't know what he's talking about. But okay fine  There believe me. It's not decentralized spotify's big time investments could help centralize monetization for the genre. Yes, that's a problem  centralize it in spotify's pocket  Apple has the largest portion of podcast listeners and that's also somewhat inaccurate  Almost half of podcast listeners use itunes. It doesn't mean apple has them  Right. It's a big difference. It's not it's not a publisher. It's just a directory. So  Anyway, yeah  Anyway, anyway, okay someday podcasts are going to be huge and you will have been you could say  Not you won't be saying i'm the del hel guy anymore. You'll say i'm the guy  That started podcasting you could say that  How many years we've been doing this one? I don't know way too long

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  568 episodes don't get him sad and bitter almost 11 years jeff almost 11 years

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, i'm not i've never been sad and bitter the company. No, no you  This one this is the 560 first episode  Jesus even if we had 50 a year 52 a year. You gotta be sick of me. Oh, yeah. Yeah, i'm sick of me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it is kind of amazing that we've been 560 times four hours each is a lot of fun hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, these are not four hours long. They just feel maybe they used to be with stacy. No, no, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's never it's actually gotten longer. It's gotten longer. Yeah  What let's make it short again, you know what I I now now that I know that joe rogan  100 millionaire joe rogan's podcast  averages more than three hours

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're heading for four today stacy. I don't feel guilty at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I only had soup and bread. No, no, no, i'm gonna need more food. No, we're gonna be done in a minute  I'm not hungry yet. We're fine. Do we care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That twitter is finally is labeling  By the way, they didn't label trump's tweets about  Joe scarborough's assistant being murdered which were blatantly bizarre and wrong  But they did label his tweet saying  Email voting is bound to be filled with fraud, which I think is less provably wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But for the first time twitter is going to kind of did the next one  There was there was the furor right they didn't want to letter and they kind of picked the next one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is that how it works? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we missed that and they've said that anything that's about facebook twitter both said anything that is defrauding people about elections  Is bad so they could they could jump on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is what you see and I don't follow trump on twitter, obviously  But you'd get a big fact check label get the facts about mail-in ballots

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't even some people said that may look like twitter is agreeing with trin right. It doesn't look like it's disagreeing  Yeah, that's not that's not saying and then the right wing has gone that trump's threatening to shut down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, he says that's it. We're gonna put them out of business if they don't fix their bias

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, the right wing is picking on individual twitter employees whom I know  Uh and i'm finding any of their tweets that are anti trump and you're saying this proves of course  And don't they see the irony here as they're complaining about their freedom of speech being impinged upon  But then they're going after anyone else's freedom of speech

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, but the irony are you kidding?  Yeah, I know. I know are you kidding?  Um half the twitter accounts pushing to reopen america are bots

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the only problem with that to my mind is how media thinks that oh my god america wants to reopen and and they've got  You know 500 people on the street in an entire state and bots used as their as their uh basis  200 million tweets discussing covet 19. This is from carnegie melon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They analyzed them, uh  Half the accounts including 62 of the 1000 most influential retweeters appeared to be bots  Non not real people. They're automated  Retweeters who makes these bots do we know?  Russia

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this is what business insider says there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  China  There are a few possible like I don't know that's no we don't know there are few possible explanations for the surge in bot activity  People may have more time to set up elaborate bot networks during stay-at-home orders. I think that is true  Uh, the availability of botnets for hire has exploded recently. That's the problem  You can't tell if it's somebody trying to destabilize the u.s  If it's if it's just a bunch of weirdos  If it's if it's just a bunch of weirdos  You just don't know could be bread. I can't because I don't run by brad parscale. I don't see them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How come you don't see them because I follow people I like and no  That's that's the problem. Oh somewhere on twitter. There's a bot. Yes, there is somewhere on twitter  Yes, but a lot of people retweet the bots

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see bots because people who I follow for their technical or some other acumen also tend to retweet those things  So they are out there jeff. Well, that's a larger problem then  Well, yeah, I think that's the issue for people. It's not that they're  It's not just that the bots exist  It's that people who maybe like my journalist friends do not retweet bots  but the people I follow in like cloud computing or maybe in the security space or  Corgi space very big bot retweeters. What is that true? Really?  Oh, yeah, those are like normal people who like bring normal people are the problem because they yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I see that once I got went back to facebook. I see that a lot of facebook which is  Normal users don't aren't really distinguishing between you know anything they just you know, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Share that share that share that  I think life would be better without twitter, but that's just me  Uh, I know neither of you agree with me i'm the only one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we going to talk about true crime again? No, no, we're not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to talk about the fabulous fabulous ruling  uh from john, uh  coffiner  Of the u.s district court in seattle  And it goes back to a arrest in may 2019  In washington state  A guy was indicted on several charges related to robbery and assault. He was using a motorola smartphone  When he was arrested he says one of the officers present hit the power button  To bring up the phone's lock screen  The filing doesn't say that any officer present attempted to unlock the phone or make the suspect do the same  Uh in february 2020 the fbi also turned the phone on to take a photograph of the phone's lock screen  Which displayed the name streazy on it  The lawyer for the uh defendant filed a motion arguing this evidence should not have been sought without a warrant and should be suppressed  In other words is they didn't unlock the phone. They just looked at the lock screen  Is that evidence that requires a warrant the district judge said yes  Really? Yes  The judge determined police looking at the phone at the time of the arrest and the fbi looking at it again  Are two separate issues police are allowed to conduct searches without search warrants under special circumstances. That's probable cause, right?  Uh and looking at the phone's lock screen may have been permissible as it took place either incident to a lawful arrest  Or as part of the police's efforts to inventory the personal effects  So and he then did say I want to he asked the police  To see if their search of the phone fell within those boundaries. So he didn't give them a complete pass  But he said there are circumstances. That's part of the normal process  But he said the fbi's actions crystal clear encountered the defendant's fourth amendment rights  The judge ruled fbi physically intruded on mr  On the defendant's personal effects when the fbi powered on his phone to take a picture of the lock screen. That is a search  The fbi did not have a warrant it was unconstitutional

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good decision will last

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem. Uh, you know, it's just one court u.s district court in seattle  Uh, is it a precedent?  I don't know necessarily if it is it can be certainly brought up in other cases, but I don't know if it's binding  I know it's not binding

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's binding if you know people try to refer to it or if it gets appealed and goes higher up and then they change it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it would have to be appealed before it would become uh binding  I I as I don't know a lawyer. What am I saying? I don't know  I don't know

Transcript:  And that my friends  Is the google changelog?  We've done our duty my friends now it's time for me to tell you about express vp and your home  oh, oh, I am so mad at the united states congress in the rea in the  in the authorization for the patriot act  You know they tried to put in  a amendment to it that said the fbi  Can't just go looking at your internet history without a warrant that failed in the senate with by one vote  I think that's going to fail in the house, too  The fbi is going to be able to just go to your internet service provider and say I want to see everything  Stacey's been up to for the last  As long as she's been a customer and they'll just hand it over no warrant. No nothing  If ever there was a time to start using a vpn at home, I know you're thinking well  I don't go out anymore. I don't need a vpn. I'm a member at a coffee shop  You might want to be using it at home  But let me tell you something if you're going to use a vpn  It's got to be fast, right? You don't want to feel like you're suffering because you're using a vpn and maybe more importantly  Whatever privacy issues you're concerned about with your isp. You're just kicking the can down the road that new vpn provider  They're going to see everything you're doing too. So you got to pick a vpn  with a good  Privacy policy that's why I use express vpn. By the way, the privacy policy has been verified by independent third-party audits  They even went so far as to create a new kind of vpn server. They call it trusted server  That when you you go to express vpn, you can do it in your phone  iPhone android you can do it on the computer. You can do it in a lot of places tv  When you press that big button that turns on the vpn  It spins up the trusted server at that vpn location just for you. That's yours  It runs in memory and only in memory and it's sandboxed. It cannot write to hard drive. And then the minute you leave it's gone. It's like  Footprints in the sands of time. It just your presence is not recorded. That means express vpn  Not only do they not log your information. They can't  And I think that's really important  Not only can the fbi get it but your isp can legally sell information about your internet visits to ad companies and most of them do  Express vpn does not  Plus they secure your browsing they secure your internet traffic  That's what a vpn does and if you think oh, don't worry. I use incognito mode incognito mode does not hide your surfs  Surfing history from your internet service provider  They can still see every website you've ever visited  When you're home  When you're about now, you should always use express vpn. It's fast. It's easy  They have servers all over the world 90 plus countries, which means you can use  Express vpn to be in england  For instance if you want to use the english netflix and watch your doctor who series or japan if you want to watch anime series  It's pretty cool  Protect your online activity today  With the number one vpn not only not just me cnet and wire degree express  Vpn and we've got a great deal for you less than seven bucks a month now. I know you say well  I get it for free. No, no, no, no a free vpn service is worse than your isp  They've got to monetize you somehow. That means they they are watching you they're even injecting ads into your stream all sorts of stuff  Use the best  It's not expensive and believe me. It's worth it express vpn.com slash twig  The best deal you get a three months free when you sign up for a year express vpn.com  slash  Twig these guys are the best. That's what I use. That's what I recommend everybody use express vpn.com slash twig  Thank you express vpn  Taco bell is going to be an advertiser  With quibi. Oh, no, they already are but they don't want to pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you buy hbo a la carte with their hbo now program it will convert to max probably already has  So it's the same price you're you're just gonna get so that's for people who buy it  I buy hbo I I do with my cable company, but we don't get it. No  No, that's it pisses me off unless you're with spectrum  Are you with spectrum?  No  Uh some cable companies at and t  Are you with at and t?  i'm in the files  Verizon  So this is the problem is that many people are getting it for free because of  Side deals like at and t is getting it for free spectrum, which is another cable company owns hbo max now  Oh, yeah, that's right. They're all warner hbo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then I bought the super killer mondo at and t on my android phone, but I can't get it there  Oh, you should no no no no if you have an at and t phone.

Oh, yeah  You're right, it might be another quibi the thing is the difference is nobody wants to watch anything on quibi  HBO max because they're owned by warner, which is owned by ntt. They have a lot of content  And they have all the hbo content. I mean  I you know what? I I think this is where the value would lie if you cut the cord  You got rid of your cable television and you bought hbo max  Over the top and maybe netflix and one or two other things over the top  And then you might be happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not paying for a lot of things. I'm trying to remember so amazon prime. Am I paying for it? No sort of so  That's one hulu  I'm paying for it netflix paying for it disney plus not paying for it because it came with verizon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do have hbo  Oh, well, why do you want hbo max again? No, because it has programming hbo doesn't pass  That's what's so absurd about this. So cancel normal hbo and get this hbo. Is it the same price?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, that's not probably not because trying to cancel it. I got a package on file  You probably can't just cancel it. Oh you're on file

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So because I just I just buy these things through amazon and like if I want to watch a show  I just subscribe for a month for like and then I cancel at the end of the month, right? It's very easy

I think it's important for you to understand is if the cat were a little bit bigger  It would eat you  That's probable but because it's so small you're fine it could still bite you I mean I  No, no, no, no, the cats aren't stupid. They're not going to bite you  Unless they can eat you  But honestly if if the cat were a bigger cat it would just eat you  Okay, yeah, that's fair. Yeah, but they're just they're not dumb  They're just you know, i'm not gonna bite you for no reason. What's the there's no percentage in that  Do you have a thing this week mrs. Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. Um, it is across the room. So hold on one second

Transcript:  The only thing I won't worry about if I were stacey because she has all those bluetooth gadgets  We talked about it yesterday on security now. There's a new bluetooth attack  Called bias. All right, that means bluetooth is  Forever broken and insecure  What nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I missed whatever is this whatever downside to bluetooth there is happening. No point worrying about it at this point  Uh, yes  Okay, here's my thing  this is oh  I haven't opened it yet because  I am moving as you guys know and so I bought something to make my  Um, what's it called?  Uh breaker box smart and so this is going to allow me to  Uh see what energy is being consumed by certain appliances, but eventually it will also ouch  be able to  Give me insights about how I should be using my electricity and this is cool theoretically  It could one day communicate with my utility

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's i've always wondered how these things know what devices using the electricity because you put it in one one place  Right or you open it on all the devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is what it is this is the  wiser energy system  By schneider electric la la la  Okay, and these things this is to be installed by a professional electrician. I should also mention. Oh, this is not don't mess

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not something you should do cats may not kill you but electricity will

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These are the little things that go into the breaker box. I believe I believe leo. I have a friend who did research on this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  every appliance has a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Signature did I not answer? Yes. Every appliance has a unique signature like a mac address

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And no, it's just a pattern the way it uses electricity  And they're all unique  Yep. Well, I don't know that every  June oven is different from every other june oven, but june ovens are recognizable

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, I had no idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a friend of mine who's an electrical engineering prof at at rutgers

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did work on this. Yeah, i've always wondered because you see these devices  So this is the this is from how they gather that data, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They pull it from they sit on your breaker box. They're attached to either individual circuits or they're attached at the like  Junction of the breaker box like this one. Yeah. See there it is. Well that thing is actually in the breaker box

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't want to do that. Yeah. No, i'm not touching this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I will wire a light switch or an outlet. How much is this?  Uh, I don't remember

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like this idea. Yeah, maybe when we get the electrician out  We would get one of these. I think that's a very  So it tells you what's using all the juice  Yeah, because we have a lot of it which yeah, because we have mysteries. We use a lot of electricity  I can't quite figure out  Is it because the computers is it because of the lights? What is it? You know, what is using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Um, so another company that does this and why is it?  Why is actually our wiser actually uses their technology their algorithm technology is sense and sense also makes a physical device  So you could go with either of these. Oh, okay  There you go. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So installation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, plus your electrician. So those things clip on to  Yeah, just put those on circuits somewhere. Yeah, that doesn't look too dangerous  I'm not going to touch it. It does need to be professional. Normally i'm like go try it out. You can do it for this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, when you open up the box

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I open up that box all the time when your breaker gets thrown you don't you open that up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't take the cover off the box exposed to all the wires. Oh, you don't play around with the wires

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you you just flip the switch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then when it jumps again, I put a penny in it or a little something to jam it  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, nice  You said that so you would scold him stacey because you're not supposed to do that  I know you're supposed to yell at him now. I just like I I wasn't paying attention. I'm sorry  I was reading some of the comments. He was baiting you and you didn't you didn't take the bait
