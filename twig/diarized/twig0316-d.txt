Transcript:  before it was an alphabet actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yahoo used to be a cabono, right?  What was was Google to server that they were on? Yeah, remember yaka? Yeah to go to Yahoo in the early days  Yeah, there was some weird a cabono dot Stanford edu. I think I can I was this I do not remember that famous sumo wrestler  Were you too young? Yes. I'm very you missed out on that. But oh, that's Mike Elgin. Hello, Mike Elgin. How are you?  Good good. You were up early today covering the Sony. Yeah. Yes. Yes. It was it was great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a great announcement and it was it was a sony announcement Leo. I'm just gonna throw it out  There was a Sony announcement. So everything was better. Yeah  Cool stuff that you're not gonna buy and no baloney. No baloney. None at all. It was all baloney

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw like three minutes on the phone and the rest of it was baloney

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was funny because I think to me the grandest irony of today's news is that  Sony announced a 4k screen phone. Yeah, which was very donkulous. Yeah an Apple  95 Mac announced that next week they're gonna announce Apple TV, which will not support for yeah  So Apple's major television product doesn't support 4k, but Sony's phone does there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in a nutshell ladies and gentlemen the tech industry and no better observer of the tech industry  Well second only to Mike Elgin, mr. Jeff Jarvis professor journalism. All right  There's no better  Your blog at buzz machine commas a must read Jeff joins us every week, of course  What is the pixel per inch on the Sony 4k?  I have that because I mean this is UHD. I mean most of the higher-end phones are UHD  I'm not sure what the distance not that much more than UHD or is it I don't know. It's gigantic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gigantic. I'll have it for you in a second 802 pixels per inch 808

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Crazy talk no human eye can know you can't after three or four hundred you really yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what's that what does that does that have an impact on power? Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to imagine every pixel costs you so the phone has a gigantic battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It actually gets to two days of battery life, but they said well they said right if you if you don't turn it on  But it's yeah, it's it's a it's a huge battery 300 and something milliamp per hour  30 yeah, it's it's big just plain large

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let us talk first about the new logo because I think that's real Google News  Google announced it yesterday on their blog and with this  and I had to go to the Google archives to find it Google doodle because now it's just  they took the original serif font and  replaced it with a sans serif font which is  Design is so funny because  Designers always yell at me when I say this, but it's very fashion. Yep driven. Yeah, it's like whatever's you know  I mean people thought avocado refrigerators looked great  orange appliances  The designers argued no no no burn orange  It's gonna be the color for 1972 and it's not that the it's not that we have better taste than they did in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  1972 it's fashion right right exactly designers hate it when I plus we have better taste  You know the thing the thing with this low with the thing with any corporate logo the problem is is the suits get together  You get all these cooks in the kitchen and everybody knows how they want the new logo to make them feel  I want to weep with nostalgia, but at the same time I want to feel the future come their letters their letters people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Aren't we getting weren't we gonna get a design you never got a hold of them, huh?  We had we had a designer wanted to come on and talk about this and I said we'll give you ten minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Geez, I can't even believe ours now so so this font they actually invented this font. It's called product sans  product sans  Serious, I'm serious. That's the name of the tie face

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And see sans is very hip right now right yeah sans fonts effect if you look I mean I I  If you go to twit TV, we spent a lot of money on a sans serif font yep  Verlag it's called. I like it. It's a beautiful cast sans net cast sans. I'm calling those ver leg  But that's very modern right is the sans font you don't do serifs anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's exactly why I do them all the time  Because you're you're Gutenberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm-hmm yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is supposedly more legible without the serifs serifs are those little  widgets the little little more

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess my issue with it is it's it's it's even more childlike it does look child now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it doesn't help that the guys drawing with a crayon  You know what I'm trying to and I wish we did have that designer on because for instance  It looks like you know we talked about kerning  Which is the crane is off to be too it looks off to me the kerning is a distance between letters and this looks like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A monospaced font that doesn't look a curned. Yeah, the East sticks out there too much  And it is you know it is getting  Destroyed by the designers who say that it's this that the other thing, but this is one of those things  Where we'll all get used to it. Yeah, it'll burn itself into our brains  Just a logo well, but but I think what's even more interesting about it is why they did it and I my theory is that  they are trying to look as absolutely warm fun fuzzy and  innocuous as they possibly can as they're as they're dragged into court in India and Europe and elsewhere over antitrust charges and  Privacy issues in Germany and all the rest they want to just look like something right out of preschool

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're Google you can't go this is this is my argument long since on the show that that that  The world sees the rest of the world sees Google as Godzilla and Google sees itself as Snuffleupicus  And they're both you know gigantic monsters yeah  And and and so Google's trying to present this and you know it's a fine logo  It's perfectly fine, and the cut you know the the childishness of it is the colors, but a serif added a little bit of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Serif sophisticated nuance actually but again, it's fashion remember the movie Helvetica, which I loved  Yes talking about how sophisticated  Helvetica was as a sans font yeah, and that really designers if they really were sharp would understand that  Helvetica is of course perfect, and I suspect that's what began the sans serif  Movement let's not forget comic sans is a sans serif

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The whole notion of I mean Gutenberg moment coming up drink people drink  Right Gutenberg's first fonts tried to mimic scribes handwriting. It was absolute handwriting. It was absolutely illegible then Jensen was the first  Designer of a Roman font it was it was beautiful. It was gorgeous  And it was finally pleasing to the eye and you could make sense of it now  That's what we're all trained to do if you go to the second link the fusion thing has the stills of the logos through the ages

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah nice, so I think I'm also guessing that part of what they must have considered  I'm certain that they did is how it looks tiny how it looks a different size  I mean oh yeah  Apple came out with San Francisco font for the Apple watch and they liked it so much they rolled it back up into the phone  And so this is something that has to look like if you look at the fave icons for example  Their little G has to look perfect  Tiny tiny tiny on a screen with pixels  And so I think that this you know the smaller you get a typeface like this the better  It's going to look relative to share fonts and other things  So this is gonna look good on all the devices all the different places where Google serifs generally don't do well in small

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they do not Danny  We were talking about a cabono and I was trying to remember the original name of Google well this fusion article tells us back rub

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah back rub when it was out on and they used to have a little the other hand there you see it and it's  San serif by the way yeah that didn't last for very long  What I thought was interesting with this is  despite the change  If you look at something like Apple where you have the single Apple signal, that's that's very iconic, and I think you really  Identify with Apple and you know that it's Apple and you can use that and all sorts of things and have an Apple brand beyond it  You know the Google logo to me feels a bit  Kind of cartoonish. I know we'll all get used to it, and I can't say that the old logo was necessarily that great either  But they still seem to lack that kind of what's your icon right?  I know you got a logo  But that's not the same thing as an icon and they've done that new G thing where you have  You know the dots spin around there it is and it turns all into that  It'll be interesting to see if they actually adopt that and try to use that G more as their icon as well  Or if at some point Google says you know we actually need a symbol to represent Google and the G isn't gonna cut it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know ironically it looks a little bit like the Apple rainbow logo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that the G is very problematic because you essentially have a single letter with multiple colors  And so as that shrinks down and smaller in size as you move away in distance it  You don't it doesn't retain the line of the letter anymore  It looks like this splotchy mess at the yellow fades into the white background or whatever  And I think that's really problematic. They're gonna have to fix that I think some point

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe we're spending so much energy analyzing. I know well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, but but I think I think it I think it is worth talking about because first of all is Google show  But second of all Google is one of the world's leading brands globally right I mean  It's a it's a and this is this thing is gonna be with us for years  And so you know this is a big part of the identity of this company. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, although they did change their logo fairly recently they dropped the  the depth the little this which was really dated this you know  Yeah, to give it a 3d look they dropped that only two years ago, so that's you know this  They have tweaked it before and remember all the attention Yahoo got when they changed well. Yeah, if you put those together

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I  Daddy I agree. It's just it's just it's the childlike nature of it  But I agree with you the same thought you did Mike that this is trying to make them. I find that it's harmless

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, that's very preschool isn't it? Yeah? I remember going to a  lunch in  South Park that Google held back when it was still pretty small it was Larry Sergey and maybe 20 other press people and they gave us all  Brio trains you know the wooden track and  They had alphabet cars, and they bought GOO GLE  And they gave and I wish I had that I have it somewhere this brio train with Google on it  And it was very much like this it was a kid's toy  But at the time they didn't have to prove that they they weren't they weren't trying to say no no we're just innocent kids  Here so this may just be their own ethos not having nothing to do with

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Image although, I'm kind of inclined to yeah Larry and Sergey are are basically trying to recapture that kindergarten vibe  And I'm sure that their teacher had the same thing. They're very disruptive Sergey. It's very disruptive in class. It's very disruptive kid  Yeah, it's  All right, it is strange

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Logo I think I think if the one interesting thing to say is it does feel like they're trying to be a little bit  Softer and gentler oh sure yeah as they conquer the world yeah  They actually have posted something at design.google.com. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Latif in the chat room all right if you have that up on a screen while you're taking testimony from  Larry page on or or send our push I have his is their plans to conquer the world. It's like us conquer the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's preschool  Designers from all across the country  I'm sorry the company including creative lab and the material design team convened early this year in New York for an intense  Week, I mean if they think you've spent you think we spent a long time talking about it  Oh, yeah long design sprint we drafted a brief that identified four challenges a scalable mark there you go  And I agree that could convey the feeling of the full logo type in  small spaces the incorporation of  Dynamic intelligent motion  responded to users at all stages of inner interaction a  systematic approach to branding and our products to provide consistency in people's daily encounters with Google a  refinement of what makes us googly  combining the best of the brand our users know and love  With thoughtful consideration for how their needs are changing. This is designer speak. Oh boy is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's always verbs. Oh sitting through those meetings is just torture

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I love designers. I really do I really do and I wish I had your taste  But normal people hear this stuff and they go what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know the funny thing about these and again  I've been in a bunch of meetings where you design a logo or something like that and it's in the best idea  Comes and then you move past it and on to the bad idea always. Yeah, I don't know why that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I started when I started EW  The magazine it we out yeah, sorry the magazine came out and and I had to defend it  but the truth was the design sucked badly and  I  Didn't know that I was a first-time editor  you let a design department keep futzing and they will keep futzing and futzing and futzing and futzing until it's over futzed and  That's the natural  Process of design is to overdo things. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The here's another quote the Google logo  Has always had a simple friendly and approachable style  We wanted to retain these qualities by combining the mathematical purity of geometric forms you write  You know, it's definitely very circles and straight line with the childlike simplicity of schoolbook  letter printing  Childlike who wouldn't sue a little kid would you put that verb in their minds childlike?  Do you think Larry or somebody said, you know if you could make it childless? Yes  That's not something a company a massive  Multi-billion dollar multinational usually says how we want to do is childlike

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple would never think that way. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Besides the jokes about about you know, you're not gonna kick a child in Europe. There is something to saying that that that  it's childlike is a universality and an innocence and and a simplicity and  You know, it's not wrong  Typography primary colors alone get that across. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We created a custom geometric sans serif typeface to complement the logo and product look up lock ups and supporting identity materials  We call it product sans the typeface design takes cues from that same schoolbook letter printing style  But adopts the neutral consistency we've all come to expect haven't we all come to expect  Neutral consistency from geometric science. I for one have I I have this allows us to maintain an approach

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not a word. They should be using neutral consistency

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This allows us to maintain an appropriate level of distinction between the Google logo type and the product name  Interesting. So they're really I mean they've spent a lot of energy on the dots and the G  That's you know, we're all talking about the word Google but that's not you know, the most important

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see how they do animate it. Yeah, what to do with it. Yeah. Oh

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about the cost of doing this is we the design that has to go into every single of the other division  Sign it physical sign. It's not like changing Macy's logo, right?  You have physical signage. No to that remember and this is many years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When Steve Jobs started the company next  He went to one of the most famous designers in the world Paul Rand to create the logo  Rand said here's the deal. I'll do it for you Steve. It'll cost you $100,000 you get no input and  That's it. They I'll do something for you. And that's what you get brilliant. No changes. Nothing. So that was in  $100,000 it's got to be ten times and the logo sucked. I like the next logo. You don't like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like it the the letters  Vanish into the thing. It's forgettable. I think a cube and you kind of remember it was a cube  But I think it was more or less forgettable somewhere. I have the poster of that signed by Paul Rand

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got to find that it's probably worth something. It's so funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of my earliest experiences with this sort of thing is we actually went a Windows magazine  We launched with a serif font. We ended up changing the logo  launched with a serif font  We ended up changing it to sans serif font the serif font was designed by Milton Glaser. Yeah  it was one of the  Brilliant right the and then the the the  Publisher and some others decided that no we need a more contemporary. Look, we don't want this thing, you know  And so the associate designer for one of the publications in this organization designed the sans serif. No, that's fine  Go with it. Yeah, it's just I don't know it just  It's like entropy everything leads towards sans serif roundy  fonts, I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I just I open a new tab and went to Google and it's still it's funny how it takes me back for a second  It'll take about a week to get used to but yeah, it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And even though it now is solid colors. It still feels like it's being drawn in chalk  Yeah, really does that kind of yeah it fades away or something does

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a little upset the capital G. I feel like the top should not finished. Yeah, it stops early. It's premature

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ejaculate  Ejaculate  And then the E why is it pointed up? Where is it going? It wants to leave  I think the old one did too wants to go for a ride  I'm out of here. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember when the when the fight was trying to pick the entertainment weekly logo is to bring back memories  They picked a grotesque version of the font my course my reaction is amateur was well, yeah looks grotesque

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Technical term, you know, it's so funny because when I look at Twitter TV, I really know for a while  We had a problem with our we get it from typography to feed a calm  It's a net font and for a while we had a trouble with it. I think it defaults to Helvetica or something  I really didn't like it. Yeah, and then when I found out how much for like was gonna cost us. I asked the designer  Hey  Isn't there a free font that looks at and he said well, there's this and I really didn't like it  It's very subtle, but there's just something I love for a log. I think that is a gorgeous  Yeah font and it really it does it says something for the choice of typeface does really  Communicate it really does. Yep, oddly enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep, I mean think about the most I can look think about the Apple website for example  or all the logos you've seen in the air or the you know, some some of the  Yeah, there was some discussion about the original NASA logo from the 70s and 80s. Yeah, don't ever change that  I was that's historic now. It looks like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a little discussion on my Facebook page about what companies have not changed their  logo  Somebody said Coca-Cola, but that's changed appreciably over time  To am I was told by Ford that the Ford the script Ford in the blue oval is Henry Ford's handwriting  Wow, so I think that has not changed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm in some time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And mr. Mr. Robot mr. Robot really people are pointing out that in mr. Robot the evil corp  That is the company that is the center of that  It's called e corp has the same logo as Enron which it does  So that's a good that's a good choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is this? I don't know what this is. That is a large evil corporation. Not evil  This is evil corp. There it is e corp

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have now well, we have one more note on this. Okay, we have not  Yes, you have the fact that the search box is bigger what is that? Oh, yeah, you didn't you notice that Danny

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't notice that but Barry Schwartz are our fine-standing news editor notices these things and the microphone is in color now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I noticed that on Android as well probably does some animation if you speak

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure if you follow that link because that goes an animation showing the difference in size precisely Danny

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You you know your staff well, and you know that when you hover over I'm feeling lucky. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I forgot about all changes into something. We're I mean you can it's interesting though because  It is really rare that I actually go to the Google home page  Whoever sees this anyway, but people do I mean, you know people do but  It is you know so much of a change where if you're on your phone  I'm just searching in the omnibox or oh, I love that one. That was a great logo  Yeah, Tom swear if you know or if you are, you know  You're speaking to it or you're in Chrome on the desktop, you know, even if you're using Safari  You're not going to the Google home page, you know  I think most of the people going to the Google home page are the people who are using  You know Bing and they type in Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some people probably I would guess set this as their default home page in their browser, right? Yeah, they could although

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's interesting if you were gonna have a home page as default. I mean being is a beautiful home much much nicer  Yeah, they're always showing you different images that are out there. They've really it's really well done. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can even now there's sound on the on the home page so you can hear where are we at today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is in Iceland. I think I would been at that broker geyser. I was just there Wow  They knew  I see you know Danny Sullivan going off  I thought it's a race you'd like to see except my view had a lot of people holding selfie sticks. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I I so that's actually interesting that you say this Danny cuz  This is a remarkable  Alternative to Google which is the notorious for a simple clean design fast fast fast and even after Marissa Meyer left  They you know, I kept it as simple as possible and you could not get more diametrically opposed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is come. This is they've got a video on the big page. Yeah with audio

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And news stories and suggested searches and there's even these little highlights  That load I don't you know, what's amazing is it does load fairly fast. Yep. It must have been pre loading all day  You don't think I doubt Microsoft spent any time on the Bing logo at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I actually know that don't you remember?  I was about a year ago that Microsoft went through this huge rebranding and they had a very long  Documentation this is why all of our stuff comes together  This is how our angles all come together and that Bing logo I think came in as part of the same kind of  rebranding that they did for some of the other Microsoft stuff at the time I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just I think it's amazing. They have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kaiser erupting. Oh, yeah, you got to be careful where you sit around there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is gonna in a few years gonna look very dated. Isn't it this page? Maybe not. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the images don't get dated  It's beautiful actually I love it and then the logo of course did change  I've got you know, it made all my other Bing stuff outdated, right?  I mean I was being snowboard and now my look ago and it doesn't oh man. You're being snowboard. Where is it?  You're in a different room today. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm in a different house. Our other house is having some construction  I'm in a laundry. Well, not our other house. I mean like we're in a rented house. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Summer house we're in the summer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's had to do some stuff in the Sun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm tucked away actually in a laundry room so how did Barry Schwartz know I mean did he measure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you should have very on the show someday first I'd love to  My guess is he's probably saw somebody noted  Although usually if he got it from somewhere or someone will he'll credit it at the bottom of the page  Unless it's just so widespread that it's happening out there  So he may have had seen people saying oh my gosh  Have you seen that the logos changed because there's some people who really get get into watching that sort of stuff  He says but it's amazing because you know we go through the debates like oh, you know, they made the search box longer  Does anybody care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, you know, this is data driven. There's a reason why they do that. They're not just kind of hey  Let's add 33 more pixels to the I mean there's they have data that tells them something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what they have done over time and in fact, I don't know if you recall a few years ago  They got mocked for this and I can't remember who did it  It might have been Steve Jobs where they enlarged the search box and someone  Made fun of them like and what did they do? They made their search box better  But then again, you know, they're a search company understand people like to type in there and you like to have room to time it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate this though. Wait a minute. Is this normal behavior? So I've got the full page. I start typing something the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jumps up to the top. I hate that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stinks yeah  Well, it's but if you want to get to stuff after you might not they're trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what they're trying to do get you used to typing the top of the screen. Yeah, so you stop going to the Google front page

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interestingly, I don't really want to get a real criminology here notice the thanks to Demi's  Staffs animation that shopping and news have changed position

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, what is a hovered bosa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And why is that's a great question?  Why is a typo in the instant search results and who is mr. Robot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is my IP and who is mr. Robot  Wow, those are something I must have searched for right? I'm surprised. It's preserving the typo  Where's I don't even see shopping and no no if you go back to Danny's thing, okay, I  Would but I don't really care  Let's move on  I'm a bad bad man  So Google has actually this is a good one for you Danny Google and Firefox have teamed up to deprecate  flash as  Of this month  Great as of yesterday  Flash will not autoplay in Chrome  If you got the new Chrome 45 which came out yesterday  Now fortunately if you go to our live page, it does autoplay  So they say less important content what they what they don't want to say is that's ads ads exactly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ads in related junk it also has to be said that Amazon also in addition to  Google and others have  They've banned it banned flash ads throughout Amazon comm  Not that they have a lot of ads, but they do have them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are tend to be flashed part of this comes from the fact that the MSN and Yahoo have both had  malicious malware ads  That were based with malware is based on flash that infected some people's computers if they hadn't updated their flash  Google has also changed the default behavior in settings now  It used to say under plugins in the content section of your settings on Chrome run all plug-in content  The default now is detect and run important plug-in content. So you can change that behavior

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can even what what what is what defines important?  Google how is that determined? But how is that determined? That's what I couldn't figure out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google figures all that stuff out. You don't need to worry your pretty little head

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you don't have to I think they didn't want to say ads I  Was I was pleased that let's see CNN does a lot of flash, right? Let's see if CNN stuff runs  I don't know if they have autoplay  And they maybe they don't but if I go to twit TV slash live that starts and plays  So obviously we're important  So it's not turning off all flash that's flash and it runs so it's not turning off all flash  But it is turning off flash ads. Oh  I know why I should turn off  I've got you block origin running  That's really changing my experience of the web  For the better Danny look good in the little window there. Oh, thank you  Little window. Hello. He's in a little window within the little window

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I try to get Barry to give me some more information on that navigation stuff by the way  So if you reports if he reports back to me, I what I was noticing to go back to it  Is that the navigation actually seemed to be dynamic now? So for example, if you if you search for  Search for like cars  Me and my cars. Yeah, and then what navigation do you have there?  Click off the search box  So I can see the links at the bottom. Yeah, how do I get rid of that? Just click anywhere on the page. Oh  My goodness, it's terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Press harder

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's do that again cars  Then do what enter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go. These web images videos. There it is. Here's we're shopping now change cars add the word DVD to two cars  You know put cars DVD. Oh  Yeah, well anyway, you'll see it but if you do cars DVD, then I bet shopping jumps up to the second. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what the what the what? Oh cuz I can buy now the cars DVD up Barry's already come back. That is very old

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's very long doing that for ages. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm doing that forever  It's just you know, but that's really raises the very important point that we don't notice these things  But I bet you it changes our behavior  Bet you bet you a bunch  So you can don't have to worry about starting up the  The video you YouTube has abandoned starting in January abandoned flash  HTML5 is default  Flash ads in February Google started converting flash ads to HTML5

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good you know, this is just following along with over under here on the on the on the death of flash will flash completely die

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean why use flash we still use it because our providers  I mean we don't use it but you stream uses it and bit gravity uses it for playback  I would expect you stream now has a fall back to non flash  So if you come to it on an Android device, it will fall back to HTTP streaming according to adage

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  84% of banner ads are still flash. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeez, well, it's too late. I think it's almost too late, but that's I mean when people say oh  When adage in fact says oh my god ad blockings costing the industry billions of dollars  You should have thought of that before you started 80% flash ads on yeah, that's that's the subject of my column

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unfortunately, it's not today. It'll be on tomorrow in the observer  But but just arguing that the basic message of all this ad blogging is talking stuff  Last week is that is that all the things that are wrong with advertising and we have to rethink just like we have to rethink media  We have to rethink advertising fundamental

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love forced to because people are gonna see your ads exactly. This is what I love about no in charge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is what I love about this whole thing. The reason everybody's quickly suddenly finally  Embracing the abandonment of flash is because of ad blockers. Right people are saying or hey these these ads are so problematic  I'm just done with all of them. And so the companies like Google who live and die by ads are like, wait a minute  Wait a minute. We got to do something about this  So and also yeah, you know, I'm sure that Jeff you're calling on everyone to embrace silverlight as an alternative

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, even Microsoft is a has deprecated silverless. So  They should throw that in the bin. You could do everything you do with flash now. You could do with CSS or Java  Yeah, you don't need it. I'm gonna be all animated gifts all the ways down. Yeah, right  That's okay with me. Those those can't infect you  Until there's a problem with the animated gift library on your platform  Yeah, so I'm glad I think the I think flash I think by the end of this year  No, maybe by the end of 2017. You won't see any flash. Yeah, I'm surprised to taking it this long

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually ever since they you know dropped it off of iOS, you know, it's been

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's years old at this point so ad blockers are about I mean we're about to hit ad block hoplips  Yeah, which I by the way was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we're gonna hit it if  people on  iOS think it's worth going out of their way to downloading a third party thing to add into Safari  You know a lot of people just aren't gonna be bothered. They're not gonna do it  Yeah, I mean I think you've already do it on desktop people don't really do it on desktop  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but you know, it's there but it has not been such an issue that the industry has said  Wow, we've got to do something to stop this. It's gonna be easier to do it in your  mobile browser  It'll be interesting to see if people really do pick it up  But it's not if it were going to be on by default that would be a much different story, but it's not on by default  So you got to think oh, I really want this now. I'm gonna go get this now  Download an app from a third party. Wait, who is this third party? Do I trust this third party?  Do I want to use third party or some third party ad lock or at some points gonna turn out to be tracking you as they?  Delete the thing which is gonna freak people out even more. So, you know  But if it did get that way and it suddenly everybody turns out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I'll ever be you know everybody but what if 25% of your revenue disappeared that would be significant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure  If 25% of your revenue disappears because all the ads are really getting blocked in that way  What you're gonna find out happens in my view is native ads could explode even more  You're gonna have the ads that you'll find other ways to do it. Yeah, which is exactly the problem, right?  I mean it's ironically it's gonna make it worse because much worse or  People will be asked to pay for content more than they do now and you know, maybe they will probably won't and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Content will die and insights will die, right?  Already die. Yeah, I think we'll see that happen. Yeah, and you know, there's an argument to make  Not to put myself in the observer again  But wrote a column that when when thousands of people write the same stupid blue moon story when there's nothing actually knew about the moon  It showed we're a terribly wasteful industry. Yeah, there's plenty more efficiency to be found  Maybe we have too much content. It was the argument about about television. We have too much television content  That's just an argument going around this week  I can't remember who started it but saying, you know, there's too much too much good TV, right?  Yeah, that's not a problem for us in the audience  But it is a problem for those making it that they can't get their their attention up to the levels they needed  But we've got New York Times by the way. Yes. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I forget who what it was a service is John Koblen soul searching in a TV land over the challenges of the new golden age  We everybody agrees. We're in a golden age of television except  There's so much on television a glut. This was a guy. Mr  Let's see John Landgraf of FX networks. He said at the Television Critics Association media event  it's hard to cut through the clutter and create real buzz and  Has presented a huge challenge in finding compelling original stories and the level of talent needed to sustain those stories with it  Yeah, apples about supposedly apples about to create content

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really hard for Hollywood to try to figure out how to find original stories. I mean apparently it is  I don't know Amazon and look at the you know thousands of individual authors that are putting stuff out there  I don't think you know, I don't know an expert on Hollywood  But you're you're glad I'm finding original stories is that you don't like risk, right?  And so it's better for you to do is to have another hundred shows about you know, maybe a cop drama  Yeah, exactly. But you know, let's set it in Miami

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How many CIS is are there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I I think if they wanted original stuff  They could totally have all the original stuff they want if they're willing to take the risk, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're not willing to take the risk. So you think there's a okay, so there's enough writers. Is there enough are there enough actors and  Maybe I used to live in LA. There's plenty of actors every restaurant waiter is an actor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just gonna serve us at the restaurant exactly  Question is are there enough Jennifer Lawrence's that we can put into our original stuff because that might help it  Yeah, there's probably a lack of  Superstars that I want to do things but gosh, you know, it's wonderful when you watch  What we just had the some kind of hero or or show me a hero that was on HBO and like yeah  Oh the actors I didn't even know no they were great and it was fresh and you're like, oh, this is like a whole new

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  New actor that I've been the story of the redevelopment of Yonkers is gripping

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean well, I could really did you like that show it was interesting, okay, I  Tried to watch it. I really did I wanted to love it was it really probably only needed about half that length. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know but there is great stuff out there, but I can also see the glut really isn't so much  There's a lack of performers and writers. Their glut is that there's a lack of attention. There's only some I mean I already  In my household Lisa's saying let's not start another show. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to start another show by the way, did you know they're making a TV series about Minority Report?  You've got to see it. I saw that it's maybe gonna start watching better

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's gonna improve the quality cuz you're gonna select better

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but yeah, there's a problem. Here's the real problem  The siloed so Apple's gonna have their own content  So you got to have that and then you have to have HBO and you have to have Netflix and you have to have  Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I think the opposite thing is happening where you realize it's just just as with news content  You have to be everywhere. You have to put your you have to you're gonna have to put it in some articles  You're going to be on Facebook same here  Producers are gonna have to be everywhere granted. No, but that's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The model is different now because Apple's paying for this content to and Netflix is paying for this kind of Amazon's paying for this kind  To give them an exclusive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the whole point so I have to have HBO I have to have Amazon I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wanted to watch TV and I say I want to have these channels because I want to know I want that kind of content  So my modern cable channel these days is I have who I have Netflix

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I have Amazon but the difference is the cable didn't have great content. What's that crap mostly?  Well, but HBO's a fishing channel and stuff like that. Showtime HBO

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  MC a modern cable system for me would be  Actually, I don't get this stuff through direct TV  But I might buy my maybe I buy my bundle where I've got you know an Apple and Netflix  The the Amazon or whatever and you know, I've built it up that way  So maybe I'm paying my $40 per month, which is what I was doing with cable in the first place  Yeah, I'm not getting everything on one one single channel getting what you want. I don't get that now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But isn't there a FOMO problem too that oh, I don't have Cinemax. I'm not gonna see the Nick. Yes, there is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you saw you saw you started typing in what is and I said, what is mr.  Robot people are hearing about mr. Robot right and they don't even know where it is where to find it. Yeah  That's a very good problem. Yeah, and that's great for Google because they have a search engine. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got a call last night from Comcast  And then we're gonna take a break I  Know oh no, I shouldn't answered it I knew it was I knew it was a spam call  And they wanted somebody the triple play package and I said well, I already have  Comcast business class and I want to keep that so I won't be buying the internet and I don't have a phone line  We use cell phones so I won't be buying the phone and he still tried to sell it to me  He said but you'll save money if you have a triple play  I said but I save money now because I don't have a phone at all  He said yes, but even if you don't use the phone and the extra internet it will still be less if you buy this package  They're insane finally I had to yell at him and say goodbye

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The airlines are like that the airlines are like that it'll cost you it'll cost you  $350 to fly to Dallas  I like $200 to fly to connect in Dallas on your way to Miami

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I said even at the beginning call if this is a call to sell me triple play  I don't want it. I don't need it. I can't use it because I  Hmm, and of course, I know that it starts low  Yeah, I said, but how long is that price or two years and then yeah, yeah, and then you're stuck behavioral economics, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if I could get a good clearing house, it's somehow let me buy five  Five things in one go. I mean it's not gonna happen, but it isn't because no it's not in the interest of the creators

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, not I'm sorry the creators is in their interest. It's not in the interest of the people who fund the creators

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, but if someone can if someone can sell a  Hulu subscription to someone else who wasn't even thinking about buying it because they will buy it if they can bundle it up with something else  Who makes some more money off of that even if they didn't sell it direct does?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know the music industry is moving towards this model of selling direct basically artists go direct to their audience  What did what did the record labels really add to the next except, you know boy bands when you become known?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, there's a few ways to go here. This is what I argue when I call into Howard Stern  I say why are you sharing your money with serious? You should have your own  Empire only 100% on your own online and you can do that  Now can Joe Schmoke and the you know, the 12 year old Howard Stern of today do that?  No, and Howard argues in return you've got to go to broadcast  You got to be on my side and I yell at him and say, you know, nobody listens to broadcast  Exactly what I said hard you're the one who ruined run. You're the last one how are you the one who killed it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly what he said. That's exactly what Jeff said you pulled up the ladder

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but there are models that start to go where you start up and you build this is why VidCon was so amazing  To me. Yes is that you can build an audience Kickstarter is not the answer for everybody  But when you do get to be known the question is where does the risk capital come from for entertainment?  That's the real issue right now you have the big money player if you want to make a blockbuster  You want to make something big it's gonna be expensive to make  You're gonna have to go somebody who's willing to make the risk capital upfront and that's gonna be Netflix  Hulu Amazon Apple  networks true  But if you want to make something cute and funny and you want to make the Daily Show tomorrow  You don't necessarily need that risk capital  You could just do that and if you're good enough you can build an audience and and you can get going and and if the engine  Starts cranking great if it doesn't well throw it overboard and start the next thing if we move to it  It's it's the blockbuster economy as long as we're a blockbuster economy  Which some part of entertainment always will be because the returns are so magnificent if you hit it  Then yes risk capital matters, but a lot more entertainment is gonna go to less and less risk capital  It's a lot cheaper to make this thing and what proves that this very show I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't follow that but it sounds good at the end. Yeah, that was a great ending

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely  I also think that shows are I mean there are multiple models. There's the  There's the there's the VC model where where the money and it doesn't matter what where the money is coming from goes out and funds  I  You know content creators, right?  And then there's the other model where they they hire people and to develop content  The first model is a total winner like you know everybody should you know you you talk about you know  You you sort of bootstrap it on your own  You don't have to do that you can be like an app developer and you can go to a VC

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Netflix or whatever it is. Do you really even need a VC? Do you need that risk capital?  Mean most of the stuff my kid watches is no there's no  There's no investment involved. Yeah, I think of epic meal time those guys basically  They buy a couple of dozen donuts and they're fixed  Then they shoot it. Yeah. Yep  And that's another question of course it's scaring the hell out of the TV folks and the and the content creators and the content distributors is what?  Is the younger 25 set doing and how do we reach them? Nobody knows you busy broadcasting so you went off  Privately didn't you say Jeff? I think you said this last week that every industry just says well, they'll grow into it  Yeah, once wait till they get to be older and then they'll watch then they'll be watching the Merv Griffin show

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You'll be you'll be driving a Buick. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't think so  Our show today brought to you by legal  Zoom if you do want to start a business you absolutely can do it  I really think you'd can but there are a few little T's you need to cross eyes you need to dot  You need to get some legal work done, but you don't have to have a lawyer to do it  For more than a decade legal zone has shown people  That they can start a business they can protect their family  they can confidently navigate the legal system without a  Law firm see legal zoom is not a law firm. That's why they're so affordable  They don't charge you by the hour instead you get transparent fixed prices  Customer reviews, you know what you're getting up front  Whether you're incorporating creating an LLC. That's what I did  So couldn't have been easier with legal zoom and more afford and no couldn't I mean it was so affordable  trademarks last wills living trusts legal zoom is the smart choice and  And this is something that they didn't have when I used them ten years ago  But they do now if you need legal advice  They have pre arranged pre negotiated fees with a network of independent attorneys  Who can give you straightforward guidance at a fee, you know, you know ahead of time, you know, it's gonna cost and it's not much  Don't let legal hurdles become an excuse for you living your dream  Protecting your family go to legal zoom comm today start building your future the right way you could do it yourself  a little bit of help from legal zoom  Legal zoom comm by the way, if you use the offer code twig at checkout  You'll save a little bit and they'll know that you heard it on this week in Google and we'd appreciate that legal zoom  dot  calm I  Love the conversations we have on this show  It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know when you don't understand what I'm saying I under I was being facetious

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't know you were I know the whole the whole issue of  the cost of creating content  Is very interesting because you still probably contest one of the few areas, you know, you could start a blog and write  Every single word you write Jeff you can do all by yourself. You don't need a venture fund to do it  But but media television and movies we haven't figured a way to do that for nothing. Yep, not not high quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, but but but a talk show used to be very expensive  This is she were on a network that did it, you know, you say she let me ask you a question  Do you ever in a cold sweat, you know when you open the new studio and spend all that money or those things?  Do you ever say?  Vicious. I wish I'd stayed one show and I'd have no obligations to anybody. It's just me every freaking day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I actually really like what we've built but I I'm very cognizant of the fact that  It's you know what this is a conundrum for me because it cost me millions of dollars a year to run a larger operation  Than just me and this nice studio and all this stuff  but on the other hand would I get that same income that I get if I  You know, I don't know if I don't know if shutting it  Squeezing it down to a smaller size would give me that two million dollars a year extra in my pocket

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think it would and the reason you and you could grow even bigger if you'd taken capital and the reason well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could grow faster. I don't know if it would be the right kind of growth  I look at you know revision three is the example for me of that  They got eight million dollars in venture funding  Spend it all very quickly on studios and talent and acquiring things that it didn't work and  We have a discipline of having to do, you know, we can only buy what we can afford

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I was writing about earlier this year when the whole giga-ohm thing happened the idea that the  SimCity model of building but you know, you build up to your budget or whatever  And yeah, it's a difference and to go to the video thing  I mean what am I not remembering like Louis CK funded one of his own things because he said you donate the five dollars  You can do it and it's certainly a lot easier if you want to do it as an individual and you're not trying to build  Something that you hope you're gonna sell to another person or that you you know are expecting to get a capital payoff from it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just want to be yeah, but but stand-up comedies is cheap. I mean Game of Thrones  There's no way you make Game of Thrones for less than a million or two an episode, right?  Somebody's got to come up with that million or two an episode. Yeah, but potentially you could still do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could find other ways of funding it. It's just that you could find other ways of funding it  The ways of funding it right now are very efficient and they're all institutionalized  Here's a question suddenly you couldn't if you suddenly couldn't get ads subscription revenue  You'd find another way to do stuff. I don't think it would disappear, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Danny, let me ask you this we had just because you follow this some all three of you follow so much  What if venture capital started to come in and here's what I mean by this if you took away the need for distribution partnerships  You said you really could distribute on your own  You call YouTube not even distribution partnership just just a channel of sale and distribution, right?  You don't need to do it to get bought by you don't need to get green lit  By a major studio or a major network, right? Let's just imagine that then why wouldn't venture capital come into this business and say

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Give me a famous producer. Well, I think they do I just I think they do it in ways that we're not used to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thinking about it chase we loved we loved the Sopranos so much. We just believe in you and we want you to make  Here's a million dollars an episode, but that's what Netflix did they went to Dana they went to Trigger Street and said we love you  Kevin Spacey, what if they said here's a here's a hundred million dollars make house of cards

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what if somebody goes to Kevin Spacey or David Chase and says here's the deal  I will notice split your revenue with anybody  You just give me a payback at time and you sell directly to the public you can charge them  Whatever you want you sell directly to the public you could there's plenty of platforms where you can do this and  I will up I'll put up the money because I'm sure you're gonna be a blockbuster  Distribution is the issue right now, right? I should say no, it's not that's what I exactly I'm saying  It's not anymore. You could put something up online  You could put a friggin PayPal in front of it and you can charge people to watch what you want to show them and  You could own the money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Jeff the you know, the only place where that really happens is YouTube  I mean you can talk about Louis CK you can talk about Howard Stern  You can talk about all kinds of people  Kevin Spacey who made it with the old model and who are who are household names because of the old model  Well, yeah, they can do it in the new way  But the but the people didn't make in the world, you know again PewDiePie and all those guys on on YouTube are different  Our differentiator, but they're not household names at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, but you can you can you can build up your reputation in a lot of different ways, right?  You took massage and what you said about you?  Google is the anti  Apple and the anti Amazon and the anti Netflix Google could say to any performer out there  This is why I say this is why I introduced  Stern's people to Google five years ago Google could say to any top performer out there today  However, they made with the reputation and find they may have made it in old ways because there's a transitional period  But let's say you go to David Chase and you say Dave babe. Love you. Love your stuff  Google says, you know, we have a standard cut that will take for distributing you or selling ads on your thing  You pick your model don't care and that's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it's happened because you you have studios and existing financing things that operate in that sort of thing  Says they're gonna back a film they're already backing the film they effectively are a VC right so what  You know, what's a VC who's not used to doing investments in movies adding to that process other than unspecialized knowledge in cash  Which is a disaster, right? So, you know, I think that's why it hasn't happened  I think and I actually think you can find examples of movies where you have had these outside investors put in money  Just because they're told this is a good movie to back  But I think there's also a question about are you backing a movie?  Are you backing a performer or are you backing an entertainment portfolio?  Because to say yes, we each get a VC company to back a movie is like saying  We should get a VC company to back the iPhone 6 and they're gonna do great off the iPhone 6  But you know, then you're gonna have an iPhone 6s out and they don't have anything to do with it  Hey, they don't want to back the product  They want to back the company that they hope will churn out lots of products

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they also want return if you I'm just saying it's a different kind of fun  You could get you could get return rather than waiting three to five to ten years for return  You're gonna make your  blockbuster business of entertainment  VC is a blockbuster business with a longer turnaround  Entertainment is a blockbuster business with a short turnaround and it's not gonna be all about deal flow  so the first time that somebody goes to a Howard Stern or a David Chase or or a Tom Cruise and  Says I'll back your thing to make this independent screw all the middlemen  You are now big enough the Internet is possible enough to go without middlemen and we're gonna both keep more money

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As a result. Yeah, I don't know why that hasn't why I haven't observed you see it much more going the other way  We see people hit cherry-picking YouTube stars, you know, Fred Figgles Figgles bunny, whatever his name is people  People like that that annoying orange those people get plucked from because we're in a transition stage  We're gonna it's gonna flip you think this is why I keep you know  It would that be a smart thing for a VC to do to create a content VC  Right now.

Transcript:  What happened?  It's a little weird, but it worked when are you getting your  Moto month my Google what model if my hub I canceled this is actually good subject  I cancel it because of the Asus  Well because of the Ars Technica review  Ronam audio reviewed it and said this thing is a pig  It is not a good router  He calls it they're a smart home Trojan horse and a $200 leap of faith  And if you look at the benchmarks he did with a two-year-old Asus router was very very slow  He also says it's very limited because the only way to configure it is with the app and the app is  Very few features. It is not in fact a I thought oh this because it's from Google  This is gonna be a sophisticated device and in fact, it's not look at the look at the transfer times  This is not even the latest Asus router  It's a couple year old Asus router it took for a 4 gig file over Wi-Fi  312 seconds 5 minutes on the Google hub 1 minute on the Asus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but that Asus is the old and busted the new hotness they announced today spider router. Yeah, exactly  It's a 2.1 6 7 gigabits per second on to 5 gigahertz bands. Yeah blistering fastest router ever. I actually bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yesterday so I cancelled the on hub and I bought the high-end Asus router of yesterday. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Should have waited should have waited it's coming today. Unfortunately, but it still will be much faster than this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, you're getting your own hub tomorrow Walmart lied. They kept on saying it was to be delivered on August 21st. I finally  It was awful. I know I got from Walmart was spam  So I cancelled that and then somebody on Twitter said I just I just got it on on Best Buy of course, you know  Pavlov's dog that I am I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Immediately order on Best Buy. Oh, I did too. I ordered as fast as I could but it's coming tomorrow  I'm glad it mine's not coming because I cancel it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I will be very interested in your results well if or now now maybe I won't open the box, I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mine the problem the problem I have is  You know, I test a lot of stuff  Internet in the house is a mission critical. Yeah thing. I don't I I screw with the Internet in the house at my own peril  Yeah, you know I'm saying. Yep  It's not something I want to benchmark  Right and I know and and this really was a pig in a poke and after reading run them audios review  I was a little hurt because a lot of people got free on hubs because they were invited to a Google event  Which we were not invited to but now I'm glad because they got to review it and let us know not to buy it  We're all but we're all the reviews. I thought they were all very negative  But Ron's was look we know Ron he was on the show  Yeah, we trust Ron and I tell you what you look at these benchmarks now admittedly these are you know  This is it's hard to benchmark this kind of thing  But I think it's much it's very what it became immediately clear is this is not a state-of-the-art router. This is really all about  a  Home automation yes, and I'm not really ready to pick a winner in home automation  We're gonna see an Apple TV next week that will do this a similar thing  I've got smart things. I think that there's in the new smart things is coming. I got I think I feel like they're  Look at the difference in speed this thing was about 1 5th to 1 6th the speed of a couple of year old Asus Wi-Fi router  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is not impressive. I mean they've got some intelligence switching around of  You know  There's some intelligence behind it. It's just I would like to see that applied to a really fast router

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think there's intelligence because remember  We had Matt cuts on and he initially said well  It's got 13 antennas and it change and it changes it will change the band every 15 minutes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got 13 antennas and my razor blade has five blades. I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and then Matt kind of interestingly said oh, I've just heard I just heard from the on hub team  It does have 13 antennas. It does check the state of the Wi-Fi every 15 minutes, but it doesn't switch  So it's like well, what are you doing there? What's going on there? What is it checking for? What's it checking for? Yep? Yep  They're still there. No, I am NOT a privacy nut by the way. I don't care that it's Google's hub in my house  I know and I trust them to do it right. I don't think that's a problem. I

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just I like my Apple time capsule whatever I have in my ear  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been having so much trouble with my airport  Extreme and I had the new one that I've really am ready to try a different router and asus does make very very good routers  Yeah, yeah  One thing asus does is when I got okay, it's not a spider  But does have five antennas its its tri-band because it's got dual five gigahertz plus and five gigahertz has been good  It's been very very good to us. I don't know. I'm desperate  I got the 3200. That's what I got. Yeah. Yeah  There's also multiple land ports blah blah blah. I just feel like there's more  More I could do so I decided not to sacrifice myself, but good good good on you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff and let us know how you like it. I don't know. I don't I'm no I'm no I'm  Jake's it depends what Jake says. Yeah. Yeah, you know what everybody needs a Jake. Yeah, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, let me give it give let's have Jake give us a benchmark  You know, we should still get one in benchmark it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got a Jake too, and I don't think it is a good thing to have a Jake because you do rely you like okay  Nerdy child of mine who I gave life to fix all this stuff for me, please  I don't have to learn how to do it. Yeah, I do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Motorola this more today at noon's  Launched the new moto X a day early. They tweeted it. They had a tweet that said September 3rd. I was expecting September 3rd  And then they tweeted a date yesterday. We're gonna do it tomorrow  So the Moto maker is there don't know much about it. The choices are three different layer levels of  storage  1632 for another 50 bucks 64 gigs for a hundred bucks extra  Moto maker is there with all the traditional Moto maker choices including different front colors  Different back styles leather wood and plastic different accents engraving and so forth  This is the this is the new moto X pure, which is a five point  Seven right? It's a pretty big phone. Everybody's doing big phones now. They also unexpectedly announced announced a new  Moto 360 actually several new moto 360 watches  Android wear really seems to be going somewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very interesting why couldn't they get rid of the flat tire?  Do there's always a flat tire, but they could have found a clever way to hide it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah with a big bezel around it. Well something but that's well, that's how the other guys do it  Mm-hmm. Yeah, and the problem is that you have less screen as a result because a bit. Oh, that's not good  The site is really suffering. I think a lot of people are ordering products

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think that that it's just that they decided to have a larger screen less bezel  This is an interesting one. This is the first Android wear watch with a built-in GPS a runners watch  Yep, that I think will do well  That'd be nice. That's not available immediately the and this will work with Apple  Well, that's the other stories that they have now put out an Android wear app on Apple on the for the iPhone  I haven't played with it yet  Megan Moroney who does iOS today with us has my I just gave her my LG  Urbane because that's the only one that's it was a ruse

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She just wanted to get her hands on your watch. So she's gonna try well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't have my iPhone anymore. I gave it to my son in preparation for the new iPhone  so I can't tell you but I can't imagine it does quite as much as  The Android phone because iPhone is so locked down

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the fact is that people don't do much with their Apple watches or Android wear watches anyway  He's mostly notifications which works fine  Yeah  And a few other things so I think I think it's actually for people who want to have an iPhone  But also don't want to spend a fortune on a watch and want a good watch that costs less than an Apple watch  You know, it's a good option

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's why this is interesting because Apple doesn't currently do a GPS  Nope, if you want GPS functionality have to take your phone with you this new moto 360 support does have GPS. Yeah  I mean there are high-end runners watches that do this. But if you're a runner, this is this is a really cool  Yeah, and then the new the other new 360 has a variety of looks  I'm trying to get into the site because it's been really I feel so lost

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know which of the new Android watches are the watches that you should have. Yeah  There's some really good-looking ones. I thought it was all about the 360 but everybody talks about this urbane or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, don't get the urbane. That's now last generation  But there's other round ones that look good. It wasn't it wasn't Sony's  It wasn't Samsung they're doing Tyson Huawei has  Keep hearing really great things. Nice Android wear. Yeah round Android wear watch with no flat tire, I think  See see well, but it'll have a bigger bezel as a result. Well  Gold and you can get gold with a micro neural

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See that's thought that bezels not I'll take that bezel. No, this is the moto 360 you will take that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this isn't you want all gold. Where's the Huawei? You can do all gold. Should we look at Huawei? All right  HWU  WEI  Android wear watch here it is  And some people have hands hands on already. It's up for pre-order  Pre-order just started. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still stalled back at the $350 thing for something that's not being pushed by Apple  Which I think the Apple watches are already overpriced so but it's Apple so what I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Know well Apple's done so well that or I apparently done so well that while I said  Yeah  Yeah, so what this is these two are the urbane which I we were talking about the middle one is  The Huawei and you see a small bezel and no flat tire  So maybe Jeff's your dreams will come true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how all the images of these don't show any of the actual smartwatch functionality, right? It's always a walk  I it's like it's look. It's just a watch. Yeah, right. Yeah, it's more expensive starts at 350

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It goes all the way up to eight hundred dollars if you want rose gold with gold links. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  would not invest a lot in a  Technology device it's gonna it's gonna get well, I think it's gonna get updated

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I think these watches are very strongly targeted at Chinese  Buyers who are looking for status symbols  Right, so and Huawei has a much better reputation in China that it does outside of China. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sapphire glass display which Apple couldn't yep  Actually, no Apple has it on their higher end watches. That's it. Not this work, right?  With looks the charger looks very much like the Apple charger. I think this is public

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Intentional right the Chinese currency heading down fast you wonder if they're gonna use that's not a market on price. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For snapdagon 400 that's what everybody's using these days  I'm not sure I'll order this. Do you want to get this one?  What I actually it's your turn to buy Jason. Well, I should be getting a review unit from Huawei

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So much crap just to figure out what when I should actually we said there were too many TV shows. No, that's not the problem  There's too many watches phones. Yep  tablets  We're being buried in crap. I  Can't wait till I buy one thing and stick with it for more than a month  Good luck with that  You don't really know I do but Lisa won't let me I  Actually said at the beginning of this silly season that we're just entering  I actually said I'm not gonna buy any of these new phones and Lisa says the hell you're not. Yeah, I even bought  Well, I told you about the Robin zig  I  Did not get the new Nest thermostat. I  Bought you know had a nest and I never installed it in the new house. Do you have a nest?

I was like, yeah, I was like a hero. Oh you want heat? Here we go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, now you could if you have an Amazon Echo you can say turn up the heat with your echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not allowed to use the echo what my wife is tired of us all yelling at it  We get these competitions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how we solved that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have it here, but I I got one of the nest camp to see how that worked, too  I put it in the kitchen. Nobody knew Oh  Watching him making stuff  Are you sure you want that and he's just like he's not the camera all of a sudden you seem go

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a camera here  It's classic also today at IFA sir had its press conference is announced a  New phone the Predator 6. This is this is not a joke  10 core  10 core smartphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a decacore media tech processor console that also has a phone at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, basically four gigs of RAM six inch display for speakers haptic feedback

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm what OS is it running? I'm sure it's Android. I mean, so what am I playing on it that I need all that  There's good Android games. You sound like an iPhone owner. I know there are but what Android game is demanding 10 core

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lovely game this is future-proofing so you never ever have to buy another phone again

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fallout shelter yeah, I did that last time. That's why I'm not buying

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, okay see  See that's the theme. No fallout shelters on Android. Oh, yeah, it is isn't it? Yeah, everything's on Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it is an Android, but you can't move what you did on whatever device you're on  That's the device you're on for the rest of your life and fall so I don't care because I only have like don't spend any energy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This but this is this is the theme so far at ifa, you know, we saw in the Sony event  We see it here these companies are coming out these really amazing phones with amazing specs  The Sony phone has a 4k display and 23 megapixel camera, etc, etc  These companies are it's so hard to compete in this business that they're all coming out and targeting these tiny markets  How many people are going to buy a 10 core smartphone?  300 people I mean is a tiny tiny market and and Sony and Acer  They're going after these really minuscule markets because the big markets are gonna be completely taken over by the Chinese companies by Apple  Very low and others. Yeah, it's following my mind is that the cost of the phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish someone would chart it but they seem to keep going up, right?  Like, you know an Apple phone you're getting close to dropping a thousand dollars on it  The the edges and everything that came out and I was thinking  Samsung you're trying to fight with Apple on a device that aside from the weird edges that don't have much usefulness to them  Is oftentimes still seen as not quite as good yet  You still want this premium price and I guess maybe that's working for them  I guess but I just look and I think wow now you're dropping eight hundred dollars and under and meanwhile  You've got your PCs that have come down in price  And it's just like when did this tiny thing turn out to be much more expensive than that giant thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing makes sense anymore. And you know, I think what they're doing is they're chasing margins. They're figuring well  We're not gonna go after the mass, you know, we're not gonna make it up on volume  We need to find a niche that can have some margins where it can have profitability and it's very difficult to do because as we know  There are only two companies in the industry making profits. And so that I think that's what this rising prices  Phenomenon is all about Danny. It's it's all about like well, you know  If we have a really high-end really expensive phone, we charge $800 for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe we can make it for 750 will make 50 bucks a phone or go or the race to the bottom you go one or two ways  Right, you don't want to be in the middle although motors in the middle. That's $400 500

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well that's the other thing is I look at something like the moto X and I said he was asking me for like they wanted a  Phone and it was like the moto X. I mean, it's like $400 for an unlocked awesome phone  I deal it's cheaper than the Nexus 6  Like and in fact the moto X that they had really was the Nexus 6 for all purposes, right?  And it was like cheaper than buying it from Google. It was better than the Nexus 6 really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so I look at that night. Just kind of think gosh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I I hope Motorola makes it because you know, it's nice to see phones that are being sold at sensible prices

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Jason how's the host of all about Android? He's also our producer Jason is  Is it just a rumor the new Nexus phones? I mean, do we know anything about them? We'd well, I mean we know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What we think we know is that LG is gonna have a sequel to the Nexus 5  Right probably I mean in my opinion probably the best of the Nexus line agree devices  Yep, so that'll that's something look forward to and then of course Huawei is making the sequel ish  To the Nexus 6 and I think it's gonna be a 5.7 inch screen  Yeah, as opposed to six inch just a little too big  I think I think most most of all and then the Huawei device is going to be probably the higher priced device  Although bigger although probably not as you know as extreme as the Nexus 6 was the Nexus 5 will be a little bit  You know probably more in that like 400 ish range

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm guessing and then so CNET says it's gonna be September 29th in San Francisco if it is by the way  Right guess who's going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't know what day of the week is that you know, I know I can follow me bad. There's no way to echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, oh good we can talk about it the next day and you can talk about that night

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and these would be if they come out September 29th  Would that mean marshmallow comes out September 29th or is this an announcement for a phone that will come out in October and November?  December with marshmallow the latter I would think right you never know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would say the latter I suppose you never know you never know I think that's kind of how they how they've been doing it  Which actually now that I think about it  It is kind of strange that they're planning an event because the last couple of years they really haven't done that  I know they've just gone the  put out a press, you know press a release on the blog and  Its importance will rise to the top all on its own, and I don't know if that's the best strategy  But that's what they've been doing so this would be a little different

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel sorry for Sony because I feel like yep the  Xperia and I know I and I've been guilty of this just doesn't get the attention the last Xperia  I reviewed the z3 was a little disappointing and it had a lot of great specs especially for the camera  Yeah, but was not a great camera. So I just didn't I wrote off the Xperia line the new z5 looks interesting  They've got a premium version which won't be available till later this year  That is a 4k smartphone the chat room saying something like 806 dots per inch  Which is 300 more than the note 5 which is crazy. It's 2160 by 3840 Wow  That's just nuts, but they say they will upscale  Hi-def content to be to look good on a 4k anything. It's gonna look good on that screen probably there's not a lot of 4k content  To me it'll be good for cardboard  Yeah, I pointed that out for VR. It's great because you divide it in half  So it'll be HD VR capability but Sony and Sony does have a visor a headset

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not only divided in half, but you have a lens that's focusing on something that's two inches from your eyeballs  So you're really what they're looking at the pixels. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Certainly on the galaxy gear VR with an s6  I see the pics. I see a screen door effect and it's waterproof. So you could have underwater VR  Nice finally finally long man  Sony is  Losing according to a gadget 1 million dollars a day on mobile. It's good business  So you got a work if you can get it you really got a wonder in fact, you know  They've been losing money on TV. They've been losing money on everything except their insurance business in Japan  Which is apparently the only part of Sony that's doing very well  I feel for them because they know cameras boy. I love their cameras. Well, here's a theory for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if these phones with these ridiculous specs 4k it has got a 23 megapixel camera what if this is just a  Sales pitch for their components to sell to Apple and Samsung other companies. Hey, look at this is a reference platform exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At this point battery and camera are all I really care about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what their opportunity was they should have brought back the Walkman and cassette

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Selling the walkman they need to bring back the Sony I bow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's it you bring it back with the cassettes you start getting people talking about how oh my god  You haven't heard sound quality until you've heard it on tape the new vinyl  You bundle in an mp3 player so it can be dual use and it's going on with it from there  Can you imagine like the hipster sculley? Yeah, that's right. I got my thing. You know, they'd be all walking wearing them  They did they missed it with guardians and guardians to is gonna come out and they're gonna be cassettes gonna be back  They need to be ready for it. I'm telling you  Vintage cassette is coming back and I have got 45 of them ready to go  It's true. Guardian the galaxy.

It's fresh books is a cloud accounting  System that makes it so much easier for you to do what you have to do and which is send out invoices  And  More time to do what you love to do which is do your work your stuff the thing the reason you became a freelancer. I  Love fresh books that saved my life. It's now almost ten years ago when I discovered fresh books  I was doing it by hand as I'm sure many of you still are now you can use fresh books to design a beautiful  professional looking invoice send them out  the invoice itself  Goes in email although that you know for a little extra you can actually have them believe it or not printed out  Lick the envelope stamp it some people still demand that at least they did ten years ago  Yeah  The nice thing is the in the email they send out most people prefer and there's a pay me button on it that lets your client  Pay you instantly and for that reason fresh books users get paid about five days faster  Than people sending out paper invoices. It really is a great system. Should you have a slow pay fresh books helps with that too automatic  reminders  Great for expenses too  If you keep track of those the fresh book app on your Android or iOS device will let you take pictures or receipts get them  right into the invoices  You can also track your time and hours if you build that way it couldn't be easier  And I'm telling you if you're suffering now at the end of every month sending out those bills  Please do yourself a favor for the next 30 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  To be honest getting it just for the pico projector I think this could be your multimedia device

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a little small one  We always would like to take on trips and by the time I get it all set up and I've  Got the thing hooked up in here and the inputs going with there if I have the movies already on my Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, be awesome. Why five models only 499. It's the same price as the low-end  You know what? I'm that pico projector is piqued my interest. Hmm. That's the one thing that might

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a little low, you know, it sounds dark in the room  Yeah, and and if it is bright enough, then the battery will last 10 minutes  But still it's an interesting idea  This is kind of thing has been on the fringe for a long time and it's great to see it kind of like creeping out  Into something you might actually buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But yeah, I like it Wow, I really think of it as a projector. Yeah with a tablet attached, right?  Alright, I'm that one I might get

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So have we talked about Tahoe that the Samsung tablet that's 18.4 inches coming out that's right  Yeah, okay. So Samsung 2 is a normal size tablet. Yeah, so Tahoe code name Tahoe  It's a lollipop tablet with mid-range specs, but it's 18 4 inches  across for the display and  What is the right size for a tablet? That's way too big. I guess that's the wrong way to say I'm at 18  That's pretty I mean, that's like a placement. It's it's a it's like a if this was a laptop screen  It would be a huge laptop. Well, should be your dinner table. Yes, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's why Apple is hoping this pro would go but that's only 12.9 inches this is much larger

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm that's gonna be so bizarre we're gonna have a 12.9 inch  Tablet from Apple that I can touch but I still can't deal with my MacBook screen that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, do you yeah, they really ought to add touch the MacBook. Do you think tablets are a vital?  Viable category or is is is that is it I'm starting to think it's such an intermediate  That especially now that we have big phones that most people will either use the phone or the  Laptop and and the tablet where it sits in the middle is just not that useful

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's hard since I moved my wife to the iPhone 6 plus she hasn't used her tablet right my sons haven't used their tablets  And they're on larger screen phones. I use the tablet all the time. But I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  mean I have see I  Think the tablets should be super vital and useful  But they're not because people don't change their behavior and the companies aren't coming along with the program  To me I think one of the ideal tablets would be if  Chrome if the Chrome OS had a real touch user interface, so you had a totally  Chromebook like cloud-based device that was a tablet you mounted in places put it on the refrigerator put it in  you know in certain places and it was like a  Sort of a public terminal inside your house  That would be super useful if if we had a real sort of desktop  Style apps that ran on touch devices with a giant screen  I'd love to have I'd love to be able to use an Android device as my full-time desktop  computer with  Powerful apps and all those I think we're really getting there  But again, that's not a behavior that people really want to hear is something interesting Microsoft. This is rumored the Microsoft

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Continuum dock this will go we talked about on Windows Weekly today. This will go with the newest  Windows phone which will be I think called the city talk  city, man  There's the city man in the talk man. It's a five point seven inch kind of fablity phone  It will have it this looks like a type-c connector  I'm almost willing to bet as a type-c connector which then goes into a dock which has three USB ports  HDMI and display port out you connect that to a screen and a computer your phone is your computer. Yeah, is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That a crazy product but well we've had we had those phones that the docked into the laptop and made

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, but now put this  From Microsoft. That's what's different about it right all of a sudden. This is a Windows 10 product  Because Windows phone is Windows 10, right? Very intriguing to me  This is a different Microsoft I have to say yeah, it is that is a crazy product. Yep  Three USB ports an HDMI display port  If you if you get the new high-end  Oh you at the continuum also uses mirror cast which means you don't even have to have a wired monitor  You pair a mouse and a keyboard with the thing in the dock  You won't even need the dock you just mirror cast from the phone. Mm-hmm. The phone is a computer  Too bad it's Windows phone  Yeah, but Windows phone is more Windows 10 now than it was before so yeah  anyway  We live in interesting times. Do we not many many options out there?  New apps layout for a mobile I haven't seen this have you seen it  Either for where for the the store on mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't look I was looking a little bit yesterday because I don't tend to search for apps when I'm on my mobile browser  But yeah, I'd seen that I think it was in testing as well  So it's interesting yeah, I think it ties into that I mean well  I don't if you want to go back to that other story about them blocking the app app install ads to let's talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so  You know, I mean yesterday they Google announced that if you I think we've all had this happen where you know  You do a search you click on a link you end up at some website  This happened to me with our local TV stations all the time and before you get the article you get this annoying thing that  Pops up saying download our mobile app, right? So you're like, okay, I'll dismiss that hate that so much  Yeah  and so then you know and you read the article and Google feels that you hate it so much that they've decided that if  Somebody does that on their website and they show you a mobile install app that blocks all the content like that  Then they're considered a site to no longer be mobile friendly and as a result  It will no longer rank as well when people are doing mobile searches, so you're gonna get penalized for doing that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little penalty, right? It's a small penalty. It's smaller than it sounds. I think I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't actually know how big it is. It's a it's a penalty  It's probably we've already had all sorts of sites face penalties for not being mobile friendly and still manage to rank

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well a mobile search result. It isn't necessarily a pen. Here's why I don't think it's that big of a penalty first of all lots of  Advertisers are gonna go running and stop doing this. So for the ones who continue doing it  They're gonna have a lot more eyeball than users are expected to see  to seeing  Secondly on mobile. I think I would suggest you know, I would suspect that a lot fewer  People arrive at pages through search, right?  So you get a link from Twitter or you get a you know through social media or whatever and though is  The Google results don't matter the Google research results. Yeah, it'll affect some number but the payoff  There's clearly a big payoff for these kinds of ads. They take over your screen. They say download this app

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm even tempted to do it, you know, once we have official apps  And you go to our website on mobile wouldn't I I mean it's kind of in my interest to let you know that we have  A mobile app we wouldn't do though a big takeover and that's what they're deprecating

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't want a big as long as you want to have a little banner up at the top of the page  And I think it's okay. Otherwise, they'll consider, you know, so  It's a penalty. It doesn't mean that you're necessarily banished from showing up in mobile search results  But yeah, it's it's Google wielding their power to say we don't think this kind of behavior is good. So you shouldn't do it  Which led to my big rant yesterday where I was like, oh  You don't really think things that are annoyingly causing people to install apps should be happening  Then maybe you shouldn't do that in your own mobile search results  And because I don't know if you've noticed but when you search on mobile in Google  You get all this stuff trying to get you to install apps now  So if you've got my article from marketing land, you'll see but you know  One example is I do this search for say Denali and in the middle of the page is telling me  Hey download these apps. They have content related to that and their news apps and the content that they have related to it  It's just web content. I don't need the apps to read that content  But Google's decided to take you know, like 10% of their search results page and  Devote it to telling me to install apps that I don't necessarily need  Because I could just click from my mobile web. That's so annoying  See, that's an example there. That's a takeover. That's the whole page is blocked  Well in the in the thing above, you know, like when you that's terrible the one above that one  Yeah, that's the kind of thing that Google is going after because the point is that's annoying right?  Why would you want to get that when you click from the mobile search results to get to an article?  But then if you scroll down  Then see you can do the search yourself  I searched for Denali and then Google's like saying here's more content in apps if I were to go download the Mount  McKinsey Wikipedia app or the NBC News app then I can read these articles, right?  Except that I don't need to get those app to read those articles those articles exist on the mobile web  So why are you shoving app installs that me in the mobile search results because it's annoying  Paid that's not a paid result. It's not a paid thing, but it's annoying and so then and then go down one more  Or in another case where I search for say Best Buy here  They say I don't have the YP app installed, right?  But here they're giving me a link in my mobile search results to the YP app  Right, yeah, but I don't have it installed  So now I'm gonna have to go install it and it's like so I'm on a browser give me results  I can see in the browser and that was sort of my argument, which is  You Google are one of the major players that's giving people so many incentives to create and have apps  Some of whom don't even necessarily need to have them  So sure you're kind of eroding the support for the mobile web  And then you get upset that when people are on the mobile web trying to drive people to the apps that you now decide  That you should penalize them for a different division. That's a different division  It's yeah, it's annoying  So anyway, that was sort of my my thought to Google which was yeah  It's it's you want to crack down and the other thing too is why are you just going after apps?  Because takeovers any takeover ad  So  Deprecate all of them well and I still don't have an answer from them as to why it is now  I could theorize that some people might find the app install ads especially annoying, right?  Because it's like well, why should I get this ad for their app to you know, the articles right there?  But then so what if the publisher wants to show so if the same publisher showed you a takeover ad for  You know one of their events or one of their newsletters. You don't have a problem with that  Where'd the audio go sent me no it just beautiful I'm here

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh good Google Google Google did it took over at the router blocked me out

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what I think is like so if a publisher wants to  Promote something else of theirs that allows them to connect with readers  Like say I have a newsletter and I decide to do a takeover app saying hey  Make sure you just follow a news or say I want you to follow us on Twitter or Facebook  And I do takeover things saying make sure you follow us on Twitter or Facebook  And I do takeover things saying make sure you follow us in Facebook or Twitter they don't block that  It's only the apps that they've kind of gone after and so we had this opinion piece from Jeremy Stoppaman from Yelp last week  He was like hey, we think they're trying to do this stuff because it's all  Anti-competitive that the more people install apps the less likely those yeah  Now he's gonna have his own take on that you could certainly poke at it  But when you go after just app install apps on  The rationale that well we don't like them because they're annoying to users  All the takeover apps are annoying to users. That's the same problem. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're the only the only you know if you're gonna be you know cynical about it. I mean Google it makes apps  Right right any other app is theoretically a competitor for eyeballs and attention to analogous to what Apple's doing in the opposite direction

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Putting content blockers and Safari encourages you to use apps exactly where Apple sells ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly and yeah, and Danny on the annoyance meter  How does that rank against the idea of putting native ads in Gmail what yeah?  Google is putting native ads in Gmail. I've been testing it for two years and basically what are native ads  It means that it appears in my email. Yes, it appears in your inbox is a mess is a  It looks kind of like I think they're gonna give me spam  Yeah, they're gonna give you spam and when you you you able to forward it where does it appear? That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it still appeared separately. I couldn't see an example it appears

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as I understand it, I haven't seen it myself, but it basically it appears as  in the same space where your incoming messages are and then you can open it and it's a  It's a it's an ad and then you can save it to your inbox  You can forward to somebody else you can do stuff like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the big insult is that it comes right into your reverse my screen. Maybe there's a way for me to do it  Hang on here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have some in front of you then I was this yesterday by the way hang on here  They said according to a Frederick Laudanois writing in the tech crunch they said we've been doing this since 2013 well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they've been testing. Yeah, I haven't really rolled it out my screen. So yeah, so the ads that are coming here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's nothing you're gonna see that's scary. I've seen this this is in the promotions folder

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If I if I click on it, then I get see how I've got a whole  Article that's showing up like that, but it's motion

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I've seen ads in the promotions folder provided that did not come into my email

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's just because it is in promotions it potentially I think you could get your ads in anywhere even if they were

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's not good. That would be that would that would cause me to be screaming against Google. Yeah, that's the whole value of  Priority inbox is not to get not to say that. Yep, and then and then that would and I would argue that  watch out in the European case if they cut if  If they cut out everything else in the world of spam, but allowed their stuff in is not spam is paid  Not gonna look good Google not gonna look good  At all because that is in fact you advantage in yourself with a paid if that's what they're doing  I'm not convinced they would do that. I don't think they're that I think somebody in that organization is gonna scream evil from the mountaintops

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a world traveler you all world travelers, perhaps you have been in a city  Where you've heard the call to prayer? Yes. I've been in that very city. That's Istanbul Istanbul at night  There's the Red Mosque is that the Red Mosque. I don't think so. Tell maybe not I think it is  Those are the towers because the Red Mosque has more towers than any other mosque is allowed to have except the one in Mecca

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think there's five and the problem with Istanbul is that they all go off at the same time. Yeah. Well, that's intentional  Well, yeah, but but it's like a cacophony rather than a lovely well in cut in Egypt a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Muisine that's the call the person who sings those calls is in trouble  Because he changed the call during the dawn prayer from praying is better than sleep to prayer is better than Facebook  and  That's what a cleric supposed to do just just root canal is better than

Transcript:  He's in serious trouble he is the religious endowments ministry is  Investigating him after locals complained last week. He went on a hunger strike and then he denied he said it I  Don't know what Facebook is and I don't know how it's spelled. He says  Of course, everybody heard him say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My wife is chatting me and saying it was a blue mosque not the red mosque blue mosque. I'm sorry. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right. Of course a mirror. That's the blue mosque. That's what I meant

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know where the red mosque is is there a red mosque? They should do the the towers in different colors like Google. Yeah

Transcript:  I don't know what to say about that number. I do we trust Facebook's numbers, right? I mean, there's no way to really verify it  It's probably yeah  It's it to me. I always think of the engineering miracle that that is  Yeah, that you could have a serious a system of servers all containing the same content  That a billion people could see at any on any given day is a mind-boggling and and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't hear this a lot but I've experienced it myself Facebook is very fast as a website. It's snappy  It's snappy much more so than any other social network
