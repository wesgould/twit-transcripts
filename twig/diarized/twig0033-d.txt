It's time for Twig this week in Google, our special South by Southwest edition.  We're here in Austin, Texas, thanks to the great folks at the Texas co-working facility in downtown Austin, 206th Street in Paul.  We thank you for your hospitality.  We also thank the folks at New Tech who have set up a TriCaster HD and a bunch of high-def cameras.  And this is a nice setup. This is a really nice setup.  So we even have a few people live in the audience who are compelled to stand, which I think is only fair.  You should have to stand if you want to watch this show.  I am sitting with Gina Trapani in the flesh. It's so nice. I've never met you.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  First time we've ever met.  That seems so weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to hug Leo.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think this happens at South by Southwest is that you actually meet people that you've known for years but never met.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Absolutely. You're no longer just a floating head. It's so exciting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Kind of still am.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also, Jeff Jarvis. Nice to meet you. We've never met either.  We've never met either. No.  It's so great. And Jake Jarvis, your son is here with you?  That's so cute, father and son.  Just accompany him.  Oh, isn't that great? So this is my first. You guys, Jeff and Jake, you've been here three times.  Gina's been six times.  I think this is my sixth, yeah.  What was it like in the old days?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I can't even really speak. The old days were truly like 2000.  The people who were here 10 years ago.  Right.  And there's a Flickr set somewhere that Matt Howey is in. He's in the audience here.  That's like 2000, like the really early South by, you know, and everyone's looking very young and spry.  We'll get mad on it.  Yeah, we should get mad on it. He's going to talk about the old days.  I would just be a poser talking about the olden days of South by Southwest.  Yeah.  Because.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, six is a long time ago.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Six is a while. It's a lot bigger.  It's pretty Twitter for God's sake.  I know pre Twitter. What do we do?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did Twitter change?  I mean, Twitter debuted at South by in 2007 and that really was the big debut.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Twitter amplifies the fact that there are 50 things going on during the time, the thing that you're at.  And it makes you feel like, should I be here? Should I be there?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And didn't Twitter make it easier to people to coalesce? For Gary Vaynerchuk to say, I got wine and.  Definitely. Absolutely. Absolutely.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Although, you know, the year that Twitter kind of got big here, what was that?  2007. I was still I was sort of the still the late adopter.  I was the one standing in the hallway kind of staring at this being like, what is this thing?  And that's actually when I signed up.  So so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then for Foursquare became big last year.  This year that doesn't seem to be an application.  Everybody's kind of using Gowala's here. Foursquare's here. Twitter's here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What was the one Scoble was talking about a minute ago?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Plancast. I love Plancast.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Another one he that shows you all the sign ins on Gowala.  Bicarious. Bicarious. Bicarious.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bicarious. L.Y. But it's Gowala based or is this a bunch of other ones?  Jake Jarvis. I'm not sure.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  He said it just it shows you like blips of people showing up at different places.  Doesn't show you who they are.  It shows like if you see a blob of people, right, you know, go there.  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. Have you guys seen Sit By Us?  No, it's that. It's Sit By.  U.S. It's you're in South.  You're at a panel at South by Southwest and you check in and say where you're sitting.  I love that.  And then people can figure out where you are in the room.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This has really become a test tube for all of these social.  It's a social media event now.  I mean, it really is.  You know, I'm sure it was web design early on and things like that.  Yeah, it was.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I tweeted today this morning just to start a game going.  And I said that South by Southwest is not a conference.  It's a tribal gathering.  And then I started some other names going.  People came back with what it was and I had a whole bunch of what it really is.  But to me, it is a tribal gathering.  You see these people you haven't seen.  If you ask me, that's the future of conferences.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nobody really wants needs or wants to see booths anymore.  So trade shows that rely on booths are kind of dwindling.  Except for CES, maybe that's the one exception.  See bet in Germany.  And I think even panels, you know, there's too many panels here.  You can't see you can only at best you could see one tenth of the panels that are available.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it's a classic case of the hallway being the real event, the lobby con.  You want to turn it inside out.  It's a paradox of choice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a paradox of choice.  You're like, I can't even deal with dashing across the convention center and making it to the other thing or choosing.  So you just have to congregate in the hallways.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it was truncated by a fire alarm.  And you were glad to be here.  I was actually glad.  It was Mark Cuban and Avner Ronan.  Avner is the guy at Boxxy.  And I thought he would be a very interesting person to listen to.  But Mark Cuban is so annoyingly opinionated.  I just was like, I couldn't.  I was so glad the alarm went off.  It sounds like it was.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You didn't pull it, did you, Leo?  No.  It's a case of the big media personality sort of slamming the quiet, thoughtful key.  He said, are you making money?  I'm making money.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a case of Mark Cuban being a...  You said it before, Leo.  A dick.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A prig.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey, look at this!

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  On the more positive note, there is a hardcover edition of Gina's book.  Hold it up, Gina. Hold it up.  The Complete Guide to Google Wave.  Wow.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Your co-author, Adam, is here also.  We'll have to say hi to him.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, he is.  This is the debut.  First edition.  First copies that no one's ever seen besides all of us.  Yeah, first edition.  It's up, available for order on the website.  CompleteWaveGuide.com.  This is your third book, right?  Yeah, this is my third book.  This is my third book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's not new to you to see a first edition, but...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is not, but there's a lot of things that are new about this book for me.  So I decided not to sort of publish it the traditional way, like through a traditional publishing house.  This was really a DIY kind of experiment.  Got together with a small company in San Diego, and we said, you know, we're going to do this book together.  We're going to design it, we're going to copy-edit it, we're going to make the index, we're going to do the screenshots,  we're going to do it collaboratively in this wiki, and we're going to print it ourselves.  Because speed was the essence, right?  Because Wave just continuously changes.  We wanted to get this book out the door, and I wanted to have more control.  And this is the result.  And we got to do some really cool stuff with this book.  This is the first edition.  The preview PDF was out several months ago.  But this book, Adam and I just, we blew it out.  There's two new chapters, tons of screenshots, tons of use cases.  I mean, the focus of the book is just answer the question, illustrate the answers.  The question, you know, what is the point of Wave?  So we tried to do that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Did you print a bunch, or is it more print-on-demand, and you can update it as you go?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, so what we did, well, the ultimate goal is to make it more print-on-demand,  so that people can get the current content of the wiki in their hard copy.  Are you going to use Lulu?  How are you going to do that?  Well, so what we did for this first print run, you know, we were thinking, oh, we'll just go with Lulu.  But we got to do this really neat thing.  We hooked up with this, or 3-1's, my publisher, hooked up with this charity in San Diego,  which provides job placement for developmentally disabled adults.  These are people who want and need jobs, but having a hard time finding them.  Anyway, they had enough faith in us to do a first print run of a few thousand copies,  and they're going to be doing all the book fulfillment and the orders processing and returns.  So when you buy a copy of the print book, which is $25, half of that money goes toward this charity.  So, you know, nothing against Lulu.  They're a great service, and they print beautiful books.  But this is a really good opportunity to sort of make your, you know, send your money to the right places.  So I'm really excited about that part.  If you don't want to kill trees, there's still the PDF version, nine bucks, buy it straight through the website.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you subscribe, do you get updates automatically on the PDF?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If you bought the preview PDF, you will get the first edition free as a thank you for supporting us early on.  We didn't know if we were going to be able to do that, but we decided to do that because it only made sense.  And the whole book is, you know, available to read for free on the website.  And so the idea is to turn around kind of new editions as wave evolves and changes as quickly as possible.  So we're trying to figure out a way to kind of meld this like web publishing and book publishing.  But we put a lot of work into this thing.  I mean, we had a copy editor just slaved over the index in this book, you know, because we're dealing with a print book.  You need an index. There's no control left.  You can't do a fine for a word, you know, how antiquated is that?  I know it's crazy.  A human indexing the book. It was amazing.  I didn't really think about that part of the process.  Those people are pros.  Oh, yeah. My copy editor, Marion, she's amazing.  I want to click the pages.  Yeah, it was really hard.  You know, putting I use Google URL shortener for the particularly long and complicated URLs in the text of the book because that's a long URL.  Yeah.  Yeah. So I'm totally excited.  It's available now.  Literally just went live today.  Brand new.  So I hope everyone will check it out.  And if you decide you can buy it, where, Gina?  CompleteWaveGuide.com.  Yes.  And thank you to all the listeners who bought the early copies and have just been, you know, visited the site, checked it out.  I really appreciate it.  I'm really excited about Wave.  I know there's been a lot of backlash, a lot of people saying that, you know, it's dumb.  There's no obvious use.  But to me, you know, Wave represents this kind of future in real time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Have you seen a new good application on top of it lately or anything?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think that Google is gearing up to launch some really cool plugins to Wave for Google I.O. in May.  So I think they're rolling out a new API for robots for building Wave extensions.  They've been launching a few new things here and there, like email notifications just got built in last week so you can get email notifications.  There's a link now, extensions, where you can browse and install extensions inside Wave pretty easily.  And I think they're going to have some goodies come May.  So, you know, Wave is still preview.  It's not even beta yet.  So I think we're going to see some really cool stuff come down the pipe.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can get the book now, The Complete Guide to Google Wave at Google Wave, complete wave guide dot com.  Never will get that right.  Thank goodness it's printed on the back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You need to give Leo his own short URL.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know. I know. No kidding.  So Google's testing Internet TV, TV's Internet search.  That is just the weirdest thing ever.  They're doing this with Dish.  I don't even know how widespread this is.  It's just executives.  Just to start.  So what is Google's plan with this?  What do they want to do?  Make it possible for you to search your TV?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. Organize everything.  What don't they want to organize?  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny.  We have stories about Google display ads, Google radio, Google now TV search.  I mean, Google really is into everything these days.  So this is according to Information Week, but actually they're quoting a Wall Street Journal report.  So we'll give credit to Wall Street Journal for this.  They're testing a search service that would enable users to find video content on conventional TV on the Internet and on the Internet.  Actually, this would be good for us because as a video show, it's hard to search us.  Precisely.  So how are they going to do it?  Are they going to transcribe it?  What are they going to do?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm not sure exactly, but I think it is a bit of the Holy Grail here.  You know, my theory is that right before the Oscars, WABC TV in New York was at war with...  Oh, wasn't that something?  And 15 minutes into the red carpet, they turned it back on.  But what's going to happen here in my view is that more and more stations are going to ask for money, get money from the cable operators.  It's going to go through to the consumer.  The prices are going to go up and the FCC is finally going to demand a la carte.  And if that happens, it's going to kill tons of cable networks.  And that's the beginning of Internet TV.  That's what it all starts to look like.  You just woke me up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got excited then.  Yeah.  That's good news.  That's not bad news at all.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think we should be pushing for it more and more.  I forget where it was.  I saw a list today, a very good list of the per channel cost for what we pay for cable.  I, not being a real man and not watching sports, don't give a damn about any sports station except my daughter, Jake's sister, likes tennis.  Jake does too, once in a while, so do I.  That's the only one we watch.  I think that's like four cents.  ESPN is $4.60 a month and I don't watch it.  Fox Sports is $2.63 a month.  I don't watch it and it's bundled.  40% of what I pay to cable or the fees that go to channels are sports.  Plus Spanish stuff, I should speak it, I'm sorry, but I don't.  Plus all this other stuff that I don't pay for.  And I think we're going to finally hit the point where we are subsidizing a whole bunch of channels.  So that's going to kill if this ever happens, if the FCC finally does protect us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's unfortunate because it's going to support sports channels.  They're not going away.  No.  But maybe the niche channel, Discovery Science or Discovery History, that's going to go away.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it'll go away, but then again, somewhere out there, there is the Leo Laporte of Science Geeks.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There is. His name is Miles O'Brien and he does great stuff.  Right.  And so maybe you think it's an opportunity for something like that.  But they don't have, we don't have, I should say, the budgets to do those kinds of productions.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not that kind of production, but you tell me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe we will. Maybe we will if everybody migrates to that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  A. And B. You can still reduce the cost to make a good, respectable production.  Right.  I mean, more expensive than this sitting around the table, but still cheaper than the way big old TV does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. Right. Well, you know, you can whine and moan all you want.  There's nothing you can do to change it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So once you're there, once all of it becomes TV, then searching that and finding that stuff is the Holy Grail.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so we're using Android as the operating system for set-top boxes, buddy boxes, and TVs.  And I take it back, it is not dish executives.  It is Google employees that are getting the access to this.  Didn't they learn anything from Buzz?  I was going to say.  Try it there.  Yeah, we know Google employees are not normal.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  A stranger crew you couldn't imagine for testing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, well, we don't know anything more about that.  That's basically what we know.  So an interesting insight into what Google is all about.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I want to say something about the FCC.  I've just got to brag for one second.  A week ago, I got to testify before the FCC about the public interest for TV stations.  And so I said, as I began my testimony, I said, I want you to indulge me.  Years ago, I have had fights with the FCC over freedom of speech through FOIAs.  And I want to begin my testimony today with one word.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bababooey.  Oh, man.  Bob Ford Stern must have loved you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, he did.  It was on the air a couple of days later.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He loved.  Oh, man.  He must have loved you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And do you think anybody got it?  A few of the FCC guys laughed.  Yeah, they got it.  I was so proud.  I got bababooey.  I mentioned it three times at the FCC.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you tweeted a picture, a capture from the screen of the closed caption person.  And you said, whoever is doing the closed captioning clearly isn't a Stern fan.  It says, to begin with one word, Bob Bubbly-ba.  Google Voice.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  YouTube captions.  Yeah.  Bob Bubbly-ba.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  That's very funny.  Take that FCC.  It does look like Google Voice might have done that.  It does.  It does.  Somebody sent me a...  I guess YouTube has now opened up the automatic transcription to YouTube videos.  So some of our videos that are on YouTube, people are turning it on and getting some  less than ideal results.  I got an email from...  It doesn't do a very good job.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Someone said that it's on by default.  Is it?  Yeah.  One of the producers of The Guild, which is this really good web show, is uploading their  latest season to YouTube.  And he wrote me to say that a lot of people are saying that it's on by default and viewers  are upset that it's not perfect.  Well, it's not very good.  It's not very good, right?  I haven't watched one of our shows with it on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm going to have to watch it now.  I've only heard from people who have.  So that's a little scary.  They've also added variable speeds to YouTube video.  So this is part of their HTML5 experiment, which I love.  And I turn it on all my browsers.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There's a whole panel here at South by Southwest about fun with HTML5 video.  I think on Monday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this must be part of it because if you're using...  So you need to go to youtube.com slash HTML5 and then it'll say, oh, would you like to  join the beta?  There's a link kind of buried in the text there.  And you click that.  And from now on, I guess when you go to YouTube, you've got a cookie set and it will default  to HTML5 instead of flash video.  If you've got it going, then next to the play pause button is a little arrow.  It's very hard to see a little red arrow.  And if you click that arrow, a panel with a tortoise and a hare opens up and a slider.  And you can make the videos.  I don't know why you'd want to do this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, considering how fast I usually talk, some people might like to have that actually.  Slow it down.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  People do it for podcasts all the time when they're listening to the audio, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this actually does what people do, which is a pitch shift.  So the audio doesn't sound weird.  It sounds normal, but it's speeded up.  So you can get through.  Watch Twig and half the time.  And it's well known that the human brain actually has better comprehension when stuff is faster.  So we actually understand it better.  So I've never minded if people listen to our podcasts faster.  And I guess you could now do video podcasts faster.  That's kind of cool.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If captions are annoying you, though, and YouTube, if you go to your account, playbook setup,  playback setup and captions, you can uncheck, always show captions.  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, you mean it turns them on always?  How annoying is that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Word on the street.  I haven't verified.  But yeah.  How annoying is that?  If captions are annoying you, though, you can.  I'm going to check my account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  YouTube has started to cover live sports streaming.  Well, it's the Indian Premier League cricket tournament, but it is live.  Is this new to YouTube?  I don't remember them doing much live.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the first effort.  They announced it a little bit ago, and I think it's just starting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They have all 60 of the cricket matches.  I've never watched cricket.  That would be one where you'd have a little slider.  It would be very handy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, my captions are on right now on my YouTube account.  This is beer.  It is beer.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is somebody trying to get us drunk?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Clearly we need to do this live and in person more often.  I had no idea.  Gina, have I decided we're already moving to Petaluma?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Would you please?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We would love to have you up there.  It's so nice there.  You know, we're trying.  This is, I don't know how well.  You know, remember Google says they're going to do gigabit Ethernet, or gigabit Internet rather, in five communities nationwide.  You have to be between 50 and 500,000.  My town, the little town of Petaluma, the city fathers, or whoever they are, the mothers, got the idea that we should be participating in this.  And they've asked me to kind of launch a grassroots effort because it would be great for Twitter to have gigabit Internet.  We pay a lot of money for tenth of that.  There are 100 picas pushing every time.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My mayor didn't respond to my email.  He's lost my vote forever.  Twinburg?  Sorry.  Mayor Bloomberg?  No, no, no, my little town in New Jersey.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I thought you lived in Manhattan for some reason.  No, no, no.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You seem so urbane.  I have kids who like oxygen in schools.  Oh, I'll go to heck with that.  It's overrated.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think any time between 50 and 50,000 should be lobbying for this, but I'm going to make a web page.  We're going to get, and I guess, I don't know what Google's going to look at, but I would imagine if there's a grassroots movement within the town to get that gigabit Internet.  That would be awesome.  It was Topeka that changed their name, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Was it Topeka?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Somebody changed their name.  Somebody changed their name, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google, Kansas, it was Topeka?  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I haven't set it up yet.  So should we show the chat room and everybody, we should brainstorm and create incredibly impressive things that Petaluma can do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Petaluma.  What could Petaluma do?  Well, we've got Twitter.  I think that should be enough.  What more does Google want?  Home of the president of the Internet.  Home of the president of the Internet.  Shouldn't the president have the best access of the Internet?  Of the Internet, anyway.  So we're going to take a break, come back with more.  This is This Week in Google Live from Austin.  At South by Southwest is a lot of fun.  Jake Jarvis is here.  I should talk to you in just a second, find out what you think.  Representing the future and all that.  Gina Trapani from San Diego.  She's visiting.  It's so nice to see you in person for the first time.  Jeff Jarvis also.  And Gina's book is out.  If you go to completewaiveguide.com, you can get your copy of it.  Don't forget, of course, what would Google do, which is still out.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's still there and still selling very well on Amazon.com.  More with Twig in just a moment.  But first I want to mention our friends at GoToMeeting.  If you are currently wondering, you know, why am I traveling?  Why am I spending all this time on the road, driving across town for meetings,  or worse, flying across country in the middle seat for meetings,  and you haven't really taken a look at GoToMeeting, I want you to do so.  This is a way that you can travel less and yet get more done.  We're all doing it now.  I mean, nobody wants to spend the money and the time and the stress traveling,  so we do conference calls.  But they're so unvisual.  I mean, you really need to be able to show them the PowerPoint  or the keynote presentation, maybe share spreadsheet data,  collaborate on documents.  That's what GoToMeeting lets you do.  From the folks at Citrix, they know remote access, they've got it wired.  They really have the best technology.  It's secure, 128-bit encrypted, end-to-end.  It's fast.  That's very important, very reliable.  And you can try it free.  How about that?  By going to GoToMeeting.com slash twig, G-O-T-O, meeting.com slash twig.  30 days free, unlimited meetings.  But you know, anything, it's only $49 a month when you decide to buy.  And you never have to watch the length of the meeting  or the number of meetings, it's unlimited.  Use it 24-7 if you want.  Free for the first month.  GoToMeeting.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  Netflix, I don't know if this isn't really a Google story,  but it's kind of relevant to the cloud.  Netflix had a contest, remember, last year to improve their recommendations.  At a million-dollar prize, a pair of researchers from the University of Texas  were able to win that million-dollar, is that right?  A million-dollar prize.  Unfortunately, the anonymized data which was used for the contest,  apparently, including movie recommendations and choices made by hundreds of thousands of customers,  could be used to identify them.  That's what the researchers figured out, I'm sorry.  That wasn't the team that won.  They took the data and said, hmm, you know, we can show,  this is the name of their paper, robust de-anonymization of large data sets.  How to break anonymity of Netflix Prize data set.  Party poopers.  They're from here in Austin.  We should go get them.  Osborns.  You've got to do this, right?  I always think of that as Ozzy Osborn.  So the Federal Trade Commission said, wait, hold on there,  and a lawsuit has been filed, and that means Netflix is going to shelve its plans for the sequel.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's really too bad, because that kind of data, that aggregate data,  if we can find a way to anonymize it, really has value for research.  I've written about this when it comes to medicine, that if we knew what happened,  in my latest medical condition, if we knew what people were doing 24 hours before they got it,  maybe there's something in there that's valuable.  And if we just lock everything in the earth down to privacy,  we're losing something as a society.  We're losing an opportunity.  I agree.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I've applied just recently for the personal genome project.  This is something that a Harvard geneticist is doing.  And what they ask you to do is submit your genome and then submit all of your medical records,  everything, your height, your weight, your hair color, everything.  They call it your phenotype.  And by doing that, they can match the two together.  But one of the things they say is, we can't guarantee the anonymity,  so we're going to warn you right up front.  We're going to print out your name.  We're going to tell everybody.  In fact, they are even offering for the – they've got 11 people who have done it so far,  including Esther Dyson is the most famous.  You can get a strain of Esther Dyson's cells because she participated in it if you want,  because the researchers need that.  And so this wouldn't be any good if they had to – they basically said,  recognizing the kinds of things that these guys at UT have realized,  you can't anonymize these data sets, so we're not going to promise it.  We're going to, in fact, make it public.  And what you can do with it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jake, what was the Leonard Nimoy Christmas napkin?  The Big Bang Theory.  The Big Bang Theory, that's it.  That's a TV show.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Who got his –  Penny gave Sheldon – she works in a restaurant, and Leonard Nimoy came into her restaurant,  so she saved a napkin for Sheldon.  And it has his –  And he's happy that he could create his own Leonard Nimoy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, how far off are we from that, really?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you could sell Leo kits.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if I – you know, I applied.  You have to get accepted to this.  But if I get accepted, they draw blood.  You actually have to fly to Cambridge, and they draw blood.  They do the genotype, then they do a long questionnaire.  If you get accepted and you have to –  What's the basis of acceptance?  You have to – besides applying, you have to fill out questionnaires,  and they really – one of the things you really have to do is say,  I understand the risks of what I'm doing.  And it's not just risks to you, it's risks to your family members.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, what is your wife and family –  They have to approve it, too.  They have to say yes, too.  Oh, so your family has to approve it as well.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Absolutely.  But what about your unborn children?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't get the hot did.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There are none of those.  There are none of those.  So that's one of the reasons I feel comfortable –  Are you sure, Leo?  I am positive.  There's no way that could happen.  So – but my kids will have to say yes, because half of their genotype will be known.  And, you know, if I have a predisposition towards, you know, I don't know, alcoholism or something,  it could hurt them in the marketplace.  It's exactly as you say, Jeff.  You lose something in society by this.  I think we have to deal with this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, today Dana Boyd, who's brilliant, gave a keynote here at South by Southwest  about privacy and publicity and raising a lot of good concerns.  And when companies kind of don't realize how they think that something's a little bit public,  they make it very public what that does.  And that's all true.  But I think we never talk about the benefits of publicness that we have today.  And what can happen –  That's a good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, you're – you, like I, like me, are very public and open.  Yes.  And so you think there's value to it.  And you told the world that I was incontinent and impotent.  Yes.  After you did.  But you see the value in that.  Absolutely.  And you're willing to take that chance.  Absolutely.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So these are the – I'm just showing you the public profiles.  They have people's names.  They have everything about them.  You can – like I said, you can get a cell strain from them.  It's out there.  And if I get accepted, it'll be out there for me.  But I feel like I can – since I already do live in public, I can accept that lack of privacy.  And it is for the public wheel.  So it's worth doing that.  For those of us who are willing to do that, it's worth doing it.  Yeah, I think so.  But you also can't ask anybody who's – just because I'm a member of Netflix –  No, that's true.  You know, my data shouldn't be public necessarily, right?  No, it's a challenge.  It's got to be informed consent.  Yeah, yeah.  But I think it's important, as you say, to recognize the value in this living in public, too.  There is some value to it.  It's not merely exhibitionism on our part.  I'm not a Netflix customer.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Are there dirty movies at Netflix?  Or just embarrassing ones?  There are.  Well, they're not X-rated movies.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But there are certainly sufficiently dirty that – well, you know, I'm on this thing called Blippi, which –  What are you nodding?  You're going, yeah.  So Blippi.com is a Twitter, but what it tweets automatically is what you buy.  So your Netflix is on there, your iTunes is on there, as well as your credit cards if you put them on there.  And so I'm fairly public.  But every once in a while a movie crosses the stream that I'm going, oh, I don't know if I should really have mentioned that.  I didn't know if they – you know, maybe my audience wouldn't like the gay schoolgirl in prison movies that I like.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So you opt to have your Netflix data?  You choose that.  And do you do it on a per case basis?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could, but who's going to do that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But who's going to take the time to do that?  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you just decided to –  Blippi gives you that granularity.  I think it's great.  And you know, I've got – and again, speaking to your point, I've got so much out of seeing what other people buy.  I've bought stuff that they – oh, that's great.  Or that movie is great.  You know, so there's real value to our sharing this information.  I guess it's just a question of informed consent and knowing what you're doing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Absolutely.  But it works for me.  Google Buzz is going to – you know, are you disappointed with the lack of speed?  I was talking to somebody yesterday, the speed in improvements in Buzz.  Do you feel like they made a commitment?  How about you, Jake?  Do you use Buzz?  No, I don't.  You use Twitter?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Yep.  Why don't you use Buzz?  It's just – I don't like the fact that it's in Gmail.  It's just –  Yeah.  If it was separate, I might consider using it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's problem one.  In fact, that's one of the things they're addressing, more inbox management features.  Yep.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And that was Dana Boyd's main point today, or Jake was there with me, that the big mistake  was that they mixed the public and private.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Well, she said people thought their email was becoming public because Buzz was public.  It's not clear, is it?  Right.  No.  And it's just that it shows up, like, when you click all mail, it's just all there.  It's too much to handle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's also not clear which Buzz's are public and which Buzz's are private.  Right.  And again, for people like you and me, Jeff, we don't care.  But I can easily see why other people –  I'll show you my tattoos.  Yeah, I can easily see why other people would care.  Right.  So I guess Google's – according to a Clinton Bolton writing in Google Watch, the Buzz team  is listening to your pleas.  They sent out a brief Buzz that it's working on two features to cut down the noise.  One, settings to control what gets sent to your inbox.  Yay.  Although we've all figured out how to filter it.  Yep.  But this way, you don't have to do that.  You'll be able to choose whether these Buzz items get sent to your inbox.  Comments in your posts, comments and posts after you comment on them, comments and posts  after you're at replied on them.  See, I just turn it all off.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This seems like a lot of configuration.  Yeah.  This is the, like, almost too many choices thing that Android suffers from a little bit.  I mean, it's great to have choices.  Geeks love that.  Geeks love it.  And I love it.  But it's, like, so many choices.  You know, I am filtering Buzz so it doesn't show up in my inbox.  But we have no granularity.  I just filter everything, label Buzz.  Right.  And I'm also, it bothers me to see that big unread number.  So I'm using a Grease Monkey user script to actually hide the number so that I can just  dip in when I want, but I don't have, like, inbox guilt.  Like, I have their unread items.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Twitter, you can go to whenever you want.  But Buzz, it makes you feel obligated to click that and read it.  It does.  It does.  It's the email metaphor.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah, so that's the problem.  You're mixing metaphors.  That's really the problem here.  Yep.  So I don't have any problem with having huge numbers of unread messages in any of my inboxes.  Because I just gave up on that.  No, you've read some of mine.  I gave up on that a long time ago.  You just, I mean, come on.  You're in box zero.  See, Merlin's still impacted you, Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I am.  I am.  Because I'm a special kind of uptight.  Give it up.  Really?  You know, well, it's just, I worry that something important is just going to fall down the stream.  I'm not going to fall up on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I know it's going to fall down the stream.  And if it comes back up again, that's actually the rule you gave me.  If it comes back again, then okay.  And it's important.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It is like it's to do this.  But like as a freelancer, something important could mean like my next play check.  You know what I mean?  So it just becomes like, you know what I mean?  So at Lifehacker, we got tons and tons of email in our tips box.  I could dip into, check out.  And if I miss something, it was like, it'll bubble up fine.  But you know, if I'm a freelancer talking to clients and looking for work, then I request from the boss.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's why email is so different.  That's why they mixing metaphors didn't work.  Because there is a difference between your buzzes and your tweets and your email.  Your email should be somehow separated and sacrosanct.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Has anyone done any studies yet on how much of one's Twitter feed is read on average?  You have this assumption that the kind of the rate base, the circulation of Twitter is that everybody reads it.  But not of course.  Obviously not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Although I've talked to people who go back, scroll back what they missed.  That's crazy.  That's crazy talk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I agree.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's crazy talk.  But that's not an inbox.  That's a stream.  A stream passes by and an inbox sits there and waits for you and haunts you with an unread number.  You weren't saying that you do that, Jake.  No, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You just dip it in whenever you see it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I thought I was going to use lists to create those people I really don't want to miss.  There are some people I don't want to miss, but I haven't used it that way.  I do.  Because it's another damn stream.  Yeah.  Who has time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jake, it's so nice to see you.  Anything you'd like to say about South by Southwest?  Are you excited about this?  It was good to be here.  Yeah.  It's cool.  Jake will be a freshman in college next year.  You don't know where yet, do you?  Not yet, no.  How's your daughter?  They're just waiting.  Any minute now though, right?  Very soon.  He's gotten a big acceptance.  Oh, you did?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Rochester.  Congratulations.  Congratulations.  That's awesome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a great school.  You want to go to a tech school?  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, that's a great school.  So you got that in your back pocket.  Yeah, exactly.  Now we get to let the other guys decide.  They're worthy of you.  Next few weeks.  That's great.  Why don't we bring Matt ... Is Matt here?  Did Matt Howey come back?  Yeah.  Come on over, Matt.  We'd love to have you.  Come on over.  Matt Howey is a legend on the internet.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This guy's my hero.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Metafilter.  And what else are you doing these days, Matt?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Fuelie.com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is Fuelie?  It's a ... Get real close to the mic.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  Completely public, open, miles per gallon tracker.  So like Fuelly.com.  It's pretty cool because you can ... If you're looking for a new car, you can see real world  mileage from 25,000 people.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you have something to think ... You have a thought about then this notion that there's  some value to being public in your data.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  Yeah, and we were totally upfront about that.  We still get an email a week, people going, I don't want people to know I fueled up or  that I got terrible gas mileage.  Or you can just go to the browsing vehicles to see a random vehicle.  This is fantastic.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So does that happen automatically?

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  No, you can SMS us or you can use a web app to just pop in your miles, probably from gallons.  So this is like Blippi and a lot of other services.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Could you connect it to Blippi?  Is there other data?  I don't know.  There's an RSS out for the data.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, Blippi right now is like they do the deals with the companies and the credit cards.  I don't think they have a way of adding stuff to it, which is too bad.  They really ought to.  This is Philip Kaplan.  He's one of those guys involved in the startup.  Well, it's so nice to see you, Matt.  So what was it like in the old days at South by Southwest?  It was tiny.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  So I've been here ... This is my seventh year.  I've been here 10 years.  10 years ago we did the first weblogs panel ever.  Like 40 people showed up.  I am a blogger.  And then the tech boom and then bust happened.  And then South by Southwest went from 500 people down to maybe 150 people in 2001, 2002 for interactive.  There's more people in the bar downstairs.  It was just one row of four rooms.  That was it.  And there would be two or three things happening at one time.  Then it would be like four panels at once.  Now it's 23 in every slot.  It's so many at the same time.  It drives me crazy.  In three different buildings.  Yeah.  There's over 10,000 people here for it.  It's crazy.  Why do you think that is?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's happened?

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  It used to just be like blogger summer camp.  I mean, like you knew the 150 people.  They're all sort of active bloggers.  And it was like seeing friends again.  It's hard to get more than five people to be recognized together in the same place now.  Finding them among like a thousand people at a party.  It's not easy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That age is so much over.  I was talking to Dave Weiner through links about the original blogger cons that he held.  Right.  And it was kind of a magical moment in the blog world where you really had that, gee, I get to meet you moment and you knew everybody.  But is that over?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's still kind of when you've I mean, just for me to see you guys.  Oh, yeah.  You still get that experience.  Right.  So, Matt, you're feeling well because you had an amazing blog.  Talk about living in public.  You had an amazing blog post.  Yeah.  What's that?  Two, three months ago.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Which we talked about on the show.  We did.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sorry.  I missed that show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, I wrote a post for friends and I thought, you know, there weren't that many stories out there on the web.  I might as well share it and see what other people I've got like hundreds of emails about it.  But I got 30, 40 emails from people with the exact same condition.  That was really awesome.  Just like what was public and private data, like people telling me their health story.  Right.  And like, you know, all but two or three of them had great stories.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Any regrets at all?  Any single regret from revealing?  No, not at all.  None.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  Zero.  Except people thought it was cancer and were like, I'd be like, what the fuck about you?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And most of us never will get that, you know?  Yeah.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  I mean, the first Twitter post I made sounded pretty grave.  Right.  Like, I collapsed, had seizures, and I'm going to have to have brain surgery.  Right.  Within, you know, 12 hours.  It was traumatizing.  Yeah.  And then I was like, oh, and then it sort of cleared, you know, got, the news got better in a day or two.  And then I started to like talk people down.  I knew that post had to be like calmed down.  I'm not going to die, everyone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you, what is it that makes some people like Jeff and me and you public and willing to post this publicly and others think we're nuts?

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't, I mean, I'm not, I'm an introverted person too.  I think we're all introverts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think I learned it from the web.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I learned it from the web.  I learned from the value of the blog.  I mean, I started my blog out on September 11 and that trauma of having been there.  Wow.  And I saw, I'll always remember the most important, you know, media education I ever had was when two bloggers in L.A., famous ones, Matt Welch and Ken Lane, saw my first post, thanks to Nick Denton, and said something about them and linked to them.  And then I responded.  And I realized it's a conversation.  Distant and distributed, but a conversation.  And that was a pathetic commentary of my life.  There was a life changing moment, but it was.  And by revealing, you saw that value that comes back.  I mean, haven't you learned that from the beginning of blogging?

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  I mean, you put it out, you put out whatever you, better than like I had a sandwich today.  You put out, you know, your thoughts and just like, you know, love was coming in in 2099.  And it's still to this day, great connections.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I do remember the first time I wrote, started a blog and I thought, this is, I felt egotistical.  It felt like it was very self-centered.  Yeah.  You know, and I was already on TV and I mean, I was already doing pretty egotistical things.  And even then it felt like this is, this is like creepy.  What is wrong with me that I'm doing this?  But I guess you quickly get reinforced that this is a.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  I think some aspects like a reaction to elections and the way the politics has done in this country,  really dig up some tiny aspect of someone's life from 12 years ago or 22 years ago where they said something.  And I was like, you know what, I work with databases and I was like, you know, if we were all completely public,  like, you know, 20 years from now, especially with like Facebook generation, everyone's drunk in pictures on there and people getting fired for it.  But like 20 years from now, it's going to be ridiculous.  You could railroad anybody.  So I was thinking when everyone's skeletons are out of their closets, there will be no skeletons.  Mutually assured humiliation.  That's what you call it. I love it.  Maybe the discourse will raise up, you know, because we're all.  Tolerance will raise.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But how many of you have had a stalker or a harasser?  That's true.  I mean, you have.  I have.  Have you? You have.  Psychotics.  I have as well.  Yeah, true psychotics.  And does the testosterone keep you from being like.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It happened to me long ago when I was on the radio and TV.  I kind of dealt with that from being a public figure.  I think you get I think it's actually better the more human you are.  I think a lot of that comes from being somewhat distant.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I got a more when I was a columnist in San Francisco than I get it now.  And it was it was spookier, I think.  So it's creepy.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  With like 100,000 people over like a long, you know, whatever micro fame media career online.  You know, one in 100,000 is going to be off their meds and off the rocker.  It sucks when it happens in like the first month or the first year of it.  But after like five years of it, you know, like, you know, how much of that a threat?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We have a nut job who's calling our home, who I think has no idea who we are.  And so it also can happen randomly.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah. But but the thing is, is like, do I want that one weird person who I totally expect to know exactly where I am in the moment or like what I'm buying?  You know, I can understand that.  I know.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  I'm probably my home address and home phone off the web, maybe around two or three years.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We also live in a little bit of a bubble because we still are talking to a small subculture that is higher educated, more normal, more higher functioning.  You know, you're not really I mean, that's the difference in mainstream media and what we do when you're on, you know, entertainment tonight.  Yeah, you're talking to everybody and you're much more likely to.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's even more than that.  And chat room blush here because you have an incredibly nice audience.  Well, I'm serious.  They've been mean.  But you know, you take somebody like me and I'm a gray beard in here and you invite me into this world and I'm not part of this world.  And there is an incredible welcoming nature to your audience.  They're very nice.  People stop me here and say, oh, I love Twig.  It's a reflection of you.  It really is true of the people who gather around you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's good.  And it's a reflection of you.  So we are living in a bubble, right?  It's the Leo bubble.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, and that's done a similar thing, a meta filter.  And I think what it is is it's a meritocracy, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What we do is we celebrate merit regardless of other externalities, whether you're a man or a woman or black or white.  None of that matters, age or anything.  And so when you celebrate merit, I think you attract a certain kind of person and you kind of foster that.  Boy, I'd love to foster that more globally.  I mean, that's a really great way to be.  It's not the way the world really works yet.  But maybe we're utopianist.  Maybe a lot of what we're talking about is wishful thinking.  But maybe you can add to that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If all you ever do is shut down to the worst common denominator, yes, you can find a reason to do nothing.  Right.  That's true.  But you've got to try with caution and with wisdom.  And I think you're right, Gina.  It's important for us to let people know what the risks are and what the prices are and then make sure it is their decision.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have to say, though, that the chat room can be harsh.  We've had people come in studios, mostly women, and the chat room can make very personal comments that are upsetting to people.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is why I don't look at the chat room.  Sorry, chat room.  I don't look at it too often.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think you're wise to know what you're...  And I often tell people who come into our studio, OK, we have chat over there, but don't look at it.  In fact, I sometimes will close it and not have people look at it because it can be very difficult.  And the truth is, most of us, we see one bad thing, even amongst a hundred great things.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The one bad thing always seems like the thing that you see.  So sorry, chat room.  Most of the chat room is great.  99.9% of the time, they're great.  I'm the chat room's best friend today.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I said nothing but nice things about the chat room.  These guys are throwing you under the bus.  Who loves you, chat room?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  See, the chat room is saying really nice things right now.  They're showing their...  The truth is, they do love Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do love her.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you know what?  I almost want to say first post because every time I come on camera, they go, boy, you look tired today.  And I almost want to say, oh, that's the first tired of the day.  And it happened today.  I came in.  The first thing I see is, gee, Leah looks tired.  And you know, it's just you get used to certain things.  And you let it run off of you, you know, right?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, well, a thick skin is certainly required apparel for a living.  But there's a...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And the key is there's a benefit to it.  So it's worth having a thick skin because of the great benefit of being more public and so forth.  True.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And part of it is that I know that we in media try to clean up the whole world for you and put a box and a bow on it.  Absolutely.  But the truth is there are bozos in life.  There are bozos on the Internet.  We all know who the bozos are.  We know who the trolls are.  You bet.  You bet.  Twits.  They're just all...  Sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Search Engine Land writing about U.S. regulators gearing up for a Google ad mob challenge.  Of course, Google acquired ad mob.  Or is trying to.  $750 million for this, what was it, two-year-old company?  Amazing story.  Why would it be a pro...  And by the way, Apple was also bidding for them.  Why would it be a problem for Google to acquire ad mob?  Isn't it just more of the same?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's the problem, right?  It's just more hegemony in advertising.  And...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The FTC is taking a closer look at the deal.  And of course, the competition doesn't like it too much because...  Surprise, surprise, surprise.  Should it be blocked, the Google ad mob acquisition?  Does that concentrate too much power in Google's hands?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google has Android already.  Google has mobile.  They're mobile.  And it needs to be able to help support that.  And those of us who want to create content for it and support local news on it, ad mob could be helpful to us.  So blocking it is a non-market inanity.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm with you on that one, man.  Did you order...  Anybody order an iPad?  Yeah, Matt's saying yes.  Oh, yeah.  Sucker.  Every employee.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  You ordered a bunch?  Yeah.  I don't know, but work for Matt.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I was talking with my CFO about whether we should get one for every employee, and we thought, well, we'll get a couple, we'll try them out, and then maybe we'll see if we want to get them.  How many have you ordered so far?  Four.  Four.  Cool.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Can I work for you or you?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to go with the, like, let it come out, see what people think.  That would be the wise thing to do.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  I know it's not going to be a good creation device, but...  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's some interesting questions.  I had a question on the radio show.  A guy who goes around to schools, he's a marine biologist, does presentations, wanted to know there's a connector that goes from the iPad to a VGA, so you can put it out on a projector case.  And it's got this mobile keynote for $10 that they're making.  He was wondering, is it going to be able to, can I do the keynote presentations with it?  I said, we don't know, but that would be annoying if Apple didn't, you know, sort of...

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  Keynote presentations and demos.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it looked pretty cool.  And if you could do, you know, take this little thing with you, have little presentations, plug it in, put it on a screen, I think there might be a, that's just yet another way it could be used.  I'm pretty exposed.

Speaker: Matt
Transcript:  I can't wait for just being a tall guy in coach class, not having a keyboard.  Like, I'll just have just the screen to watch movies.  That's all I want.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, we're running out of time.  Adam, do you mind if I don't bring Adam on?  I mean, he's here.  Is it okay with you?  Come on over and just say hi.  Just say hi.  Great to see you, Matt.  Thank you so much.  We just love Matt Howey.  One of the pioneers of the Internet and a great blogger and just a really great guy, obviously beloved.  Adam, nice to see you.  Good to see you.  So congratulations.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a great book.  CompleteWaveGuide.com.  One more plug.  And when you were on, you said you're also working on a buzz guide.  Yeah, is that right?  No.  Oh, that wasn't Adam.  That was Kevin.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Kevin.  Yeah, he's working on the Android guide.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Android.  Buzz guide?  Come on, maybe you like it.  I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If they keep adding options, perhaps a guide will be required.  The title, Buzz, what gives?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Adam, you're an editor.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is your title again?  Editor.  Editor at Lifehack.  I think in chief now they added it to the masthead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're in chief.  Did you make any more money from Nick for that?  Oh, all right.  I'll take it to the table.  That's very good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How's the South by Southwest treating you?  Are you enjoying it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good so far, yeah.  It's really, yeah.  I mean, it's been the typical thing.  I've been to Naria panel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I've seen a lot of great people and had a lot of great conversations.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's the new slogan I decided.  South by Southwest, it's made of people.  It's made of people.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  How about that?  What do you think?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just invented that just now.  So let's get to our tip tool and number of the week.  Now, Gina, I know you were scrambling to get one, but that's why I brought Adam over  in case you wanted to get him to do a tip for us.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, she says.  Adam, you got any tips for us?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  There are a few of them I was going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Talk about it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So there's a new Gmail Labs feature.  This is good for people who get their pop email in Gmail.  It was annoying.  Before, you had to enter your credentials for a pop account, and it would fetch your  email at sort of random times.  If you got a lot of email, it would do it more often.  If you didn't, it wouldn't do very often.  So if you go to Gmail Labs now, there's a new Labs feature called, I believe it's just  called Refresh Pop.  Let's see.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You can kind of manually force it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Refresh Pop accounts.  Yeah, so it adds a link at the top of your inbox.  So you click the link, say refresh, and it will repop your messages from your external  account.  So it makes it easier to kind of consolidate all your accounts in Gmail.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's great.  So turn that on.  We also bookmarked the one about adding.  This continued Quick Search Box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Quick Search Box was an application that the guy who made Quicksilver, I think, was  behind when he went to...  Yeah, Nicholas Jitkoff.  He went to Google and he made it for Macs.  And then they released it for Windows as part of the Google toolbar, I believe was the only  way you could install it, which is insane because no one wants to install the Google  toolbar.  No one wants the toolbar.  So it was like, if you want this application, it's just like an application launcher, install  this toolbar, which is actually like the most backwards.  I mean, you always unclick installing the Yahoo!  Ask.com toolbar or whatever when you're installing applications.  So anyway, yeah, I guess they've discontinued it from that, but you can still install it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The trick is to install Google toolbar, move the folder for Quick Search, then uninstall  Google toolbar.  It won't find the folder, but you still have the application.  That is so sad.  I feel like it's been abandoned though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's sad.  So no one wants to...  Forget about it.  There's no reason for that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Forget about it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If I may intrude on Tipland.  Please do.  There's a new fast window in Gmail that I haven't been able to use yet, but I find it  true that I...  Here I am.  I'm in tab think.  Whereas in Gmail, you're in screen think.  It drives me nuts.  So they've created a means to create a new window using Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's great, because it's one of those things when it used to be if you popped up  a new window, it would do the whole loading thing, and it sucked.  Right.  And now it's super fast.  It's great.  I mean, if you do that ever, which a lot of people don't.  Yeah, I'm not a new window person, but...  I do when I want to look at an email while I'm composing another one.  How many tabs do you have?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Too many.  I'm mad at tabs.  You're worse than I am.  Too many.  That's a geek thing, how many tabs.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, when you can't read any of the text on the tab, doesn't he know?  Yeah, exactly.  When it's just the fave icon.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Actually, Google is here at South by Southwest, according to the official Google blog.  Representatives from Google and YouTube are on more than 20 panels.  That was a number.  Was it really?  No, it's all right.  Was it really?  I thought you said another number.  All right.  At the Google booth, there ought to be...  There's a Google booth.  I didn't even know there were booths here.  There's booths hidden somewhere.  I didn't know that either.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Any swag from Google?  Anybody been there?  Oh yeah, we have a Google Maps bike.  We're going to talk about that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's one of my tools.  Because bike routes just launched.  Yeah.  Yeah.  On Sunday, the All Day Hackathon will give you a chance to get your hands dirty and build  applications using a variety of Google technologies.  There'll be prizes, including Android phones, Gina, for the best apps.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They're giving away those phones, man.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we're back, Leo.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So, let's get to our number of the week, if you are ready, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, if you haven't stolen it by now...  I didn't mention it.  99.9, just to get a news update in here, which is the Financial Times says that that is now  the odds that Google will, in fact, pull out of China 99.9%.  Wow.  How would they know?  The odds...  Is this the betting arm?  Sources.  But that's the word we'll see.  They still haven't set a date.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They haven't...  Are they even negotiating?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Evidently, they have been, and it has gone nowhere.  That's what the word is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Going badly.  I forgot what my tool was, but I have a couple of good tools.  We mentioned already that Google Maps has biking directions, which is just fantastic.  I think that's a wonderful thing for them to add.  And Gina has donated a tool.  This is in the Google Shopping for Mobile application.  It's not even really an application.  It's just the mobile version of Google Shopping.  Right.  They now have an in-stock feature.  So if you do a search within your mobile version of Google Shopping,  I presume if it does it in the mobile version, it ought to do it in the full-size version.  It should, but you...  There's now, if you do a search for a product, you will see whether it's in stock.  And if you click the In Stock Nearby button, it'll show you the stores that have it.  Very handy if you're searching for something that will be out of stock,  like an iPad or a Wii or something like that.  It works with three vendors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's pretty small.  Oh, it's limited.  There's another service that does this already that has like 25 or something.  But once you have an API, it's pretty easy to see how you just add it in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was visiting Best Buy this week, which is really fascinating.  Best Buy sees itself as becoming a media company, and they are.  They sell advertising in circulars.  They sell advertising in the stores, end caps, displays, and all this.  And to work with Google on this kind of stuff at a very local level,  you take the disadvantage of retail as brick and mortar becomes an advantage again.  And it becomes an advantage.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And this isn't a great tool, but I think somebody like you in New York would love this.  This is an 8-bit.  Oh, my God, I love...  It's a Google Maps mashup.  8-bit NYC.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Have you seen this, Jeff?  It's amazing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As if New York were an 8-bit game.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It looks like a cross-stitch that I want to have on a pillow.  Isn't it great?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Zoom in on that.  And let's zoom in on Brooklyn.  All right.  Where is Brooklyn here?  Right and south.  Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All right.  Now we're going to zoom in.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The plus sign is up on the left-hand corner there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Left-hand corner plus.  So as you zoom in, the little block trees and the little...  Oh, it's so cool.  But it's pretty complete.  I guess this is a mashup.  I want to get the little tiny people, 8-bit people.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, seriously.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And if you're in Austin, by the way, they just launched an 8-bit Austin as well.  So we can zoom in on Austin as if it's an 8-bit game.  It's the number 8-B-I-T-A-U-S-T-I-N.com.  Or if you want to go to 8-bit New York, it's 8, the number 8-B-I-T-N-Y-C.com.  And it's just cool.  If you're an old Nintendo player, or a Commodore 64 player, it's just a cool thing to have.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  If he pans you far over to New Jersey, it just kind of stops.  Hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You got a problem with that?  It goes 16-bit all of a sudden.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It just stops.  And credit to Brett Kamper who came up with it.  Nothing but a turd's mic.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Because the world pretty much ends somewhere in New Jersey.  Hey, hey, watch it, lady.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love it.  Hey, it's so fun to have everybody real and live and in person here.  Oh, I was going to mention that there's going to be an event if you're in Austin tomorrow afternoon, Sunday afternoon, at the coworking facility where we are, the Texas coworking facility.  There's going to be an open Linux event from 1 to 4 in the afternoon.  So come if you'd like to come to that.  It's open to, is it open to badge holders only or anybody?  Anybody into the open source thing?  Anarchists, so they don't care about your badge.  Yeah, anarchists.  We do really want to thank the folks at the Texas coworking facility for letting us be here.  Great space.  You're really a great host, Paul.  It's a beautiful space.  And the gang let us use it.  And thanks especially to New Tech who brought their TriCaster HD and cameras and the setup.  Really nice of you to let us use this for our broadcast today.  Thanks to Gina Trapani.  We're so glad to have you here.  Thanks so much for having me.  So nice to see you.  Congratulations on the book.  I got such a nice hug.  The book is out, completewaveguide.com.  It's a three bones thing.  And that's what it says in the back.  I'm just reading the back.  Three ones, three ones.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's not a B, that's a one.  It's a three, well three ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  B-O-N-S, it looks like a B.  Are you sure?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Three is a...  I thought it was a Jones thing.  It's a Jones thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We were reading way too much into that logo.  That's my publisher, three ones.  Three ones.  Threeones.com.  Not three bones.  Not three bones.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks so much.  Thanks for having me.

You do, you have a little Frankenstein scar.  Oh, that's great.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for having me.  Thanks for having me.  You're welcome.  Thanks for having me.  And I'm sorry, I got a little bit upset.  I'm sorry about that.  I'm sorry about that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm sorry about that.  I'm sorry about that.  Good to see you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good to see you too.  Jeff, by the way, is the walking wounded.  He had surgery yesterday and still came, I can't believe it.  I have a little Frankenstein scar...  You do, you have stitches there.  I've been staring at that.  Did they take the nodes out?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They took out arteries.  Oh, wow.  To test the arteries.  I have inflamed arteries.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they chose that very public place to take them?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Uh, yep, that's where they do it.  But I'm on drugs, I'm feeling better.  The last two shows I was sick and you didn't even know it.  Really?  Oh, I'm glad you're feeling better.  Jeff is very tall.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We have confirmed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As they say here in Texas, he's a tall drink of water.  We thank you for joining us.  We hope we'll see you next week back in studio or this week in Google.  I'm Leo Laporte.  Have a great week.
