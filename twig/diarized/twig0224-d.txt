Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  After the my last appearance whenever that was a few weeks ago a lot of people contacted me and said hey  I noticed you mentioned on your galaxy s4. You're running Google edition and not touch wiz. How do you do it?  So I had to buy it from Google  No, I didn't yes for no  This is a AT&T from the AT&T store  Rooted it loaded recovery mod loaded the Google edition or there's a couple different names for it, but I call it the Google edition ROM  And there's something about somebody extracted it from the there's several of them out there, right?  So this happened to be version 4.3, but since 4.4 came out  I thought during the show what I would do is take my phone and see if I could get 4.4 running  While we're discussing stories everything else this never works for me, but I'm going to do it anyway  Live demos. Is there a chance you'll brick your s4. There is a good chance of that. Yes. Oh, no how exciting?  Yes a little bit of a little bit of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they've pushed out for for for the Google edition s4  I don't believe so not yet, and they have it for your HTC one  I know Gina's uses a Google edition HTC one. Yes, they were supposed to put it out for the  Nexus 7 but they haven't no and I'm supposed to supposedly they said in a few weeks for the moto X haven't seen it either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't I haven't gotten it yet. It's I thought it was November 15th. Oh, well, that's a couple of days  You got a little yeah, so I still got a couple days up to date up to date

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So so where does the 4.4 GE come from so this is a OSP Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so what happens is the the lovely hackers over at XDA?  Developers take a OSP and reformat it to work on a particular device in this case the galaxy s4 from AT&T  So I will I just saw a ROM pop up there today. I've been waiting with beta breath  I check every day to see if 4.4 is there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So how do you do it you download the ROM from the site you put it in a place you can find it, right?  Right, and now you're gonna boot into recovery mode and install right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have to be rooted so root and then load recovery. That's the critical steps  That's where most people break their phones because there's some things you can do to break your phone during

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The root software now is pretty sophisticated  But one thing I would warn people is to make sure you have the root for the right there's s4s in there's s4s

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's four different forums over on XDA developers for s4s, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So for the different team mobile international XNOS version yours is a snapdragon version the XNOS version is virtually unhackable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, yeah, because of the they've got a lot. It's a Samsung and it's also a Samsung processor, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They never publish source code  So my international s4 I'm stuck with and I can't even update it anymore cuz I've triangle it too too many times  So I'm stuck but this is safe to do on an AT&T sprint team mobile  Right Verizon s4 if you get the right if you get the right thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always tell people to do and this is what I've been telling people  For the past couple of weeks since I was on last is go to XTA developers  Go to the forums and look for your model phone and you can find out what's possible and what's not  So start there see what other people are saying read the reviews I got it to work. I didn't get it to work  I bricked my phone look for that kind of stuff and then go from there and the the instructions should be pretty straightforward for anybody  Probably watching this show that's relatively tech savvy  You should be able to do it but follow the instructions read the reviews first make sure that it's gonna work the way you want

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You'll see if you go to XTA dash developers comm they have a device  Search but you'll see if you enter galaxy s4 that there's more than one galaxy s4  That's right. Actually, I did the wrong search. It looks like I don't know what's going on. Oh, these are these are articles not devices  Yeah, if you go to forums that XTA it says this always says find your device in the forums and it's I've yet to have it work  So let's not oh, maybe I'm supposed to enter it there. That's probably worse  So form dot XTA dash developers dot com, right? You could have also you have a mini you could have an active  You could have eight different carriers. So it's good if you can find the carrier  That  Get the number that goes with your carrier. There's nine five. Oh five. Which one do you have the nine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this is the I have a  This is the one three three seven, I think it is or the 9500 is the international it is late late

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Five I would guess let me just check I'm having trouble with a search or something going on  Yeah, I know the websites kind of it's kind of long see wonka Lee

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, you'll find it all here. I will find it. So I'm gonna do this right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know how this is it like network TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This I don't know what's going on. It's all wonky  Well, they would edit that out of network television. Yeah. Yeah, yes, they would so, okay  So can you do you have an over-the-shoulder shot for Aaron's phone so we can see what's going on  All right. So are we in recover? Okay, we're in we're this is this is 4.3. So this is Google Edition that I'm running

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been running for forever. It has great battery life  I'm on 4.3, but I want to go to 4.4. So  While we're talking about the stories, I'll go ahead and load the ROM and we'll see what happens. All right  You want to just show it you want to go walk through it?  I might take you already downloaded it. I have not so I've got a download show us that process first

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because you're gonna use a browser to download it, right? Right. So I actually did that already

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have the file on your SD cards, right? This particular ROM is called gummy. I don't know  I can't see that there it's called gummy is the name of this and it's supposed to be 4.4  We've got screenshots and everything  So I've downloaded that already and what I'll do is I'll show you what I'll show you how the process starts  Who did the recovery mode?  Exactly. All right, and then then we can go from there. So I'm gonna hold down power until the power off comes up

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you're turning it off completely off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it says yes, you're gonna turn it off and  Every device is a little different in the buttons that you have to press to get it to go into recovery  For this particular device you hit power, I believe it's volume up and the little

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Whatever this button is the home button all at the same time that up or down volume up power up up is recovery down is down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that fast fast boot fast boot? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you can see we have a custom ROM on there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's custom ROM and you notice there was a little thing in the corner saying there was it so this is this is recovery mode  this is recovery mode here and  So what you can do from here is you go down  There's lots of different things the one you want to do which I'm not gonna do right now exciting to download one more thing  Is install zip from SD card? Okay, and then when you go in there, it's gonna say choose is it got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's let's come back and we'll do that. Okay, so let me know we'll just interrupt and we'll say alright  he has downloaded all the files he needs and now he's about ready to and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We're still like that. We're gonna come back to Houdini as he tries to get out of the  dangling over New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So again just to recap you need to have a rooted phone to do this phone  So look on XDA developers for how to route exactly your specific model. It can be a little tricksy  Yep, once you've got it rooted you will also in the process of rooting you'll be installing a super user program, but also

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Generally recovery you need a custom recovery  there is a file there is a program in your phone called recovery and what that obviously allows you to do is go in and  load new versions, it's what the  The phone uses to upload when you get one of those, you know big file big downloads over-the-air downloads  Typically it uses recovery to load that new version of the operating system under your phone  custom recovery lets you do things like actually browse your device for the actual files you want to install and kind of overcome some of the  Limitations that you have in the stock recovery

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  application and I use clockwork mods recovery clockwork mod is very popular. What is the other one Torp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, there's another one TWWP I think it's called

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Which which works very well as also is it relevant that there's now a cyanogen mod launcher in the Play Store. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's interesting  It's a long it might be the Google launcher

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Huh, it's it requires tether to a Windows machine. So I can't yeah, it's a way to install cyanogen mod

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need what you need the Windows installer and you need to connect your you know  Your connect your device to your Windows machine and then run this installer it does help you install

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's pretty cool that in in the Google Store you can find a way to get rid of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they could ban that it's certainly Apple would right? Yeah, Apple would absolutely. Yeah. Yeah  Is that it I don't know if there it is one-click

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Installer for your Android phone. That's cool. There you go. I got excited then I saw I had a Windows machine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, there's a lot. I mean not to I think it's great  But there's just there's a lot of conditions here requirements  one being that you need a Windows machine and you have to download the desktop client and then connect your phone via that and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One reason that Google doesn't worry about this too much is the level of sophistication required to do this is  sufficiently high of a barrier to keep people who might you know, just want to mess around and then come crying to them for  Help. Yeah away. I mean it really you have to be a little bit sophisticated to even route it. But once you've rooted it  Then you probably will install clockwork  Mods ROM manager and it becomes very easy. Now. This is not available in ROM manager. So you're correct download

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a different ROM and it's I haven't seen clockwork  Or or Sanagem mods ROM for that includes any of the 4.4 stuff yet. So they're still working on them

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, let's cheer everybody up. Are you ready for the heartwarming?  Google video of the week. This could be a new

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They got they got kicked out

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are common for regular airports to have hangar. Oh, yeah have terminals that are company specific. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this isn't company specific this this this will be Google's but I imagine other other private jets could be there as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because it's being run by a signature

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Mmm, which is which does it a primary the other primary? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they've already subleased the majority of the project to a company that operates the private aircraft of Google executives. That's blue city holdings

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow now what's blue sir Chad what's blue city a reference to where what is that blue city holdings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, if you watch the 1990 whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I  Could swear to be I'm not joking. I could swear at the beginning of the commercial when you showed it  I saw the words blue city go by

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, maybe I don't know chat room do some research for us  HP and Google we were really excited about this HP Chromebook 11  HP and Google have halted sales following complaints of the chargers  Overheating they've pulled the Chromebook. Oh, is that it? Yeah from Best Buy sales have been halted on Amazon  HP and Google's online stores. It was a best seller on Amazon  customers complaints of chargers overheating  Best Buy told the verge that urgent instructions have been sent to store managers to remove existing stock of the devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's speculation on Google Plus  Somebody I know returned one and  And the problem was it had the same problem the original Chromebook did it was too low in RAM  It was only two gigs and it's gonna slow down everybody people complain about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much is in your pixel for gigs in the pixel? What's in the pixels ran for for?  Yeah, who should be enough for a simple operating system to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, it's not though for the tabs when you open up tabs on my original Samsung  It cuts luggage, huh? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You remember that they announced was it Google IO that they announced the Google Play for education  Finally here. Yep. Awesome. It ships on tablets  today  Google Play for education us only sorry  But it's been in beta for a while they say thousands of students and more than 50 schools have used it in beta  It will ship on the Nexus 7 from today the 10 inch ASUS  Transformer pad the 8 inch HP slate 8 Pro will be added early in 2014  So you'll have to have specific hardware to use the Google Play for education  Store oh really? Oh, that's weird. Yeah, so I guess  Yeah, you have to get out get something with it on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not sure what you're driving that but I think this is great. I mean the fact yeah, you know for education  The fact that you can actually think there's a video that shows you know what you can do with it  Basically, I mean teachers can collect where they're all the responses from their kids simultaneously  To see whether they're getting it or not  I mean, there's all just all kinds of cool stuff teachers can half the price less than price of an iPad  Oh, yeah, exactly. They can push out apps to their students on the fly

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In all fairness, I made fun of LA public schools getting the iPads versus Chromebooks  And so this is another tablet there no keyboard so for certain grades one short in the commercial I think fine  But you get much higher a Chromebook is a better

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I think it's a one-two punch. Yeah, in fact, I think some schools might choose to have both  Maybe you know a dozen Nexus 7s in the classroom to be handed out for specific times and then  You know what? I'm seeing Leo look crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's the one one-to-one. I'm seeing I  I'm in the Chromebook for education group on Google Plus and you see these pictures one just last week of 1800 Chromebooks  Being prepared for the students. It's really inspiring. It's really kind of great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean there was some there was a news report the other day. I heard that where you know kids from the age of like  One now are able to manipulate  You know smartphone screens  So, I mean, this is the interface that kids are used to now  I mean why shouldn't it be the the way that they interact with education, right?  If this is what they're used to using why are we forcing them to go back to older styles?  It's not I'm not saying there's anything wrong with books. Don't get me wrong. Don't take it too far, but I mean, you know  You know, but if this is if this is what they're used to this is the easiest way for you  I know I know I'm a book hater  I won't go into the debate about listening to a book versus reading a book but  If this is what they're used to this is what this is the interface that they should be using for education  I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Interactive in a way a book is not I love books  But you gave some examples right there tests and you know surveys and kid can be listening  To audio or watch an animation or movie you can see the progress exactly. Yeah. Yeah, there was a related story

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That teacher worried on her neck a microphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was it a microphone? Yeah, I've seen teachers wear those before sometimes when you have classes of smaller children  There's a lot of yelling involved. So having an amplification system also you might note that some of these kids are wearing  Yeah, some of these kids are wearing headphones too. So it may be that she's using that to  Talk to them directly. Yeah, whenever it's convenient for them. By the way, that's Frank Bonner the guy who's a turb tarlick

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I'm gonna look up and see if there's a wiki answers question for that guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Must be you know what turkeys can fly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I get it. I get it less nice man. That is a very  Reference but it is the most famous episode of that. Yeah, definitely ever seen because we're all too old  You know I we had wild cheese. It is just staring at us  In the yard the other day in our new house  Wild turkeys gobbling their way level yard. Yeah, we've got around our house to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tell them take cover before you know, I know I said run little turkeys run Thanksgiving is coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead looks like the tablets are with Google Play for education  They're based on are they're built on Google apps for education  So are they I guess my question is are they converting these schools over to Google apps?  For education so every student gets like their username at the school that edu  I mean it makes a lot of sense for Google to do that right because every kid you need a Google account to sign in  Right, right and you can't you can't necessarily assume that a kid especially one under 13 is gonna have an actual  You know sort of public Gmail or Google account, right?  So this is this is really this is really beneficial to the students, of course  But it also is very beneficial to Google not only they're getting kids using Google apps very early  But it seems like it seems like it sounds like they're actually converting these schools over to Google apps in the process

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And then along comes Larry page. He's going to have a pipe and he's gonna lead them all to a barn  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean they have had a specific program for education for a while Google apps has  Where you get free free access to all the app stuff for your school?  And then they also have one for nonprofits as well, which is which is free again  If you're a nonprofit you can get free Google apps account  I don't know what the limitation is there how many users you can add but they've had these for a while  And I guess it makes sense. I wonder if there's any  You know T's and C's about we will not share your data since you're under 18 or you know all that kind of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They'd have to there's legal at least under 13. There's legal issues  Motorola G announced the Moto G. Yeah, that's interesting low-priced version of the Moto X hundred seventy nine dollars. No LTE  You know the people were very upset that Moto X was only available in  the North America right North American market  Motorola has a sub $200 phone. That's that's unsubsidized price  Mostly based on the Moto X. It's a there's an 8 gigabyte version for 179  199 is 16 gigs both contract free sim unlocked no LTE  But that's not really an issue in a lot of these areas 3g is more than adequate  I'm not sure what's missing  It's got the edge-to-edge display the curved back the Corning Gorilla Glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Processors, you know like one little slower, you know, but the screen what's the screen res on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't remember. It's 720p, which is the same as the Moto X  5 megapixel rear camera  1.3 megapixel front camera Bluetooth for Wi-Fi. It's a Snapdragon 400. Yeah a little bit slower 1 gig of RAM  But as a result better battery life on the slower processor and less RAM, right? That's pretty good for sub 200 phone  That's very nice. Oh, yeah, and they're also gonna support Moto maker  Well, you can't choose custom colors of the device, but you can get a shell sort of you get a shell and yeah  Okay, and you get 65 gigs of Google Drive along with it. Nice goes on sale today in Europe and Brazil  It will be available in the US as well as India in the Middle East  30 countries 60 partners

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  G stand for  Cool this is a this is great  I mean this is you know  They just said that Android is aiming to get the next billion people online, right?  They want to Android wants to run on low-cost devices and if Motorola wants to lock in I mean  What's the best low-cost device out there right now?  Well, you can get there sound there are Samsung ones. There's Nokia to for yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But in terms of smartphones with on Android you can get a basic basics  Samsung I think the the school the s4  for  Closer to 100. I think if I'm wrong here you can buy one on Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you there's if you go to Virgin mobile, which is the carrier that my family uses  They actually have a couple of phones there for like 70 bucks that you can get  That's subsidized. They're not running KitKat granted, but they're ice cream and a bug. These aren't running King cat until next year till January

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Well, yeah, okay, but they'll be they will get kicked yet  And they're getting that fairly I mean the moto X is a fairly pure Google experience  It's not exactly a Google experience with fairly pure

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the other interesting thing is that all these international phones the standard for them is they come with FM radios?  Isn't that funny?  It is I was never figure out who wants an FM radio, but I guess radio is still alive

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just not here in the US  Android has 81% of  The smartphone market for the first time ever  This is according to IDC the analysts  That's in the third quarter 80% of global smartphone shipments in the third quarter  So that's a big jump. Although Windows phone did pretty well  It had a year year-over-year growth of 156 percent in the third quarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There was Henry Henry Blodgett did I called it slidegasm he did at his conference he did this  123 slide presentation was very good and in there he talked about about platforms  And he said ladies general we have a winner and the winner is Android. Yeah  The number I got more than one number. So this is fine to use this but at the I think I have a slide at the end  60% of all new computing devices  Run Android there's a chart at the bottom number. It's victory for Linux. Yeah, absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  iOS Apple's iOS twelve point nine percent  Samsung thirty nine point nine percent  So yeah, this is a very big jump for Android  And BlackBerry one point seven percent down from four point five percent  That's that that's that little blue stripe in the middle of that sea of orange and red  Be maybe saying bye bye to Dalvik. This is probably more appropriate for all about Android which Gina and  Erin our regulars on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we discussed this that link last night with Brian Kluge. Oh good. We're non-tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Perfect guy to talk to you about this. So what is art and why do we need to replace Dalvik? What is Dalvik Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dalvik is the is the runtime environment  so when you  when you make when you build a Java application that you produce bytecode versus machine code and Dalvik is this is this runtime environment that runs between  The hardware of your device and your Java bytecode and translates it for to run on on the device  So it's a runtime environment, so that's what Dalvik is and and and art is the Android runtime  It's basically Google rewriting the runtime that will run on all Android devices from scratch from the bottom up  and they want to replace Dalvik with art and  The reason why is basically comes down to performance  Better they're saying that you that you get better better performance out of it Dalvix been around for a long time  Android's been around for a long time and rather than you know continued to improve Dalvik  Google wants to throw it out the window and start from scratch and start over and you know, we've talked about  Chrome was it was what was a way that Google kind of started from scratch with their own browser  They forked web kit and went with link  I mean, you know  We've seen Google do this a couple times now and just you know start from the beginning or or fork something off and say hey  We're gonna leave this old technology behind and start new and I feel like this switch to art is  Is part of that this doesn't this won't affect users in any way  I mean if all goes well users will only enjoy a  performance boost a speed increase  And you can switch to art on KitKat right now if you enable developer options  But if you're thinking about doing that you should watch the episode of all that Android we did last night because Ron Richards my co-host  Did that he tapped that button right there?  And and all went well until he tried to use one of his most important apps  Which did not work with art and wound up had the fact wound up having a factory reset his phone, you know three days later  Ready yet Ron ran into both WhatsApp, which is an app. Oh, I don't care about what's app

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't care about what's up a lot of people do holy cow. What's app is amazing hundred million images a day on WhatsApp

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's extremely popular  So we're still kind of early and if you google whatsapp and art, you know  There's you know thousands of people screaming about how it doesn't work with art that work gonna fix of course  It's early days and art isn't quite ready, but that's what art is  It's just it's a new runtime for for Java for for Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Java bytecode. Yeah, it's worth pointing out. This is for developers. This is a developer feature. It's not for average users  You're not gonna get that much  In fact the the ROM that I'm loading now there was a big warning on it that said, you know  Do not use this with art stay with Dalvik for now because there are too many users with too many problems for me for this  particular developer of this ROM to support art right now because there's just too much going on so just keep that in mind it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What all real advantage to using art, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's not the performance improvements are not like, you know, blow your doors off right now  You know what?  I mean that they're not so significant that users should should be you know clamoring to switch the developer options  I think that I think that for me it sounds like art is about future proofing for Google getting ready for for new kinds of  Hardware that are coming out and and just and optimizing for changes, you know changes to Android come in the future  But right now I mean a few a few blogs through the Android blogs have published side-by-sides of running art and Dalvik  And using that their devices  There might be a slight performance improvement, but it's not it's not that noticeable

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So according to the Android police still in Coombs writing or Cody Toombs not Dylan Coombs  I don't know who Dylan comes is Cody Toombs writing says that the way Dalvik is is just in time  Java runtime, which is not uncommon where you as needed you you compile the the run the code the p code the pseudo code into  application  But art apparently in fact what if I do this thing? I'm gonna do it  if I do this thing it will go through all my apps and  Precompile all the bytecode into machine language and and that'll be done and that instead of just in time. It's ahead of time compilation  Which means that?  In theory this stuff would run faster, right? It doesn't have to interpret bytecode as I go. Yeah, especially startup time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alright, let's see the application should be I'm gonna so this is by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The way you get your developer options you tap what you tap the build number five seven times  Yeah, like this and it goes yeah, by the way, did you see this if I tap and I get the K for kick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The jelly beans tap tap it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It makes me hungry for yet there's more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's more hold down. I thought Leo was gonna get mad about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think you I think you hold tap and hold the logo tap and hold the logo

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a guy no, I want candy. Where's my candy?  Yes, it needs to just hatch an actual kitkat bar, right pop it right out of the the phone port. Oh  Here we go swipe down  There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For those just listening Leo  Rather nonsensical bunch of little nice little Android honeycomb screen. See if you can identify

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  the version of Android donut

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Donut was if you if you hit fro yo bigger one

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can I is it like concentration? Can I like not quite if you hit if you hit two the same?  It'll make a bigger one. Oh, yeah, look at that and then wait a minute  So there's the jelly bean I need to tap another jelly bean  That makes a bigger jelly bean and look if you get it big enough. Here's a cup here a donut cupcake cupcake cupcake  Cupcake cupcake and then look what happens  Wow  That's fat that is amazing how do they do that

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's delicious but  This is a just-in-time kitkat bar. Just a word of warning

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not an ahead-of-time kitkat no

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Alright, so I'm gonna how do I get the hell out of this message was brought to you by  Hershey  manufacturer of fine snack foods  So Nestle, this is a Nestle kitkat. That's like alright. I'm gonna go well Hershey owns in the US  I'm gonna go to about phone. I'm going to go. No, I'm sorry developer, right developer options select runtime use art  Reboot to change runtime from lib DVM  So to live art so okay  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now it's gonna do it on your decks files over to the whatever the is there no going back  You can go back  Reset because whatsapp was broken even after he went back. So I think you can go back like uncompile it  Yeah, you'd have to switch back to using the decks files that the files that Dalvik produces

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cool. No, I'm playing that game somewhere when it's rebooted. Oh man. Are you ready for a route for a ROM update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  installing your  4.4 right cap right so you two can have candy coming out of your phone quick update. I hope so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope I get that so quick update what we've done is we downloaded the the files that I need I need the ROM file itself  And the G apps, which is the Google apps  It's a zip file with all the Google apps that I'm gonna apply. This is typical of a ROM

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't ship with it can't ship with for legal reasons the Google apps are right. They're not open. So they're not allowed to distribute

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll be right. That's right  So what I've done is the next thing you have to do is you have to wipe you a factory reset and wipe your cache  So I've done that ahead of time here just so you can see so now at this point if I was to reboot my phone  It would boot up like it was a brand new device right I could still reboot it at this point  Yeah, I haven't really done what you'd want to do is back up before you do this definitely back up which I did earlier today  now I'm gonna go ahead and do what I was talking about before which is install from from this from the  SD card and I'm gonna go down and find my gummy  ROM

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You said you had to download something else. So what is the G apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The the guys the G apps gummy is the ROM and G apps was what I forgot to download  So now I've got gummy I'm gonna go ahead and install it  It's gonna say are you sure you want to install this cannot be undone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, I'm gonna install it and you'll see it'll just ask you can to install the G apps at a separate time or when do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't ask you to do anything after this so it sees the G apps and installs them automatically you know you  So after this the next step I'll do which I will go ahead and do the same process  But also like the G apps zip file to install after the ROM ROM is done  So that's where we are and we'll come back in a few minutes and see how this is going

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Installing gummy right now. I feel like the brownies just went in the oven

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's exactly right and meanwhile my apps are being optimized much more slowly than usual when you stall a new ROM you do get this  Optimal is that doing Gina you must know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Optimizing I think I think what that is doing right now is it's converting  It's doing the dex files the Dalvik files to the art file anytime you change roms you get this optimizing

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Usually goes fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That happens every time you install a ROM and I believe that came out when butter  Do you remember butter came out with I think it was ice cream sandwich or something?  Yeah, that's kind of like what it does to get the app  Oh dexing them or is it something separate from it's part of the Odex process. Yeah, absolutely  Wow, that's very nice. You're being shown up here the boys

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Each what are you gonna destroy? Yeah, I just we both bricked our phones. What are you gonna do? Yeah, come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm good with a working phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm good. I'm not brick yet. They're not brick yet. Stand by it's the destruction derby

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know Ron was saying like I could have fixed it but it would have taken a few more hours and like it's my phone  I need it to work and that's kind of how I feel. It's my phone  You need to work. I can only do that to a test phone a secondary phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's good to know if I were a whatsapp user  But I'll let you know what this is good for me to do because then I can say what apps don't work with art  Things like that, so I'll play what is it that you're doing that the Nexus five is the only one that I have a KitKat on  Right, of course. Yeah, I love this Nexus five. By the way, are you happy? Did you get yours?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You yeah, I'm very happy with it. I mean I still take your point that I think they're the Phillips that are on the  Lex yeah are appealing. This is a bit. This is a  Raw Google phone, but yes, it's very very nice. I  I have AT&T on this one  And so I put on the AT&T international Wi-Fi thing as I'm going yeah Europe and that all that sucks down the battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know AT&T software really

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jesus so I killed it back off to the battery other than that works pretty well  I haven't used the camera a lot yet, but it's a better camera than the moto X

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's if I could get the moto X features on the Nexus 5 it'd be a no-brainer for me  I like the screen better. I like the camera much better. It's a real, you know, despite what the verge said  I think it's at the Nexus 5 cameras excellent. I'm very

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've seen some really nice photos on Google plus now some of those may have been  Optimized but most of the people that are posting photos say hey, here's the optimized, you know, the automatic  Here's the unenhanced versions and they to me they look pretty good. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm getting good results out of it very happy with that, but the moto X has such nice. It's the little things  It's the moto assist. It's the active alerts, you know, there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean I do what I'm in the car, you know  I saw I'm not gonna ruin Gina's tip, but but I can talk to it  Not quite as smoothly, but it still works  So no, I'm very happy with it all in all and so people rise be nuts every time I switch phones  I wish I could just replicate  and then  So once I've installed everything the real pain in the butt is that I then have to go and find like a whack-a-mole game  All of the damn notifications that everybody puts back on again. Oh  Yeah, just at me and yells at me and screeches at me

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It should remember your default settings notifications, I agree. Yeah, you know this phone downloaded all the apps I'd ever installed on Android  I trust how did it do that?  Well, it's a Google phone and obviously you can see the Play Store normally what I'm not really sure what the rules are about  Redownloading your apps because I always set my phone to backup and restore through my Google account  Sometimes a phone will download all the apps that I had most recently  This is the first time a phone's ever downloaded every app I'd ever installed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh not even the ones that were installed before but even the ones that you didn't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  installed  Which is a lot of crap Chad you should share your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The tip that blew all of our minds right? Oh Chad knows how to fix this. Well, so so yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ron had the same issue that basically what happens is if you go to the  The the store there's a section of the store. That's all of your apps and that's what it  That's what I know how to eliminate apps from that. Here's here's but do you know how to batch eliminate them?  If you do, okay  So this is this is what blew everyone's mind was that if if you go to my apps and then swipe over to all  I could show it over here, right anything you can you can long press and then you can select multiples at a time

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had fortunately I had done that not so long ago. So  It didn't install every app ever  But still far more a larger set of apps than I actually wanted  So as you know you and by the way, I like this new they're doing what do you call it the hamburger Gina  It's really nice to use the hamburger now on the on the app store a lot easier  Yeah  So this is all I've ever installed and I'm just repeating what Chad just told us if you press and hold that you can now  Multiple select notice ones that are currently installed will not be highlighted and you can remove  You're gonna want that no, I'm actually gonna I'm not gonna say yes, okay, but I had already done this thank goodness  Because if I hadn't I would have got a lot of crap and then you can delete these all at once

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, really handy. Isn't that nice? I don't understand how it downloaded any I have to download each app individually from my play account  How do you get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's that's what I'm confused about because sometimes that happens with the phone. It doesn't download anything  Sometimes it redownloads everything I had on my last  Install and then on this phone redownload everything I ever had. So what are the rules? Does anybody know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't been able to figure it out. This is something it seems to be random  Sometimes it doesn't download anything and and then this is the first time I've heard about downloading everything  But usually what it does is supposed to do is  Install the apps that you had most recently installed on your last device and that's what nine to not what oh four times out of five

Transcript:  Yeah, something to be aware of the Google Play services update which I just got today has maybe some negative  side effects according to Android police  What is this by the way the play services update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know they're always updating play services  No, well, it's the let's see it's the it's the Google services or Google settings app

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let's see this guy. Yeah, it's called kind of funny in my updated like it didn't it just kind of it was a strange update

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm. It's a gray icon. I'm not on KitKat  But it's a gray icon for me, and then it's got you know  It's got all the apps that are connected to play services listed there  But it the Android device manager if you turned it on to be able to remote remote remote wipe your device  Apparently this update  Unchecked that box for some users it didn't for me. I checked mine, and it was and it was as I had left it  And I just checked to see if it's activated just check to see if it's still it yeah exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly, let's see what because you don't want to get your phone stolen thinking that that's turned on and then not have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then not have it turn on exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what if I weren't installing art right now, I would I would check mine  Ever hear of a company called reputation changer  They changed their name had not I had because they bought ads  On the local LA State radio station where I work and they the or they were trying to me  I can't remember if they bought ads are trying to buy ads and somebody said would you do an ad for them?  So I looked into a man. I was less than  overwhelmed by  the company's  Mo that they've changed your name now to brand.com which must have cost him a pretty penny  There's an article about them and the companies that do this in courts  You know the problem is and it's a big problem, and I'm very well aware of it  You you don't control what Google search results will show up, and if you have not been active  Online if you haven't been a busy little bee posting stuff on your blog all of us are very active  But tweeting and Facebooking and blogging  Then if somebody else posts something about you that's going to be one of the first results in your search  You don't control that and if it's nasty stuff. That's what people are going to see when they Google your name  It's one of the pieces of advice  I give teenagers is is do get active on the web be proactive in managing your reputation online  By putting the stuff up on the web on Twitter on Google plus on Facebook on a blog own have a web page and  Post stuff there because that's going to be what people will find about you  And you want to make sure it's stuff that you put up there that reflects you well in case of this  So what reputation defender what reputation change these other companies do their variety of things is fairly expensive  One of the things they do is they'll put a lot of a lot of posts over your name  And eventually Google will index those and even if they have nothing to do with anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know I think it's the reputation.com  Method is to put a lot of stuff  I've got this with this one what the reason I put this one in was interesting about this one is they said no no no  We'll erase it. We'll get it erased. Yeah, so it's just it's just thrown in there  Oh well  They have to go to court and get it to be declared to be libelous and then Google will take it down  Like that's something you can do very easily thank goodness in this country  We have laws that don't make it that simple to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and that and of course if it's not libelous if somebody posts something that's true about you  However scurrilous your stock right can't get them taken down  So your brand comm will sue  This is a big business. I didn't according to this court's article the market  Which is one was one point six billion dollars in 2011 maybe as much as five billion dollar market by 2015 a lot of people  Have these problems right? I think it's very common well, but or they're being scared into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You listen to the reputation.com ads, and I know the CEO of the company  We've you know sparred about privacy and publicness  But they advertise that there's will put you know the truth up front well not necessarily maybe a restaurant really does suck right?  And then what they're putting up is your PR

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It has to be libelous. I guess it could be also DMCA. They could get stuff taken down for copyright violation  Well for now  And then brand comm also suppresses it it says by populating results with positive information  that is authoritative and truthful and  And it's true that if you can get that first page cleaned up  you're good, but  $7,500 a month for that fee mm-hmm and that betcha that's the starting price. Yeah, if they're gonna go to court  That's gonna cost a lot more I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I'm trying to try to be open-minded about this  I'm okay with the whole like somebody's supposed to something to famatory libelous  And I don't want to do what the paperwork so I'm gonna hire someone to do that for me the whole posting positive  positive stuff about the client just sounds like  What do you do? I mean sounds like SEO sounds like spam it is those totals we am but it's the only thing you can do isn't it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What can you do?  So I mean this is why I tell you actually but post now your point was you can actually be there for real and

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do good things and add good things and say things that are worth linking to and then that's legitimately rising

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But there are a lot of people adults  Today who never posted anything on any  And they're very vulnerable  What do you do?  Very close friend of mine very close friend of mine has this problem and I just don't know what to do about it except say  You know create a blog post as much as you can  But it's it's there really isn't much you can do retroactively. It's very hard  You really need to be proactive and and create a reputation online now, and that's what I tell kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've got to create a reputation online. I had a great meeting today with the CEO and founder of Lex blog  Which is a lawyers blog platform?  He owns it entirely he has a thousand blogs eight thousand lawyer authors and  It's fascinating how he has to get across to them the idea that if you're not out there talking about what you do  Nobody's gonna hire you from the yellow pages  You've got to be out there saying what you do. You've got to be showing your leadership  You've got to be talking about stuff and as I was talking to him, I think there's huge opportunities in areas like therapists  You know you look at that online all you get is pictures of flowers. You don't know what they  Totally agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Totally other areas yeah, I just read that 30  I think it was 31% of all schools are now looking at social media postings for their applicants of colleges are looking at the social  media postings for their applicants and and it came up because a  Young lady who went to a college informational college seminar  as a high school senior  Well, I can't was it Rutgers. I can't remember what school it was no it wasn't no it was another college  I can't remember was but she went to the thing and she sits in the back row and tweets these people are so stupid  Oh my god, I can't believe how idiotic this is and just goes on and on then applies to the school  The school says she didn't get in because your record didn't justify it, but you got in you got to think

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The school also said even if her record was good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We wouldn't want her in here  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean at 31% of schools now look at your social media postings before they accept you Wow  So again another reason why teenagers ought to be active online and put your good stuff up put the you know your track  record and your best a plus papers and you know just put stuff when I've met with high school students they get so paranoid about

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It that they'll say the opposite is that no and I've got to expunge my entire record  I've got I've got to be nothing because I've been trying to get into you know a good college  But I but I agree with you Leo that's the wrong way to go impress people with what you are

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well what a lot of them do of course is they create a Facebook account under a pseudonym  Yes, and then they change it when they you know so that you have this or you know somewhat of a pseudonym  Like purposely misspell their last name or right? Yeah, it's you know, it's good if you have if your name is John Smith  You're probably all right  If your name is Gina Trapani  Jarvis Leo Lafort Erin Newcomb  You probably should pay attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dana Boyd also talks the brilliant Dana Boyd talks about how young people are very good at speaking in code, right?  She does great great story, but we all understand the code now, right? Yeah. Well, no, no, no  This is this is my favorite story of Dana's  And she's told it often a young woman 16 years old her mother's follower on Facebook and it's fine with her  She's cool with that  But she's having problems with a boyfriend and she doesn't want her mother to smother her with with concern and affection and all  the horrible things that parents do hate that and  So she thought about it and she put up now  I always forget this the end of life of Brian the song he sings as he being crucified is

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look on the bright side of life. Not yes. Yeah, I was gonna say every sperm is sacred, but that's earlier. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look on the bright side of life look so she puts up the lyrics to look on the bright side of life  And so her mother says oh good dear. I see you're having a good day. This is so nice  Oh my god, what's wrong?  Right, so she speaks in the code that her she knows her peers

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Any teenager today knows life of Brian they would

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See that was that what it's called sub tweeting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like sub texting a little different sub tweeting is when you're talking about someone without  Mentioning saying their names so they don't know but everybody else knows  Oh, I like that so it's it's but it is more like speaking in code  So cultural references that family members wouldn't get yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me ask you guys a question and do me a favor and sub tweet this  I know you'll know who it is. Don't say it. I don't want to give this guy any publicity. All right, okay  So there's a guy who thinks he's funny  I wish he were that I'd be okay with this who has a fake account based around  Oh, I don't know some journalism professor you both know  I'm not saying we is I'm not saying who he is Jay Rosen. Okay, go ahead. I  Get email from my one of my deans on the other night saying oh my god  There's this guy who has this thing and he's posting pictures of penises and he's in this horrible ridiculous stuff  And I said to say yeah, I know  But I said if I if I complain about him, I'm gonna get you can do crap  Leave it nothing you can do. She was she was amazed of this. No, you're kidding. This happens on the internet  The internet is a terrible place

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  terrible place

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Verified right Jeff on Twitter. I'm verified. I'm verified. Yeah  It's an obvious parody

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  She were funnier

Transcript:  That's funny, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Contacted the guy. He also doesn't have the balls to talk to me. I said, you know, let's talk and  He was too chicken

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey Twitter owes you money a  lot of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  nice  All right, so let's do it  80,000 so here's the deal. This is a interactive infographic from Time magazine. I think it's fairly accurate based on the  Stock of the valuation of the company Twitter, which is probably higher by now  And the nut, you know the number of people tweeting and the number of eyeballs each tweets  Sees at only 25 percent of people pay attention. So it it's fairly conservative  time estimates that  Twitter owes you twelve point four or five cents for each daily eyeball that you reach Gina Trapani. That means they owe you  thirty two thousand eight hundred sixty one dollars  Amongst us  Ninety-four thousand three hundred sixteen dollars. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Erin, what's your Twitter? I'm new come all one word aro aaron aaron

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  NW any WC OMB  Why did you have a name? It's so hard to spell  Thirty-five dollars. Wait a minute Erin. That's not your real name. Did I take that wrong?  Is that really your Twitter handle and that's how much it that's depressing that is that's awful that tells you I always say this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't hang out on Twitter. I don't hang out. Yeah, well, I'm on Google Plus  So you get even less money than we don't get thirty-five dollars though

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just depressing Chad. What's your Twitter handle? Oh, yeah, it's like I think it's like a four hundred twenty three bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll take it. That's an iPad. I'm hanging out with the wrong people. Okay. I don't feel so bad now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I don't feel so bad now this Jeff just tweet like so much more than us is that I have a yeah life

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Katy Perry four point four million dollars  Barack Obama  5.2 million dollars  Lady Gaga two point three million dollars  So it's not just it's not just how much you tweet or how long you've been there. It's all of the above  Now, of course Twitter is gonna give you absolutely zilch zilch  well, oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, what is the it's like saying it's like saying that because I buy at Amazon Amazon owes me money, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's not like saying that it's like saying if you wrote a sentence a day  for you know five years and  Somebody published those sentences and made a lot of money on that wouldn't they owe you money

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's like saying that the phone company owes me money because they make money off be talking on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's not  It's your content that they make money on. Yeah, but you voluntarily use the admittedly you put it there admittedly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You put it there. So understanding that you weren't gonna get yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Buccus but so there is a difference between a company  Facebook's kind of the same right Facebook  The only value in Facebook and Twitter is the value put there by people who put stuff on it Twitter more so than Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because Twitter is all about the content that's there see what really occurred to me is I hope to heck that they gave Chris  Messina some some friends and family stock

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do him money because he invented the hashtag  Exactly. I doubt very much real value the woman who drew the fail whale  posted on  I stock photo and  Twitter bought it royalty free for like 50 bucks  You didn't get any money for the fail whale she got some notoriety and it's gotten a lot of business since then but no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Money from Twitter stock. I mean if they if Noah glass didn't get anything that's shocking  Then he invented it. He named it. I don't think Messina or the fail well lady or we are gonna get anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so did Noah get nothing is that what because Nick Bilton wouldn't tell me he was on Twitter this week  And he said it's he's written the hatching Twitter his new book about Twitter as a mystery and I said well  The last page and he wouldn't let me but apparently  Because Noah glass was written out of the history of Twitter. He did not exist  Jack Dorsey took great pains to make sure that nobody it's not a lovable company Twitter. Wow, is it not a lovable company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The New York Times did a story this week about how dependent Twitter is on developers and they didn't mention any of the troubled history  Of Twitter and developers. No, we've all forgotten that we've all forgotten it already

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think these things are messy though. Like does any company that's gotten really successful and had this kind of money? I mean  They're always so Noah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apparently according to Nick Bilton Noah glass is gonna make a little money  Off the IPO. He says according to he says glass stands to make about as much money as Jack Dorsey's secretary at square  Not a Twitter at square  He hasn't updated his YouTube his Twitter his blog in almost two years  He's kind of I guess gone under the radar. He must be a little bit better watching the success of Twitter. He named it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was probably the biggest I haven't read the next book yet I'm going to I read the excerpt  I have a copy of the book. It's on my nightstand. I can't wait

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can't wait. Yeah, I think it's great that he released it. The timing was perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think I think there are things to be learned kind of from all from all these boy does the timing per I asked Nick

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I said, did you have some sort of inside information? You must have  The book comes out two days before the IPO Wow, you can't get that perfect timing  Somebody in our chat room Aaron B has just put his cat on the keyboard Aaron if you could just lift the cat off the keyboard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's all these right brackets  According Twitter has announced custom timelines for hashtags. Thank you Christmasina or

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  topics on tweet deck  So I didn't quite understand this. This is not it's kind of like store or five, but a little more dynamic

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't understand it either

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Our expert is here though. Gina trip any of think I'm I told I was waiting for

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You should have a new segment explain it to me. She made it through me. Gina. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what Andy Carvin does I mean we know what Andy Carvin does right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He retweets from what I understand and I actually haven't had a chance to play with there's a whole lot in tweet deck  Although I do use tweet deck is that this this ad store if I like capabilities and that you can say, alright  Something big is happening, you know, I'm all my friends are live tweeting scandal tonight  And I want to you know curate the best tweets about about the show or you know something else and then you can create a custom timeline  And then you can create a custom timeline where you can pick and choose and add particular tweets  I think you can also do it on a per hashtag basis  So if there's a live event if you're at a conference or whatever and then other people can see your custom timeline around a particular  Event that's my that's my understanding of it. Has anyone else played with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or that would be very cool to have. Yeah, I mean it's it's very store if I like  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I work so that with with networks beyond Twitter, but somebody curates it so it's not automatic

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not mechanically curated somebody what I'm asking though is if you put in somebody it says you can add tweets and delete tweets from it  I get that that's more like storeify, but I have the sense you can put a hashtag in there and then it will flow in

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, right. Lots of junk and retweets. You have to use the API to control it at that point if you're doing that  Drag and drop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've just created one drag and drop tweets into this timeline  So it looks like yeah each tweet has a little drag finger  And and so yeah, so you can see you can add a tweet but you're but you're asking Jeff  It can it can you add a hashtag?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What I had the impression that was a little more dynamic than store right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if you had a tweet with a hashtag in it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is not gonna go well at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It sounds like flipboards capability of creating a flipboard magazine  Which you then put stories in and friends can subscribe to is it that you can share it which and you can share it  I like that and it sounds like that's what this is. Although because there's an API  Tweets can be added programmatically. That means you could use logic operators. You could use hashtags  You said you could say if a tweet has this and this but not that you can then  So for politico for instance has created a tweet hub using the API  To feed policy industry tweets into this tweet hub. This is apparently done  By this API this new API its politico its politico's end energy insider tweet hub presented by Chevron and  Then it I don't know if it's fully hashtag driven. They have a special  energy insider hashtag

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that's interesting and then more dynamic than storify

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I as a past hence record right this is real time. It sounds like look these are 12 minutes ago an hour ago  So and they also are doing it by list so they have three columns energy reporters energy influencers energy lawmakers  This looks like it could be really useful and it's obviously that's just a list. Why is that just a list then?  Well, it's probably a list plus right a list plus what logic in from the API the logic may be as simple as the hashtag

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or can be more complicated is dynamic if it is dynamic it is then what good does it do to put individual tweets in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, this is interesting because it's dynamic but not chronological  So I see a tweet from the Heartland Institute that seven minutes old and that's below a tweet from the salon.com. It's an hour

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm confused

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think with custom timelines you are actually hand-picking it is store if I like and that you're hand-picking  tweets to add to the timeline

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Twitter does say that you can also do it programmatically using the API  So  Which makes more sense because you could write if you were good coder  You can you could it says the tweets can also be added programmatically using an API that was announced today as well  This allows users of the API to program timelines based on logic operators or to add the custom timeline creation feature to their own products  Politico's using this in their tweet hub Twitter offers a host of examples of people already using the timeline and  These spell out it this is from Twitter's own  No  This is TechCrunch the spell out exactly what Twitter hopes to see it used for including TV shows live Q&A sessions Twitter playlists and sporting events  So that's kind of cool. Yeah, that makes sense  That's really kind of cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in other words like survivor could put could put this page up there like this and then they control we're gonna say we're gonna  Insert this tweet. We're gonna insert this tweet  You like what this guy said about the show and then all of a sudden you've got a whole page of content

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you need to be able to control it if you're survivor. You don't want yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's for brands that's why it's not automatically populated right that's why you have to put the posts in  Manually or you name it you choose the tweets you want to add either by hand or programmatically using the API

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so you have to apply to get access to this API  So there must be an API to just add tweets where you can say show me all the tweets from these people and containing these  Keywords and then they stream in and you go. Yes include that one include that right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So here's Carson Carson Daly's voice timeline a curated timeline from the voice  And they're different hashtags. It's not all the same. It's not always voice save  So some of these I don't know they might have editorial staff dragging these over here, right?  Yep  Politico the Guardian here you go for you Jeff the Guardian is using this for a Q&A  So it curates the lead question  Smart really smart in it, so they're using it in a Twitter chat. Mm-hmm  Yeah, it gives you some really interesting  Power in this so they've added this to a so this is a Guardian article and then they've added at the bottom  Selected questions answers will be featured in real time on this page during the chat using Twitter's new custom timeline tool  See this is this is absolutely a monetization strategy. I would guess yeah  Certainly  Ransing no, it's no brands, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's monetization and curation and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here is the the timeline hosted on Twitter itself  Huh, well women says make your own  It says make your own maybe you can do it learn how to make your own

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can it's it's in tweet deck I have it in tweet deck right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, so you have to use tweet deck. Yeah, but it right for now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just tweet deck, but you do have to drag and drop individual tweets  It's the API that you have to apply for beta  Beta that you have to apply access apply for access to which I think they've given their partners access to probably people who are already  Curating Twitter streams or I mean you've all seen TV shows and Q&A is where where people you know  There's somebody there picking out the best tweets and this is just a tool for them to use versus store-fi. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like it though. I think you can see a lot of a lot more brands using this kind of thing, right? Mm-hmm  I think this is I would like to use it wouldn't it be fun to use this during our shows  It's kind of like a chat or a curated chat room. Mm-hmm  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know the thing is you need somebody doing the curation needs me  But but yeah, I mean, I mean there are definitely been times when things have happened on Twitter and I'm like  Oh, I want to remember that or I want to group this this, you know group of tweets together and remember this thing that happened  And I've used orify for that but to have it built into

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can do that too. You can do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Octopus  Hey, let's take a break change log coming up what's new at Google we'll find out but first a word from legal zoom  Comm legal zoom. Oh, I love them. They're not a law firm.

I don't know maybe maybe maybe features come along  Later because this says 2.0, right? But when I open it and I go to  Settings and I look at my about hangouts I get build version 1.2  It is weird, but I'll vouch for it I use it instead of the messaging app on the end  On the end you can't side load it I just have been resisting that I want to know what it is time  Yep, yeah, it's a lot cleaner do like the KitKat keyboard though. Highly recommend it. It's got swipe and everything. I love it

It lost a quarter of them more than a quarter  Wow, that's yeah. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. So now, you know why they rushed out a copy of a version of maps  Um to replace that and it's the power of the default  Yeah, it is the tyranny of the default as others have said google glass now has stereo  Or soon right and earpieces

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the new the new google glass is getting those stereo stereo earpieces and google is announcing music and all access

Transcript:  I don't know. You're not wearing glass. I can tell that you could get in the program now by the way the sdk

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is the sdk out just yet?  I feel like something like pocketcast would have to build  Or if glass, you know natively supported like rich notifications  So like the rich notification shade, you know that has the pause stop, you know  That kind of thing if if there was some sort of way that that glass could show you those notifications in a in a glass  Friendly interface then maybe pocketcast wouldn't have to build something something extra, but I don't think that you can  Listen to podcasts and then just stream just say hey just you know stream whatever's put it my glasses

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why wouldn't you be able to do that though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, no you would right because anytime a phone call comes through you're getting its bluetooth, right? Right, right  It's just bluetooth audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Ever since evan hansen left

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uh netflix and youtube rule online video hulu and amazon not so much  Uh, this is uh, uh  traffic  Results from sandvine. They seem I think they seem fairly reliable in terms of  What's going on?  according to sandvines latest global internet phenomena report  video streams from  Google and netflix make up more than i'm sorry google. Um youtube and netflix make up more than half  Of all residential north american downstream traffic in the month of september  Hulu and amazon together three percent  Oh, let's not forget bit torrent in that bit torrent's number one as well  Bit torrent's number one with thirty six point three five percent. Wow  That's got to irk  That's upstream  So what's the difference between upstream and downstream?  downloading versus uploading sharing  Well, no, I understand. Okay, that was a dumb question  But does bit torrent even show up on downstream? No. Oh, yeah, there is four percent of downstream  Thirty six percent of upstream. Does that mean that everybody's seeding but nobody's downloading? That's what it looks like  That's bizarre. It makes sense because you wouldn't you would never have upstream right? Well, you would never seed a netflix  Movie. No, I understand why netflix isn't on the list at all. Right, right  Oh actually it is 4.44. Why is any netflix on the list? Is that user data going back to netflix?  Anyway, let's forget downstream take that left column off and talk about uh, I mean upstream  Let's let's just look at yeah zoom in on forget aggregate zoom in  on downstream netflix 31 percent of all traffic  in north america  YouTube 18 percent of all traffic the web 9 percent it's beating the web  iTunes 3 percent amazon video a scant 1.61 percent  Hulu 1.29 percent. I'm kind of surprised. I watch a lot of amazon video

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to but at their  Their interfaces and things are so jinky. It never works kind of hard to get to  It's not like netflix. They need to make it easier to use. So easy. You're right  Um, there's a lot of stuff I want to watch. I mean i'm a prime  Subscriber so there's a lot of stuff that i'd like to watch on amazon. It just doesn't right. It's not easy  I've got um on my google tv  I've got an app and it won't sync so it won't let me watch anything and

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess that actually tells you something that it's ease really that is i mean youtube is very easy too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube's on computers. I'm sure mostly on computers, but still I don't understand why companies don't jump on this like, you know  Make it easy to use. I mean, I think netflix has even  Proven this out for a large degree. I mean they don't have the best content on there  They don't have no recent releases of movies and things anymore  So it's like, you know, they don't have the best content, but everybody watches it obviously  Based on the statistic everybody's using it. Why you can hit one button you go in you've got your stuff  It starts playing you do a search you hit play it goes that's all you have to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what amazes me is that all these people watch netflix pay netflix eight bucks a month  Yeah, like these are all paying customers on top of their broadband provider, right like youtube is free and netflix still beat youtube  Almost twice as much and part of it is just great product design  You can watch netflix on anything but think about the uphill battle that is to get people to subscribe for eight bucks a month  That's that's a huge accomplishment for netflix. I agree. Yep. I agree. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you talk mobile youtube's number one and mobile 17.69 and facebook then the web

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google market, which I guess is the play store and other stuff  6 then pandora 5 then netflix on mobile 5 instagram 3.53  Netflix for the first time a  source of traffic in europe  It's not huge, but it's 3.45 percent of all downstream traffic in europe  Even though you still can't get it in germany or france. They just launched in the uk and ireland in  scandinavia  And the netherlands in september  So that's good. I mean netflix is netflix is on a roll. Yep. Netflix is on a roll consider consider that could have been near death  Isn't amazing. I never gave up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep, have you guys used? Oh go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was the name of that other product that they went to ship?  I forgot what the name of it was and then they just pulled it back because everyone thought that it was a terrible idea when

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They separated out the businesses. So yeah, I mean people were really bashing reed hastings who I think is one of the smartest guys out there  because  uh, they basically wanted to increase your cost of netflix by a significant amount if you  Watch just streaming was eight bucks  But if you also got dvds they instead of uh, I used to get streaming and dvds together  They were going to separate those out and you would end up almost doubling your netflix bill if you wanted to continue to watch dvds  But it was pretty pretty clear to me what reed was trying to do is get you off the dvds

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and it worked. I'm trying to remember the name. I can't remember what the name is. Yeah, he had to apologize  Quickster quickster. That's what it was. Yes. I remember it was like oh, no, don't screw this up netflix  Don't screw this up and they didn't they totally recovered. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No good  I was just gonna say have you tried the red box instant streaming anybody?  No, I mean they have  So it's interesting. It's somewhat compelling in that, you know red box is everywhere  So they kind of combine these two things about the go get your dvd or watch it online or you search for a dvd  It's not available to stream but it says hey, but we've got it at red box down the road from you  You can just go pick it up right now  Um, really that's compelling, huh? I well, I think it is. I mean  The thing that they have is they have that presence that blockbuster used to have  And now it's red box that has it netflix doesn't have that  So netflix you can't go down with netflix and say, you know, I really wanted to watch this on netflix netflix  It's not available. I can't find it anywhere else. I'm screwed right you but with red box you can say  Oh, I really wanted to watch this. It's not available online, but oh it's available down at 7-eleven. I'll go grab it  I think that they have a case to be made for again kind of the ease of use quick gratification  Again, this is probably us only at this point. But I mean, I think that they have  Kind of like the new blockbusters voodoo. There's uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blockbuster has online. They have online still but there's always a line at the red box at my local grocery  Yeah, me too. It dry it it amazes me because I would I just wouldn't occur to me. But yeah, there's always a line there

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's just the slow death of physical media

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's because you can get stuff that's not streaming on red box

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly because that's exactly how I do it. I search all the streaming channels first  Can I get it on amazon? Can I get it on netflix? Can I get it on even youtube and you can't find it?  And then it's like well, it's kind of a new release. I wonder if it's a red box sure enough  I can get it on blu-ray or dvd and you go down and pick it up. So  They're kind of feeling that that it seems like a little bit of a hole right now temporary. It's a temporary  It's a temporary hole, but it is a hole that exists right now in that business right now, by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Can I stream dot it? Yes, and then you could just do one search and find out if it's streamable on any of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Excellent use of italy's top level domain. Yes, exactly

It really is a lot. Yeah google strategy. Yeah, really has paid off

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And uh, let's check in with the uh galaxy s4 and see how it's doing. Yeah, let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I may have lost power here. Oh, it actually booted up already

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. So look where this screen is and that's where you have to put it. Yeah, i'm actually going all right  So you're now in uh, 4.4. Yeah, so i'm actually going to reboot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, uh so I can finish off the process. Let's just recap  So first what we did was we rooted the phone we loaded, uh the uh  Custom recovery, right? So those things were done before and then we downloaded the rom itself and we downloaded g apps  Then we wiped the phone right? We did a factory reset. We wiped the cache  And then I went back in and I showed you during the last segment  Um that I was actually able to load those zip files that I downloaded the rom and the g apps, right?  So let's pick up there and so okay. Go ahead. Well, I was just gonna say so i'm gonna go back into hopefully  uh recovery  Hang on a second  Let's see

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you're rebooting into that special recovery mode. Yep, just kind of a system. Oh, yeah, you are out of power

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm almost out of battery. So I have john running. Get me some power. Let's see if I can do it here  Uh manually it may not like it. It may not like it. Let's see  Uh, this is why you don't do live demos folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's why you keep it plugged in while you're that's right  You should by the way really have it plugged in when you do all of this  Which they usually tell you yeah, yeah, because you don't want it to die in the middle of uh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so i'm just gonna plug it in now we may have missed that anyway  the only cool thing there was you just need to select reboot after you're done I was going to show you that the  Uh that the roms or the zip files had actually loaded the image files

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So one by one you pick the zip files first the the rom and then the google apps  You install those even though it says apps you're installing them from that zip file  That's right, and then you reboot and you're gummy. Look at that. It's gummy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is what it looks like this is you know something custom that the developer put on here all of these roms  It's called gummy. Yeah, this is the bootloader, you know, whatever  So it came up and uh, and that's it so you can see how good that was and i'm now in  Try okay jarvis now. I don't know if that'll work because here. Let's try it  Okay, jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You shouldn't have to touch anything right? That's right. I shouldn't if it's on it did work. It did work actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, so there's one last step that I need to do  So i've got the g apps loaded but one nice thing actually for most people is that  More and more the google apps have been moving into the play store and not necessarily come pre-loaded on the phone  That's so more and more people can load them if they have touch whiz or some other environment  They want to load really nice to be able to so to finish this up  What I would need to do is I would actually need to go in and load chrome for example or maps google maps  I could do  I would have to sync my account and let it download all those apps that we were talking about before which I skipped that step  On purpose because I didn't want to go through that's like watching paint dry even more than what we've been doing here already, right?  But you know, I just wanted to show everybody  It is working the demo worked for once. I think this is the first live demo i've done that's actually worked  Um, all the apps are there  And should we go in and just verify that this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see. Let's see what you got there tap that. Let's see if you get the kitkat dance

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So about phone it says android version 4.4. I know it's hard to see  Uh, so let's see the kitkat dance if you tap android, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  four four, uh, what oh oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See so I can prove that it actually is now what I have to hold this down

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and there you go. You're gonna get the game and it's amazing because in a minute you're gonna get a kitkat an actual  Oh, no  What you said that would work. I'm so sorry. That's the whole reason I did this. I know i'm sorry your custom rom

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does not get you a free kitkat. Yeah, look at that. It's not doing the uh,  It's not doing the little dance, but this is not unusual with these custom roms things are missing  That's all they probably just didn't load it or whatever didn't they you know  They try to slim these things down one of the reasons you load custom roms to be roms to begin with  Is to speed up your device or to make the battery last longer, which is why I had the old  Rom that I had the 4.3 running on here because it gave me like  I don't know three times as much battery life because it wasn't running all of those things that samsung wanted me to run in  the background so  Anyway, so it does work you can go down you can find the gummy rom if you want to on xda developers forum.xda developers  Go to your particular phone model and see if you have a 4.4 kitkat rom for your device  They're slowly coming out as people are developing these for uh, they're downloading the a osp and turning these into roms that you can load on your phone  Go try it today it works now i'm gonna go play with my phone  Go ahead brand new device

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to show you because we were talking, um about the dissatisfying experience with the wireless charging  Gina and I had both had  With our nexus 4s and that stupid thing that the nub that google was selling and I found something uh called tilt  I can't remember. I think this might have been a kickstarter, but this actually works  Uh the they make other things as well, but they make the view wireless charger at tylt.com  It's not cheap. I think it's uh  Was it 70 bucks 80 bucks? It wasn't cheap. But boy does it work great because it's a uh, it's a stand  So now I have my phone in a nice stand. You can't really put it in wrong. Can you show the stand real quickly?  Yeah, chad. Yeah, so it'll actually even charge the phone sideways as well as in portrait mode  Um, and it does it does a great job  Um, because it just seems to work all the time. There is a little led on the bottom  It'll tell you it'll light red if it's not charging but look at that. I have a nice angle  Uh for viewing the phone and it is charging. There's a little bit of heat. It's warm  So that's one of the problems with wireless charging inductance based charging is not completely efficient  So some heat gets dissipated, but I love this it comes in four different colors. I got two. I got one for the nexus  Five and i'm hoping the nexus seven will charge  On this one. They claim it charges as fast  As a plug-in charger. Wow, and it will work with all chief phones  And back doors from any manufacturer so i'm guessing  It will work. All right. They say there's no need for perfect alignment  Which was one of the problems that you and I had yeah. Yeah, so hard. What is it 70 bucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. There you go. Is that because inside the phone the uh,  The conductive material is spread across the back of the phone  Is that why you can put it in there any way you want? Well, you know, I don't know you're asking

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Seems like it must be right. Yeah, I love it that I can run it sideways so I can play plans

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zombies as well as exactly you don't have to worry about turning it sideways and all of a sudden you're out of juice

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right exactly. Yeah, so you should I should have let you have oh the galaxy s4 doesn't have it doesn't have it  Yeah, sorry nexus five does most lumia phones do nexus four does nexus seven does and yeah  I kind of think it looks cool, too  Does have a proprietary charger don't lose the proprietary charger does not use usb micro usb for the  the power cord  vu from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Blt have you ever you reviewed that on?  By b just got it today. You have to do a bake off like take two phones plug one in and then oh, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will do that. Yeah, because they claim it'll charge as fast as being played right test it out  And you know, I have a lot of tablet, you know  These these flat chi chargers and it's just so hard to get on there right but this  Every time I plug I put it on there and the little thing lights up and I know i'm charging awesome.
