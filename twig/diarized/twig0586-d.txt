Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hello. I knew you were going to catch me first because I just ate a cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's today's Christmas cookie of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Lemon rosemary butter cookies, and they are delicious.  Show us one.  Oh, I just ate the last one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I knew that. That's why I said I only had two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly why I said it.  I ate it.  Oh, man, I'm jealous.  Now, did you make this with your daughter or is this?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And these were rollout cookies.  So we got out the rolling pin. Very exciting.  We're practicing our Christmas cookies to share with people who want

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Christmas cookies during sugar base. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Butter and egg yolk, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'd like to do is make a cookie that looks like Covid  and see if anybody will eat it.  With spikes and everything.  That's Jeff Jarvis.  Thank goodness he laughed at Buzz Machine.com.  I'll eat it. Yeah, I'll eat anything. I'm Mikey.  It would be fun to pass out Covid cookies.  He's the Leonard Tao Professor for Journalistic Innovation  at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University  of New York and our most welcome contributor.  Contributor. Hello, Jeffrey.  And on the far right there, that's Ant Pruitt of Hands on Photography,  Hands on Wellness, who cannot hear himself right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I have no idea what I'm saying right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He just can't hear himself.  Today, we will not talk about Apple's M1 ship.  You have my my well, I'm not going to give my word on that.  Oh, come on. We could. We might.  You never know.  I will talk about the Nest adage that took everything out,  including your security cameras.  I mean, I don't mind if my Nest Hub isn't working, but I mean,  you take out my security cameras.  That that's a potential problem.  Stacey and IOT, they fixed it.  What did they ever say? Why it went out yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't see a report yet, but I wasn't looking for it.  This happens. I mean, this happens like at least two or three times a year.  Yeah. So I mean, I always tell people like for baby monitors,  because there's all the baby monitor people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's another one. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't use these for baby monitors.  If this is really your only option, use a dedicated proprietary radio technology.  There's a reason that those exist,  and it's because they're more resilient than trusting something in the cloud.  But this is cheap and it's easy to use.  And for most people, it's going to be good enough.  So good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I was going to ask, why would someone use it as a baby monitor?  Is it because it's a lower barrier to entry?  Just so easy to just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and it's it's not a baby monitor.  It's cool. It's you can look in and see a lot of the baby.  The official baby monitor ones are pretty expensive.  They don't tie into your smart home.  They're not going to get cool features like Nest might one day recognize,  hey, your baby is laying face front down.  Yeah, they shouldn't. Yeah, that's an alert.  You they don't do that now. But they could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Baby monitors are surveillance.  It's part of the evil takeover of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This isn't no, this isn't bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is just well, don't use it for a baby monitor because if it's down,  you're not going to know there is a Nest X or Times Yale lock.  Apparently that was unaffected.  Thank goodness, because that would be a big problem.  If for 45 minutes you couldn't get into the house,  but that seems to be working all right.  Nest camera feeds were down or having issues.  The Google Assistant or Google Home app apparently working OK.  It's this this happened in August.  So it's not the first time and it probably isn't the last.  But it probably should inform you about using these devices for anything  mission critical, like a baby monitor or a door lock.  Yeah, I'm always I've always been nervous about Bluetooth and other door locks.  I just want a regular physical door lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I will say two things here.  A door lock can physically like it can gracefully degrade.  Right. You should have a key somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It fails closed, not fails open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it does fail closed, but you should still be able to get to it.  Bluetooth is also local, so you don't need cloud servers if you're.  That's true.  So if the lock has the token and your phone has the token, then you're fine.  Yeah. But you couldn't let your maid in or someone like that, maybe.  And that might irritate people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hate it when I can't let the maid in.  Then there's no one to sweep up.  My new car is it's a Ford Mustang Mach-E uses Ford Pass,  uses the phone and Bluetooth LED to unlock the door  instead of a key dongle, key fob.  I think you have it not yet.  They're making it on on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd like you to do a show from the car, please.  I will. I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's the new thing, right?  Apple has this built into iOS, but to this point,  I think it only works with one model of BMW,  the Carpass or Carkey or Carkey, I guess it's called.  I just do you also get a dongle?  I'm sure you still get a dongle.  I would I would expect that.  And there is a manual entry technique  with a number pad on the door.  So you're not there are other ways to get in.  But there's no lock and key.  There's no barrel for the key.  There's no key like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's like the Tesla.  And I will say I once got locked out of the Tesla.  I didn't get locked out.  I couldn't start it remotely from my phone  because it was in a parking garage and it was to it couldn't access the Internet.  And I didn't have my key fob with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It reminds me of a friend of mine who's a well known director  who had one of those new the first edition Fisker  cars, electric cars that had the solar panel on the roof.  And I was asking his wife, what do you how do you like it?  She said, well, wasn't great.  We drove up to the Oscars one year  and couldn't get out.  So it was it was a good entrance.  Right. Go around the block.  Go around the block. Go around the block.  John, go around the block.  So she she wasn't a big fan.  They were cool looking cars. They're still around.  They are cool looking cars.  Yeah, because they have solar panels on the roof, which do not accumulate  enough power to actually do anything worthwhile.  It's just cool. They're just they're just cool.  Google Pay.  Well, you know, I should save that for the change log.  We don't God knows we need more things for the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, I put it in.  I put it in for the for the for the for the big guy for the grownups table.  The grownups table. Really? You want to put on the table? Change log.  I think it's a big deal. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a big no, it is a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is a big and why would you shove it in the change log?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the change log is the kiddie table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God, I don't.  Google Pay has been updated to do peer to peer payments.  In fact, actually a lot of new.  Oh, it links to your bank account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that the story?  Well, it's the same.  The bank accounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's it's all part of the same.  Right. I focused on a different portion of it than you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the change.  That's not the story, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Geez. It now allows a peer to peer change log

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because this is something that they've had before updating and updating again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but there's a there's a critical mass point.  Is it a big enough change that you might actually mention it on Twitter?  Well, I guess it feels like that's actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would you do a fleet is the question.  Wait a minute. They're called fleets.  What is a singular?  Is there a fleet or are they just all fleets?  Would you do a fleets?  Do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter store.  I would is the verb form the flit.  I will flip the fleet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fleet I flit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I fleeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I fleeted.  I said, I did the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's gone.  I flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is a new a new feature on Twitter, which you will only get on mobile.  You won't get it on the desktop.  Normally, you get it in any of the third party Twitter apps.  So you have to be using the Twitter native app on iOS or Android.  And it's basically Instagram stories  or Snapchat stories.  It's a pretty Facebook story.  It's a pretty close clone of Instagram stories.  Have you played with it? Yeah, you have.  Because I saw your fleet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I decided to give it a shot.  I don't know how long I'll play around with it.  And if I do, I'm just going to pretty much do it the same way.  I do Instagram stories because my audience over there is different  from my audience on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And you already have the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yeah, so I'm just going to sort of double dip it and just  what do you think of promotional and behind the scenes stuff?  If anybody is going to even watch it, is it as easy to use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was pretty straightforward.  That's the real thing.  I think it's got to be easy to use.  People aren't going to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's if anybody watches it, because if if no one's watching it,  I won't put any more effort into it.  But I mean, I had like 100 people or so on that last one  within the last couple of hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's one thing that's a little disappointing.  I don't think Instagram does this or Snapchat.  It shows you immediately who's seeing it.  And what's more, if you have a multi multi-image fleets fleet,  if you have a multi-image fleet.  The fleet is plural for many like many ships in a fleet.  It's a collective noun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, but this is a pun and a twist on fleeting.  So just say fleet.  It's a fleet or fleets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or is it fleets?  One floats a fleet or flits a fleet or or one has flat.  Fleeted. I done I done fleeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw three deer yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But did you see a fleet of deer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or were there multiple types of fishes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, back to Google Pay.  I don't know how we got in this one.  Google Pay is launching Plex Bank accounts with Citi and other partners next year.  That's a little bit different.  The new app is in early access.  This is the official announcement.  Let's go say they had an event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hello. See, see, and I think that's a test.  If they have an event, it's bigger than the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It shouldn't be in the change log. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with that. So this is like, I guess I was focusing more on  just that they're coming back.  I didn't necessarily think about the Plex card.  Where'd they go? They didn't go anywhere.  Well, yeah. OK, wait, let's start this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, just do the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's do the story.  We're getting a little bogged down.  So let's start with they had an announcement today where they shared.  What was it, Stacey? Google Plex.  And what is, oh, let's talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, what is Plex? Plex

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  allows you to have a digital bank account.  They've also added peer to peer payments.  And Google Pay now can only be used on one smartphone at a time,  which is a bit of a disadvantage.  Google's kind of trying to get in the same business Apple's been in for some time  with Apple Pay.  The announcement, say hello to the new Google Pay.  The new application will help you, quote, improve your relationship with money.  End quote. Well, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's also it lets you it's like Venmo  in that you can tell your friends you can say, hey, give me this money.  It also does things like it holds rewards for various businesses  that you're working with. I think Apple Wallet does that.  And then there probably are budgeting things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go to the video.  Oh, I miss 28 minutes long. Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not good. Let's skip the video.  That's far beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They are they are working with probably was it 11 or 16 banks to offer this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although there's something with Citi specifically,  like if you want to start a new account with Google Pay,  it'll be through Citibank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's new, isn't it? That's new. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess what you're thinking about, maybe remember they had a credit card  for a while briefly and had a debit card.  Yeah. I used to have one. I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  White debit card. Yeah. So that went away.  Yeah. Killed it off. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they wish they'd done that because Apple's making bank on its Apple Pay card.  These Plex accounts are with Citi, but other partners will come along next year.  So it's more now basically Google Pay was touch  touchless payments, NFC payments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And if you want, you can link.  Your bank account with Google  and get like all this information tied to what you've purchased,  which is kind of like searchability, and I assume eventually analytics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting, of course, is Google has for some time  offered advertisers using Google's ad platform  cross reference information.  This is what advertisers love.  Oh, and by the way, that person who saw your ad the next day  charged that product at the store.  And remember when we announced that and everybody's saying,  well, that's kind of creepy  because I guess they're collecting the transaction information  and they can match you up somehow to the credit card transaction.  Well, advertisers like it because of advertising.  Yeah, yeah, they want to know.  Yeah, they want to know, did that person buy based on the advertisement?  Yeah, that's everything they want.  Is it Valhalla or the Holy Grail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who Valhalla is like heaven, so it's I would say it's more like the Holy Grail.  I thought I was in the same place.  I was like, oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but it's heavenly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Valhalla. It's not it's the halva of advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think they've arrived in Valhalla.  They've arrived in advertiser heaven.  I'm going to stick with it. I'm sticking with it.  He's going to go with Valhalla. I'm going Valhalla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is where the heroes killed in battle  in Norse mythology feast for an eternity with Odin.  Yeah. And that's what advertisers are trying to do.  An endless meal with Odin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But aren't they waiting to come back and defend against Ragnarok?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. OK. Stacey, now you're doing it. See.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, and we're talking about this on a Wednesday,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's a new ransomware called Ragnarok.  I like that. I just like the name.  I don't like the ransomware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With regards to this account,  would you all recommend the average person to  to just dive in and use this as their accounting system,  bank bank account system, or do you suggest going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because Google will kill it in three years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that funny that honestly, that is really a consideration  nowadays with Google.  I don't know if I want to go all in on any Google product,  because then what happens with Google tires of it, just as they did.  And with that credit card, which I still have, but is not useful.  And they didn't last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just a credit card.  Your bank and it's not your bank.  They're partnering with real banks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd have a real bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, your real bank account is never going to go away if you do this.  Right. And it's FDIC insured and all the good stuff that you should look for.  And it gives you the functionalities of things like Venmo  with the protections of the financial system, which is actually kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Banks for a long time have fought a rearguard battle against Venmo  with Zelle, Z-E-L-L-E.  And a lot of banks use that Zelle system to kind of give Venmo  like features to your bank account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody else has it then what good does it do? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But Zelle was actually they had a lot of fraud recently.  So yeah, that's a little bit.  I like Venmo. Everybody has Venmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody takes Venmo. I use Venmo all the time.  When my kids need money, I Venmo it to it or cash.me is good. Yeah.  That's from Square.  I it's interesting. I mean.  I've been I've been researching digital, you know,  online only bank accounts for some time, because I'm always looking to see  if there's a better deal out there.  And the thing when you're assessing an online bank account,  you got to figure out what the fees are going to be,  what it's going to cost you if you go below a certain amount.  You may be if you have a savings account interested in what their rate is  and the savings account and those very widely.  So there is some consumer shopping that's appropriate  before you create a bank account with anybody.  I usually go to NerdWallet, which does some reporting  and rating of these kinds of things to see.  They'll at least there's at least a place you can go to kind of compare  the various rates and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you say Internet or digital banking, what are you talking about?  I mean, I've had an Internet bank since like 1998.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so I used to be with Bank of America in 1980.  I did. I started using an online bank.  It was so bad. It was 40 characters wide.  White text on a black background was a terminal.  Even if you were using Windows in 1980, it was a term.  I guess it was Windows out. I don't know.  And then it was only it was all caps.  And we go, but you could do online banking.  What I'm talking about is not is not that which is an online interface  to your existing bank, but banks that have no branches.  Banks that have no physical place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that was that is my bank.  I banked or I have an account at first Internet bank.  There are no branches. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then the other thing that you look into, if you're interested in that,  is, well, what about ATMs?  Because I'm going to need cash somehow.  And there are all sorts of plans.  I actually looked at Axon Bank and I thought, oh, this looks pretty good  because they had a high savings rate.  But then I found out to get cash.  I'd have to go into a 7-Eleven that their ATMs were in convenience charges.  Ten dollars. They were in convenience stores.  I have USAA, which I've had forever.  They have no branches either, but they do the right thing.  And this is what I would look for is I can use any ATM  and they refund the ATM fee.  So mine, too. Yeah.  So first Internet does that. That's good.  That's the kind of thing to look for.  And I presume there's no fee checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No fee checking.  I mean, right now, all savings rates are just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can shop around, though, there are some savings rates as high as one percent.  But yeah, it's not enough to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  not write your entire banking account.  But what I wouldn't.  So would you say digital banking, though?  I'm thinking of much more modern things like, again, Venmo,  even PayPal, although now we're, you know, but a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Venmo is owned by PayPal, incidentally.  Well, I know.  So you are using PayPal.  Yeah, no, I think I think the you want to use what the most people are using.  Right. Because if they if you're using Venmo, everybody has to use it  if you want to pay them and you want them to pay you.  You use cash, the cash app, and you find that most of the people you work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, most of my circle uses cash app.  And then you excuse me.  And then they use Venmo.  But I like cash app because I was able to get a debit card to use.  And that's I want to do shopping online.  I usually pay with that particular burner card.  I got a bunch of burner cards and cash up that actually offers one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the reasons there is this  churn of all this stuff that people are really interested is it back in 2007,  Vodafone created an electronic banking system called M Pesa in Africa.  And M Pesa was a huge success.  Now, this was in an area where people had smartphones,  but they didn't tend to have bank accounts or broadband or broadband.  So it was a really it was a it was it took off because suddenly they could do  all this banking stuff they could never do before.  So and then Pesa was such a success.  It spawned some follow ons in other areas.  And I think that we've been the you know, and as is often the case  when you have existing infrastructure,  you're slower to adopt the latest, greatest stuff.  But now you're starting to see, I think, a lot of institutions.  And it makes sense that Apple and Google would be in this to try to create  these kinds of payment systems.  But if there's this many.  And they don't talk to one another, that it's like the early days of email  where you could email people at MCI, but not on AOL.  We need to federate these somehow.  And I tried to put my credit card on.  Go ahead, Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was just I was trying to put my credit card on to Google Pay.  And I never got the confirmation number from my bank and I couldn't do it.  And there's no there was no help. There was no nothing.  Some banks don't support.  Oh, I will. I will see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see that. And I will raise you the fact that I called when I tried to put my  credit card into Google Pay, it was like, oh, this is what I'm doing.  This is weird.  We're going to have to have you call your bank.  And I was like, all right, I'll call my bank.  My bank was like, you have no idea what's happening.  They were like, OK, give me I spent two hours, three different people.  And the end result was call us back tomorrow because this really should work.  And we don't know why it's not.  And I never called back.  So, yeah, I don't know if people are enough to help you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very interesting.  So Google, but you're but you nailed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was a city, city, big cart, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. That's a while.  You nailed it when you said Google's done this before and pulled out.  They actually did it before Apple did Apple Pay.  Yeah, it was a long time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to trust them.  Remember, it was so long ago.  I remember still having the Logitech review Google TV at the time.  That's how old it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the one, the keyboard, right?  Yeah, that was a piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So can we talk about Google Photos?  Are we done with this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, we're done with this story.  That is the Google changelog.  No. So Google is pissed off a lot of people by announcing.  We are not going to continue to make Google Photos for free.  You have until June of next year.  Anything you put up there now or all the way up until June will continue  to be stored on Google Photos free forever.  But after that, when you upload stuff, it will be  charged against your Google Drive or Google One account.  So you'll have to have you get 15 gigs free.  But if it's more than that, you'll be paying for it.  It's not expensive. A buck ninety nine for 100 gigabytes.  I pay ten dollars a month for my Google One account.  That's two terabytes of storage.  So that's so I can store original photos.  You've always had to pay for that unless you had a Pixel phone.  One zero. Willa Ramis says Google Photos just made the case for breaking up big tech.  That seems a little bit of an overreaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anybody want to?  That was my reaction was it was overreaction.  And then I read it.  There was a point there about having killed other photo  could be an opening today that aren't there because you couldn't compete with free Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And OK, so I'm seeing this in play out in the IOT space, which I'm  glad that will brought this up because talking to executives have smart products  for the home, they talk about their cloud costs, which is a huge component of  not a huge. It is an ongoing, though, commitment on every product they sell.  But Google and Amazon can subsidize those costs.  So they don't have the same pressures to come up with a subscription plan  or to charge higher prices up front on their connected device products.  And so I'm with them on this.  I'm like, yeah, there is there's something to be said for like.  I mean, it's like the heroin model, right?  You give people you get people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me let me argue the other way.  Because it wasn't, in fact, Google and Amazon that put them out of business.  It just does. This was never a viable business unless you could  subsidize other stuff. I don't think that's true.  Well, I'll give you an example.  So I used a lot of these services.  I used ever picks. I bought a device.  It was a physical device.  They all went out of business.  But one of them picture life was using AWS to store it.  Its costs were in the first year more than a million dollars to store these photos.  It reminds me of the ice cream store down the street.  Guy Guy rented a place, started ice cream store.  What he didn't count on was the huge expense of keeping the ice cream cold.  And he went out of business  as soon as summer hit because he couldn't afford the freezers.  And you have to consider when you start a business like this,  that there is a significant run rate for storage.  You could mean YouTube doesn't make any sense if you're not Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. I mean, I know everybody thought it was insane and only Google could buy it.  That was the opposite. Right.  They could only make YouTube if it got bought by Google. Right.  But but on the other hand, another way to look at this is.  What is the revenue going to be from this?  When they get the photo, it's going to be de minimis,  and they're going to have pissed off people and affected the brand  and given antitrust people something else to complain about.  Is this really going to be worth it in the end?  It's going to be tiny revenue, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, probably.  Although how much does it cost for them to do Google Photos was, I think,  you know, in the early days, the benefit was we assumed  there was the AI training that they were getting learning. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they can't they can't keep doing that.  Like they did that with with one of their phone services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or one one Google for one one. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to give you a service until we learn enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they said they actually said that up front with Google for one one.  That's true. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But why is it a problem for Google to say, you know what,  we need to drop this free service because we want to make money off of it?  Well, we can't afford not to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, because I think one year, you have to say, you know what,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we can add one more line on the on the  on the accounting side of things and have some more money coming in.  So why not do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it is the will's argument is that that's classic monopolistic behavior.  That's what Amazon is doing to bookstores.  You you you undercut all the brick and mortar stores  till they go out of business and then you raise the prices.  The Google undercut all the photo storage companies  till they went out of business and they raise the prices.  My only counter to that is I don't know if they had a viable business  with or without Google competing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It depends on I mean, the question isn't I mean, if you look at it that way,  think of it like dumping. Right.  Does it cost like dumping? Right.  But is it dumping is wrong because they're selling it at less than it costs them.  Right. So if Google is selling this for less than it cost, it costs them,  then it is driving people out of the market and it is kind of dumping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, pretty much every free service that we use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not necessarily like well, yeah, because it's your ad.  I mean, we're talking about how to get away from that and pay for that.  And Kevin is actually using maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is Facebook doing that?  Is Facebook dumping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Be Facebook is something new that didn't exist.  Google maps and waves, friends, stir and lies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Space existed before Google, before Facebook existed.  But they incidentally were free as well.  Well, they were free as well. So to say, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And to your question, I think it's a it's it's a cost benefit analysis.  So we make an amount of revenue.  Is it worth it for Google given one animosity from customers,  the public, or we say they're stuck with us to heck with them.  And then to the bigger issue to me is I would think the policy people want.  Do you want to do this right now in the middle of antitrust stuff? Really?  Yeah, it's a wait a few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, maybe. Yeah, it does make that it's a harder argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think the stakeholders and shareholders care about antitrust?  They care about that bottom line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should care about antitrust because the bottom line gets affected  if they get broken up. Actually, maybe.  Well, there's another argument.  Maybe not. They get five stops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Get their cash and run.  They care less once the lawsuit comes in.  But right now, they want to see their money go up.  It's greed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's an argument that says that a breakup will be good for the stakeholders.  They'll end up, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's five parts, five stocks that are worth more than the single stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Harder company to run and loses  synergy benefits to the consumer.  Synergies benefits to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And well, you lose the synergies.  This is the synergy that makes Google Photos  viable as a free service, as it has been for 10 years,  because Google gets other benefits, just like Android's  essentially free because Google gets makes money on the advertising.  So, yeah, I mean, it's a it's a really I don't know what the law  what the legal arguments are.  It may, you know, it may be we need an antitrust lawyer could could say,  well, that doesn't let you off the hook or that does let you off the hook,  because none of those companies are really viable.  And antitrust, right.  None of these companies were really viable  because they didn't have that synergy, you know, they just never made sense.  Forever picks. It's a good argument.  You make you make me down, Elliot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then the other thing is, isn't this for if you use a pixel,  none of this applies to you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they changed that plan, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, until sometime in 2021, I thought. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't remember.  OK, so so initially when you bought a pixel up to up to the pixel three  up through the pixel three, you had unlimited original photo storage.  Correct. Everybody had unlimited JPEG storage.  You had unlimited original photo storage.  I don't know what is the promise for pixel four and five.  Is it still that? No, they dropped that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was still just a JPEG high res.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But everybody has that. Yeah.  That's like the Aaron Rodgers discount.  Everybody gets it.  See, I knew you'd get it.  I know these guys don't have football, but I knew you'd get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I looked at this no differently from the likes of, say, YouTube  and Hulu both have their TV services and YouTube comes out and say,  hey, our rate is going to be  $10 a month or whatever. Oh, wait.  No, this is around and says, you know what?  We're going to do $8 a month and then half a, you know, six months  later, the rate goes up for both of those entities because they can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Google confirmed pixel one, two, three, four and five would all retain  free Google photo storage forever going forward forever until they change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I thought they said until sometime in 2021.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is no, that's for people who are not pixel owners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that in June 2021, everybody else is losing the free  in part because some of these devices have lifetime guarantees for free storage,  which is used in marketing the device.  So they can't really stock with backup.  If you have a pixel five device earlier, your current backup quality  options and benefits remain unchanged.  Uploads in high quality from your pixels, two through five devices  will continue to receive unlimited free storage.  Photos and videos backed up from other devices in high quality after June 1st,  2021 will start to count toward your Google account storage.  Is that so that's so that actually could tie into the antitrust stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because basically they're they're penalizing anybody who doesn't buy their hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right, Stacey.  But they probably are actually cursing that they did make that promise.  So it's actually against them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And can a company can a company not offer a benefit to buyers of their product  with that? I mean, that's not an antitrust issue.  They can offer that benefit.  Look, you bought our product.  We're going to give you this is part of what you get when you buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not antitrust.  It does get into that appellee lock in feeling though that I write so low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But feelings, as I've said so many times, are not illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At either rate, don't depend on Google photos for your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that we said we've talked about this many times, you know,  the Google death watch on Google continually harms their reputation long term.  And it makes it I would imagine, you know, we just had two stories in a row,  one the nest outage and then this story that make people think maybe I shouldn't  invest in a Google ecosystem product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, and actually, you could say Google Pay is similar because they had a watch  or they had a credit card that apparently died that ants still toting around in  this day. Yeah. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So. So don't trust Google.  Yeah, I don't. Do you think I mean, certainly somebody at Google is responsible  for thinking about things like that or maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is convenient to have the full resolution of my,  particularly the videos that I would film with the phone.  Right. Just go up and be stored.  But, oh, God, are you kidding?  I have a system in place when I get back to the to the desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're coming down. Well, as I can't wait.  Is it Chris Marker, one of our one of my contributors on the tech, I said,  oh, gee, now you have to buy a hard drive like like a normal person backing  up their data.  Oh, you know, it was the premise was, oh, you don't have to buy a hard drive.  We'll back it up for you forever.  But that really was untenable.  And let me go find my surprise.  So you have to back up your your data.  You have to do for every other kind of data.  Why should photos be something special?  And on the other hand, if you have Amazon Prime, you have unlimited original  storage on Amazon Prime Shutterfly, which is see, this is another example.  I see. Here's a perfect example.  Free photo storage with Shutterfly.  How how can they make that work?  Because they they do prints and calendars and mousepads out of your photos.  So they figure, well, if you store your photos here, it's a lot more likely  that you will order stuff from us and that will pay for the storage.  I mean, storage is cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google calendars, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I got to Shutterfly calendars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I made a scrapbook.  Yeah. Let's see.  Oh, Kevin has piped in to say if we have to pay for Google Photos as a service,  then they shouldn't get to use or keep the data, which is his two cents.  I agree. Mm hmm.  I agree with G Suite.  Oh, don't bring up G Suite, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But no, but don't bring it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's right.  But that would be starting June 1st and going forward.  I have 60,000 plus photos stored on there, which is still going to be there.  And and that's still for free.  So in that case, they can use that data.  Right. So Kevin's point is really that from June 1st forward,  anything you store on Google Photos should not be used to gather,  you know, to do machine language training or machine training.  But I think that they said that they weren't going to do that.  In fact, I do believe I read that somewhere that they they were going to.  Maybe I'm maybe I'm mistaken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and they do learning on your own photos, too.  So like one of the services they offer is I can I can type in my name  and I get pictures of me.  Which is actually pretty, pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to still use Google Photos for that reason alone.  The automatic categorization is really, really useful.  And it's very effective. Very good.  So, Kevin, we do get something for that.  That's kind of the traditional Google tit for tat.  We will will be you know, we'll beef up our services based on your data.  But in return, we'll give you those services for free.  I think that's a fair trade.  And now it's more explicit.  Google is potentially being sued.  I don't even know what to make of this one.  They're trying to get a class action together.  A suit filed in the federal court in San Jose.  Because apparently Google Android phones mysteriously, mysteriously,  even when they're not on Wi-Fi, without any applications running,  will upload about eight or nine megabytes a day of data.  To Google.  And this the lawsuit says you're basically costing us money on our cell data.  Because we're not getting any benefit.  This is just stuff being uploaded to Google.  I haven't seen a response from Google on this yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know what it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, why is Google doing this?  What was being transmitted in that article?  Well, didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, they did have a bunch of stories and I didn't read them  because I get value out of them.  But how to turn off the smart features in Gmail  so they're not using quite so much data.  Some of it may be something as simple as, you know,  just trying to preload things so they load faster, for example,  or pre download stuff so it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The attorneys for the plaintiffs took a brand new Galaxy S7 with Android,  signed into a Google account with its default settings  and then let it sit without a Wi-Fi connection.  And they found that 94% of the communications about it,  nine megabytes a day of data were sent or were between Google back and forth.  They didn't say whether uploaded or downloaded.  It sounds like, oh, yeah, the device with all apps closed transferred data,  transferred data to Google about 16 times an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, OK. And it's saying that a lot of this is log files for network availability.  The apps and OS metrics.  So, yeah, this is nothing essential to be continued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm going to guess I haven't read down anybody has the this agreements  you agree to when you start using a phone.  I guess somewhere in there, it says you agree to provide us with information,  help us improve our services or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I read a term here recently, but it wasn't Google's.  It was Instagram's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I know why, because you're a photographer.  But there's many pages you have to read in the terms of service,  the privacy policy, the managed Google Play agreement  and the Google Play terms of service.  According to the the attorneys did read them, they said none of them  disclosed that Google spends users cellular data allowances  for these background transfers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and this might just be stupid, not stupidity,  but this might be a lack of understanding about how some people  really monitor their data plans.  So if you're Google and you're you're an engineer thinking about this,  you're probably not thinking, hey, we should only transfer this data  over Wi-Fi when people are on that network because it's expensive,  because they're maybe not thinking about data in terms of drafts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly right. Yeah.  Hey, let's take a little break. We got lots more to talk about.  See, we it's been all Google all the time. See? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And boy, that that pay story was was not change log worthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess it wasn't because there were a lot of ins and outs.  Yeah. So, yes, I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe not as many as we made it out to have.  Our confusion is not scintillating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll agree with that. I'll agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll have more with Stacey and Jeff in just a second.  Our show today brought to you by E set for over 30 years.  E set E S E T has been a global leader in cyber security.  It's the provider we rely on here at Twit.  Yes, I didn't even know we were using E set, but that's one of the beauties of E set.  It's so lightweight. It's so transparent.  You won't know you're running it.  Our managed service provider, our IT guy, Russell, puts it on all the machines.  Even the machines that need every CPU cycle possible,  every ounce of RAM possible, like our editors machines,  because, of course, as a small business, the last thing we need is ransomware.  We need enterprise grade security, but we can't afford to have it slow us down.  That's why we love E set.  And E set can block everything even zero days  because they use something called the dynamic threat defense.  This is so smart.  It's another layer of security for E set products like endpoint and mail security,  a cloud based sandboxing technology to detect and stop never before seen threats.  This is always kind of the Achilles heel of antivirus products  is if they don't know about a virus, they can't stop it.  Well, not with E set and their dynamic threat defense.  When you get an attachment in your email or a suspicious program downloaded,  it says, whoa, hold on, takes it, puts it up in the cloud in a sandboxed thing box.  I guess I would say and runs it.  It executes it and analyzes it.  And then if it's malicious, it stops a cold all before it reaches you or your network.  Dynamic threat defense is just one more reason to use the layered security  that E set offers in a lightweight package.  And Russell loves it because of the E set security management center,  which gives him a real time overview of every endpoint on or off prem.  We've got a lot of work from home employees now.  But they all are protected by E set even off site.  There's full reporting, automated security management for all operating systems.  And Russell can access it whenever he is online.  He gets around.  In fact, that's one of the nice things he said you can get it on prem or in the cloud.  You can buy it directly from E set.  You can do as we do, get it through your managed service provider.  There's an E set reseller program to just find the option that works for you  and protect yourself.  We've been using this.  It turns out without even I didn't even know for years,  trusted by thousands of state and local governments, top universities,  and enterprises worldwide.  And if you have compliance requirements in your industry, don't worry.  E set meets those requirements, whether you take credit cards with PCI,  handle customer financial transactions, GLBA,  or if you're processing healthcare data, it's HIPAA compliant too.  Your employees are your first line of defense.  So if you have a remote workforce, check out E sets remote workforce bundle  for advanced ransomware and business data protection,  along with other bundles that he said offers,  protect your employees no matter where you or they are.  They get top reviews from independent testing labs for minimum system impact  and extremely accurate detection.  They're perfect for our small business.  I bet they're perfect for yours too.  He said really understands the needs and concerns of SMB.  So trust he said to future proof your business.  There's an interactive demo waiting for you and a free trial  when you go to try.eset.com slash twit,  t-r-y dot e-s-e-t dot com slash t-w-i-t  to get your free trial and interactive demo.  Thank you, he said, for protecting us all this time.  And I didn't even know it.  Try.eset.com slash twit.  Let's see here.  The next G is here.  You thought 5G was cool.  What do you see next G?  And Google and Apple among many others are joining the Next G Alliance.  Stacey, tell us all about 6G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Silence.  Silence.  Stacey wants a cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to talk about this.  6G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I saw this and I said, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will not read about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.  Well, because this is not the Wi-Fi 6G.  This is actually the cellular 6G.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Correct.  And the bandwidth not yet licensed.  It will not be around until 2030.  So don't worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, I mean, it's the time for engineers to start thinking about this.  You do start thinking about your next G about 10 years before it's due.  You really do.  Because all these guys, and what's notable here, this also happened with 5G,  but the rest of the world was late.  But this is no longer just a cellular thing.  There used to be the 3GPP was all the cellular carriers and they got together.  They were like, hmm.  I was writing about 4G in seeing demos and tests of that.  Yeah, four or five years before it even made it into phones.  There's a lot of work that needs to happen.  And every G gets even more complicated in terms of,  like 5G is incredibly complicated because of the multiple antennas,  that it can go across different spectrum bands.  So it makes sense that we're talking about this now.  But for most normal people, don't even worry about it.  The engineers are meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, the first meetings this week.  But listen to who's in it.  I mean, it is, you're right.  It's not just cellular carriers.  Charter communications, Cisco, HP, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Intel,  Keysight, LG Electronics, VMware, AT&T, Bell Canada, Sienna Ericsson, Facebook.  I mean, Microsoft, Nokia, Qualcomm, Samsung, T-Mobile.  So it's all the carriers plus.  It's the hardware and manufacturers.  G to the N.  Yeah.  And we got to plan because the world does not stand still.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you know.  Who's going to need these high definition TVs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Was that what you were saying, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said no one will ever want to have a TV that's more than 400 lines.  That's crazy talk.  Crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I talked to some people at Cable Labs about the next gen TV.  It's actually kind of cool.  Is it AK?  No, it's a different filming technique for a more immersive experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's high frame rate, high dynamic range.  Yeah.  Yes.  All of that.  And I was just like.  I don't like it.  I'm like, how many TVs will that be?  No.  And it's a lot.  Remember when they did the.  What did they.  So there was a movie.  Ang Lee did a movie called Billy Lee's Billy Swan's Long Halftime Walk.  Did you ever watch that movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't Lord of the Rings in 60p?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think.  Yeah.  I think you're right.  Lord of the Rings was.  In fact, people were saying Gandalf's wand when it's 60 frames a second looks like he  it's made out of it's made out of resin and was purchased.  Wands are us.  It looks because when they filmed it, you know, it was 24 frames and it was a little  smeary and it looked real.  But at 60 frames, man, you can see every hair as it's glued onto his face.  It's not Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.  If you ever want to see what hyper realistic filmmaking is, it's promise you.  You can't really see it on a regular TV, but it was high frame rate, high dynamic range.  Ang Lee didn't let his actors wear makeup.  He shot them very tight.  And it's like the guy actors in the room.  And it's really creepy.  It's super creepy.  It just took you out of the out of the movie entirely.  And it really shows how much we we think of a film as being 24 frames.  It's a little bit dreamy.  It's a little bit unreal.  And if it's too real, it's not a film.  It's creepy.  It's gone into the next uncanny valley.  It is.  It's too canny.  It's like too can Sam.  Although when you play video games, you want that high frame rate, right?  In fact, that's the big thing.  Oculus 2, the Quest 2 is 90 frames finally to match the Vive and others and the higher  frame rates better.  But I'll tell you a high frame rate in a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'm the only person that didn't mind it.  Did you see it though?  Did you see it in the high frame rate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe it's an old person versus young person thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because there's very few theaters that can show it in that frame rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't see it.  I never went to the theaters unless it was Star Wars or Black Panther.  High frame rate.  Like if someone's watching soap operas, it doesn't bother me.  I like how crispy it looks.  Oh, the soap opera effect?  I noticed some of the people on YouTube are doing 60p on some of their videos and it looks  pretty good to me.  But all of the comments are complaining about it being too real for them.  But I love it myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's two problems with high frame rate.  One is that some TV, almost all TVs now, will do frame interpolation to get to take the  30 frames and make it 120 or 240 even.  And that really does have that soap opera effect.  It looks very strange because they're faking it by interpolating frames.  That's a negative.  That's a bad effect.  And Hollywood's lobbying against that.  They say turn off frame interpolation.  But then there's the natively shot at 60 or 120.  And I agree with you, Ed.  If it's a documentary kind of thing, if it's recording real life, that's fine.  When it's doing a story, a movie as in a Hollywood story, it's disconcertingly real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you not consider it like you're looking at a Broadway play or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, except you're right there.  You're looking at a Broadway play but you're on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're watching Hamilton in 120 frames per second.  That's true.  That looks outstanding.  Not that I'm watching Hamilton, but...  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why aren't you watching Hamilton?  He doesn't like Hamilton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not a musical person.  I like music, love music, but musicals never really did it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Hamilton's not a musical.  It's just...  Yeah, it is.  Okay, it's a musical, but it's the best.  I was like, yeah, it is, Leo.  It's a musical plus.  It's so much better.  That's like saying, I don't know, a German chocolate cake is just a cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because you're worth it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you're worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, because you are.  Because you are worth it, baby.  L'Oreal.  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is introducing AR makeup because obviously a problem with the business,  I saw somebody today on Twitter say, my makeup is all going to expire before I have to use it.  There are other friends that say, no, I got to...  I got to do it in Zoom meetings.  And then I see L'Oreal announces the first digital makeup line.  It's purely...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For online?  It is purely AR.  Oh, it's AR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a Snapchat filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Snapchat filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is, but L'Oreal is making a business out of it.  Kind of.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are people really...  So...  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the moment when even Stacey feels old.  Breathe, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not breathing.  I'm just I'm just thinking about it.  I'm like, would I pay for this?  I mean, I own...  I pay...  I spend crazy amounts.  You wouldn't know what to look at me, but I have quite the makeup drawer.  And every now and then I will go crazy with fun, like euphoria-esque makeup and my wigs.  But...  I'm just trying to think if people...  Like if the effect is good enough on a Zoom or whatever that it's going to handle...  Like, I mean, fake makeup looks weird when you move.  Like the filters look...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Holy cow.  Wait a minute.  They're using...  It's Snapcam.  It's Snapcam.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Snapcam.  So it's just some Snapcam filters.  That's all it is.  It raises interesting questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a gimmick.  It's all it is a gimmick.  But will L'Oreal and what Stacey's heading toward, will L'Oreal be in a makeup company, add value?  Listen, hey, Leo, you're a guy who buys fake hay.  So let's not get too...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you want to know what L'Oreal's business opportunity is?  I saw it at CES and I think it's freaking baller.  This was last year.  Do you want to know or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's freaking baller.  You're trying to act young again.  Go ahead.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If she were trying to act young, she would say it's hella baller.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's like acting like you're from California or Seattle.  I don't know.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is MAS, Makeup as a Service, says Zephyr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a personalized compact that you take your picture, you get all the information about your face  and then it will...  They're color cartridges and it will make the color for you so you can apply it for that day.  3DU.  Yeah.  So it's kind of like...  I mean, it's personalized makeup.  It's like the bar robots where you stick your beverages and your condiments or whatever in  and then it...  A personalized cocktail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had me at bar.  I think this is...  Or for your skin treatments.  This is actually brilliant because if you think about it,  half of the Snapchat videos, Facebook reels, Instagram reels, Facebook,  half of them have Snapchat effects.  I mean, all of them.  Everybody does this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see so many moved out faces and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And influencers go crazy with this stuff.  I think it's actually a very smart move on L'Oreal's part.  It doesn't look like they're charging for it or maybe they are, but it can't be very expensive.  The idea is...  And it works with not just Snapchat, but they have Snapchat filters, Instagram filters.  They even have Google Duo filters.  You and Google Duo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All three people using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they put some effort into this, but they don't charge for it.  But this is a brilliant brand play.  I actually think this is quite smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you could test out their colors on your face without actually going into a place and  testing it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good point.  Oh, was that your brand?  People can say, oh, how did you get that look, L'Oreal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's smart for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People really say, where did you get that look?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where did you get that look?  For a mainstream makeup brand, that's actually really smart.  It makes them a little hipper.  I mean, L'Oreal is not...  You tell me, Stacey, but I wouldn't say that they're not first tier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I was at Conde Nastal when cosmetics companies were worried about a lot.  And they wouldn't go anywhere near...  They hated Sephora.  They didn't want to be anywhere near Sephora.  They wanted to control their experience in Bloomingdale's all on their own.  Then they had to go into Sephora and found out it was actually pretty good for business.  And then they avoided online like the plague.  And then finally, slowly came on.  So the high end cosmetics won't do this.  So this is really smart for L'Oreal as it gets ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You want to read a really interesting book.  It's kind of peripherally about this.  It's called Clean.  It's by a physician named James Hamblin.  And he talks about the history of soap.  And the history...  It really is the history of cosmetics from the very beginning.  It turns out that soap really didn't exist until the knackers, the slaughterhouses,  realized they had this huge surplus of animal fat and animal byproducts.  They couldn't do anything with.  And so they turned it into soap.  But now they have all this soap.  And they couldn't figure out what do we do.  So they created literally with marketing.  This is a very early marketing success about 150 years ago.  They created a market for daily bathing, which didn't exist.  You can imagine what the world smelled like before that.  It didn't exist.  Nobody bathed.  They thought it was bad for you.  It created a market for it.  They...  You know, Ivory, 99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's fascinating.  People in Western Europe didn't bathe.  Europeans didn't.  You're right.  Muslims did.  They thought Europeans were disgusting.  It was religious ritual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jews did.  It was religious.  But in the West, yeah, we didn't bathe.  We were disgusting.  But they created a market using marketing.  It's fascinating story.  The beginning of the book is all about that.  Because they had a surplus product.  And they created...  It became a billion-dollar market.  And actually, the cosmetics market really is a follow-on to that.  Later on in the book, he talks about...  And deodorant.  And deodorant also created, invented...  Invented need.  It's really fascinating.  And actually, there's some evidence...  And he's a physician, so he's talking a little bit about the evidence that  probably all this washing is not good for you.  You're hurting the microbiome in your skin.  You're damaging it.  Every now and then you need some filth.  A little filth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a bad thing.  As you're doing the history moment...  Yes.  196 is a very fun video.  The...  Oh, the sage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The computer with people inside.  This is from Archive.org.  By the IBM Military Products Division.  So I have to say, one of the things that  Dicty Bartolo does every Saturday afternoon with his GizFizz,  he plays these old movies.  And they're so much fun.  They're so great.  Yearn to learn, he calls it.  So we're watching a rocket launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, we must be on guard because the Russkies are going to come and get us.  That's right.  So we need IBM to protect us.  The kids could get bombed any second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this was you and me, Jeff.  Ducking and covering under our school desks.  You bet.  Preparing for the Armageddon to come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank goodness IBM was there on guard.  On guard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Protecting our little children.  By the way, playground equipment that these days would be considered so dangerous.  Yeah, you want to know what danger?  They would be banned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Forget the Russians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So many broken arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God.  There is a picture of one of the very first  jungle gyms installed because people were worried that kids weren't getting enough fresh air and  getting outside.  Kids were climbing like literally 20 or 30 feet up on these things and swinging from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Over rocks.  And all around.  It was nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find that.  Being kids.  And you know what?  We liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My fear of heights began then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here is a picture.  This is in 1900.  This was built on school yards.  Oh my Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My palms were sweating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These kids.  Look at this kid in the middle.  Just kind of sitting there.  Just hanging up upside down.  The early days of school playground equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you hear YouTube change their terms of service?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube has changed their terms of service.  Breaking news.  Aunt Pruitt has the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well they updated their terms of services regarding the ads that are going to run on  some people's accounts that aren't necessarily in the YouTube partner program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh like if I put ads in like this, like we do, what are they going to do?  Oh it's going to run ads but not give you money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you put ads on Twig you'll be able to get some of the share.  The revenue share.  The whole three or four cents that they give you.  But if you're someone that doesn't qualify, YouTube has said we may put ads on your videos.  But you won't get revenue?  You're not going to get any of that money but we're going to put ads on your videos  from time to time.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are killing the YouTube rewind this year and probably for every year from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh rewind was that the like things that happened on YouTube?  All the wonderful things that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The most hated video on YouTube it was the 2018 rewind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't understand why they didn't stop back then.  They just didn't move the needle the right way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know it was a way that of YouTube.  Let me see what the 18 million thumbs down on this.  Of course it has 208 million views.  That's the Fresh Prince about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's rewind time.  You know if I control rewind I would want Fortnite and Marques Brownlee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is some might say the jump the shark moment.  Is this what you want?  You know who I would have asked for?  So these are all YouTube celebs.  Quit horsing around.  There's Ninja driving the bus the Fortnite bus.  You said jumping music?  Jumping music.  Now they have to jump out of the bus because it's Fortnite get it?  Yeah this is triggering me too.  Yeah you don't have to watch it.  This is what kids did in the 21st century before we had playground safety.  They would jump out of buses.  Jumping out of a bus.  But this was YouTube I think this was their idea to  you know kind of reward the most important voices on YouTube.  But then PewDiePie wasn't in it and people got all upset and then down voted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you figure rewarding this would be rewarding to those big creators?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well you know wider audience.  Yeah it's also an honor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't the algorithm already doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No no no but you don't understand that because you have no ego.  It's an honor.  It's an honor to be in the video like you're one of the top creators and people watch it  and go I saw Justine in there she's one of the best.  No I think that that was a big deal but the backlash has been pretty  even Marquez kind of wasn't too happy about the rewind.  He looked thrilled.  So rewind's gone for this year because YouTube says it was a bad year and we didn't think we  wanted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It wasn't I mean they're not wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't want to relive it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Rockefeller Christmas tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What no what did I miss something?  My mom just would have said leave it in the corner it'll be fine.  Wait a minute wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute this is the Rockefeller.  Oh my god that's the best they could do.  It's like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was okay when they cut it down but by the time they also apparently rescued an  owl from it which is nice and they're rehabilitating the owl.  But it's so ratty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my god that's terrible.  Wow.  They're gonna have to be like 2020 right there.  That's that's that's what they say the internet is trolling the Rockefeller Christmas tree  for being so 2020.  Oh my gosh.  Unbelievable.  Well once they put the five miles of lights on it and the L'Oreal snapchat filters I think  you won't notice a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh now that's something like a tree filler filter that could be kind of a virtual or  virtual ordinance where you could have it like you could do like a winter wonderland theme  or like a country christmas theme or I don't know that'd be kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm so glad you brought that up because I missed that meme.  I hate it when I miss the Rockefeller Center Christmas.  Oh the Rockefeller Center?  Yeah I missed that.  It wasn't in our rundown.  Thank you for bringing that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Karsten you failed.  Well maybe it is.  No I shouldn't say it wasn't in a rundown.  It probably is.  Karsten's pasting it in real quickly.  Sorry Karsten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No I'm sure it's in there.  You got dimed Karsten.  Stick it in there fast.  Oh yeah yeah there was a line on 476 you just didn't see it.  There are a lot of lines in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are a lot.  I kind of looked at this and I was like oh I don't even know which ones I care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well there's Zoom's what's wrong with Christmas for a moment there is Zoom Santa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh and Zoom's taking oh you should tell everybody that Zoom is going to let people  like talk if you don't have a Zoom account for more than 40 minutes over Thanksgiving  and I would be curious because next week is Thanksgiving and we've all got a plan.  Not how are you handling this but what is your Zoom slash virtual attendance strategy for  Thanksgiving because I don't think I want to like I know I don't want to eat virtually at the table  with like I don't want us all trying to be eating at the same time.  That does not sound fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  We haven't we haven't really figured it out yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was really hoping I could get like creative ideas anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I saw and I don't know if this is true I saw a stat that said 38% of all Americans still plan  to go travel to Thanksgiving gatherings of more than 10 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well that's just dandy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Silly.  And I also saw shortly after that somebody said your  your Zoom Thanksgiving is going to turn into something horrible.  I can't even say it because it's so depressing something like your Christmas funeral.  Enjoy your enjoy your COVID Thanksgiving's and then your Christmas funerals.  Yeah so we we were going to do that we were going to have family we we went through a bunch of  strategy ideas we were going to get tables outside but it's cold of course and it's rainy and  you know that wouldn't be good.  So then we said all right what if everybody gets a test but then the problem is not everybody was  willing to get a test and if they did they would have to quarantine from the like the time before  a few days before they got the test to the meal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah because even if you even if you just got if you if you just got exposed it's not going to  show up in the test for five to nine days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right so you got to like quarantine for a week before the test get the test and then not do  anything.  It sounds feasible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah it's not going to happen.  Just for some damn turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah so we basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not the turkey it's your family but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But in the worst it's doubly difficult because it's also Michael's 18th birthday on Thursday.  Oh my.  So that's a and that's a big deal right your 18th.  Yes that's huge.  Everybody wanted to gather to celebrate that but Lisa and I just decided no it's going to be the  three of us and just because of covid and we said Michael you're 19th we're going to make it a  really great birthday but we just can't do it this year.  He understands but it's still hard and then and I have on order like a 20 pound turkey and an  18 pound ham so I think we're going to freeze the ham for three people and a cat.  I think that's what Dorothy Parker said eternity is a ham and two people.  We're going to freeze the ham we're going to make the turkey and then I think we're going to drive  around to people who are local and deliver you know turkey care packages I guess.  So that's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah oh and you could you could sign in for turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are you doing and for Thanksgiving anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not doing a thing.  Hopefully I'm watching television and we're just hanging out.  Thanksgiving for us I know this is going to sound weird but where I come from Thanksgiving  dinner was pretty much like going to grandma's for Sunday dinner.  It was hardly any differentiation other than a turkey if that so it never really changed for us  and even when I stopped you know going down to my mom's for Thanksgiving or whatever it was just  another meal and we just sort of hung out and relaxed for a day and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think in an America that did do that that had Sunday dinner with all the family Thanksgiving  isn't as important but it's assumed a lot of importance in the modern America where we're all  a diaspora and nobody gets together and it's the one time of the year everybody gets a chance to  get together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I remember being young and some of the classmates would just be all excited about  their dinner for Thanksgiving and they would tell me what they're having and this and that  and I'm just having a mental checklist going you know we had that Sunday we had that Sunday  we also had that and just it's like oh so every Sunday dinner at my grandmother's or my great  aunt's home was like Thanksgiving for most people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But see that's a testament more to you and your great family and what you did on Sunday.  How big were those Sunday dinners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh dude it would be probably 20 people in and out coming in to eat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See that's Thanksgiving.  Yeah that's Thanksgiving.  Yeah and you had it every week I'm so jealous.  That's so wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good god that sounds like a lot of work.  Or if you're Italian in New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah Sunday gravy.  That's what people do.  Yeah make the Sunday gravy.  Yeah I kind of wish I had.  With the wife not the mistress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah you keep your what is it the gum not not gumbah the.  The what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's not offend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's an attack in the sopranos the gumah right I think was there gumah anyway.  Oh I know you're talking about.  Yeah it's a sopranos thing.  Yeah it's a sopranos thing.  Gabagool or something.  Gabagool is also very good.  You should have Gabagool but not your gumah at your Thanksgiving.  I'm just saying.  Very important to make the distinction.  Don't forget the cannoli.  And don't forget leave the gun take the cannoli.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I will I'll call my mother and check on her but that'll be about it.  I don't that's we don't really just do a whole lot of reaching out or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about you Jeff?  Are you planning you're not planning a big event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No we're debating still.  I mean son Jake is in Boston with his girlfriend and they are quarantined but.  As of now they're coming down and stay in a week quarantined down here.  That's so risky.  I know I know.  We haven't seen him in ages but yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah so what do you think Stacey what's what are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh ours is well I was going to suggest either appetizers or kind of zoom happy hour after.  That's not bad.  The dinner.  It's easier to drink than eat on zoom.  Right and it's a it's a smaller amount of time plus I was trying to figure out the logistics of  getting my stuff on the table when they were getting there like there's four families that  are trying to.  Oh wow.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And I was just like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Challenging.  Challenging.  That is not not going to happen.  Well most like two chunks of family are in Austin one's in San Antonio and then we're up here.  And that's just my husband's family the other my family's small and they'll just  my parents haven't celebrated Thanksgiving since they only celebrate when we come.  Although my mom's so sad I'm half worried that she's going to show up at my door and then what  do I do but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I sent my mom and she got it yesterday unfortunately a little Harrington's ham  with some Vermont cheddar some bacon some a whole little care package that she could  nibble on and nosh on and then we're going to zoom her.  But yeah it's but this is just one of many you know sacrifices some of us losing loved ones  there'll be as they say an empty seat at that Thanksgiving table because of COVID.  So it's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  sorry this is the ring mailbox sensor that will work with the ring bridge  this is sidewalk is this sidewalk okay so this is not sidewalk yet one day the ring bridge so you  need a ring bridge and you need this sensor this is the sensor god it's huge good lord

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  okay there you go ladies and gentlemen our first review hands on first unboxing  wow where does it go does it go on the door of it goes in your mailbox it just goes in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  goes in your mailbox and when it goes off it opens and it's like oh hey you got mail  you've got mail it does not but i bet i could set up an  amount of notification you can do an if this then that so which part goes where  well that's a good question again literally just unbox it my bet is this is a mount so if i wanted  to i could mount it this is a pir this looks like a pir sensor okay what's that infrared

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's motion oh it is motion okay it's motion or light yeah it's it's any sort of movement  and light counts as movement um this looks like it slides onto something i'm guessing this is a puck  that stands outside so because your mailbox is like a faraday cage so you can't get the signal out of  it that's exactly what it is sure so that's what i'm thinking this is the antennas and such  but i don't see where this goes maybe in here anyway haven't installed it yet we'll tell you  next week how it works but this is my thing of the week oh this is 29.99 and you do need a ring  bridge to work with it oh this is the sticker so yeah this goes on the outside of your mailbox

Transcript:  number mr ant pruett your pick of the week well mine is uh because you know i love watching netflix  on the weekends or does any type of docu series and this is probably something that's not new to  many of you but it's called song exploder and it's focusing on the musicians and artists as they  sit down and begin to create their the work of art today getting ready to put out and in particular  i've watched the first two episodes and the second episode was featuring hamilton lindman  lindman well miranda see see you like hamilton after all of that huh see hold on hold on i didn't  watch hamilton but i respect the process um some people don't know but i used to be in the band  even though i was an athlete i was still in the band i didn't know that to march and things like  that and i was also in concert band and also in jazz ensemble so what did you play saxophones  i can see that and so i i love the the the work and the process that that goes into people sitting  down and composing music you know people i'm gonna piss some people off but i give a little  bit more credit to people that sit down and put a c on the staff and a f sharp on the staff more so  versus writing out lyrics you know it just seems like it just takes a different type of brain to  do that but just the story but behind those two episodes just really blew me away alicia keys is  another one that i love and that song three hour three hour drive the way it came together had two  total polar opposites um as far as how her input came in versus the uh co-op uh artist in there how  his input came in it's two different ends of the spectrum but yet it melded together to make this  beautiful track and it just it really warmed my heart because i heard the song before i never  thought anything about it but when i heard the story behind it man it gets you right in the fields
