Jeff is the Leonard Tau Professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School  of Journalism at the City University of New York, blogger at buzzmachine.com and Ant Pruitt from  Hands-On Photography and Hands-On Wellness. Always a pleasure to have all of you on. So Stacey took a nap.  Jeff and Ant watched as long as they could and gave up. I had to do Windows weekly so I only saw  the opening statements. We're talking about of course testimony today in front of the House  Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust by four of the, I don't know, five or six big tech CEOs from Amazon.  Jeff Bezos, first time he's ever testified in Congress, which is kind of interesting.  Mark Zuckerberg, who's been there before many times. Sundar Pichai, who's always been kind of a favorite of Congress,  I think. He's always done very well there from Google, our own CEO. He's not really our own CEO,  but this is this week in Google, so we'll own him. Or as a Republican congressman called him

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mr. Peach Eye. How can you not know who's Sundar Pichai and how to say his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's poor briefing on the part of the staff. Mr. Peach Eye. Mr. Peach Eye. And then finally of course  Tim Cook from Apple. And actually I have to say, I was listening, I was getting ready to come to  work because it was delayed by like an hour and 15 minutes, which is frustrating, but then after all  I do the same thing. So now I know how you all feel. I finally said, look, I'm taking a shower,  and of course as soon as I started, got in the shower, they started. So I was listening to all  of them speak, then I quickly wrapped myself in a towel because I wanted to run out in the living  room. Lisa was watching Liverman. I wanted to see because part of the theatrics of this, all four  CEOs were on video cameras. I think they're all using WebEx. Is that the congressional choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  WebEx has some security features I think that might be why they're there. That would make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some members of Congress were there, some were not. The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,  Jerry Nadler was not, but Jim Jordan was. And so was Cicciolini. Jordan's the ranking member,  Cicciolini's the chairman of the committee. And I wanted to see the backgrounds of all four CEOs  because I thought this is going to be kind of telling you how they were dressed. Zuckerberg  kind of had a loose tie. He looked like he got in some sun, but as one would expect with Mark  Zuckerberg, it wasn't a tan. It was just very freckly nose. And he kind of looked burnt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course, everybody made fun of him because he put the zinc on his face when he was surfing.  Yeah. And now we know why.  Everybody made fun of him for protecting himself from sudden.  Oh, that's the right thing to do. Thank you.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so he looked like he was at his Martha's Vineyard house. I don't know. It was like on  the porch of his house with the... And then I was a little disappointed. I expected the richest man  in the world to have something a little better, but Jeff Bezos just kind of had an office  with a credenza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why you're the richest man in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. He saves money. Well, very famous, the Amazon for years made their...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Rate my Skype room rated Bezos. And they did them all. Okay. Yep. You need to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. Very famously for years, Amazon had desks made out of doors on sawhorses. I don't know if  they still do, but that was actually the big thing at the time. So you're right. That's why he's rich.  So here's, let's see what room raider has to say. There's Jeff Bezos.  That's so good.  And you see, it's just a credenza. Looks like it could have come from Ikea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not... Well, a little more expensive than that, but yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, and it's kind of not a lot of effort put in dressing it. I don't think that's  a real place. That's probably a... I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a nice use of the rule of thirds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Back off the soft focus says room raider. Add books. Remember books? Order a couple of ring lights.  Here's one. You gave it 4.5 stars. Six out of 10 for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know what that feels like, but I like that he's just slightly off center. I like the rule of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  thirds. And even the fact that this isn't straight behind him. This is all, I think,  I may be wrong, very conscious. That the idea is to make it look like an executive in the office.  Not a stage set. So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or maybe it's his lawyer's office, but go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, and a black suit, black tie, white shirt, very nondescript. Didn't want  to look too rich, probably. Mark Zuckerberg...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't choose a blue or red tie anymore because that's now politicized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not saying something. Zuck is wearing a checked blue tie with a white shirt. Both  Zuck and Bezos affecting the rich man's spread collar, which of course is a Britishism that I  find particularly annoying because anyone with taste wears a good preppy button down collar.  Anyway, he does look like...  It's all about how your face is shaped.  I'm just kidding. He does look like he's got some freckles. So he's been in getting some sun.  His tie is loose. Not exactly tight, but remember we kept him waiting an hour in the green room.  And I don't get the background here, but honestly, it looks like he's on the porch of his Nantucket  summer home. It's an odd kind of background.  And it says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does he have a Nantucket? It's shiplap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, he's well lit. In fact, if you look in his eyes, you can see it may not be a ring light,  but he's got some good lighting going on there.  Hostage video, says room raider. Putin has not released him, but has allowed him to loosen his  tie. That's nice. Two out of 10. That is as simple a background as you can get.  Tim Cook. Ooh, even worse. This looks like there's some dying plants.  He's in the lobby.  Yeah, this is awful. There's those partitions, those cloth partitions. They used a dead noise.  He looks like he's in borrowed somebody's cubicle. It's terrible.  And you can see in front of him, and I'm not sure why, you can see a... It looks like an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know, a Macintosh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it's an... Well, it's obviously an Apple device, but it's an iPad.  Tim wearing gray, gray suit, light gray tie, kind of light gray shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Lightly off white shirt. It's nice. It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not doing the spread collar, but it's still a little more spread than Americans wear.  Tim Apple needs some work. Plants help, but that wall needs a patch of art. Depth would help too.  I think the plants look dying. My favorite was, and I'll be curious what room raider thinks.  Yeah, Sundar Pichai. Loved him. Loved him. This very textural sculpture or painting behind him.  Another credenza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wondered if that would sound baffling. It looks kind of like...  You could buy a textural baffling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And a...  Probably an expensive sound baffling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also serious dark suit, dark tie. Almost matching, but a little bit lighter gray.  And the least spread of all the collars.  Well tied.  I feel like this actually might be his office. What do you think? I feel like it almost might be.  No? He also has a plant. Room raider, of course, loved him. Loved the texture, great composition.  The vase and plant are perfect. Strong 9 out of 10. It would be 10 out of 10 with more color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He should have stuck a Google product, the little speaker that's covered in cloth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Home Mini or something.  I would have set that off nicely. But you know what? None of these guys...  In fact, one of the things they all said is, hey, what are you talking about? None of us are dominant.  Tim Cook was famous. He said, Apple is not dominant in any of the markets we participate in.  We're a small part of any market we participate in. However, that's not our goal. We don't want  to be dominant. We just want to make the best products, which actually I think is sincere.  Well, he's not dominant even in iPhone. He's dominant in Mindshare.  But even in the United States where the iPhone is the strongest, it's only 50%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's the app store, not the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that is what they talked to a little bit about. They kept him mostly on the sideline.  From what I read in the play-by-play, mostly Sundar Pichai who did a lot of talking.  As we already mentioned and expected, the Republican members of Congress were more interested,  even though this is the anti-trust committee, were more interested in bias,  anti-conservative bias than they were in any interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's because governing is hard and they don't want to do that. They just want to get all  aggravated and get their talking. I mean, what is even?  It is interesting. I think that Bezos' shot was carefully contrived. Remember,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he's got the best people, right? He is contrived to kind of blend into the background.  Seriously.  I'm not really here.  Isn't that how he deals in general? He never gives interviews. He's very much a blend in the  background kind of CEO. And so I think that was very conscious. I think all of these are pretty  conscious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But for those tight shirts at Sun Valley, there he doesn't blend in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but he doesn't expect anybody to be taking pictures of him at the Sun Valley.  Yeah, Tim and Sundar have normal collars, but the rich guys, the founders.  I like how you say the rich guys.  Founders. Well, they're founders. They're the founders. These guys are just hired hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of the four, he says, the rich guys.  The rich guys.  Zuck is so rich. He lost $70 billion in stock value over the last three months,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and he's still one of the richest guys in the room. That's how rich Zuck is.  So the founders prefer the British spread collars.  That's all I know. Although I said, I felt like after I watched the four speeches,  I felt more like Jeff. I felt like because all four of them were great pains to say,  look at the benefit our companies have brought us that we are the economic tech in general,  the economic engine of the United States. It's brought huge benefit, especially during this time  of quarantine. We are not trying to be cutthroat competitors. We're just trying to do a good job.  And I felt like I wanted to wave the flag. I felt like, yeah, God bless them. God bless them.  We know there's problems and there's things that should be addressed.  Whether Congress is the right way to do that, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tend to stay away from this stuff because quite frankly, I hate politics even though I know it's  part of our life. It is what it is.  You're not alone, Mr. Pruitt.  But I did want to attempt to watch this here and today just for the sake of the show and try to  have a little bit of information. And it just made my blood boil listening to some of the crap  coming out of the mouths of our leaders of the nation. You got one guy, the guy that you talked  about off air. Was it Dr. John something other?  Jim Jordan.  Jordan. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy without the jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. He's going on and on and just being rude and asking. I give him credit for asking a yes,  no question. And I hate when I ask a yes, no question and people won't give me a yes or no.  I give him credit on that for being frustrated on that. But it was still a lot of other chatter  going on with people saying, hey, well, why is my campaign email showing up as spam in my father's  Gmail account? And I'm like, really, your campaign, I guess they just don't quite understand how all of  this stuff works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I expected better because this is a subcommittee that focuses on antitrust.  So they're theoretically more up to speed have staff that's more focused on this exact issue.  They've heard a lot of testimony. I thought, oh, it's going to be better than the senators who  quizzed Mark Zuckerberg. And it wasn't much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it wasn't. And these, sorry, calm down. Again, so we're just looking at the,  go back to the spam email thing. I mean, this man was just so passionate and pissed off about the  idea that his campaign messages are not going directly to the inboxes of all of the citizens  that requested it. And I'm like, man, there's bigger problems on this planet. There's bigger  problems in this country, but you weren't about spam email, you know, and improper tags of your  campaign messages going out there. It just really, really frustrated me.  And then there was a Democratic representative from Florida. She asked questions and wouldn't  allow Mr. Pachai to freaking answer the question. Every time you want to answer, she cut them off.  And reclaiming my time, reclaiming my time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what a lot of this is, and this is the frustration I think most people see,  have when they watch this kind of congressional testimony is that is, especially lately, mostly  a opportunity to, you know, take the stage for these members of Congress to get on TV,  to get attention and to showboat. And that's really what I think we saw as a lot of showboating,  right? I don't even know if they care much about these issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's okay. So let's look at that. Let's look at that. They're wanting to showboat for who?  The people that could potentially vote for them?  Okay. So what does that say about the people voting for them? If this is what's impressive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember, most people are not going to watch these hearings. They're going to see soundbites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They see the soundbites and they get excited. There is very much a nihilistic strain in  the world. I mean, I look at my parents and I look at people who are fed up with politics.  And to them, these people are like, yeah, stick it to the big CEO, screw all these people.  And I mean, that's for them, this is exciting. This is candy. And I guess,  I guess they don't realize that unfortunately, we still have to govern a country and  yelling and this doesn't really help. And I feel like sometimes it's a very big,  they're playing to the immaturity as opposed to rising above it and realizing that  government, and if we could talk about this realistically, you need government to do some  things, we can debate what those things are and how far we're going to go on them. And that there  will be winners and losers and unintentional winners and losers each time. And Jeff, you and  I come up against this a lot, where I'm like, yeah, this is going to hurt some people. And you're  like, I don't want it to hurt these people. That will be bad. And I'm like, let's see what happens.  Let's see how people adapt. But we don't ever have those discussions in the US because they're  too hard of a conversation. And they're very, I don't even think they're too nuanced. It's just,  we can't have them in the formats that we currently have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no. Stacey, I think a great example of that is 230. Right? I don't think 230 should be touched.  I think it's good law. But even if you do think it should be touched, those who think it ought to be  reconsidered a little bit, you open up that Pandora's box. And what the heck happens then?  And you can't have a sane and informed discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They actually, I can't remember if it was Sensenbrenner, but they actually did bring  up 230 and the protection it offered and talked about it in a negative way, implying that it gave  these companies the right to censor speech they didn't agree with as opposed to. But I have to say,  government is intensely boring. Unless you're a particular kind of person. If you're a wonk  and you really enjoy this stuff, it's not, it's fascinating. But for most people, watching  government is like watching paint dry. It's slow, it's tedious, it's detail oriented, and it's  boring. What's sad is that as the more and more of these hearings are televised, and this was,  everybody knew this was going to be a lot of attention that we're, you know, everybody's  going to be talking about it. It unfortunately brings out the worst in these members of Congress  who are taking this as an opportunity to exactly as you say, Stacey, preach to the base. It's all  about, you know, feeding meat, red meat to the base, whichever base they have, and very much less  about governing, because they know that the actual governing part of the testimony would be intensely  dull. They didn't really seem that interested in fact finding. Don't get me wrong. For them to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  attack the CEOs of these large companies, I get it because ultimately, the leader of the company  is responsible, even though a lot of those questions, they're not going to have the answer  to right at that moment, because there's so many different levels of management in that hierarchy.  But they were asking those questions as if they would actually know right at that time. That's  the kind of stuff that frustrates me. If you're going to ask the CEO about something, you know,  do a little bit of your research. If you're a government and you're so detailed oriented,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  be detailed oriented in your research too. What happens is the conversations that you see and the  back and forth that happens prior to this between the congressional aides, were the people who are  actually crafting the policy. I mean, they educate the congresspeople and then the lobbying firms and  lawyers on behalf of the tech firms. So what's happening is this mass of people that we'll never  see or hear from, they're hammering out their statements, their questions. It's not entirely  scripted, but they know exactly where they're going to go. And they do that because most people  will find it boring and these guys have to get their sound bites out of it. There is some  accountability for this. I do think this is a good warning slash wake up call that when your  lawyers come in and they're like, yeah, this is a big deal. You got to go address this. You're the  CEO. They need you. No one else is going to do this. It's got to be you. That's an oh poop moment  for these guys in the sense that. It's a little bit like a court trial. You have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  witness who is clearly going to testify in his own interest. He's hostile. I don't think they  were under oath. Are they under oath? I don't think so. Oh yeah, they were. I don't think they

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  had to stand up because they would have been out of range of the camera. I was listening to the car

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and I heard him say you can remain seated. Okay, so they do get sworn in. So it is a little bit  like a trial in that sense. There's the risk of getting caught in perjury. So you're going to try  to avoid that. Yeah, lying to Congress is actually a serious offense. It's a federal offense.  Is it perjury? Maybe it's not called perjury, but it's lying to Congress.  Well, it's lying to Congress. You're right. Maybe it is. Yeah. So I think the opportunity is there  for the members of Congress to ask. So there's two kinds of questions. They can ask  questions that are just theater, like asking the question for the rhetorical purpose of asking the  question. They know they're not going to get a good answer, but the question. It isn't a federal

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  crime to lie to Congress while under oath. It's not? That is considered. It is. Okay. It isn't.  Oh, it is a federal crime. Yeah. Well, this was a terrible articulation of this story. I was like,  what? Yeah, I'm sure. And it is illegal to make false statements to Congress,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  even if you are not under oath. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Yeah. You really have to be honest with  Congress. So there's two kinds of questions, pointed questions that are purely rhetorical  to make the point. And then questions where you're actually trying to get the answer. I would hope a  committee like this would be trying to just like the Supreme Court when they're asking questions  during oral arguments. The questions would be more to gather information so they can make a  decision than to make a political point or rhetorical point or to showboat to. But unfortunately,  I think, especially when it's a televised hearing like this, it's kind of hard to get people to do  that. What would this have looked like in a perfect world, Stacey? What should have gone on here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this might be as close to perfect as we can get. And I say this, I wish we could get like the  money out of politics and some of this crazy grandstanding. Like, maybe if you had less  Twitterati and more just straight up C-SPAN, we could have some better conversations. But this is  kind of how it should look, which is interested parties get together and talk about how this,  people with actual expertise helped the politicians figure out the rules.  Yeah, that's right. Staff helps form the questions.  Were those people there because they were some of them lobbyists? Yes. And that's why I think money  is the ultimate corrupting influence here. But they had educated people doing this. They have the  companies on the other side. And if you had a, and I don't want more, like you could envision a  system where I call my congressman and I can like vote them in or out immediate feedback on stuff.  But I don't know, like I, as a short term person or my dad, for example, I don't know if we really  want that kind of instant response to things because I think we need to look at the long term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right. You don't need high-techs. You want to hire smart people to do a complicated job.  Right. But that isn't the way it is these days. Well, and then as somebody in the chat room's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pointing out, there's, you know, they're closed hearings where you perhaps get more serious about  it. Although I bet there's a bit of showboating in there as well. There is. I mean, yeah. I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  friends who work on the Hill and this is like it is. Yeah. Well, so Jeff, is there, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we, I think we'd all agree there is meat for the, there is a reason to have this conversation  that these are real questions that these companies do wield huge amount of power,  whether they're monopolies, whether they're trusts under the legal definition. Well, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So let's talk about how to have that conversation. Right. I mean, because what, what, what, what  scares me to death here is that you have a pincer movement of the left for its reasons and the right  for its reasons are going after the proprietors of the internet. And I'm scared for the internet.  These are the temporary proprietors. These are the people who are in charge of not anything.  I'm going to be there for forever. I don't think that's the internet, Jeff. I would say

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that they're the people building walls on the internet. I mean, we, the internet has changed  and is not a, is not a, not, it's a, it's a moving entity. I couldn't agree more. So that's what I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  saying is that it's not, these are the, these are the, these are the temporary proprietors of much  of the internet we see. I very much believe temporary. Nevertheless, they can have impact  on what the internet is going forward. Yes. But, but so how would you have this discussion? You  said, Oh, they have a lot of power. Well, let's have evidence of that. Let's have research that  informs the discussion. If we're going to talk about antitrust, let's do it in a line of the  legality of it and define the legality of it and say what I think is some of the questions

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about emotional things. No, I think some of the questions that actually happened. I can't  remember who it was. There was a member of Congress who was talking to Jeff Bezos and said, we, I,  you know, our research shows evidence shows that a company that pays you for advertising is going  to be higher ranked is going to be more likely. In fact, he mentioned testimony from the owner  of pop sockets who said Amazon competed directly with us by making a clone ripoff product of pop  sockets until we paid $2 million in advertising and then they stopped. So stay on the first point

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for me. That's the point. How do you think Coke gets the end cap? No, no, I, that was my immediate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  reaction is that Amazon's doing nothing different in some respects than a grocery store does. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  how groceries, you place replacement grocery stores as opposed to the dominant place people  network effects on the internet are much more there. If you imagine, you know, that you imagine  those things, you it's science museums that you throw the quarters in and it spins around and  around and around and it, but it always goes down the tube. Do you know what I'm talking about  on the internet? If you're a big enough site, I know this is, this is the drugs talking.  How many dollars if you're, if you're a big enough site, you become that funnel and nothing can  escape and you to get anywhere and the consumers at the bottom, you have to go through that funnel  in the real world. There is friction that we're accustomed to. So we go all over the place and  maybe, you know, buying an end cap at a Kroger versus a, I don't know who they're all owned by  like Safeway now. So I don't know. But I would say actually our issue isn't our issue is our  current definition of antitrust. And I think that's where we need to start is our current  framework in the U S for antitrust law is demonstrating actual competitive harm,  which I think is the wrong thing to look at in this particular era because I think it's hard  in its pricing harm is what we're looking at. I think what we need to start looking at is the harm  of, you know, aggregated data and the decisions that you make because of that. And then the  features and service, and that's much more difficult. It's a much fuzzier problem,  but that's actually like that's in part how Europe structures their antitrust laws.  And they're looking at these companies too. So I think actually what we need to do is to build  more sophisticated legal framework for antitrust. And that's what these years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now Jonah Hughes is asking Jeff Bezos if it uses data from AWS glean from hosting other  companies data for competitive purposes. This is something Amazon is accused of.  I'm reading Kashmir Hills tweets. I think that there may be maybe now later in the in the  game, they're getting into some of the more serious questions Val Demings is grilling Sundar  Pichai because Google promised not to combine Google and double click data when it bought the  ad company in 2007, but then did it 10 years later after Sundar Pichai became CEO. So these  are these are pointed questions, but I think and perhaps they don't expect answers from the CEOs  except, you know, deflection, but these are important questions. And they need to get them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on the record. Someone mentioned this in the chat. A lot of this is to get their  conversation, get this on the record and start these conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the but the desire still is the problem is much of the attack is anecdotal rather than  what you need to show under law is a pattern. And one person who's going to accuse you of something  that's not but it's dramatic. It goes to our earlier point about drama. Oh, that's going to  make a good clip is this woman at her bookstore. And I have no idea what the pattern is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So when they do these hearings, they actually have the data they pick. It's like actually it's just  like in reporting, Jeff. I call it the dead baby lead, right? You've got to find the dead baby to  get people excited about your boring story about your hospital, you know, admission trends, right?  So you find the dead baby, that's your anecdote. And then all the data so the data is actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  there. But they don't know that's that's a that's an article of faith. They could be picking out  one anecdote, it could be represent data, you don't know in the case of these folks.  They so it's like it's like Jim Jordan lists 20 anecdotes of how they're against conservatives.  I don't think that he has data behind that that proves that.  Well, in some cases, there isn't. In some cases, stuff is never going to become law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, so I've been part of like, I know, I've done like broadband, I was very much against  broadband data caps, right? And I talked about the harms that that could cause. In the GAO,  actually GAO, yes, GAO actually called because they were gathering that data and trying to figure  this out. And they had surveys that they were looking for actual data, not just anecdotes.  And I've had people who work staff for congressmen and women, they call and they,  they read your stories, for example, and then they call you and they ask for the data and the  people who will give you the data. The anecdotes are what's going to play in the hearing. Yeah,  they have the data. I can't be sure that they're doing one of these folks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think in our times, the members of Congress said we have the data,  we have the research that shows. And I think there are a number of very pointed questions  they've asked. We, it's still going on, unfortunately, so we can't really give you a final  take on all this. That's the last thing I want is another take. Enough takes. Well, I think at some  point, that's why I'd like to go through all the testimony and kind of find some new,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  they tell you that tell us also, create a storm about doing a very good job.  Good.  You know, there's other moments here where it shows, you know, that we see, especially the Senate,  but also in the House, ignorance of how the internet works, but then ignorance of how business  works, how retail works. Right? That this scandalous view that coming up with your own house product is  a terrible thing. Well, every single retail company does that. Right? And everybody has a widget.  Right. Raskin was going on about HBO Max isn't on the fire devices yet. And he's getting into the  details of a negotiation about that. That's none of his damn business. Yeah, really. Well, actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, that's the stuff that his constituents care about. Right. So that's when people call Congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and that's why they care about. He's playing to the political point rather than the legal point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you could argue that that's why he's there. This is political. Yeah, this is not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this is not a legal hearing. This is a very much a political hearing. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When consumers call their Congress people and they say, Hey, I'm really pissed that this is  happening. And it doesn't seem right. You know, that gets their attention. And, you know,  there is some of these negotiations, there is an antitrust or a competitive issue there that does  actually harm consumers, which is what our laws are designed to protect against.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we also are going to listen to for moments where accidentally perhaps a CEO lets  slip something or gives us a better insight into what their goals are. This is all a chess game.  And I don't think that you can't, it's going to cherry pick exchanges at this point is premature.  I do think there are some points of reading Neil I Patel's threads now on Twitter. It sounds like  there are some good points being made by the members of Congress. And I think, you know,  maybe the thing to do is wait till it's over and then let people like the lie and cashmere  hills synopsize the most important points for us. I will try to watch it though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stacy, one more thing about our dear field. Yes, a good journalist to should do what you say,  but journalists also pick out anecdotes to make the story the narrative they want to make,  and don't necessarily have the evidence and backup for it. And so we're guilty of that too,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  as a profession. Oh, yeah, dead babies, I can tell you. Because I write, I tend to neglect the dead

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  babies. There are some I have to say I'm looking at Val Demings. She's asking Tim Cook about  something that was a big issue a few months ago about Apple restricting parental control apps,  because they used MDM and then bringing them back. I think these members of Congress are  actually fairly well prepared. At least some of them are fairly well prepared with information  from their staff and so forth. And are asking questions that I think are important. So I'm  going to say on balance, you know, this is an important hearing. And I hope that we hear,  you know, I want to read the details more. But I hope we hear some of these accusations responded  to by these CEOs. I doubt they will. Right? I doubt they will. They will turn in further written

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  testimony later. That's right. That's right. Exactly. Because some of the questions are,  are of a nature where if I were sitting there, I would say I answer this right now,  because I'm going to make a mistake. And I don't have the details. And so we're gonna get back to  you. So it sounds like an evade. Sometimes the question is meant to draw that out. So it sounds  like an invasion when in fact, it's responsible answer. Jeff Bezos, for instance, early on,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there was an exchange about whether Amazon had demanded this pop socket testimony demanded  $2 million. And Bezos was very clear. He said, we don't that would be wrong. If we did that,  that was wrong. I'll investigate. He made a very clear statement about what their policy is. And  sometimes I think it's just, that's the point of it is going on record very publicly in front of  Congress saying this is, we don't tolerate that, or we don't do that. So that if they are found to  do it later, they you know, there's some there's some meat there, or even just getting them on  record to say it. I think this is going well, to be honest. But  you saw better than I thought I did. It's going better than I thought it would. There is a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of stupid stuff, which of course, these people should have been speaking in the first hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just takes time. Yeah, the oldest. Yeah, yeah. Well, they're coming back around. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  have another round. Mike Masnick is getting a migraine. I can tell. Here we go. One more  round of questions six minutes ago. Oh, no, no, no. Rep. Sicilien just pulled out fire in a crowded  theater and asked Zuck if he agreed with that line. You know that course coming from? Honestly,  he says Rep. Sicilien is coming off as the Democrats version of Jim Jordan in this hearing.  Both are screaming incendiary nonsense. So yeah, I wouldn't be so quick to judge my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I think there's a lot going on. I think you're going to unfortunately, you're going to see the

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  hot sound bites because those are the ones that are interesting. Here's the key one. Here's the  essence of it all from Masnick. So Rep. Sicilien, right? That's how you say it, right? Yeah. He's  the chairman of the committee from Rhode Island. Yeah. Thank you. Oh, the subcommittee. So Rep.  Sicilien is demanding Facebook take down the content that Matt's gets earlier was demanding  the Facebook keep up. That's the essence of everything about this hearing. That's the vice  they're stuck in. And so trying to have a decent discussion about real issues around that is very

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  difficult. Well, I mean, we have trouble here. Frankly, it's a this is all very challenging  stuff. I don't know what the right answer is. In many cases. This is about Jim Jordan saying you

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  took down the Hydroxychloroquine video and you have the left saying, why aren't you taking down  these disinformation videos? That's what I'm saying. Right. Right. Let's take a break. We're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going to come back with more. Our show today brought to you by World Wide Technology, my friends  in St. Louis. We were so impressed by the Advanced Technology Center. We talk about it a lot, but  there's a lot more that WWT does, including I don't know if you know this software development.  They do apps for their customers and they do apps right. And having been involved in the production  of a number of apps over the years, this is exactly how you should do it. WWT software  development experts use constant customer collaboration. That way they develop solutions  that are better than what could have been imagined at the start of the project. It actually gets  refined and improved as time goes by. We know software can change lives, transform business,  disrupt industries. We see it all the time. WWT can do that for you. Solve your toughest challenges  with its proven approach to agile software development. This is something WWT has always  been in. I found this fascinating when we talked with them. Always been interested in process.  They do a lot of work with the executives in management and process. They are very interested  in development processes. They support DevOps, the DevOps model. They support the agile model.  And because they're using agile, they are able to deliver end-to-end digital experiences  that blend best-in-class software development with the strengths, capabilities, and expertise  of a multi-billion dollar technology integrator. They do the hardware and they do the software.  If you're looking for the rare partner who could deliver both strategy and execution  for your next project, WWT is the partner for you. They worked with a very well-known hospital. I  won't say the name. You would know them. To help patients and families better navigate the care  journey, they created a custom app for patients and their families that allowed care teams to  interface with the patients, to give families all the info they needed from travel arrangements,  scheduling appointments, to wayfinding. And they really got results. Within a year, the hospital  started seeing a reduction in preventable readmissions for patients. Fewer days spent  in the hospital because they were able to do virtual care with this app. Fewer septic shock  deaths occurring in patients treated remotely. Again, this is all the app. The app has been so  successful. It actually won a Webby Award. Partnering with WWT, one of America's favorite  sandwich chains, brought digital transformation to more than 1,500 stores. The customer's investment  in next-generation technology included mobile, kiosk, point-of-sale, and loyalty enhancements.  The technology is positioned to scale with the company's pace of growth and has enhanced its  ability to deliver best-in-class service. Finally, WWT worked with a large grocery retailer to improve  its customer experience that led to the creation of a custom app, a loyalty program, enhanced  signage. It's kind of amazing. Apps really can't change the world. WWT helped this great retailer  achieve its two- and three-year goals in less than a year. If you've been thinking, we need an app,  we need a custom app, or a digital experience. If you're looking for somebody to do something  that will exceed your expectations, WWT's processes are unlike any other true agile software  development from planning to ideation delivery. Agile, and I've worked with Agile, has a number  of benefits. One of the chief benefits is it's one of the best ways to listen to a customer,  to respond to the customer's needs. They call them user stories in a way that really makes the  resulting app reflect your needs more accurately. It also helps you develop, as you go through this  process, exactly what your requirements are. It's a really good way to do requirements. Of course,  they support DevOps, as I mentioned. That combines people, processes, and technology to help your  teams continuously deliver service and value to your customers with speed, stability, availability.  And WWT's all-over container platforms, that's the hottest technology out there. Of course,  they're expert in that. Cloud-native and best practices to help you rapidly create services  that can scale and perform. So here's the bottom line. Solve your toughest challenges with the  software experts at WWT. They have the experience, the discipline, and the track record to deliver  custom software solutions, provide some real value to you, and most importantly, to your customers.  Transform your business, deliver great experiences through WWT's wide range of software services.  They're not just hardware integrators, they do it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So yeah, I put that up there. That's a really interesting story. It really is both Bixby and  the Samsung app store. Yeah. Which my reaction is personally was, oh, maybe I'll buy a Samsung phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This would be a good thing from your point of view. It is one of the knocks on all Samsung phones.  We're going to have a big Samsung reveal August 5th, next Thursday, a week from tomorrow. The Galaxy  Note 20, I guess they think they're going to call it a new watch, new earbuds, bunch of new Samsung  stuff. And I agree with you. It's the rap on all Samsung Android devices is they duplicate existing  Google products. They have their own mail, their own gallery, their own messaging. It's really  annoying. And they're doing a pretty good job though. Well, you know, a lot of people agree  that the Samsung internet browser is a much better browser than Chrome. Yeah, they're doing a pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good job. I remember the Samsung bloatware was so bad and just so it got in the way of just simple  tasks, you know, several years ago. And I think they just learned from it and things just got a  lot cleaner and just made the outstanding hardware that they're already working with just even better.  So kind of tip the hat to them on that. This is carrying these days, Ant. Pardon? What photo  are you carrying these days? I'm still a pixel guy, you know, courtesy of Uncle Leo there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We got our Pixel 4s. And by the way, that's another rumor, the Pixel 4a, John Prosser is now saying  August soon, like next week for the Pixel 4a. It's gonna be a very busy couple of weeks in Android.  So this is a writer's scoop. They said they saw correspondence yesterday between Google and Samsung  saying Samsung's considering dropping not only Bixby but the App Store from its mobile devices  as part of a rev sharing deal with Google. Samsung's response to Reuters is we have no  plans to drop either Bixby or the Galaxy Store. We remain committed to our own services and ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Be interesting. Stacey, if you didn't have to deal with Samsung bloatware, would you consider

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a Samsung phone? The hardware is great. Yeah, the hardware is really nice. Probably. I would  consider it. And there's a lot more options. So sure. I mean, the only reason I'm on Pixel is  because I want the cleanest Android experience. So sure. Yeah, the cleaner experience is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the other hand, Samsung, you know, it's kind of interesting because for a while it looked like  Samsung actually wanted to go its own way. That they did. Yeah, that they really didn't want to  be dependent on Google services at all. They have desks. They have a desktop. They actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  designed their own chips and were doing they have the Exynos and they were trying to,  I mean, they were trying to pull a full on Apple. And we know that for years Google has wanted them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not to do that. So this this letter that Reuters saw might simply be a continuation of a years long  debate between the two. And are you sure? Sure. Pretty please. Would you please consider  Killbyspr Bixby? Please. Now I admit Bixby. It's easy to imagine Samsung dropping Bixby. It doesn't  serve any purpose. And of late what Samsung's done with Bixby is make it less a general voice assistant  and more of a tool to help you use the phone. The open apps integrate interact. It's a paperclip.  Talking paperclip. Yeah, kind of is a little bit like Clippy. Yeah, kind of. But I don't know anybody  uses or loves Bixby. So I think Samsung could probably get rid of it. They've gotten rid of  things in the past. Remember, they had a music service called Milk they dropped. But I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know. The Samsung people that I know that are hardcore Samsung people, they never ever mention  Bixby. But every year they get the next line of Samsung device and will pay top dollar for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've had every note they've ever done and I'll buy this one too.  And I have to admit I use the Samsung store for Samsung specific stuff. So there are a few tools  that Samsung offers. There's wallpapers, fonts. There's things that Samsung does that are unique  to Samsung that they should be in the Samsung store. They shouldn't be in the Play Store.  You buy fonts for your phone? Oh yeah. Yes, there's some nice fonts. And Samsung has a font tool that  lets you change the font globally. There is a series of apps that are really nice apps designed  to change the UI on your Samsung phone in a lot of dramatic ways. It's called Samsung Unlock. I  can't remember the name of it. But I always download those and put the latest versions of those. And  that's where you get those is the Samsung store. So I think at this point, I don't use Samsung  Gallery or Samsung Mail or Samsung Messages. They're all way too close to the Google offerings.  I don't use those. But you can disable them. You can't uninstall them. You can disable them  and put them aside in effect. I really like Samsung phones. The cameras are great.  Where they really excel is the screens. They have the best screens anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Because they do that beyond the phone. Yeah. Yeah. Somebody's saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carson's saying somebody. This guy named Carson. We remember him. Yeah. He used to work here. He's  the guy with the mask. Yeah. Samsung Health is better than Google Fit. I would argue that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're right. In fact, Samsung. Google Fit is not all that. Google Fit is like, why are we

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  even talking about it? Yeah. And Samsung owns a lot of fitness hardware, right? So it makes sense  that they would integrate in better, perhaps. Google unfit, says Zephyr in our chat room.  Yeah. Google has announced that they are going to keep employees home until next summer.  This is the most aggressive of all the Silicon Valley companies. You know, Twitter said,  you never have to come back. Apple's starting to bring people back. Google says, you know,  we don't know what's going to happen. So why don't you just stay home until summer 2021?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that scary to you all when you read that headline? Just to think about the ramifications  behind it. This is a big company that clearly has enough manpower, I shouldn't say manpower,  enough resources to get a lot of things done remotely. And they're already just saying,  you know what? It's not even worth having our team meetings here together for camaraderie and get  the brains together and think about the next big project and, you know, all of those creative juices.  No, y'all just stay home. Stay home until next year. Yeah. Just stay home to next year.  That scares me a little bit when I think about just day to day life, you know, what we're dealing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  with. I think it's the right move. I think, I mean, I am not optimistic that, like, you know,  it's thinking about business travel because I haven't been on a trip in forever, but it's because  it's not safe. And I don't think it'll be safe for probably until early next year or even  this time next year. Madonna says we have a vaccine.  Yeah. And I think that given the lack of trust we have with our government, with everything else,  I think we're just going to be hanging out for a while. That's what scares me would be Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  saying, let's all go back next week. That would scare me. Another way to look at it, Ant, is I saw

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  in one of the, maybe it was that story, but one of the stories about it, which made me feel  a little mellower about it, is what they were saying was the talent, Google is its talent.  And so Google had to be able to say to people, we respect your safety, and we know you need some  firm answers to know where you're going to be. So we're just going to do the thing that's probably  right for you now. And it may be less, what I'm saying is maybe less a prediction and more a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  benefit. Okay. So I will say in adding on to this, this isn't a Silicon Valley company, but it's a  huge company, Siemens, German company, 300,000 people. Last week, they said that they were going  to establish mobile working as a core component of its new normal. They will make it permanent,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  both during the pandemic and beyond. I think that's what's going to be the upshot of all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. And I really enjoyed, I liked the way they talk about it, because they talk about it  as a continuation of what digitization has wrought. So the pandemic is a forcing function  that is pushing people out of the office because they don't really need to be there every single day.  And I want to find the quote because it was really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is forcing function a term you just made up or is that a standard business term?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, that's a term. I'm not that clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that. Oh, yes, you are.  I'm one of the few people that think that meetings are okay in person, as long as they're  productive meetings. When I started at Twitter, one of the first things I remember remarking on  was we just had a meeting and holy crap, we got stuff done in the meeting. Everybody was in person.  We hashed everything out and the ideas were bouncing off and it just felt like a productive  use of time. And I'd like to think that a lot of the bigger companies are able to do just that  in person instead of it's not the same as being remote. Other people will argue and say, yeah,  we can just do it remotely and have that same energy and same attention span. I don't know.  I don't know because I know how people's attention spans are just watching YouTube videos.  You get two minutes and you're looking away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Before you came to Twitter, how long were you working on your own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Excuse me. Before I came to Twitter, I was in IT for 17 years, 18 years, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Were you full-time employed in IT right before you came?  Right. I thought you were an independent ant before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was still independent on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  On the side, right. I didn't realize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In my IT experience, there were a lot of meetings that were a total waste of time.  They would happen way too often and then we would try to change how we get things  and move into doing, what do you call them, scrums, the little 10-minute scrums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stand-ups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those were somewhat better, but a lot of times it was a waste of time. I used to hate that. I was  like, man, why are all of these meetings that could have been handled over a quick phone call  to the three people involved or just an email just to say, hey, this is what I need done,  this is when I need it done, and this is who I need to do it in the story. Because the meetings  were just sort of political and just him hauling and just a waste of time. When I came to Twitter,  I'm dead serious. We went into that conference room back there and we hashed out some things.  I just started and everything just made perfect sense and everything just tied together and it  blew my mind. I said something to one of the staff there and they laughed and was like, no,  we always have fun in these meetings. I was like, no, we really got some stuff done in here.  I'm not used to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's two things I hear a lot from people about office culture. Well, actually, there's  quite a few. In fact, I'm reading a book, a number of books about office culture and how  it's a perversion and all sorts of things. But two things I hear all the time, meetings are number  one. Everybody hates meetings. Number two is the employee who wanders around, who doesn't seem to  have anything to do, but manages to screw you up by coming over and talking to you. Right?  The time wasting employee. But I have to say there are definite downsides. Karsten, if you had a  choice of working at home, which you're doing right now, or coming back and working in the studio,  which would you prefer? I would bet he'd prefer to work in the studio. So there are  collaborative things that happen at work that are positive. I think there's positives and negatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are times when that collaborative energy is just so much better in an office environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might be that this particular business we're in lends itself better to that than other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  businesses. I don't know. And I don't think they're going to get rid of that. For now,  because of the coronavirus, I think it's good that Google said this and gave a long time frame.  I do think that the future of work will see more focus on half and half time or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay. So as the boss, though, I interpret that as Karsten wants to  work half as much and get paid the same. No, that's silly.  No, I'll just tell you the boss's point of view. And I think it's not always wrong  is that people don't work as hard at home. Come on. You know you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I work twice as hard at home. I work harder.  When I work at giga ohm. And part of it is the nature of the job. So you do have to think about it.  You're writers.  But I mean, I worked so hard. I worked like 12-hour days. And when I was in the office,  I got half as much done because I was in meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to get stuff done at the office because the meeting's in that time-wasting.  And commutes. I had a three and a half hour commute every day.  I agree. But as a boss, I think that there's also this concern. I'm not looking at

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this person. I don't know what they're doing. I think that is the wrong metric. And I think that  is so much. I think that's actually a negative that speaks more to you and your insecurities  than it does to the actual productivity of the employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not just me, by the way. It's a general feeling among all employers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am a boss. I employ someone. I've never seen this. I've worked with a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In your business, you could do that because there's a distinct product  that either gets delivered or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's in most businesses, there's some sort of metrics. And if your metric is,  is that person's butt in the chair, then that's the wrong metric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wrong metric.  It depends on the business. Seriously, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're the person who greets people at the front of an office, then yes, the butt in the chair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or if you're a customer service representative. I think there are a lot of jobs where,  I agree. I think the factory floor is a bad metaphor for, especially for information work.  And it is. So I agree. But I also understand that there's this kind of,  and I find it hard to work as hard at home.  And see, I don't.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember when all of this went down. Most of my professional career  ended up being remote work from home full time.  Because one of my managers, bosses or whatever, came up and sat with me one day  and realized, you know what? This dude gets so many interruptions that has nothing to do with him.  You do eliminate that.  What are we doing? And then he would get the emails from something that I had  done from home later on that night because it was on my brain. I didn't have anything else to do.  So I just did a little bit of work. Didn't bother me any.  And he's like, wow, you just, you get a lot done when you're not here.  And I said, yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's think about, though, the jobs that are done at Google.  Some engineering is physical. You have to be in the server.  Those people have to go to work. Our engineers have to come to work.  Coding. So coding is a lot like writing in one respect because a lot of time is spent  solitarily typing. But there is also a very big, especially in big projects, collaborative  side to coding. Now, there are a lot of tools in coding that are designed to make that easier  remotely. But I think a lot of coders benefit from sitting across from or being in the  room with or at least having meetings with people who are working on a similar project  or the same project. That that's valuable. Maybe not. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say when Kevin and I collaborate, we do it. We just set up a video and we have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  time set aside to interface that way. And I think if you have time set aside for your group to get  together, like to truly focus together and you limit that to like an hour, that's important.  But you don't physically have to be in the same place. You just have to make  time for it. And you have to use that time efficiently. And I think what happens in  big companies is your meetings are not that time because they're taken over by politics.  And that's what the idea of like, I walk around and I talk to someone and we get more productive  because we're in the same place. That's because you're just in the same place and you're taking  your jiu-jitsu. You're using that time to do the thing that those meetings were probably  supposed to be designed for. Does that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I had a boss, the managing editor of the Examiner when I was there in San Francisco,  yelled at me one day. He sees me looking around the office and looking for gossip.  Damn it Jarvis, I pay you to be the town crier, not the office crier.  Oh, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to have my publisher used to when I was at a business journal, my editor would be  pissed if we were in the office. He was like, why are you here? My publisher though, wanted our  butts in the seats at 8 a.m. We would get a memo at least once a month about the reporters, the  news are being totally empty at 8 a.m. in the morning. And we're like, dude, that's because  we were at 7 a.m. breakfast with our sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are people like you who are self-starters, but there are also people who aren't self-starters.  There are people whose job requires them to take initiative, to come up with things, to do things,  to make calls. Sales is a good example, salesperson. A lot of that job is calling  people and staying in touch with. And some people can do that. I'm sure Stacey could do that at home,  but some people won't do it at home. Like those, get a sandwich.  Well, and then they get fired.  No, they don't necessarily get fired and they don't get fired necessarily right away.  Well, then that's bad management.  It's inefficient. But these are not things that are deliverable. So it's hard to get a metric on it.  You do start to notice things are not going well, or maybe the deals aren't being made that should  be made, that kind of thing. Yeah, those are metrics. Eventually, I think it probably hurts.  So, but don't you think that there are a lot of employees who just aren't capable of that?  What you're saying, they should just not have jobs, those people?  No, I'm not saying that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we will move to a future. Right now, it's tough, but I think we'll move to a future  where there will be a larger class of people who will want to work from home and who can

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  successfully work from home. Those people are going to be in good shape.  You know, when all this stuff goes so crazy, it's easier to have tiny apartments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Or, you know, they've got five people in the house and they need to get out or they're  more efficient and I think there'll be more choice involved. The interesting thing now is you already  see the remote lash occurring. I put in two things in the rundown where the Wall Street  Journalists are talking like, well, companies are saying this is not working. Well, but they're  missing every other factor that's involved. The stress of the disease, sick relatives,  children, school, public transportation. I mean, Jesus, it was ridiculous.  The New York, I put up another blog post that was kind of similar. It's all, it doesn't work.  We don't know yet. What did you call it, Stacey? A forcing function?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also complicated. I don't think there's a, I don't think there's a, it does and it doesn't work.  Maybe it does work for some people and it doesn't work for some people. It does work for some jobs,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  doesn't work for some jobs. Right. What's bothersome is everybody around it. The New York Times did a  story about my old building, used to be the Time Life Building, 1271 6th Avenue. And everything  is closed around it. And there's one hot dog. Oh, you both worked at that store at that building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a great article. I didn't realize that both of you had worked there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  They used to sell 400 hot dogs a day. Now he sells 12. 10. 10. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's, that's, when all of this stuff went down, I remember sitting my boys down to, to, you know,  to say, look, we need to get prepared. And I will openly admit my boys have some privilege in this.  You know, they, they have the resources here as far as having a decent internet connection.  But, you know, being able to log into whatever online schooling that they need to log into,  they have that. And I tried to tell them, look, I want you to get used to this because this  may be the norm, not just, not just for school, but when you're out of school and you get into  the professional world and start working, you know, I tried to stress to them that most of your  childhood, most of your life, you've seen me working in the house somewhere, you know, just,  just sitting at a desk for eight to 12 hours in a day working. You need to get used to that.  I wasn't necessarily getting up and going to the office all the time. I understand that it takes  some, some self-discipline to get up and put some clothes on, not necessarily a t-shirt or sweatpants  like what I have on today. But I would typically put on regular clothes as if I was going to the  office and I was literally just turning the corner in my house and sit down and work. So it's  definitely going to take a little bit of training for the future generations to try to, you know,  get their minds and wrap around it. It's going to be challenging because everybody's not wired  that way. I have family members that they're struggling with it right now for ADD reasons

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  or whatever, you know. And I would also say for some people, like I get migraines, right? Obviously,  y'all, I've got one now. When they were super bad, I would sit at my desk and I could still  work, not at a hundred percent, but I could still work. And I couldn't do that at a normal office if  I had to go in, like commuting into a physical location where I couldn't control things would  be too bad. And so like I would have a hard time if I weren't allowed to work remotely,  probably holding down a job despite the fact that I'm super hard worker and I think I'm pretty good  at what I do. But you wouldn't want to hire me because, you know, I'd be calling out sick like  twice a week. But, you know, when I was at home, I could just, and there were days I'd do this,  I'd be typing stories and then I'd throw up and then I'd finish my story and then I'd go lay down  and, you know, you can't do that in the office. I don't know. I mean, so there's lots of people who

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  working from home actually helps them. One concern, and then this was the New York Times  article about the Time and Life building, is that this might be a harbinger for what will happen to  cities, that there might be an exodus out of cities. There's been for years a trend of people  moving to the cities. Do you think that's reasonable? I know from New Jersey, friends of

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  mine who are, and spouses of friends who are real estate agents, they're selling houses out here on  the burbs like hotcakes at a certain price point. Colleagues of mine who would never think of coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to New Jersey are now feeling so trapped. That happened after 9-11 too, right? Yeah. And then they came back to the city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's the question. Are they going because of COVID and will they come back after COVID or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have they found a new way of living? I think there's some, there's a group of people who  enjoy being in a city and will stay there for a while. And I think maybe it's age dependent,  maybe it's wealth dependent. I don't know. It's just taste. I miss it, but my wife wouldn't do it.  Yeah. I mean, I would live in New York if I could, but my husband would just divorce me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we should all just get married because I would like to live in New York too, but my wife won't let me.  So the three of us should, we can make it a TV show. The three of us living in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  look here, Mr. Jers. I really like New York, but you can keep it. I'm not living there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's happy in Petaluma or, you know, he likes the farm country. I like it here. Yeah.  I would move to, I would live in Manhattan. Actually, every once in a while, Lisa teases me.  She says, now I don't get all excited, but you know, I think I maybe would like to live in Manhattan.  It's like, what? And then, you know, she thinks it smells. I've visited our buddy Dan out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like the Subways are cleaner. I like that. I remember visiting our buddy Dan and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  riding the taxi to his neighborhood in Brooklyn somewhere back when he used to live there.  There was a pigeon that I saw on the side of the road and I swear that pigeon had a cape on.  It was actually just trash, just draped to the pigeon. I'm like, well, it was super pigeon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was flying off to find criminals and poop on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like, come on, what is going on here? That would be a dramatic demographic shift,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  though, if people fled the cities. What I fear is that people too poor to flee the cities will end  up, the cities will be where you end up if you are economically disadvantaged. Oh my gosh, it'll be

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just like white flight way back in the day. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Today reinstating redlining and saying the poor people won't live next to you and your house price  is going to go up as a result. You're welcome. That's where we are now. Oh Lord. Yeah, it was bad.  It's one of the worst things he's ever done. I'm going to say something cheerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google is putting in a new underwater cable connecting the US to the UK and Spain and they're  going to name it the grace hopper. She's a cable folks. I wouldn't mind having a cable named after  me. The Jeff Jarvis, it'd be a grumpy cable. 16 fiber pairs of 32 fibers. That's a lot of bandwidth.  When you think that every individual fiber can carry the entire telephone traffic of Mother's Day  in the United States. Well, in the old days when it was telephone traffic, that's a really  that's the stat I would use on live with Regis and Kelly. Did you know Regis? One of these fibers  could carry every phone call on Mother's Day. A moment for Regis. Yeah. What a great guy.  Did you get a chance to know him at all, Jeff? I didn't know him well. I knew we knew each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, we recognize each other. After he died, I said I didn't tweet this, but I wanted to  every tweet that I read over the next 24 hours, I wanted to do in the Regis shout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. What's a gigabyte, Leo? What's a gigabyte? I think it's one of the greatest things in my  career. This teaching Regis Philbin had a tweet. Okay. So it's kind of like that, except instead  of going just to one person, when you tweet, it goes to everybody who's following you. You got a  lot of followers. You've got hundreds of thousands of people who watch your Twitter account. So if  you type something on Twitter, all of those people will see it. Who's been talking to these people?  I want to be a part of this. So you're on, this is the webpage, the Twitter webpage. Now,  it looks different now. This is 2011. With a lot of different devices, but you can also do it right  from the computer. So you see there, it says what's happening in that box there. That's where your  tweet goes. Hey, what's happening? Yeah. So now a tweet could be anything. It could be, I just,  you know, had a great interview with Stephen Tong. Even the music reflects an innocent, more innocent,  more upbeat, happier era. The idea is it should be something. The best part was after Regis tweeted,  and by the way, getting him to tweet was painful. He types very, very slowly. It went to me because  I'm following you. Now, if somebody's not following you, they won't see it. But the best part,  and I don't know if we got it as part of the segment, he had that day, I don't know where,  no one knew was going to do it, announced on the show that he was going to retire, which is a big,  big deal. It's back in 2011. And I remember I'd been doing this show for 10 years and the number  one fear everybody had, all the producers, all the staff, the camera operators, the crew,  please don't retire Regis because they thought if Regis retires, the show is over. It's never right.  Right. Regis' show. It was his show he created. So they were terrified. And so that day,  and they're all like Ashen that Regis says, because he didn't warn him, I'm going to retire.  It wasn't going to be for months. And that was his tweet was, today I announced my retirement.  And he starts getting all these tweets back, just tweet after tweet back. Now, this is a guy who's  been on television, he's done 17,000 hours of live television, world record holder.  He, for 50, 60 years, he'd be on live TV. But for some reason, all those tweets coming in,  blew him away, just tickled him. This is the moment I'll never forget. He jumps on the phone  and he calls his wife Joy, says, Joy, Joy, look at the Twitter, they're tweeting at me. He was so  excited that he was tweeting. He was a great guy. I mean, his persona was this irascible kind of  every man who was irritated at life. What's a gigabyte? And some of that was an act,  some of it was genuine, but he was a real sweetie. And I was a real honor to get to work with him

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for many, many years. Somebody I couldn't find him. I looked, I Googled, and I found someone  had quoted in a biography of Regis, my review. And I said he was a game show host with no prizes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's perfect. Brilliant. He didn't need prizes. No, no, he was a real character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was always a lot of fun. So you were talking about cables. Yes. I need you guys to explain  something to me because this story struck me as I need to understand why it's not the utter BS

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it is. What's a quantum internet? Oh, I think this is BS too. And I got a lot of heat

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  for saying that. You're still sending data. What does a quantum computer have to do with it?  Stacey's going to tell me where I'm all wrong and stupid here, but it made no sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The story didn't explain it at all. It was a poorly written story in the Washington Post.  And I think that that was part of the problem was that the person who was writing it,  but the story was about how they were looking for the rundown. I think the federal government  donated, not donated. It's never a donation. The federal government spending $700 million a year  to develop. And this was the headline of the story, a hacker proof quantum internet, a second

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  internet. No, okay. Yeah, this is with quantum computing, I think, and I haven't read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll read it to you, Stacey, so you don't have to. There we go. I'll read you a couple of the things  that boggled my mind and made now look, people, people messaged me as if I had no idea what a

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  qubit was or what quantum computing was. It's how many, how many of them, 40 of them make an

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  R. No, I know what a qubit is. I know what quantum computing is. I'm well aware of that. I know  they've even made quantum computers. It's not that, but it's a quite a leap from these relatively  simple, primitive quantum computers to a second internet that is hacker proof. One of the reasons  this reporter must have gotten this wrong, Jean Whelan writing in the Washington Post, a quantum  internet relies on photons exhibiting a quantum state known as entanglement, which allows them to  share information over long distances without having a physical connection. This made no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're right, Jeff. That doesn't make sense. So there's been research into quantum entanglement  as a method of transmitting information, and they may be talking about that. So that isn't  actually quantum computing. That is, and if you do, if you Google like quantum entanglement,  and I just pulled up the report from the DOE, I'm looking at the blueprint. So what they're talking  about isn't quantum computing, it's information transfer via quantum entanglement. And  that is so nascent. So it's not BS, but it is not like real yet, if that helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's fairly speculative. They also say, and I love this, it'll be hacker proof  because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The networks promise to be more secure. Some say  unhackable because of the nature of photons and other quantum bits known as qubits. Any attempt  to observe or disrupt these particles would automatically alter their state and destroy  the information being transmitted. This is true. This is true, but this is not going to make it a  secure network. It just makes it a very easily disrupted network. So yeah, there's legitimate

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  fears about quantum computing killing encryption. That's legitimate because they're potentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very powerful. Yeah. So much math. No, no, this is an announcement that Governor Pritzker,  J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, the mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot, are at a big announcement in Chicago  because the DOE is going to fund this new second internet, the second unhackable quantum entangled  internet. Of course, the people who are most excited about this are the scientists who are  getting money for it. They quote a professor at the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at  the Argonne National Lab calling the internet project a pillar of the nation's quantum research  program. David Auschlum said, it's the birth of a new technology. It's becoming a global competition.  Every major country on earth has launched a quantum program. We have a quantum gap  because it's becoming clearer and clearer there will be big impacts.  Now, and then I think the reporter just kind of spun up some crazy stuff like eventually computers  might also tap into the quantum internet to buy products with less risk of their credit card

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  details being hacked. That's just trying to make it relatable. That's the dead baby right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what that is? I was about to say there's your dead baby, but I said I would stop saying that.  It's possible consumers will surf seamlessly between the regular and quantum internets as they  make purchases and send information without necessarily knowing whether they're switching

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  platforms. I honestly think this guy is news. Oh, okay. So here's some good articles that are going  to help add context and make this less BSC perhaps. Come back to me. Where's our chat?  Where should I put this? I can't multitask today. There's an article from 2018. Here's the actual

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  paper that the article is referencing that'll help. I got your link from the chat room. That's  good. Yeah, sorry. I'm not great. And you're talking about this is and we actually did this  story when this happened. Google claimed a breakthrough in quantum research. No, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that Google's doing the computing. Oh, this is in transmission. So entanglement is so that's  spooky action at a distance is what they usually call it. Here's essentially I will tell you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  by the way, I know all about this. I read all about this. I'm not ignorant. The notion is that  two particles at a distance can affect each other without any communication in between. That's why  it's spooky. But the idea, the notion of, for instance, a national backbone spanning 3,500 miles  with particles spookily interacting with each other just seems a little far fetched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so I was thinking this the last thing I sent from 2017. And this is I think is the last time  I really paid attention to this was researchers transmitting data to using photons that were  like up to 1200 kilometers apart. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, they can do it. It's like teleportation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But how many bits of data did they send? Just out of curiosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a lot. Not a lot. To make it more useful because they the lifespan of that and they only  stay entangled together for like, not even a second. Like it says, this article says a quarter of a  millisecond. So then you need a lot of repeaters to be like. By the way, those repeaters have not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yet been invented. That was also in the article. So there's kind of a critical piece of technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that doesn't actually exist. But I wouldn't call it BS. I would call the speculative whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Highly speculative. Yeah. But it sounded to me like it was we have an internet. It's like we have a  store, but it has blockchain. Yeah. Right. It just sounded like it was somebody quantum is the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  blockchain for sure. But it's really important research. And the reason the reason this is  important is because we've moved from electrons to light with the internet. Right. So electrons,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah, they do. But it's not the same way. It's not light in the same way that a fiber cable is light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold on. That's where I'm going. So we've got fiber and photons. And then the next stage to get even  faster and do this even better would be quantum. The problem is, and so that's where this research  is going. It's like, Oh, what's the next faster thing? Because is that faster than the speed of  light? It's instantaneous. Yeah, it's like, boom. That's why it's a millisecond. That's beat me up,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scotty. Yeah, speak is spooky. As far as I know, it's instantaneous. You don't have to be physically

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  connected. That's crazy. Because it's spooky. I'm befuddled. That's the spooky. It's okay. All right.  Oh, and you can only do one calculation at a time. There's all sorts of limits to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Skype won't run any better. Yeah, it's a very, of course you should do research on this. No one's  saying you shouldn't. It's a little early to talk about the next internet as a result. But that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  how you try to make it relatable. I mean, as someone like I've written entire articles about  using the spinning of photons in an electron. No, sorry, the spinning of electrons in an atom,  and building like a whole new semiconductor based off of that. And there's actual research happening  around that. But, you know, when I tell someone like that, your eyes are going to glaze over,  you're going to be like, who cares? But if I say it's for the quantum internet, it's the next big  thing. Then you're going to be like, yay. And if you're still glazing over, I'll tell you that you  can buy something on a store securely. And then you'll be like, oh, that's cool. That relates to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my life. I appreciate you doing this explanation. Because none of this stuff makes any sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's also made it relatable. Significantly, it would be significantly faster and higher data

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  density in theory. I don't know if it's higher data density. I think it's faster.  Because you can know two things at the same time in two different places. You can know one thing.  Here it is. You can know one thing in two different places at the exact same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Well, you've just broken the laws of physics. You've gone beyond the speed of light.  But that's why I'm just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did it between the earth and a satellite at 1203 kilometers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why this is neat. That's what quantum entanglement is. It's this weird, spooky stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I guess I should celebrate that the government is planning to spend a billion  dollars a year to develop this. I would guess that the government bureaucrats who signed off on that  signed off with the belief that the Chinese are very close to getting a quantum internet,  so we better have ours rather than this is blue sky scientific research. It's fantastic.  May actually deliver something because it's a lot easier to convince  government bureaucrats to sign off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You sure this isn't an act from David Copperfield?  It sounds hard to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is bullshit research. Read the papers, Jeff. They are real.  This is actual science. It's actual physics. Is it something we can control and deal with today?  No. But is there someone at Google who's paid to think about these things and look at it 100%?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unfortunately, according to the dog, the real problem is the photon loss in the channel,  which scales exponentially with the channel length. So that's why getting any decent distance is  incredibly difficult. You could only obtain 10 to the minus 12, two photon coincidence events per  second. In other words, the bit rate is kind of low. But I don't know. I think it's interesting.  And at least it's not going to be hackable. Somebody is feeding a bunch of hooey,  I think, to that watching the Journal Reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just theoretical physics.  It's not even theoretical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hooey to say it won't be hackable because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. That's hooey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you could just throw it. Well, maybe. I don't know. I don't have that sort of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds like hooey to me. Are you ready? Play the drums. It's time for the Google Change Log.  The Google Change Log.  Karsten says that was Schrodinger's dog barking earlier.  Now we don't know if he's dead or not. We'll never know. She's alive. She's alive. Hallelujah.  Google Messages now let you reply with emoji reactions. Well, it's about time.  Compare this to Apple, which allows you to reply with messages with fireworks, balloons, hearts,  beating hearts, all kinds of things. Now we can send an emoji. You long press the message. You  have to be using messages for Android, the Google app. You long press the message and you can send

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  an emoji. I feel like... So does that mean all my Apple friends, the people on iPhones, will now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  suddenly get written out things? Stacey just put a heart on this. This actually is useful. We use

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this a lot. I use this in my family and I even work a lot. People... We do it on... Whatchamacallit.  What's wrong with my brain? What is that Slack? We do it on Slack where if I send a message to  somebody and they say, okay, instead of responding, okay, they'll put a thumbs up on it and that kind  of thing. It's handy. It's handy, I guess. They're also adding a new feature to Smart Reply,  which automatically suggests emoji stickers in addition to just text. This will only be available  in English. So how you doing? I'm okay. Hang in there. I miss you so much. And it suggests a weeping  cat. I get the weeping cat a lot. I don't know why. There will be a new video call button and  messages.

Transcript:  ever made a Google Duo call? Me. We do. Oh, wow. I actually saw the other night because I'm on an  Android and some person I was talking to was on an Android phone. We activated and I didn't,  I'm sure everybody else knows this, but if you're talking on the phone to someone who's on Duo,  you can actually just swap it seamlessly to a video call. Yeah. Yeah.

Google Store now does price matching. I like that in the US in 23 additional countries. So if you  go to store.google.com to buy a Pixel 4 for instance and you notice there's a better price  at Best Buy or Target or Walmart, you can say, I demand the better price. In fact,  you can even request a credit or refund within 15 calendar days if you find a lower price.

Transcript:  Google launches the matchup initiative for local sports news. Tell me about the matchup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is the newspaper industry after 30 years finally deciding they might be able to do something  together. So because the athletic has stolen all of their best writers and competes with them,  now they're going to do basically a shared content and shared subscription model across  their sports sections. That's a great idea. Finally, so Google is not actually doing it.  Google gave the money. A good friend of mine, the local media consortium is the industry  organization doing it and a friend of mine at Temple University, Aaron Pilhover, is the guy who  put it together and then another friend of mine named Dave Gehring who runs the distributed media  lab is doing it with AMP. This is part of what AMP was meant to do was to be able to seamlessly  share content in the same content in multiple places and make it work. So it's an effort to  create more money for the newspaper industry. Now I lived through a torture in my industry  many years ago called the New Century Network very early on before there was a web. Kids,  well, was it? No, I think it was after the web. Just after the web. Yes, it was. We were going  to come up with this consortium, the top 12 newspaper companies, most of whom were already  to die now, came up with a company called the New Century Network where they're going to share  content, they're going to share advertising, they're going to have one sign in, they're going to do  all kinds of beautiful things and they couldn't get along, they couldn't agree and so it died.  So they're trying again, a guy named Mike Orrin at the Dallas Morning News helped spearhead this  and let's hope it works and if it does then maybe it is a solution to bringing together multiple  media properties to be able to compete with their new kids on the block like the athletic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the way it would work, you'd be reading the Dallas Morning News about the Cowboys-Eagles  game and you'd be able to see the Eagles, the Philly newspapers reporting on the same game.  It will be part of existing sports pages on member sites and they're going to have a matchup site

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  in early 2021 as well. The matchup is not intended to make any money, it's intended to benefit  the newspapers which may be what dooms it. Do newspapers trust Google to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because Google gives money. Google's not running it. Oh that's right, it's the local media consortium.  And you'll like this Stacey, YouTube Kids is launching the Summer of Movies, 100 kid-friendly  movies and specials on YouTube Kids which your daughter refuses to watch.
