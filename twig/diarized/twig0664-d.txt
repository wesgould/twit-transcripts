Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Everyone.  I know I have a way he's taken.  Ladies.  He's taken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the Leonard Tao professor for journalistic innovation.  Ladies and gentlemen from the Craig Craig.  Graduate School of Journalism at the City University in Arc Jeff Jarvis and Stacy  has the week off but just Jeff has brought us somebody I'm very excited to  meet Shoshana Weissman is here.  She is from our Street.  She's a digital media and head of digital media and a fellow at the R Street  think tank political think tank.  She's also Senator Shoshana from East Virginia.  It's so great to have you.  I hope your primary bid goes well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was actually fine yesterday.  Will Shana Seisman lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh good.  I hated her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have a lot to talk about but I guess I'm going to have to break our covenant  not to talk.  We don't talk about Elon.  We're not.  We're going to have to talk about Elon because the plot thickens.  So Elon who is the skull.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So does the tongue Elon agreed to buy Twitter for $54.20 without doing any  due diligence.  That was literally part of the agreement.  Okay, no problem.  No due diligence.  Then apparently somebody supposed to do due diligence normally does when you  bid $44 billion for something.  You think the people whose money or even if it's not your money on that.  Yeah, but that but he got I think he's getting cold feet, which I wouldn't  blame him.  He suddenly noticed that Twitter has a lot of bots on it.  A lot of spam bots on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he said well I had no we had no idea this going to put this on hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now the latest is Twitter saying we're going to hold you to it.  You sign on the bottom line.  This house is yours.  This will be a very interesting thing.  I think the market is feeling like it's not going to happen.  You know, we talk about the wisdom of the crowds and we ask our pundits

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  feeling like nothing good is going to happen right now.  Right now.  My F you money just said F you again.  Oh Lord.  Did it.  Oh, don't even get started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's right.  A lot of us will be putting retirement off again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can't get rid of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, we're Twitter's down now to thirty six dollars and eighty five cents.  Elon offered fifty four twenty.  That tells you the market has you know, does has no faith that it's going to  happen.  Otherwise it would be closer to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right fifty four twenty Mike Mazinik had a nice parlor game wondering that  if Elon leaves and the pratties managed to bring the stock way down who might  come in his thought was Microsoft nobody that's nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, so if this doesn't go through isn't he on the hook for a billion dollars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Twitter said he's not even looking for the cancellation fee.  Twitter wants him to they said no, no, you agreed.  You said there would be no due diligence.  You have no out on this.  Twitter might have an out because Elon is apparently broken their NDA and  he's disparaged them.  He said it.  This is very mature.  I have to say he did something that even Donald Trump never did on Twitter.  He sent the CEO of Twitter a poop emoji.  Oh, even Trump never sank that low.  Wow.  I don't think I think Mazinik's nuts.  I don't think anybody wants Twitter.  Twitter has been for sale for years.  This has never been a moneymaker.  I don't think anybody wants Twitter and he is definitely money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, given who the chairman is maybe Benny off.  He wants to clean up the Internet.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shoshana.  It's great to have you welcome.  And she's coming to us.  You want to buy Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was gonna but I decided to buy something else instead because I definitely have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  amount of money just not not for Twitter because of maybe people don't know but you are married.  Is it to SpongeBob himself?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So many people don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The residuals man are killer.  I mean, does is there official our street position on Elon Musk at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we just kind of think everyone's flipping out and we're staying out of it a little like  we're kind of like, yeah, like it could work out fine.  It might not.  I don't know.  But what I will say is as someone who watches cartoons a lot this reminds me a lot of yeah,  yeah of the King of the Hill episode where Hank doesn't want to sell his house.  So he ruins it strategically and the home inspector comes and like realizes what he's  doing and I kind of like wonder if Twitter's like, oh man, look at all these bots.  It's yours now and then like to dissuade him and like I mean someone made a comment that  like the producers is kind of like the more apt comparison, but it's more to me that King  of the Hill episode like that very like you nailed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know ruining the house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although it's not exactly the same because he doesn't own it yet.  But it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean like Twitter saying there's more bots than there are.  Oh, Twitter doesn't want to.  It's like yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter did though.  Agrawal did tell shareholders we want you to take this deal and we're going to hold  on to it.  So I who knows who who knows what the motives are.  This is crazy.  I do have a question though for you since you cover government.  Why hasn't the SEC done something about Elon?  He's just he's I think one of the things he's getting away with at this point is just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  completely flouting all the rules.  I mean is this you see pretty much like a figurehead or just no, I mean they just sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of say find him 20 million 40 if you include the Tesla fine, but did they get 20 or 40

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  million dollars did they get it out of his pockets or yeah, but he wants it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you know the judge said no you can't have my here Elon Musk in the SEC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thinking how this is just another nothing burger.  Nothing's going to happen.  You know, they say they're investigating him again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the SEC a toothless tiger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I haven't really touched the SEC before I don't do financial regulation because personally  I'm more of a comedy Jew than a finance do.  So like finance often goes way over my head, but but financial regulation is kind of its  own beast.  But yeah, like I know I know people want the government to go after him and if there's  financial issues sure but with the antitrust stuff that's something I get less where they're  like, oh he can't he can't buy Twitter because that's too much like to have this all these  companies and Twitter and I'm like Twitter is a lot smaller than like it's not like he's  buying Google that would be I think maybe a different conversation Twitter's you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter's revenue is roughly equivalent to that of the Olive Garden litter.  I'm not making that up.  Yeah, and no free bread.  No breadstick.  So it's not you're right.  And what does it have to do with cars and space and boring holes under Las Vegas?  Nothing.  So I don't think there's any regulatory issue.  I guess it has to be approved as any merger of that size has to be but I don't a merger.  It's a purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there an SEC right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Technically a merger.  I think that's what Twitter is calling it is a merger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How merger with what a merger with Twitter and the Elan's money.  That's what I don't know.  Well, whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who emoji.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's a purchase obviously, but don't we still have another at least five months  of these shenanigans to deal with and listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said it'll take about six months.  So depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what the longer this goes on the less likely people are to change section 230  flash more in the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm like, all right, actually that is part of this isn't it?  Because Elon has said and we've talked a lot about it over the last six weeks.  It feels like that he wants quote free speech, but no spam.  He doesn't and section 230 says that you can moderate all you want.  But he says well, they should never have kicked Donald Trump off.  They shouldn't moderate sounds like he wants a moderation free zone after what happened  in Buffalo this week egged on considerably by 4chan.  I think you could see the end game of no moderation.  That's not what we want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but also like Elon doesn't seem to know what he wants for moderation like at all just  all together because he was praising the EU standard and he was saying yeah, we need to  get rid of all this speech but not the speech but also First Amendment standard.  He also had this strange conception that like whatever speech a government allows is free  speech and I'm like,  You know how that works in certain countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what that means.  It seemed like the whole EU praising was just a way to get them to shut up and get off his  back though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's not what that was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seems like it because he's going to figure him out to do, you know, it's like, all right,  y'all let me pacify you for a minute so y'all could stop talking about me.  Right.  Meanwhile, I'm going to go over here and just continue to ruin the social platforms.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and also spam free speech like I don't I don't know how he's going to, you know,  buy the free speech standard and he's going to say like, I mean, I'm not sure if you all  have gotten this but for years my DMs were full of hello my dear and it was like romance  scams.  I messed with them and it was very fun and I kind of miss you actually met with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You went and mess with them.  Oh, mess with them.  I think you said you met with them.  I thought that's brave.  You went to Nigeria for that or wow.  Yeah, I get a lot of I get those too, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you should reply to them.  It's really fun.  I've gotten some very very angry but when you play with them, yeah, but one was telling  me to download an app and I'm like, all right, I'll I'll do this.  But first tell me what's an app.  So like Google this and I'm like, what's cool.  And then we keep going and eventually and I'm like, so it's inside my phone.  Should I crack my phone open with a hammer?  And they're like good question.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they want somebody dumb.  So they at first they probably loved it and then they started to realize you're playing  them something evil.  So the Texas social media law, which I think we all agree is insane.  But of course it is probably going to be the law.  The Fifth Circuit has blocked the blockage.  What he has lifted the injunction.  Now a couple of tech industry groups NetChoice and the CCIA have filed an emergency  application with the Supreme Court asking to stay the lift of the injunction, which  in other words to keep the law from going into effect.  Last week we were talking about this.  I can't remember if it was Mike Masnick who said that unfortunately the Fifth  Circuit's guy on the Supreme Court, the guy who would rule on this in the shadow  docket is none other than the wonderful Justice Alito.  So I'm not sure an appeal to the Supreme Court for an emergency injunction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is it in the legislation itself, I forget who was said  this week, might be Masnick because Masnick says all things is that within the  within the law itself, it negates itself because federal law supersedes it and  Section 230 supersedes it.  So it's the law that isn't that isn't it's an NFT of laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  NetChoice and CCIA say Texas, the Texas law is unconstitutional, which it  obviously is because it essentially amounts to the government compelling a  private business to carry speech they otherwise would remove.  The First Amendment prohibits Texas, they say, from forcing online platforms  to host and promote foreign propaganda, pro-Nazi speech and spam.  Left standing HB 20, the Texas law will turn the First Amendment on its head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one way to put it.  I think it might be doing something worse, probably harmed the First Amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I almost hate people saying, but what about Texas Section 230?  Because I feel like don't mention, we don't talk about Section 230.  Don't bring it up because that just gives people more ammunition to go after.  Or fight on it.  Right.  Yeah.  True.  Shoshanna, what is the chance that the Supreme Court will strike down HB 20?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Like on a larger panel, um, stuff Gorsuch has said, like Gorsuch  understands, I'm a big Gorsuch fan usually.  Um, we agree on a lot.  He likes licensing reform.  He's like alluded to it.  So I'm like, we're vibing here, you and me, Gorsuch.  Um, he also likes unenumerated rights, which I'm very excited about.  And I think the look at this and know what this is dumb.  Kavanaugh's had opinions in the past where like he recognizes how Section 230  works and he also understands like the dynamic of this stuff.  I don't know.  Um, the other justices, um, Judge, um, Jackson was talking about, uh, in her  confirmation hearing, she was at about 230 and she seemed to have a pretty good  grasp on how everything works around here.  It's still hard to say how they'll apply it to a state law, but I mean, a lot of  the standards around the stuff are going to be strict scrutiny and like, I'm not  a huge fan of the rational basis test, especially when applied to unenumerated  rights.  So like I extra appreciate strict scrutiny because it's like the, the  Supreme court doing its job to review government actions and it's first  amendment.  So I think it'll be okay.  But like, you never know.  I mean, the Supreme court gives us horrible surprises now and then.  So I'm like, I hope, but I mean, uh, the one thing that I'm sure of is that I  think it's a really good use of government money to, uh, to spend throwing  this through court, defending it.  Um, just the whole process.  This was really, really worth taxpayer dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it would be up to Alito whether the court would take the case on, uh, he has  the right at this point to unilaterally say, uh, no, uh, we're going to let the  fifth circuit's decision stand.  And that would be that until the case comes to, uh, court.  Do you think, is it what you didn't mention Alito?  Is he pro 230?  Does he?  Good question.  I'm sure he's an enumerated rights guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's not with me on an enumerated rights.  And I don't even just mean like the, the abortion case.  I think there's a real deeper theory there that, that people tend to ignore  and only see abortion.  Well, for me, it's the right to earn a living.  That's an unenumerated right.  That's been giving more protection.  There's all kinds there, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  filibuster is an unenumerated right too.  Let's get rid of that.  Um, I'm sorry.  First amendment.  Is that count as an enumerated right?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, enumerated, not unenumerated, but section 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unenumerated merely means it's, it's mentioned specifically in the  constitution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  They wrote it down.  And the ninth amendment says just cause we didn't write it down.  Doesn't mean don't like the fact that they get the same protection.  And then you had judges for like decades being like, I'm going to ignore  that now and just kind of do what I want.  Um, so I'm big on, on like unenumerated rights theory that it deserves  the same protection, but like we're talking about fundamental rights with  this case, like the, you know, free speech, which I think it's the, you  know, I don't think it should be treated differently than unenumerated  rights, but it is.  So it's harder for the court to mess it up.  It doesn't mean they won't, but it's definitely like less likely that, that  you're going to look at their decision and stress out, but you know, for,  um, it still depends if Alito is going to do something beforehand.  I haven't read him on tech law.  I know him on certain areas, but not this.  So I'm just hoping he won't disappoint us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it'll be very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a way, somebody in the chat room is saying there's something wrong with me.  I want to watch the world burn in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel the same way.  I kind of, I kind of want to say, make it a law.  Let's see what happens.  Be very interesting to see what happens.  What would the consequences of, uh, of, uh, the HB 20 be?  Would Twitter can't say we're not going to operate in Texas.  Yeah, they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They can find some way.  Can they?  Yeah.  I mean, is it going to be imperfect?  It's going to be IP and somebody will get around it.  It's aha.  I'm in Texas and I got you Twitter.  But it's kind of, but yeah, they can, they can.  I mean, Facebook pulled its news from Australia.  You know, Texas is a state.  Spain.  It's not a country.  Yeah.  But it'd be really interesting then is, uh, you know, uh, it becomes a  warning shot to companies, but God knows with this Twitter administration  and this board, who knows what's happened?  You know, it's going to move them to Texas.  So God knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it may be more to the point.  Facebook would also have to get out of Texas.  Wouldn't it?  Facebook's is big that big or maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But how do they do that with the law saying they can't stop operating  there just because of the law?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the law specifically says you have to continue to operate in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like functionally, maybe there's a way around it, but I'm not, I'm  not sure how they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's crazy.  You could make people coming in from Texas, uh, uh, indemnify you by  saying that you won't do anything.  And then if they don't do it, then you put up a brain here, but you can't  get in unless you have a lawyer give you a blood signed oath, you know, that  kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how do you feel about cookies?  And would you sign this blood oath?  It's perfect.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a lot of blood though.  I mean, like then you have to get the, uh, you have to get health  authorities involved.  I'm just, that's extra layers that I'm not sure they'd be willing to take on for that.  They might just stop moderating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's what I'm wondering is maybe they would just say, okay, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Texas gets to give us your, give us your first born now that you're  required by law to have it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh geez.  Okay.  Too soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But first born too, then you have to get other agencies involved.  Like it seems like you're getting more regulatory complexity and I don't  think it makes anything easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the world we live in.  No wonder you live in a half fantasy world, Shoshana.  It's called Washington.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now don't tell her it's a fantasy.  I think she believes it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Bob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We call them smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I live here with my husband and I go out West a lot.  Um, but I'm not sure what you mean by fantasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, Mike actually has an interesting piece in Monday's tech dirt, uh, that  Twitch could have actually violated the Texas social media law by pulling down  the live stream of the Buffalo murder spree because that's moderating.  Uh, that gives you some reason to pause.  Um, it's just also stupid.  It's, it's, it's such a bad law that you almost want to see what would  happen if they tried to enforce it.  I just, I, sometimes I think people make these laws much like the  social media law in Florida.  And of course the Florida says you can't protest in front of  justice's homes, even though there are no justice.  I feel like they make these laws.  Oh, to get media.  It's a political statement.  It's rolling.  It's trolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's too nice to them.  It's trolling.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't think of a better use of legislative time than trolling though.  Like I'm not sure what else it would make sense to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What would you do if you didn't troll?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So governor Ducey has been doing like, you know, like letting people  from other states work in Arizona and he's done.  He had a law that actually got me interested in him years ago saying  that state and local governments could not use government money to  pay lobbyists that they hire to lobby government itself.  Cause that's silly and duplicative.  But really instead of doing that, I wonder what he could have done and  what he could have accomplished if he just tried to troll a little  bit harder, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we want 10% of the money that we pay to the lobbyist to lobby us.  We want 10%.  Actually you could really, you could really make some money on that.  I believe I think that's a violation of quantum mechanics, but I, I  think you can make money on that.  Charging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can you have Michio Kaku?  Like, can you check it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Strain theory would be very, very helpful in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Question about this whole with the Buffalo shooting and the way the  government went after Twitch.  How fast are we expecting the moderation to be able to jump into  the live stream and kill it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, well, the thing that's interesting about the Twitch is I  think only, I think I saw the number 40 people saw that.  I saw it there.  There.  But as soon as it was pulled down, it was reproduced everywhere and  millions, 40 million people, something like that, saw it subsequently.  There's that Streisand effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But it's so, but people are yelling at the social media platforms as  if it was Twitch's fault.  It's not Twitch's fault.  You know, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not Twitch's fault.  And one thing that gets me too is that like obviously platforms don't  want the stuff on them.  Sometimes they don't act fast enough, but I never understand politicians  who genuinely think that their business model is to have like the  worst stuff like this and monetize it because that's, it's functionally  not how it works.  Like it doesn't benefit them to have it on the platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just grandstanding because it's primary season.  More trolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pain.  It's just pain for me.  I'm always in pain from this.  Like politicians just not knowing how the internet works.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I've, speaking of, speaking of, of, of the video though, I  think it was, I put a story in there that I found really interesting.  This is from garbage day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  Email.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't always blame algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, so here's the Tim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cane did a tweet saying nevermind Fox News.  Nevermind Tucker Carlson.  Nevermind whatever.  Actually everybody's finally talking about Tim Cain.  Finally, wake someone says big tech, go to big tech and algorithms.  And, and then this is why what used to be known as a blogger is now  known as a newsletter, uh, rights.  Um, I'm forgetting his name suddenly, um, that, you know, it all came  from 4chan 4chan.  The point of 4chan is that it's ephemeral.  There's no, there's no amplification.  There's no algorithm involved at all.  And so this idea that let's, let's get rid of all the algorithms.  Cause that's what's corrupting society.  Sorry guys.  Not in this case.

Transcript:  It's really frustrating though.  Um, but especially because like you're saying, like the bad stuff comes on  other forms that have, has nothing to do with algorithms and algorithms just  go for what people want anyway.  Sure.  Try to mitigate the harms, but like, I mean, I am still kind of floored that  I remember the video game, moral panic when I was a kid, I remember that.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm willing to try just out of experimental purposes.  Okay.  Yeah.  Live dangerously they are.  I'm just going to take it.  I'm, I'm, I'm a chance.  I'm a chance risk taker.  I, um, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boy, let's see.  Books can kill you too says Burke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Books can kill.  We know that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Books don't kill people.  People do people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ideas are what kill people.  And the, and yeah, yeah, I don't, I don't think big tech is the problem.  Tim came.  Sorry.  It's hard for me to think that that's the issue.  Um, I'm trying to get through.  I don't know.  I'm going on and on through Elon Musk stuff.

Transcript:  Love the, uh, Palm tree earrings too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Those are fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes.  Swim.  First of all, why is there still a sports illustrated swimsuit issue?  And I guess they're trying to paper over the, the, the flaw in the  concept by putting a variety of other women that you wouldn't normally put.  I mean, it's just hopeless.  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now owned by now owned by another content factory.  Like all the other time magazines are now owned by a dot dash.  Um, did you, I don't know if you saw this story this week.  It's a big story this week.  The latest report is that people magazine not long ago, the most  profitable magazine on earth may fold its print edition, just like he deputed.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People, people, people read people.  What are you going to look at when you're at the grocery store and  exactly people read people, at least it reads people, but she's, you know,  more and more, she's reading it digitally in Apple news.  So maybe that's her fault.  That's the thing.  But people wouldn't go away.  They would just be digital only.  There'd be no news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's, that's the, that's the, that's the, that's the new death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With regards to that sports illustrated swimsuit shout out to hands on  photography episode number 95, Ms.  Loretta Houston.  She was one of the photographers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, Netflix hit by 150 layoffs.  That it feels like Netflix is panicking.  Lose a couple hundred thousand subscribers and now it's all over and time to  fire people.  Now they're 11,000 employees, but it feels like they're panicking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But their whole model, they, they spent millions on, on entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think they're trying to, to position themselves to be able to pay all of those  millions of people, not millions of people.  Thousands.  Those thousands of people that they gave huge contracts, you know, for the movies.  Yes.  Yeah.  All of that content.  They, they didn't just throw a cheap number up there.  Like Shonda Rhimes.  I want to say she got almost 50 million bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they already paid them though.  Right.  I mean, she's not waiting for the check still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I'm saying it's this, they made a big investment in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I think they spent as I remember, $13 billion last year on content.  Uh, I mean, a lot of that growth was fueled by the pandemic.  Pandemic's over.  People are going outside.  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  People are going outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whether we have monkeypox now monkeypox is in, is in, is in Massachusetts, by the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  way, is monkeypox related to COVID or something completely different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's something, a whole new thing to worry about.  Whole new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh boy.  All right.  Now I'm going to look this up because I don't want you to spread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which monkeys in Massachusetts started it?  We know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it was released by the monkeys intentionally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, it's a small.  Massachusetts confirms case of monkeypox.  I tweeted one of the doctors I trust on the topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is it from ABC news.  I don't want to show you the picture.  It's disgusting.  A Massachusetts resident has tested positive for monkeypox.  The first case of the rare virus in the United States this year, shades of  February 2020 when we were saying, oh yes, there's a new flu in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it transmitted?  Angela Raspassin who's Angie underscore Raspassin, who's one of the experts I  trust from my COVID list.  It's transmitted by aerosol and direct contact.  It's not easily transmissible person to person requires close physical proximity.  And you might want to move away and move away a little bit.  I think he's risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The patient is an adult male who recently traveled to Canada.  There's your problem.  Right.  Canada used to be okay.  And that has been the department of public health says the case  poses no risk to the public.  The individual is hospitalized and in good condition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh boy.  Don't worry.  Good old panic, huh?  Monkey.  You hit the moral, hit the moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by the appropriately enough.  Monkeypox virus.  Uh, yeah, I didn't mean to get us off.  I think we don't have to worry about monkeypox.  So we still got to worry about COVID.  It's not overly old, but from the point of view of Netflix, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, anyway, Netflix, they see the writing on the wall with all of those  subscriptions dropping and not are talking about different ways to pivot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did say they did.  They did say in their quarterly results that they anticipate millions of  subscribers lost in the next quarter.  So they do see a, you know, an avalanche coming, but I think they, they, they had  this is what we're seeing now in general in the tech industry.  There were steep growths over the last two years.  Tech industry garnered trillions of dollars in windfall profits from  COVID and now it's over.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so the next move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, with monkeypox, I think there's some hope that monkey could start  using the internet more like we were over the past few years.  So I think the solution here is for tech companies to send phones to monkeys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netflix should not ignore the vast and growing monkey population.  You're absolutely right.  Shoshana.  It's a real opportunity here.  See, that's what I call taking lemons and making lemonade.  There you go.  Yeah.  Brilliant.  There's always a bright side to everything, including monkeypox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the rights of monkeys are not enumerated in the constitution.  Ergo, they have unenumerated freedom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unenumerated monkeypox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It happens.  So Netflix with ads, good idea, bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks for getting us back here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you going to do?  I think the idea for Netflix is we want to make a lower cost subscription  available to people who don't want to pay, what is it now?  $14, $15.  And I, that's, that's gotta be one of the reasons the subscribers are dropping.  Right?  If we have an $8 one, like Hulu does, we have a five or an $8 plan  and you're going to have to watch ads.  I think that they're hoping that will, that will work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plus their programming was all at all depressing.  It was all dark.  It was really dark.  I could never find anything like cheery in the midst of a pandemic.  A lot of the content was dark during 2020.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Meanwhile, Hulu is where you can find King of the Hill.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have been, Shoshana admitted, watching a lot more Hulu lately.  So maybe that's it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Bob's Burgers too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like Bob's Burgers.  Think about it, Netflix is.  She's, she's good.  She's good.  I told you, she's good.  Netflix.  Yes.  The most amazing pivot in the history, the most, you know, modern history of media,  right?  One other company shifted from mailing you red envelopes to becoming fully digital and  gigantic and what it, and just used to just ship stuff and then made stuff.  It was a phenomenal pivot.  They were laughed at.  Kat has only so many lives, you know?  Maybe.  You pivot again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe.  Yeah.  And what do you pivot to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To, that's the thing.  They're not pivoted.  I think this is Anne's point.  Yeah.  Was it your, they're not pivoting to anything right now except panic.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a panic pivot.  And just trying to figure out what to do next.  Yeah.  Not easy actually.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not sure what I do.  It's very expensive to create original programming.  Honestly, I think Hulu needs to improve their app.  I think that by itself, discovery is terrible.  The worst app on television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hulu is bad too actually.  Come to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, they won't let me record brief clips to make GIFs and like I'm, I'm just offended by that.  Yeah.  I don't, they used to let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's very short-sighted.  I go to a museum and occasionally go to an older museum and say no pictures.  No Instagramming.  The hip modern ones go Instagram.  Here's an Instagrammable.  Please do it.  It's promoting us.  You know.  Why wouldn't you allow people to make clips to promote it?  Maybe their contracts with the creators are limited, but they should redo those then.  Oh, foggy.  So they used to let you do King of the Hill clips and you can't do that anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, just through a screen recorder.  Now they block that.  And all I'm asking is just for like 30 seconds.  Like I'm not like I'm not doing the whole thing, but 30 seconds and throw on a Hulu logo.  You know, that's that's just good branding because my gifts.  I actually my gifts get very good traction on Giphy.  So they're they're wasting a branding opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you wait a minute now?  Are you wait?  Yeah, now we got to go.  I'm done.  I would take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was about to ask a question about this is the this is the new the Giphy cottage industry.  I think this is very exciting.  I'd like to know.  Do you have a favorite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have a best Giphy?  A gift you've ever made?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's just a lot of really good ones lately.  I've been a fan of Homer Simpson when a when he's sleeping in a hammock and a and a  caterpillar crawls into his mouth and he coughs out a butterfly like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really, you know, does Giphy allow you to like do you have an oh, yeah, you do.  Yeah, you have an account.  You're an account on Giphy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yeah, for gifts, mainly ones that like people people don't like it's not easily  Googleable or it's one that I've created and I have trouble finding.  They have millions of views and I'm just like, all right.  I mean, I needed this.  So maybe you need this gift too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you can't monetize your Giphy views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't really monetize stuff that much.  I'm a capitalist, but like I'm really bad at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My favorite kind, by the way.  Let's talk.  I think we should have more really bad.  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I'm working with the Sloth Institute and one of my projects that I've wanted to do  with them is to get their cute videos of sloths and make gifts and always have their  logo on it.  So then people can go back and then be like, oh, I should donate to the Sloth Institute.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Like like sloths like like the animals sloths and trees.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this a is this a political act?  Is this on K Street?  Is it a political action?  No, this is another thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they're based in Costa Rica and I always thought it would be really freaking funny  if I got to be an associate fellow at the Sloth Institute and I kept tweeting them  like, hey, like what if I was an associate fellow with you?  So I am and I actually do government research for them.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are you still, you know, let's put that in your lower third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  Look at them.  Look how cute they are.  I love sloths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They actually do incredible work.  I just saw a great video of a sloth.  Sloth being being reunited with its baby.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I was I just saw that it was so cute.  The sloth hug.  Yeah, how was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's really sad is they always look like they're smiling.  I mean, that's why I love them because they're just always smiling at you.  But even when they're in pain, they're smiling.  It's really sad, but they do amazing work to stop sloth electrocutions.  They hang from stuff.  The wires there aren't well insulated.  So they're actually working on stopping it and lots of sloths die that way.  They rehabilitate.  And my first meeting with them, they were, you know, setting up and they're like,  well, we're getting this ready.  We'll just put the camera in front of this baby sloth.  So I'm just sitting for a couple of minutes talking to them, watching a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'd be so happy.  That would be I would just say, can I call you tomorrow?  I'd like to we'd like to do more of this.  Oh, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought when you said the sloth, there's sloth merch.  OK, come on, Leo, you got to buy some sloth merch.  All right.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's get a mug.  This is worse on this show.  I've spent many, many dollars on bad sloth stuff.  Oh, sloth mug would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tell me about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't believe what I'm seeing.  Oh, I love sloths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, though, they're making a mistake because honestly,  cartoon sloths are less cute than the real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I want a real sloth.  Yeah, well, maybe they have rights problems, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I see they're all into veganism.  People don't eat sloths, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm also actually a vegetarian.  I'm a kosher vegetarian and my diet sucks because my body's falling apart.  I have like lots of autoimmune diseases.  So like I can't eat like anything.  It's fine.  Like it's fine.  But like it sucks to be a kosher vegetarian who can't have chickpeas  or cauliflower.  Like that's not super fun.  But yeah, it sucks.  But as far as I know, people don't eat sloths.  Yeah, thankfully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chickpeas?  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't have hummus?  They make me really sick.  Yeah, I figured out one day that it was making me super sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's terrible.  That really...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, hummus is just a beautiful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.  I every now and then I'm like maybe I can have it now.  And then I'm like, oh my gosh, I cannot have chickpeas now.  It's really bad.  It's good.  It's good.  I'm just falling apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Next October, we have to do a thing on October 20th.  It's International Sloth Day.  All right.  And maybe we could do something to celebrate.  Mrs. Jerry put it on the company calendar.  Put that on the calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just want it on the record here that as someone who takes this show down rabbit holes,  Shoshana has beat my record already.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tends the way into the show.  They actually celebrate International Sloth Day with Slothtoberfest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So a couple of years ago, I was giving a talk with Governor Ducey at ALEC  and it was us two at a dinner on the main stage and I ended it letting him know that  Texas is the Texas is beating Arizona.  That Texas is the only state in the country that has a three-toed sloth.  And I asked him what he was going to do to get more three-toed sloths to Arizona.  So if you think I take you guys down rabbit holes, just know that like that's what I do for a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the big sloth deficit is something I think all Arizonans are concerned about.  Yeah, that's a serious issue.  Let me let's take a little break.  Unbelievable.  As if we haven't.  Shoshana Weissman is with us.  She's great.  Not only a policy head at the Sloth Institute,  she's also head of digital media at RSI, a fellow there and Senator Shoshana from East Virginia on the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, breaking, breaking disinformation, hot news.  Yes.  So Charlie Warts, so let's put it in the rundown at 155.  Okay.  Says that Costco, did it disappear?  Did he already take it down?  Hot dot crash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, he killed it.  He pulled it down.  He didn't like it.  What did he tweet?  Tweets, you know, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Costco's, Costco's stock crashed 13% with a meme account that tweeted  a fake headline that Costco was raising the price of its hot dogs due to inflation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's one of the few things that has not changed in years.  The buck 50.  You got to wonder what it's made of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cause if you can't, if you don't raise the price, it's like the Costco, you know what?  Here's a secret.  And I know you don't trust me because of the catch you a pepe and screw you  for that, but the Costco chicken, the road to restriction, $5.  Registry chicken is incredible.  Yeah.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, so the stocks are tumbling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The hot dog was, was the cause of this?  The hot dog.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The belief that it was going to go fake rise in price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Fake.  Right.  It's a price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I will say it's not the first time that like a hot dog has been a big  indicator of like the direction of a company.  I'm a big fan of the Snapchat hot dog because that was kind of like  their plan to monetize.  They just, they're like, here's a dancing hot dog.  And I kind of feel that this is very much the same thing where it's like  hot dog, you know, company crash.  Like it just makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, here's the, uh, Charlie just wanted to update his tweet.  The Charlie Wurzel tweet is here.  Uh, oh, actually he's tweeting.  Uh, something debunking, but, but look at, let me just show you that.  Let me show you the stock.  It is, it has gone down 57 bucks in the past five days.  But is that because of this or is it because of the hot dog?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it's the hot dog.  I really think it's the hot dog.  Like, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Well, that would, you know, that would, uh, that certainly would cause  people to be concerned by the way, the chairman's performing.  They, they are Hebrew national hot dogs.  They're very good.  Oh, those are good.  They're good hot dogs.  They're not just a old hot dogs.  I guess it's a loss.  Finance, you know, I think it's a loss leader for them, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Sorry.  Step away from the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got to, I've got to maintain my title here from Shoshana for,  for rabbit holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'll never win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think he's trying too hard.  Can't you see what you're doing to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  We can go, we can go to Google's new headquarters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like to go off about like how about which of us is going to go  down the most rabbit holes.  Like it's is Google gonna judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google will judge because we never actually talk about it.  On a show named this week in Google.  Try to get us back to Google.  Here's the new giant tent.  That is the Google headquarters.  It's got a slide in the middle, but from like nowhere to nowhere.  Yeah.  It looks like like maybe they're pushing edges down the slide or  so that's like it's a bush slide.  What is it?  Clear story windows allow light on the desks automated window  shades that open and close.  They have to because the sun I'm sure Google officially opens  yesterday.  There Bayview campus in Mountain View, California 1.1 million  square feet.  Wow.  For building for buildings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the size.  That's the size of a of an Amazon warehouse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, they always say that if you're on the cover of Sports  Illustrated, that's going to be that's the curse.  That's the end of your career, right?  And I think it's always been it's often been said that big  corporations that build overly fancy company headquarters.  It's usually their last act.  Yeah, but I think that this is not the case.  Apple just built that billion-dollar Spaceship campus and people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  aren't going there to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  It's cursed.  Google says it's going to invest nine and a half billion dollars  in offices and data centers this year.  Data centers make sense.  Yeah.  This is Google's commitment.  They say according to Fortune to physical office space.  There's the front lobby, which is singularly ugly.  If you ask me.  It's a it is brutalist the right word.  It looks like concrete, but then there's balloons and it's very ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Birthday concrete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, birthday concrete.  That's it.  And then why why are there why are there plants?  I was going to say there's plants at the top.  It looks like they it looks like the end of times and the concrete  has been you know, the plants have taken over or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can see you can sit there and be watered or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  This is what they call a dragon scale solar system.  That's all solar panels at school.  Ninety thousand silver solar panels generating 40% of their annual  electricity for the campus.  Wow.  This is such a hodgepodge of of this styles and there's like there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and there's a huge like camel in the background there.  Yeah, camel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Artwork from local artists to pick scenes of Bay Area ecology.  Red trees.  Yeah, I don't think we have those the ventilation system.  Oh, here's something interesting uses a hundred percent air outside  outside outside air.  So yeah, it really isn't ventilating if you take it just from the  inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's good to have better for COVID which is still among us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just stop with that monkey box thing Bayview is a hundred percent  electric an effort to decrease carbon emissions as opposed to  what natural gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they also have a hole.  They don't have what you would call it heat pumps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in addition to collaborative and community areas the campus  includes phone rooms and other private spaces.  Oh, this is that thing that we were talking about with privacy  thing comes in.  Oh look, there's a massage chair kind of peering out from behind

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels really like dirty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels thrown together to be honest with you.  I'm sorry, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've been building this forever.  They've been building this for four IOs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what was wrong with the current plexus is growing small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah growing the 11th they didn't build that that plex room for  11,000 new employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who are not coming to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but as I'm saying, what's the point of following through if  well, I guess they didn't know because this is not like they  started building this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although it's been literally for IOs again.  I was there watching the construction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember seeing the dirty lot couple of years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ad Tech's biggest data breach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't even...  I'm so sick of data breaches.  Did you know about this one?  All data is going to get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's just know it.  This is the Irish Council for Civil Liberties talking about this  real-time bidding system.  When you hear this actually this is kind of stunning.  RTB is the biggest data breach ever recorded at tracks and  but not by hackers.  This is intentional tracks and shares of people view online  and their real-world location.  294 billion times a day in the US 197 billion times a day in  Europe.  The most so get ready.  Okay.  This is an estimate again from the ICCL per person per day  across the US and by the way, if you live in Colorado, you're  the worst worst off of this.  If you live in Colorado 987 RTB broadcasts a day per person.  That means your location data is particularly so RTB exposes  people's data on average 747 times a day.  Google the biggest player in the RTB system allows 4000 get  ready for this 4698 companies to retrieve data about the people  in the US your your location data Microsoft which ramped up  its involvement in RTB in December when it bought agtech  firm Xander from AT&T may send data to 1647 companies.  Privacy and security concerns have been raised about RTB for  years, especially in Europe, but a rock but awareness is  arising in the US.  This is from a TechCrunch story that came out yesterday.  Natasha Lomas writing the real-time bidding systems use  of web users interviews or info for tracking and ad targeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Businesses business clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and again, I don't honestly I've said this before  I don't really care if a company buys us to target me with  advertising that seems to me to be a minor hazard, but we now  know that it's not just companies is law enforcement in  Texas.  It could just be your neighbor trying to figure out if you  went to an abortion clinic recently so he could sue you.  This is becoming you know, we the warning went out if this  Roe v Wade decision goes through the Supreme Court you  could you should probably not use a period tracking app,  right?  Because that information could be sold on to somebody who  would take advantage of it and prosecute you and those apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  have had leaks.  I think flow is the one that had a really big data leak and  also one thing that I actually love related to this is Senator  Ron Wyden obviously who created 230 I was in Oregon giving  a speech and I'm like Ron Wyden created 230 the thing I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  talking about 230 fangirl.  I know I do I heard you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but um, he has a he has a bill that would stop government  from buying data to get around like third-party doctrine  holes, which I love.  I think that's a great idea because it's like, oh we can't  have a warrant.  We'll just buy the data like that's not acceptable.  And it's it's crazy to me, you know, I'm open to a federal  privacy law are straight works on this issue, but I also think  it's kind of what you're saying.  It's more dangerous for the government to be able to have  this stuff to be able to buy its way out of the Fourth  Amendment and because those holes are there like it's crazy  to me that government isn't like hey this seems like a real  hazard here.  Like maybe we take care of this and it's just like Ron Wyden  and his co-sponsors off in their corner being like hey, we're  trying to fix this.  Maybe we want to do this, you know, the Irish Council for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Civil Liberties goes on to say there's no way to restrict the  use of RTB data after its broadcast data brokers used it  to profile Black Lives Matter protesters.  The US Department of Homeland Security and other agencies  used it for warrantless phone tracking.  It was implicated in the outing of a gay Catholic priest through  his use of Grindr.  ICCL uncovered the sale of RTB data revealing likely survivors  of sexual abuse.  This is horrific.  So it's not the kind of data breach we usually talk about  where a company that's been collecting data got hacked and  the data leaked out.  These are people selling it.  This is a system for collecting the data, aggregating the data  and then selling it on and Google is the biggest player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's not news anymore, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, although this I mean, I think this ICCL reports kind of  eye-opening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's probably the...  Yeah, that's really bad.  It's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me say the number again.  An average American has their online activity and location  exposed 747 times every day by the RTB industry.  747 times a day.  A lot of that information is coming from your phone and from  Google.  Or, you know, they don't mention Apple's involvement in this.  I'm going to hope Apple's not involved, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe Apple didn't want to come in or figure out a way to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lock out.  Yeah, I mean, you don't have to sell this data on.  Well, Apple basically stays out of that.  Go ahead Shoshana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry, whenever I get anyone's data, I just sell it.  So, you know...  Yeah, who wants it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't need it.  Anyway, so that's not the typical kind of data breach and  you're right.  It's been going on probably forever.  But the magnitude of it is kind of staggering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I really do think the third-party doctrine thing is  something that's not talked about enough in policy.  Like, it's kind of crazy to me that there's a moral panic  around 230 while with third-party doctrine, they're  saying, oh, if someone else also owns your data, you have  no interest in it, which is just nuts to me.  I actually got interested in it through the Gorsuch concurrence  and Carpenter.  I thought that was a really, really interesting...  I mean, I think all the opinions in it were interesting,  but it's something that we should be thinking about more  than like, why did Twitter ban or not ban this one dude, you  know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm going to kind of explain to me like a fifth grader  explained this and you correct me if I'm wrong.  The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution has a prohibition  against unreasonable search and seizure.  You have to have in general probable cause and a search  warrant.  That's of course slowly been whittled away.  But after several Supreme Court decisions, this third-party  doctrine has arisen that if you already are giving information  to third parties like your phone company or your bank or  your ISP, then you have no reasonable expectation of  privacy for that information.  Is that essentially what you're talking about here, Shoshana?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, that's basically it.  I'm not as deep in it as others are and it's definitely  not my deepest issue, but it is something that's kind of up  there for me that we need to shore up whether through the  courts or through the legislature or both because it's  not...  It doesn't make sense and precedent like what used to happen  in early America, that was not the understanding, but government  likes its power.  So it'll try to like get our information and get around  warrants as much as it can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me try to understand what you said as a second grader.  You're basically saying because I have a phone, I have no  expectation of privacy just because I own a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Only for the data you already share with other parties like  your location data with Google, the government has a right to  that. You've basically given up your right to privacy in that  regard.  I suppose.  It's not protected by the Fourth Amendment.  And in fact, get ready for this Bitcoin advocates.  In 2020, the Fifth Circuit, our favorite circuit out of Texas,  found that transaction data with virtual currency exchanges  like Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, are like bank records.  So they're not protected either.  They are not protected by the Fourth Amendment.  So all the people who say, oh yeah, you know Bitcoin is private  secure, not according to the Fifth Circuit.  Yeah, that's a terrifying thought.  So that's I guess the whole idea of these of these auctions,  these data auctions is well, it's worse is the government  doesn't have to collect the information.  You're voluntarily giving it up.  They just have to ask for it and or buy it if they want on the  exchange.  That's pretty scary.  Do you know Shoshana?  I understand this isn't necessarily your exact area, but do  you know of government agencies that are buying this information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know what's been happening.  I genuinely don't remember offhand which agencies but it's  been something that's become like common practice, which you  know, logistically makes sense if it's a way they can get around  meeting a warrant and like suit process, of course, they're  going to do it if they can.  Right.  But law enforcement has had that problem forever.  It's kind of wild though that that there's not as much  interest in that that it's really, you know, Ron Wyden is  really leading here, but that like not a lot of other elected  officials are like this seems like a violation of rights.  We might want to like shore up.  So yeah, it's a problem that's actively happening and it's  just nuts to me that that it's getting so little coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well now that we know how much of our information is our data  smog is coming off of us all the time.  Maybe we should pay a little bit more attention to what who's  using that information.  And as I said, you know, you can argue with me that well, it's  advertisers that's harmless, but I think we all agree if it's  government, it's not harmless.  Correct.  It's not harmless.  That's that's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you hear Google hired and former Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a good story.  One of Apple's probably their best known AI guy.  Left Apple because he didn't want to go back to work.  In that nice office we built you.  He tweeted among other reasons that he didn't like Apple's  back-to-work policy, which was by the way, May 23rd.  I think everybody is supposed to go back to work.  I believe they rescinded.  I think they changed it.  But Ian Goodfellow.  Because COVID is not over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  No, they're right.  That's right.  Apple's making you wear masks inside the campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ian Goodfellow.  Apple's director of machine learning tweeted I'm out of  here.  I don't like this policy among other things.  He came to Apple from Google in 2019.  He's now back at Google.  I think this is pretty common in Silicon Valley.  There's a kind of revolving door.  I was going to say that's what developers tend to do, right?  Yeah.  But he was apparently at Apple when they're leading  lights in machine learning.  Well, I'm trying to think if this should be a change.  I'm trying to think if this should be a change log.  I was going to well.  The Google allowing you to have your free no-cost legacy  G Suite with custom Gmail domain.  You go ahead and explain it first and I'll complain.  Yeah, so you were on it.  So you actually were benefiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'll tell you.  No, I'm always an exception.  I'm always a damn exception.  You explain it first.  Last month.  I didn't bring my popcorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google had announced that people at one point you could  sign up have a don't have email at your domain name, you  know, Leo at Laporte calm or whatever but have Gmail do it  for free if for one address then they change that policy  a couple months ago and said no, no, we're not going to  allow you to do that anymore.  Now they've announced after Jeff complain.  There is going to be a free legacy edition of G Suite for  personable.  I'm sorry for personal use Jeff.  You don't have to be personal.  You also had to be personable.  You don't know that's why I fail.  Yeah, if you don't want to pay for workspace, but and you  don't want to export your data.  You can continue for free.  So that's good news for you, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's not because some time ago I.  Ended up saying well, I'll pay because I want more storage  or something.  I don't know what it was.  My former colleagues from the company I left 15 years ago  old friends might haven't talked to them in quite a while  and like years they have email there and my son has email  there.  So there's four of us on it.  And so I keep on getting these messages from Google saying  if you don't upgrade and update by this at this price, then  it's just going to happen to you like some painful process  is going to happen without anesthesia and I go to the site  trying to figure it out and it's always confusing as hell  because I'm just a little old me.  I don't think I can downgrade to personal.  So I don't know what the hell is going on for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The main thing is keeping your domain domain.  Yeah, you want yeah, I don't blame you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'll go whatever it is.  I'll pay it.  You know, okay Google you got me.  You know, it's not too expensive.  It's confusing.  Well, no, it's just confusing as hell.  Why did they why change it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My are you using it for commercial purposes?  Jeff.  Oh God, if I wish so as long as it's non-commercial personal  use, I think it's it's it should be free.  But then there's other limits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do my web domain registration with the registrar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that says this you still have to pay for that,  right?  Jeff you still pay for your yeah, but that's not much by the  way.  It's also ten bucks a year.  Yeah.  Wall Street Journal.  I like the Wall Street Journal.  I always have to take these with a grain of salt, especially  in the opinion section.  Don't try to regulate Google ads.  Todd Henderson.  I think Shoshana will like this one.  Senator Mike Lee has some legislation that would forbid  Google and other tech giants to build and operate digital  advertising exchanges from owning the tools that help  buyers and sellers of online advertising.  This has been a long time criticism of Google that it's  both it's both the house and and the dealer and you know runs  the whole thing.  Anyway, the Wall Street Journal doesn't like it because well  this columnist is this professor not only is this bad policy,  but it's based on the faulty but he explains it that advertising  markets are anonymous analogous to security markets.  So do you agree with Mike Lee's legislation?  Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He says no, I don't.  He says in this case, well, I don't know.  Honest answers.  I don't know.  How rare do I say that?  This guy makes a good point, which is that this structure  because it could operate so efficiently opened up in a  shrinking, you know ad market.  It opened up new opportunities.  If you go back to a world where they can't talk to each other  so fluidly, he says it's you're going to lose that opportunities  and media is going to lose again.  And I don't know, but it's the Wall Street Journal.  So I don't know.  Well, that's I always I have every time I see opinion in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wall Street Journal.  I have to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know same here.  Same here.  Am I am I again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put it in there because this one made me think and say oh  Professor Anderson does say if Google offers a bad deal  advertisers publishers have plenty of full-service ad  companies to choose from Amazon Facebook Microsoft Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Advertising is not where you don't you don't go out to the  golf course with with your buddy Joe and sell him six months  of ads in the sports section, right?  All that is so far gone.  Right.  It's all and it's all done automatically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  In a trading in a make-believe trading for art action houses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He say art.  He says art auction houses offer tools for buyers and sellers  and sometimes even bid in the auctions.  They host.  Well, I don't know if that's such a good thing.  That's one of the complaints people have had about these  NFTs is that a lot of buyers of NFTs are pumping the price  up artificially by selling it to themselves and then buying  it and selling it and buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not against regulating it.  I'm not against by any means investigating it.  I just don't think we know fully yet how this marketplace  works because it's so big and so complex.  Look at that prior story about the leak.  Look at the volume you're talking about there.  You can't go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So easily the focus on delivering value to end users was  a central insight of the Chicago School of Antitrust to  which conservatives like Senator Lee used to look for  economic insight in making an inapt analogy to the security  market.  Senator Lee's bill would take us back to a less less efficient  time.  I just feel stupid because it seems like a good idea to me,  but I don't want to be inefficient for God's sake.  Shoshana, have you covered this at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A little bit.  I mean a lot of the a lot of the bills I think aren't really  necessary.  Like if Google is doing fraud, that's frauds already a thing  you can't do.  I don't think you need regulations on top of it.  It's possible that there's something I'm missing but but a  lot of like Lee's and others arguments are that there's like  no place to place your ad except for Google and Facebook.  So they're like a duopoly and I'm like, no, you can you can  put your ad somewhere else.  If you choose you can talk it out with someone figure out  other methods.  But but a lot of their argument is that the market's so tight  that if they don't like this, they can't go elsewhere.  So I think it's still part of that big tech moral panic.  You know, I'm not I'm definitely not me jerk against regulations  if they make sense, but I think this one is just a little too  moral panicky and I tend to think that like, you know, look  into it.  Sure.  But right now I don't think there's a strong case that Google  is doing anything that needs new legislation.  People often point to stuff like where Facebook inflated  video views and but like that was fraud and the FTC was like  this is fraud.  You can't do that.  And I think that's how it's supposed to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is a mistrust though of regulatory ability to catch  companies like Google and stuff like this because it's so  arcane and so high speed and it's so mostly so opaque that  it's not clear how regulators would know if there were an  issue if there were fraud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure new legislation would fix that though.  I do think that government needs to yeah, government needs  to better understand tech and actually one thing our streets  advocated for is reinstating the Office of Technology  assessment to the higher experts.  So that way we can understand stuff better.  I'm very open to that just more expertise in government.  We've also been advocates for more staff pay because while  we want to shrink government like having a just wildly  inefficient government with with no institutional knowledge  is not very efficient.  So I think there's a lot that has to happen before you can  get to that point.  But but part of it too is that I don't trust regulators who  don't understand what they're regulating and that that in  itself can cause problems.  It can cause regulatory capture problems and it's something  I see quite often where it's like, oh, I don't understand  it.  I'll defer to the expert who runs this business and then  oh wait, they're the only business that exists.  That's weird.  How did that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I completely agree with you new Gingrich dissolve the  Office of Technology assessment.  That was a massive mistake that left members of Congress without  any objective information about how this stuff works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't know it's worked out pretty well with all the  illiterate section 230 bills that have come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean honestly, you know, this has come up with when people  talk about Senator Feinstein who is, you know, clearly that's  another matter towards the end of her abilities.  But hers but as the staff does most of the work, right?  So it really does come down to how smart your staff is how  good your staff is.  Is it and you said Shoshana maybe this stat there should be  more staff but it's staff also should be given tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like yeah, yeah, better pay more resources.  Yeah, there's all kinds of things that can help but I've  known so many incredible staff paid like nothing.  I know someone who ended up going back to back to Congress,  but when they were when they were working, they'd read all  of my work before we met and we became friends because of it,  but they were paid like $30,000 doing like a wild level of  work and really really trying.  So of course they're going to leave to go to the private  sector other friends who you know weren't making much want  to start a family.  I mean for rent in DC is really high to it's a really really  expensive city and when you're making it so either only rich  people's kids can afford to work in Congress or or if you're  not you have to leave if you want to like move up.  That's just not a healthy environment.  We should be retaining that institutional knowledge rewarding  good staff.  But to that end though, I think after all my work with  government one big thing that I've really seen is you can  really judge an elected official by their staff people  who have really good strong knowledgeable teams tend to  produce better legislation and and better work.  It's something that's really really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that is a good government, right?  I mean you can't I think people say oh well the senator should  be doing all the work but that I think that good government  means you first of all is a big job and there's no one person  can do it and good good government means that they're  given the resources they need to get the information they need  so they can make intelligent decisions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to know what you don't know.  There's elected officials who come from the military know  those issues really well.  There's others who come from business like Cold Stone and  you don't know that really well, but there's all different  sides to it and it's it's always really frustrating when  a politician just wants to knee-jerk and not listen to  their staff but the ones who have that like really strong  staff like that's that's the best kind of stuff.  Unfortunately, there could be a little more of it in certain  cases, but there also is a lot of really great staff.  They just like can't always afford to live in DC and work  in Congress.  They lose money doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, it's really a sacrifice.  So thank you to all the I know we have quite a few members  of Congress staff members who listen to our show.  So trying to keep up with what's going on.  We thank you for the job.  You know, it's a great civil service speaking of which by  the way, we're going to get we're working to get Matt cuts  to come back former director of the US Digital Services.  He's a busy guy.  He's enjoying life on the street.  Is he in Canada or is he in Washington?  I think he's in Canada.  I'm not sure but but I think Jason said soon soon.  I think was the word so looking forward to getting Matt speaking  of great civil servants getting that back.  Yeah, our show today brought to you by Nareva.  Oh people coming back to work leaving coming back leaving  is one thing almost you almost certainly can be sure of in  that conference room that meeting room that that that  huddles room.  You probably have people in person.  You probably have people on the phone remote.  You got a mix and you got to make sure everybody can hear  everybody.  Everybody's comfortable with the situation.  Sometimes that means oh, I'm going to go spend thousands  and thousands of dollars on a traditional system a traditional  conference system.  What am I saying thousands tens of thousands of dollars you  got to have design software.  You've got to have experts.  You've got to have Matt that come in they measure the room.  You have a dizzying array of DSPs and speakers and microphones  and and it's just it's just crazy outside technicians who  have to come calibrate the thing frequently.  It's expensive.  It's invasive.  It could take your room offline for days.  It's about time we entered the 21st century for those huddle  rooms and that's Nareva Nareva has patented the revolutionary  microphone mist technology.  That means all you have to do for great audio in your conference  room is install one or two integrated microphone and speaker  bars.  It looked just like a soundbar you'd have in your home.  They fill the room with thousands of virtual microphones.  There are no dead zones.  Everyone can be heard everywhere in the room clearly crisply  no matter where they're facing no matter how their social  distancing meeting and class participants can just talk and  move naturally in the space and remote participants don't feel  left out.  They don't feel second-class.  They can hear what's going on.  They're part of the meeting and with Nareva thanks to continuous  auto calibration your rooms are always instantly ready with  optimized audio no technician required your IT department will  love it because they get an array of console they get the  power to monitor manage adjust the system from anywhere.  They don't even have to be on site and they certainly don't  have to go from room to room the simple installation.  It's so easy.  It's a 30-minute DIY job.  If you can install a soundbar you can install Nareva.  So that's going to save on time and cost compared to traditional  systems.  It looks great.  It sounds great and everybody can hear what's going on.  This I don't know why you would choose anything else.  Why would you want to go with that costly complicated traditional  system make the leap to the modern simple economical Nareva  N u r e v a you can learn more at Nareva.com.  It's just incredible.  You just got to try this N u r e v a Nareva.com.  Thank you so much for supporting our show this week in Google.  Thank you Nareva.  Google messages users in India drowning and drowning in ads.  This is maybe the unintended consequence of RCS the rich  communication system.  Google's been pushing on us users are being sent multiple  ads a day even with spam protection on blocking and  reporting the offending accounts doesn't seem to prevent  ads from other companies appearing personal loans gambling  companies life insurance.  They're abusing it seems according to a nine to five  Google and RCS feature that's designed to let businesses  contact their customers with rich interactive media sending  customers QR code tickets letting them make online orders  instead some accounts Google identifies as verified businesses  are sending users in India a barrage of ads.  Oh my gosh.  Here's did you see this tweet?  This is if you're wondering how bad the ads in Google messages  can get I got all these in the last seven hours.  Oh, rummy circle make a blockbuster entry by Josh Finance  no cost EMI flip card and offer you can't miss.  Can you imagine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you imagine you buddy?  This is on text.  You're kidding.  Oh, that's a good question.  Google messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is our CS well it might in India it might.  I know that's a good question.  What can Google do about this?  So I mean, I wonder if it's Google's issue or if it's the  phone companies issues.  That's a that's a really good question.  Indian based Ishaan Agarwal whose recent tweets have drawn  attention to the issue tells the verge that has been going  the problems been growing worse over the course of 2022.  Android police says the problems been around for a year mostly  coming complaints coming mostly from users in India.  The only way to stop receiving ads entirely is to disable  RCS support.  Google did not respond to the verge's request for comment.  Wow.  Thank you.  John Porter from the verge.  We were actually on the I don't know if anybody have you been  anybody getting an upswell in Robo calls and spam calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Oh my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So on rings and I don't even think about it.  It's just nonstop.  It used to be, you know, okay.  Well today is Thursday.  I'm probably going to hear from my mother.  So listen out for your own.  You know that a mob your spam, right?  But now it's just ringing all the time.  Now I'm just I don't even think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can tell you why I think the FCC we've talked about.  This before has an authentication caller ID authentication service  called stir and shake in which they're going to require right now  T-Mobile Verizon AT&T all use it and in theory could reject calls  that aren't authenticated and of course no spammer wants their  call to be authenticated because they want to hide who they are.  But there is a loophole of the FCC has been putting this off.  The Commission granted small voice service providers with a hundred  or fewer subscriber lines and extension until June 30th.  2023 and I guess the reason but of course that's the one the spammers  are using their nuts.  They're using some VoIP service.  Somebody got mad at me because I used to say Trinidad and Tobago.  So I'll find a different place out of Aruba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, some out of East Virginia, East Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't you dare blame my constituents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the FCC did move that timeline up a little bit.  So now if you do not if you're a hundred thousand subscribers  or fewer and you don't have actual buildings facilities, you got  to knock it off June 30th.  So it's my theory that these guys say we got oh my God, we got  six weeks left.  Release the hounds.  Blitzen.  So let's see but June 30th, it should get better and then June  30th the following year facilities based phone companies,  small phone companies those with buildings like the actual Aruba  phone company or the actual East Virginia phone company.  They will they will have to stop as well.  And of course then it's going to be up to AT&T, Verizon, Sprint,  whoever your T-Mobile, whoever your carriers to reject unauthenticated  calls.  Just say no or maybe give you a switch that says hey look if it's  not stir-shaken authenticated.  Well given me the switch is just as inconvenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That means my phone is still going to ring and I have to sit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and no you need a permanent you need a switch that says just  don't let anything unauthenticated come through because your mom's  authenticated right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything legit should be authenticated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So legit question here because I don't do telecom policy as much.  I know a little bit not very much but like are there small legitimate  services and people who could be affected by this negatively?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, so I think spammers use VoIP, you know online only services.  They're very cheap.  You could send a million calls for a couple of bucks.  I think those people probably really need to be stopped.  But if you're the small East Virginia phone company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about the press Democrat trying to do a big campaign?  Well, no, it's the phone company that has to implement it and the press

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Democrat needs to go through a legitimate phone company that's using  stir and shaken.  Okay.  I don't think that that's a hardship.  I mean, I don't think it's expensive to implement.  I'm sure it's you know, it's a little complicated but mostly I think  these small phone companies are not implementing it because they make  a lot of money selling, you know, spam services to companies.  Yeah, we've seen.  Yeah, I was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just curious about the regulatory compliance cost because  it doesn't sound like it's that bad here.  I mean, I'd love to stop receiving spam calls.  I'm just always worried about competition, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  You're going to have to get your friends at RSI to get to work on  this because that's a good question.  I don't I don't know why you wouldn't want to do this, but maybe  there is a large cost.  It's the stir which is secure telephony identity revisited came  from the IETF.  It's basically digitally certificate based.  So the SIP the session initiation protocol would have a certificate  which would identify you.  The first public connection to the system the VoIP service provider  would examines the caller ID compares it to a known list of IDs.  They provided that customer in other words says are you authentic?  Are you genuine?  And then they attach an encrypted certificate to the SIP header  with a service providers that is in the end of trust value.  That seems like a simple thing.  Not so complicated to do.  Shaken which is signature based handling of asserted information  using tokens.  I hate these retronyms.  It's for public switch telephone networks to tell how to them how  to deal with calls that have incorrect or missing stir information.  So what do you do if it's not authentic in other words?  And this was this has been going on the FCC started talking about  this three or four years ago because of the epidemic of robocalls  and spam calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What caused the because it was working for a while.  What was working when you did the do not call list and I joined  that list, you know some years ago and for a while my phone was  a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happened is it because do not call sold something potentially

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know that's that's a no, I don't think I think I think I'm an  I don't know but I'm going to guess that because of voiceover  internet.  It's dramatic.  It's the same as a spam is through the roof.  It's dramatically cheaper to do this.  You can't tell who's who and do not call works in the US do not  call the prohibitions against spam and robocalls that we have  in the US work.  But most of these people are outside the US using small voice  based phone companies outside the US outside jurisdiction and  can't be stopped.  You know, there have been a number of notorious spammers arrested  and prosecuted and I think they're in jail now, but it didn't  make a dent in it because most of the people are overseas.  I believe.  26 26 against robocalls 26 billion calls in 2019 between January  and October.  46 billion is the estimate in 2020.  So it's almost doubled in a year.  So you're right to say something's going on.  And of course the latest thing is you know, you poses a local  exchange same area code same same three-digit exchange.  And now the latest latest one is comes from your number.  Is your number calling you all the time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All the time.  Yeah, that's cool.  That's how you know, it's right.  That's how you know, that's completely illegal neighbor and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  neighbor spoofing which is using the same area code or the  same area code exchange is completely illegal doesn't stop  these people because they're not here.  Got it.  And but Stern shaken would because the Carls wouldn't even  go through they'd say well, what's your authentication?  What's your certificate?  They go.  I'm not telling you that well, then you're not going through  but that is going to rely on the phone company is doing it.  And I suspect there's money in it.  You know that they may be getting kickbacks who knows,  you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I bribe them from you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's you I thought so Canada has already implemented  this by the way.  So ask your Canadian friends how much how much how many  robocalls they get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This reminds me of Mark Rober on YouTube.  He does the glitter.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think of this?  So I have some qualms about this.  So Mark Rober famous NASA scientist has been doing this  for two porch pirates for some years, right?  He makes these boxes that look like Amazon valuable Amazon  packages fills them with with stink bombs and glitter glitter  and cameras so they can get video of the perpetrators  the porch pirates opening up up and horrified throwing them  out the window.  So what's the latest?  What did he do recently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he got one or two of those call centers in India shut  down.  He sent them to call centers.  They set up a team and did a lot of recon and apparently  was able to pull it through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He sent them not only stink bombs and glitter bombs.  Cockroaches.  Cockroaches.  I'm not honestly you see I don't I feel like I mean look  these people are horrible.  I understand.  Here's the video of them opening the glitter bomb and  and being horrified.  You know Calcutta mostly in India, right?  Costs on India.  I feel bad for these guys.  Mark has no compunction.  I feel like this is vigilante ism.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The city needs a hero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not the hero we want the hero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm genuinely jealous of his success because with the  romance scammers usually what I'll do is when he asks for  my number.  I'll send him to the FTC romance scam line.  My knowledge I've asked the FTC to like I mean, I don't  know if they would but like to like let me know if they  were able to catch anyone from that and I should get a  prize.  Yeah, like I should get like whatever he was going to  steal from me.  Like I should earn from like the FTC.  I feel like but but I was upset because I don't think  I've ever successfully caught them.  I've tried I've been like hey call the FTC like this has  to do something and it I just don't think it's enough.  Unfortunately, so I'm very jealous of his success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it wasn't successful with the law enforcement in  these places until he got a lot of attention and then  finally law enforcement did start to come in and roll  these things up, but they'll be right back look at their  final there be bribed the bribe the law enforcement.  They'll be right back doing it again in a month.  I don't know.  I just feel like it's vigilante ism.  I guess if you I don't know is it okay to do something  horrible to another person if they're just because they're  doing something horrible to other people and do these  guys know what they were doing even that's the other question

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what guys schmuck who needs a job.  Yeah, and it's not guarantee with some schmuck who needs

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the way the video played out was the people that  are hired.  They're going to work for said company that does whatever  customer service was somewhere else.  That's what they say leave during the day.  They do customer service.  Right.  That's what they say paper legally, but there's another  floor upstairs if you will that's sort of you know locked  off and everything but that's where the real money is being  made.  So the legal stuff is just the front to cover up the yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think the morality of the video of the vigilante ism  I think it boils down to was it funny and I think if it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  funny, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, look at this the screen the call centers that  they're legit call centers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I understand.  I don't know something about this bugs me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But all right, is it a problem for him delivering glitter  packages or put in deliver pack glitter packages on the front  porch you you have a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, for some reason doesn't bother me because he's suburban

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  guy wants to get his package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, we don't have any porch pirates but I mean those guys  yeah, because I didn't worry about porch pirate.  I didn't bother them for a long time until I started noticing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it was picking up in the news like well crap.  So I had to start looking out and put cameras up at our  place just to make sure and yes, we have had people wandering  into the yard before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, like what the hell are you doing here?  You make a good point.  It doesn't bother me that it did it to porch pirates.  I just I feel bad for these poor guys in India.  We're probably you know making 500 what about what about

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if we're a disinformation person in Belarus?  Pardon, okay.  If we're disinformation farm in Belarus, you okay?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's me breaking news.  Google declares bankruptcy.  Oh, come on in Russia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Well, no, that's a big deal.  I 87.  Okay.  All right.  Bankruptcy in Russia.  I don't even understand what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Their bank accounts got seized.  Oh, and so that it's also a way to say we don't know anybody  and we got we got no room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so they file an intention to declare bankruptcy after the  seizure of its bank account made it untenable to meet  financial obligations.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's some here's some McDonald's coupons for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just want to say do they have all day breakfast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, well, that would be different.  If that's a good point, if I can get it in McMuffin at 4 p.m.  Does the ice cream machine work?  It does.  You're not a McDonald's.  In Soviet Union, a floating machine spins you.  Chinese internet sensors try a new trick revealing users  locations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On your own on your message.  Like, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we've seen this before where they shamed jaywalkers by  putting their picture up on billboards saying you can  jaywalkers apparently shaming in China is a very effective  tool.  Yeah, displaying social media users locations beneath their  posts.  Authorities say the location tags which are displayed  automatically will help unearth overseas disinformation  campaigns.  Ah, so they're not going after Chinese citizens just Americans  let's say Russians trying to publish disinformation in China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't the same practice in place for like people to write  bad checks or or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they do a lot of social shaming.  We know that.  Yeah.  This isn't about that though.  This is saying look, this doesn't come from inside the country.  This is this this is coming from outside.  Yeah.  Huh?  Those who appear to be getting online from abroad even if  they're using a VPN are treated as foreign agitators and spies.  So there's a maybe a secondary benefit.  This also prevents the use of VPNs, right?  That's interesting.  That's it.  That really is maybe it isn't aimed at outside disinformation  after all.  Inside Mark Zuckerberg's billionaire lifestyle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, don't, no.  Yeah, but that their nuns are people too.  She seems like a very nice lady.  Nuns are people too.  I think this is like Father Robert, right?  This is what the church, and by the way, they're not all  Catholic nuns.  There's some, there's an Episcopal nun here.  This is, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why does she put lotion up her nose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you know, Shoshana, always getting to the nun of the meat  of the matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This one right here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So today we're going to talk about nun pockets.  Anybody who went to Catholic school or hung out with nuns  or hangs out with nuns who are traditional habit knows that  we have special pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, I don't want to know about her special pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does she put lotion in her, oh wait a minute, here's the  skincare routine.  Girl, I'm not going to trust a nun who says girl drop your  skincare routine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A bunch of really nice ladies have left comments.  I got to say she has nice skin.  And I just want to say thank you.  That's really nice.  And people have been sending me direct messages asking what  my skincare routine is, which is really hilarious to me because  I don't really have one.  But maybe I think I know what you're talking about.  I think I probably have a few less wrinkles than some people  my age because I can't go out in the sun.  She hasn't been around men.

Okay, you're going to click on that and it turns out that there was  a meal hack for the season ticket and when they put it on tick tock,  everybody discovered it and did it and Six Flags said, whoa, we're  losing money on this.  Forget it.  So the argument is stop spreading this stuff.  Let the privileged few know it.  Don't put it on tick tock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's very egalitarian.  I think that's what's so great about tick tock.  Yeah, tick tock's new ad product gives creators a chance to partner  with marketers on branded content.  Tick tock is starting to share more of its ad dollars with creators.  Henry tells me salt Hank tells me he's making some money on on it.

Possibly see I want to get I want to get paid for my ads not  possible rewards.  Mm hmm.  I want to actual.  No, definitely.  I want actual rewards.  Tick tock says eligible creators whose videos are selected by the  brands will benefit from a cash payment and boosted traffic.  That's better.  Yeah, but well that's they're going to get thousands of them saying  here pick me pick me pick me.  This is a great way to get a bunch of extra ads for no money.  So I guess I have to do the change.

That was very much like the iPod.  He struggled to move his prototypes past the idea stage due to business challenges.  But when the time came to renew the patent he didn't have the money years later Apple took advantage of this fact in the lawsuit citing Kramer's work as prior art hiring him as a consultant.

They're excited about it could have been just those clips if  that's if that's what you know rocks your boat.  Is there anything else you'd like to share with us to tell  the world about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well actually related to the ad I love automation.  I'm having like a grand old time in integral map automating  internal stuff for our street.  No one else on my organization has any idea what I'm doing,  but it's really really fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so automating processes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so like so I had one automation that every time we  got a media mention or an op-ed.  So basically we got an alert that were in the news somewhere  whether we're creating it or we're in it.  So I had an automation that said, okay, does the author  match one of our scholar names if yes, it's an op-ed if no,  it's a media mention then I have a reg ex to find the name  within the media mention if it exists and then it'll tag  appropriately it updates custom fields, you know throws  everything in fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's normally integral now called make they change their  names darn them.  I use I use in a more primitive way.  I use Zapier to do stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's mostly what I use.  I need to use integral mat slash make for us some more complex  things because they fear is amazing.  I'm a huge huge fan of them and they've been really helpful  when I ask them dumb questions, but and I find it more user  friendly, but there are some like data limits that like even  if you have the highest a fear plan like you're not able  to do it.  But like I spent we have like 50 automations that do so many  different things and I'm just like having a blast figuring  out how stuff works and everyone's like have fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess so it's like you're using a kind of like a clipping  service almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sort of so that's part of it.  I do other things too.  It sends me reminders.  It sends out newsletters and automated emails.  It takes data.  It organizes some of our internal systems.  It's easily like one human at our organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's this impressive are you use use and use grip.  Are you a coder?  Are you a programmer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm bad at learning languages whether like regular  languages or code.  I'm really bad at it.  So I just kind of like figure out what I need it.  I grab code from like, you know, stack overflow and stuff like  that as I need but it's what everybody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what the pros do.  Very cool.  We're going to say Integra, Matt is your pick of the week.  Although again, I use Zapier, but that's okay.  It's okay.  I use that years.  Yeah, we actually use Zapier in a much more primitive way  than you're using.  It sounds like you're doing some really fancy stuff, but  that's how we build these rundowns.  When I select stories Zapier takes it from my my RSS feed  or my pin board and puts it into a spreadsheet and then yeah,  it's really cool.  Yeah, I love I'm a big automation fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not used enough.  You know, I know that like there's group there's political  groups in America who hate the idea of like automation.  They worry takes away jobs.  But like for me and my employee gets to do more interesting  work.  I automate some of her dollar tasks and then I teach her  how to build it for herself so she can build out more stuff  and and she sort of understands what I'm doing.  But other than her everyone like understands what is being  done but has no idea how I'm doing it and just like lets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  me which I'm very thankful for as the CEO that I was talking  about earlier that bought that Peninsula.  Yes to say stuff like, you know what?  Let's let's get automation going because I want the staff  to be doing things that require brain power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was he was yeah, let the computers do the stupid stuff  the repetitive stuff the boring stuff so that you can do  the interesting creative stuff.  That's the whole point of automation.  I was kind of hoping you'd come up with a bunch of section  230 merchandise actually but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know I own so much.  Oh actually so for the hair pins.  I had enough made that I think after the second one the Etsy  seller was like, all right, what does S230 mean?  I explained it to her and she's like, oh yeah, I'm on board  with that like that's great.  I'm totally all about that.  Yeah, and you give me a whole new business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  So she does she sell them now on or you're the only customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So she doesn't like you have to request S230, but she'll  make it for you and they're they're pretty good.  You can wear them to normal events like meeting Chris Cox  or speaking about section 230.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, I'm really impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's good.  She is custom designed s230 hair pins.  Very nice.  I just got I'm looking for them on that.  I don't see him but I'm looking for him on the Etsy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you just have the what's it called like you type in  like glitter hair pins or whatever and then you just ask  for a custom.  They'll do it.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, I actually asked for the section symbol.  I'm like is there any way you can like cut to us is like  I just wiggle them.  She was like I'm not doing that.  I'm like that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm gonna I'm gonna get these glitter hair clips.  They're from lingo's but I might get I might like with a  pen right s230 on the way.  I like that.  You will know Mr.  That'd be good.  It'd be a s230 flamingo and Pruitt your pick of the  weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My let's see.  I wanted to shout out some value lighting because I did  a photograph a while back and you're the king of photographic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  lighting.  You've done some really interesting stuff.  Thank you.  Yeah, I really like your that you see a lot of these on  hop but also on your Instagram and other places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, thank you.  But the Godox or Godox SL 60W are some LED lights or constant  light you have to plug them in but they just flat out work.  They're not the bright.  They're not super expensive.  Right and they just work.  You don't have to spend a gazillion dollars on on lights  all the time granted there are reasons that you need to spend

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a little bit more these be appropriate for video or video  you could use these for video video or product photography

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because a lot of product photography just requires enough  light coming out of that.  Right.  So what I I use that to light part of the shot in the next  thing in my pick, which is a high key.  So I use those with the reflectors to light the background  because I needed the background to be nice and even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this shot.  I saw this shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now granted the main light that's on him.  That's a more expensive light and I said Stella Pro CLX 10  light.

They're really good for for pretty much for highlights for
