But I should mention next week this week in Google will be in New York City at Jeff's brand new studio.  Acuni and Gina Tripani will be joining us in studio.  I'll be there as will Jeff.  So that's going to be a lot of fun next week.  This week though great panel for you.  Starting off with one of the proto-Googlers himself.  Matt Cutts is back.  Great to see you Matt.  Hey, good to be back.  Always, always love him.  You've seen him for years on those great webmaster videos, webmaster tools videos.  And of course he's been fighting the good fight.  Fight and spam on your search results for many a moon on sabbatical right now, which is nice.  That's a new report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You enjoying it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I cannot complain.  You don't miss like going into work 9 to 5 every day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know the funny thing is I keep reading the Google news.  I can't help myself.  I'm like how could this country do this or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you've got your, you've got your, I mean you don't have the, I'm sure a tattoo but you might as well.  Your blood runs in colors, primary colors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Little rainbow, you know, thug life on the back or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Also, oh there he is at the Google dance, which is the event that Google throws every year for press, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a bunch of search engine optimizers.  Oh, SEO people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're welcome too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a dance.  But it's all guys, so there you go.  I'm sure there's one or two female participants.  There were.  Nice people.  They're strange though.  They're from another planet.  We all are.  Let's face it, everyone's strange once you really find out.  Ron Amadio is also here from ours, Tecnica.  We love Ron.  His coverage of Google is par excellence.  And I guess it's the first time you two have met.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, what's up? Awesome to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ron's a regular on this show.  I'm Ron, all about Android.  I'll do this.  We're all joined somehow magically.  Matt is a little tired this morning.  Oh man.  He stayed up all night.  Pulled an all-nighter watching TV.  But not house of cards, no.  The Go, you watched AlphaGo  win the fifth and final game of its match against Leesedal.  In fact, at this point,  the real story of the five game match  is that Leesedal won any game at all.  He won one.  He won four, even though the match was already lost.  So what is your takeaway from this?  AlphaGo, we should mention,  was from a company called DeepMind.  Google acquired DeepMind not so long ago.  So it's a Google company.  Or an Alphabet, I should say Alphabet company now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty wild because  Go is especially popular in  China, Japan, Korea.  And so the matches were staged at 1pm Korea time.  Which means it starts at 8, 9, 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock Eastern time, depending on where you are.  So there were some people who were like  in the chats for the various things saying  it's 4am, please let me go to bed.  But it's crazy to see this thing,  it's like deep blue, it's like history being made.  Where people never thought  within the next 10 years or even in the next 20 years  that they would be able to go to bed.  But it's crazy to see this thing,  it's like deep blue, it's like history being made.  Where people never thought  within the next 10 years or even maybe within our lifetime  that a computer would be a viable competitor in Go.  And so it's pretty wild to see  these people talking about  strategy and Aji and Ko.  And I had no nothing about Go, but it was still hypnotic.  So it was a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used to play Go, I was a very serious chess player.  I used to play Go as well.  It's a much, much harder game than chess.  Even though it looks a lot simpler, it's just a  19x19 board, there's only one kind of piece.  It's a stone, you're black or you're white.  And you place the stones,  you take turns and the idea is to occupy territory.  If you surround  the other player's stones, you can take them off the board.  And once  all the stones are placed,  you count up who controls more territory  and that's how you win.  But it's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I stayed up a few nights watching them  until like 3am, but  the commentators,  like I was saying before the show, are awesome.  As someone who knows absolutely nothing about Go,  they have like their own little  fake board and they like lay out moves  and say, oh, we could go here or here or here.  And they kind of explain  the game to you as it goes along, because it's rather  slow and there's plenty of time in between moves.  But if you actually want to watch it,  DeepMind has a YouTube channel  with all of the games on there and like  15 minute recaps of each game.  So if you missed it, you can go  take a look and see what all the fuss was about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Michael Redmond is  the guy on the right.  He is a 9 Dan, which is the top ranking.  So he's the equivalent of a Go Grandmaster.  And he is  explaining what's  going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, the game itself,  oh, I guess I have a tab open with your voice in it somehow.  I thought that was you talking,  but then I realized that's the same thing he just said.  What's interesting about this is  those of you who are watching,  I'm going to go ahead and start  with the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm going to start with the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those of us who watch chess matches,  like I cut my teeth in 1972  on the Bobby Fischer-Boris Baski match,  it's exactly the same thing.  These games go on for a long time. This game went on for five hours.  Five hours.  And the moves  actually are a little faster sometimes in chess  because, and I'm not sure how the timing works,  but at some point the timers go to one minute per move.  And so you're going to,  then this game does speed up quite a bit.  One minute of move is for  chess or Go. Hey, pretty snappy.  It ain't tennis, I admit.  The thing that's really interesting is  it's been almost,  I didn't realize this until I looked it up,  almost 20 years since Deep Blue  beat Gary Kasparov,  the world champion,  to become the best chess-playing  computer in the world.  20 years between then and now  when a computer finally becomes  the best Go player.  And I think it's safe to say,  from all the commentary I've read,  from Lisa Dahl, the player,  that it is the case that AlphaGo is now  the best Go player,  human or otherwise in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's really good. And if it's not, give it a few weeks  for it to do more number crunching  and it'll get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why? Do you know why it's so hard  to play Go? Why is it the,  it took 20 years.  Chess, it was able to look far enough ahead  that it could just  look at any position  and within the time limit,  in all professional games,  figure out what the best move was  and make it.  It's apparently too hard  to do that in Go.  There's too many possibilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, either way,  take a shot Ron, you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what I had always heard is that you could  basically brute force chess, like there's a  set number of moves and you can kind of  calculate out whatever,  do like a search tree and calculate out whatever  the optimal move is. You can go

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  deep enough, you can't go all the way to the end  of the game. But you can go 20 or  30 moves, which is in a reasonable amount of time,  which is enough to know,  to get to a point where you go, this is a  unlosable game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but with Go, there's just too many possible  spots for any kind of  like natural,  for any kind of normal computer  algorithm to get, to calculate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it has to be an artificial intelligence that  actually can look at a position  and intuit it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what's amazing about the DeepMind  stuff is that it's a general,  it's a general AI where like the  IBM stuff  was, they built a computer specifically  for chess,  where the DeepMind  stuff has already played,  what was it, Breakout, the video game,  they want to take it and have it do StarCraft  next, I think they had said  in an interview.  It's, they,  it figures out the rules of the game on its own,  I think, for a lot of the video games and stuff like that.  It's a learning computer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so the way it  taught, you know, the Deep Blue,  you kind of  taught it. They had Grand Masters  show it positions and say, this is  better, this DeepMind  taught itself in effect by playing  tens of thousands of games against

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  itself. Yeah. Wow.  Right. And another neat thing  is that they actually published  the results in a nature paper.  So you can read about how they did it,  but there's, for example, a couple different  neural networks they called one a policy  network and one a value network, and  so they actually got to the point where they  could predict where the world class Go  players were going to play,  you know, something like 57%  of the time, and if you can do that,  you can radically reduce where you  need to search, you know, to find the next good  plays. So what was interesting  about watching the live stream is  people, even the experts,  didn't always know who was winning.  And, you know, at the end, they'd be like,  oh, I see now black has the advantage  or white has the advantage. And  it was kind of interesting because AlphaGo  was always updating its stats  about what it thinks its odds  of winning are. And so one of the  neural networks is just to sort of figure out,  OK, what are likely to be the best positions  so it can narrow down the  search quite a bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's  I think more than  winning a chess game, it's a step forward for  AI, a kind of almost a proof of concept  that  a neural network can actually  do some real work. We've seen  more and more of this, particularly  from Google, although Facebook  also has a Go playing computer.  And there was a little bit of a sour grapes  kind of response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got to see them play each  other. Come on. That's the that's would  be great, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I love the post from the Facebook AI  guy that was like, well, sure, you  can make the world's best Go playing  computer. But did it learn to play  Go completely by itself or did you  bootstrap with a database of watching  other games? And I'm like, you know, it's still the first  time that's ever happened. That's a pretty big  milestone. So give it a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bit of credit. It's a little bit of an obscure  I mean, that's when  some of this happens. The same thing happened in  chess. That is exactly  what  people said when Deep Blue  One was, oh, well, it was  it was trained to beat  Kasparov. It was designed to beat  this particular player.  But what we've seen in the years intervening  is even a PC  now can beat 99.9 percent  of all players routinely.  That, in fact, I think it's  safe to say at this point that  with Fritz or one of the strong  computer programs that can  run on a multi-core PC,  it's not a question. The chess  playing computers are the best, period,  better than any human. And what's  interesting is the Go community is going through a lot  of the same kind of grief  that the chess community went  through 20 years ago. We got over it and  didn't stop people playing chess,  even though, you know, you had the knowledge  that a computer could win this game.  It's still a fun puzzle for humans  to solve. It doesn't take any of that away.  In fact, computer  human chess players really now  partner with computers for training,  for sparring, for analysis.  Computers are a very big part of  chess now, and it's a nice symbiosis.  It's not, you know,  they're not the enemy. But  again, it's not about the game.  And we can go on and on. There's a lot of  we had an interview on the new screensavers  with the head of the American Go Association. One of the things  he said is that  AlphaGo doesn't play like a human. For instance,  when you're playing as a human,  you're kind of calculating in your head, well, how many  squares am I ahead? How many points am I  ahead? And can I build  that lead?  AlphaGo doesn't care how much  it's ahead by. What it's always looking at is  can I win the game? Even if I only win by half a point,  can I win the game? And a human just  doesn't think that way. So it plays  a different game, but it's a  computer. We would expect computers to think  differently, right?  The goal is not to teach a computer to think like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  human. Yeah, and that  strategy made the live games super  close. Like it would never try to  pull away by a million points. Yeah, humans try to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  crush the opponent.  It doesn't  care. It's got no skin in the game.  It doesn't want to crush or not crush.  Although I guess you could probably  teach it to have that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  desire. That seems like it's insulting.  Like, I don't need a huge  lead. Just this move is close enough.  I will beat you, little human. I don't need to beat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you by much as long as I win.  Who cares?  Matt, do you follow AI at all?  I mean, you must have  some kind of at least academic interest in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I do. And it's kind  of funny because where I went to grad  school, it was in the middle of artificial  intelligence winter and everybody was like  oh, we're not even going to teach any courses  in artificial intelligence. It's failed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a failed subject. We can't  do it. It's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And now you look at what  people are... I mean, even the voice recognition  on your Android phone, you know, has  a lot of word error rate correction built  in because of this sort of deep learning. So  Google Photos, all this stuff is going to  become practical a lot faster than people  expect it to. And  so a lot of people are like, OK,  mobile, social, local.  If it were me, I would probably pull one of  those out and probably slot in  machine learning as a skill to be studying  right now because there's a lot of ways that  software will eat the world, as Mark  Andreessen has often said.  And I think artificial intelligence  is one of the ways in which you can get ahead of  that trend and sort of figure out how to be  part of, you know, making that change instead  of being surprised by it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you...  A lot of experts, including Mark  and others  say, but we also need to be careful.  Sure.  Do you fear AI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know,  any power tool,  whether it's link networks or whatever,  you want to have a healthy sense of caution.  But it's kind of interesting. I think  Demis, the, you know, one of the co-founders  and heads of  DeepMind,  whenever Google acquired DeepMind, he said, OK,  we also want to set up an ethics panel  to think about the implications of this.  So, you know, even back  years ago, whenever DeepMind got acquired,  they were thinking along those lines. And  certainly, you know, 20 years from now  we'll have computers and  robots doing more jobs that  people do today. So  thinking about how that is going to affect  society, I think that's probably going to affect  society more in the near term. A lot of the people  I talk to say, you know, we're still a generation  away from worrying about, you know,  the scariest sort of scenarios  that a lot of people seem to bandy about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Elon Musk,  who's another person who said we have to  worry a little bit about AI.  The founder, one of the  principles at  Y Combinator and others have put a billion  dollars towards  a non-profit AI research company  called OpenAI. I think  some of the concern is we don't, and I  think this is legitimate, it shouldn't be  any more than the human genome should be  owned by a single company.  AI shouldn't be owned, despite  the fact that we really do have a kind of a race  between Facebook, Google and others.  AI shouldn't be owned by any individual  private corporation. It should be  something that everybody  can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's a neat tension there because  on one hand, Google has published a lot of these papers  and we've open sourced TensorFlow,  which is sort of our machine learning  framework, so a lot of people can all  try it, you know, and I think Facebook has also  open sourced theirs as well. And so  rather than try to hold on  to their proprietary silos, a lot of these companies  are letting go and letting other people try out  ideas, which is good. The only thing is then,  you know, 20 years from now,  what might be the unintended consequences if it's easier  to experiment. But for the near term,  there's so many benefits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've made it too easy. Oh my God.  Microsoft's even doing this.  Microsoft just released a project, AIX,  which I love.  It uses Minecraft.  See, one of the problems with AI is  how do you test it? How do you give  it a playground? Of course, one way is  to make a go playing computer or a chess playing  computer, but Microsoft is making  it possible to use Minecraft.  And they have a library, an interface, so that  you can use Minecraft for your AI to test it,  for AI research.  And they've also opened this up,  which is great.  So AIX, if you  don't want to learn how to play Go, learn how to play  Minecraft. But as you say,  AlphaGo learned Breakout first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they ran it through like 13 different Atari  games, I think.  Because it's general purpose.  They want to use it for, I think, medical,  some kind of  medical diagnostic thing next.  DeepMind has a bunch of presentations  out there where they talk about kind of the future  and how they want to apply this to actual  useful things, besides just beating  video games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, let's take a break. When we come back, I know Ron,  you've played with it. I'm sure, Matt, you have too.  I'm calling it Android  NutRole.  I don't think Google will.  We know Nut.  Yeah, there is. Hiroshi Lockheimer  said that Nut would be in the name, or implied  it. He says, I'm not going to tell you what the name  is. But let's talk  a little bit about the new version of Android.  I've put it on my  6P.  Actually, I started with my Pixel C  thinking, well, it couldn't make it any worse.  And maybe, no, actually, you know what?  To be honest, I love my Pixel C.  But I thought split screen will be  really good on a tablet.  And it was so stable and reliable, I thought,  well, I can put it on my 6P now.  This is actually surprisingly ready.  Not recommending it.  But it is an early  bit. It's first beta. It's an alpha.  But Google is  allowing anybody with a modern Nexus device  to try it out. We'll talk about Ron  and give us your feedback. Matt,  too, if you've got anything to say about it.  You've tried it, Matt, right? Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could neither confirm nor deny that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's been running it for the last three months.  It's public for crying out loud.  I'll let Ron comment on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK. Ron and I will talk about it.  Our show today brought to you by  Fresh Books. If you're a freelancer  or you're on sabbatical  and you want to send out invoices,  you know, you have to send out the invoices to get paid.  You probably don't really want to  fire up Google Docs  and get the spreadsheet, put all your expenses  in there and then create an invoice  and print it out and  lick it, the stamp, put it on the envelope  and mail it. You probably want to do it easier.  In fact, it's such a burden. It was always such a burden  for me to send out invoices that I often  just didn't. You know,  I put it off. I go, oh, I don't want to do that.  Which means you don't get paid.  Because with no invoice, no pay.  So what's nice, Fresh Books,  it came along and I think I started using them in  2003, 2004.  And it made it so easy to do  invoices that I would email.  Clients paid faster because  it was easier for them to pay.  And they've just gotten better and better. And you know what the  best part about Fresh Books is?  It organizes all your cash  flow information. You can see what  invoices you've sent, who's paid you, what your  income is, which makes it easy  for, yeah, tax time.  Tax time.  Their mobile app will let you take pictures of receipts,  organize them for later.  Which means it's easy to invoice for them  if you get reimbursed.  Or claiming them as expenses  when tax time comes around.  You're just going to love this feeling.  The reports make it so simple to either go to your  account or do it yourself.  Now it probably is a little too late  for tax time this year if you haven't been using  Fresh Books. But now would be a good time to start for next  year. Especially since we've got a free  30 day trial for you.  Go to freshbooks.com slash  twig.  Get the app on iOS and Android.  You'll love it. It's ridiculously  simple cloud accounting software.  And it lets you sail through tax time, sail  through those chores at the  end of the month that make you get paid  faster. Even if you're  not a numbers person. Actually, especially  if you're not a numbers person. Fresh Books.  I loved it. I really  did. Freshbooks.com  slash twig  for 30 days  free. This week in Google, Matt  Cutts is here. Ron Amadio  from Mars Technica.  And we were kind of surprised  in the middle of twig last week  when the, when, what?  All of a sudden it said, hey,  you can install Android N.  We don't even have a name for it, but you can install it.  If you have a Nexus 5X or a 6P  or a Pixel C or

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  the Nexus

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  9, although I think that's held up a little bit.  So Ron, you put it on your  6P. I put

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it on a Nexus 6, old school.  Old? Okay. Wow.  Old school phone. I don't have a 6P on  the Nexus. It doesn't work on the 5, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there are some people left out.  But if you have a recent Nexus phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  It's just a developer preview.  So, you know, don't go running off to  install it on your actual production  phones. But it's a cool look  for, I guess, mainly  app developers to kind of get ahead of the  changes that they're  going to make in the new operating system. Having said that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I found it to be pretty stable though, right? Have you had  the only issues I've had, like, when I  go on Instagram, Instagram complains  through your libraries, they're so weird.  And then it just goes on and runs normally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It depends. I  like, on my Pixel C,  it resets about every  10 minutes. What? I don't, I don't  know why. Mine doesn't, mine's really  reliable. So there's two different ways to  get it on your device. Oh, I did the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  over the air. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did an OTA. Yeah, you can  sign up for the beta program. The new  thing is to sign up for the beta program, which is super  cool. I mean, I did a  Google, like, I did a Google  OTA for my Pixel C. Like, you go to this website  and you hit enroll and Google, like,  instantly pushes you an OTA for the  beta. And I did that on my Pixel C

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and it was super unstable. So I don't know.  I'm going to try. Here's the site, by the way.  It's google.com slash Android slash  beta. And you just push the  button and you can see I've enrolled both my Pixel C

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and my 6P. It'll show you your eligible devices  that you have attached to that account.  I have a bunch of devices that  I've installed multiple times. So  I don't know how that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It really wanted you to upgrade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But once you get it installed,  you get split screen and a new notification panel  and tons and tons of  under the hood  improvements to dig through.  I really like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the compact  notifications where it pushes them  all into. What's nice, well, here  you can see I have my chat room,  my notifications. And so these  would be multiple notifications. But when I tap it,  actually, this didn't do it  in this case. But on some of them,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's if you pull down on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You pull down on it, then you get the other ones. Okay.  But those aren't bundled. These aren't bundled.  So I just screwed it up for you.  But it's nice.  I also love the  new, we call it,  it's not a hamburger. We call it a grilled cheese.  So if you've got  multiple programs running and you press and hold  the recents  button, right,  it turns into a... Well, open something  first. Oh, I have to have something open. Okay. Now  do it. There you go.  And it turns into the grilled cheese, which is a double  button. And it shows me  on the, it splits the screen. By the way, this is  resizable, which I really like.  So I could have the chat room open  here and then  pick from one of my other, let's have Google Plus  open here. And I mean  this is, this is what the, this is probably  the single most important feature  that was missing from the Pixel C. This makes  the Pixel C pretty good.  Yep. Yeah, definitely.  It's really nice on the,  less useful on a phone probably, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, one of the  things I found there's, besides  that feature, there's another one that lets you  kind of zoom out the display.  You can set the, the kind of  overall size of Android. Yeah.  And if you have, if you have a really big  phone with these features now,  big phones become like more  useful because when the Nexus  6 first came out, it was this giant  6 inch screen, but all that happened was  Android got bigger. Right.  You didn't see more of Android.  And now with these settings, you can actually  do more with your big screen, which is  surprisingly useful. That's why I have  it on the gigantic. Yeah, because you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the Gigantor Shamu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, here's a  Nexus 5 and this giant. Look  how big that thing is. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looks like  that's nice. So you change the  is it a DPI setting?  It's like a DPI setting. Yeah, that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it is. They surface that. Okay. But it's  it's limited to like, you  can zoom out one level,  which is not a ton.  And you can zoom in a bunch if you like have  trouble seeing, you can make everything super big.  But it's very cool  that they finally surface that. It was a super  popular mod that people would do if they  rooted their phone or whatever. It

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  feels like almost some of this stuff is  stuff that Google learned from the mod  community. It's like, oh, you like that.  I love the summaries.  Now you get in the  system settings so  you kind of you don't have to dig  into the settings to see like, for instance, which Wi-Fi  is selected,  what my brightness is right now,  how many, you know, what my  ringer volume is. All of that is very  handy. I mean, the only reason I'd ever open  storage was to see how much storage I have left.  Well, now I see it without actually  going into it. So where do I, is it display  that I can change the DPI?  Yeah, display size. There it is.  Display size. As opposed to font size.  And then I have  four settings. So  I press plus.  Oops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's thinking about it. Yeah. It's thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And is it changing both  windows? It is. So that's kind  of cool.  I mean, for a large screen  phone or a tablet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's great is both those windows are active windows.  Like you can scroll up on one and down  on the other simultaneously. I know.  It's not like iOS where it's like  one kind of goes passive and one goes  active. No, this is exactly, on a tablet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is awesome.  Now, so it looks like  most of what's new in Android and at least  is UI. I don't know what's under the hood,  but a lot of new UI stuff.  I love, and I  think it was JR Raphael who pointed  this out. He said there's two features  I really like that nobody ever talks about.  One is the ability to  switch context very  rapidly. You double tap the recents  button and it'll bring up the last app you used.  Just boom.  So you can just switch  context like that.  I think that is actually a really nice  feature. Oh, okay. Cool. It's alt tab.  Yeah. And then if you're in  multiple, you know,  you're in recents and you have multiple, you can  like alt tab between them by just  hitting it once. You can  see what you're different. And by the way, these are bigger  thumbnails than before. So this  is great. I mean, I have to say,  and unlike you, you see, I've  been using it. I haven't had any crashes at all  on my Epic. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, mine, I don't know. Something's wrong with mine.  I'll have to mess with it. Mine might be  pre-released from Google. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't know. We need to do some  special debugging for Ron. I got it when it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  came out on Wednesday.  So maybe. Yeah, I couldn't complete

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  setup. It just keeps

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  rebooting. We should  mention that you can opt out,  of course. You can unenroll the  device, but you should be aware that  it will wipe your data.  It will just basically reset your  phone back to the latest stable  release. So don't do  this unless you're willing to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and especially if  people have been using a Pixel C,  it seemed like a lot of the feedback on those reviews  was, we wish we had better Windows  management. So it's kind of nice that  this is providing that sort  of features in some sort of form  pretty early on so that people can  be using it while they're testing it and get an idea  of what's coming. Yeah, I'm thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We also saw a rumor, I don't know if you saw this,  I won't ask you to comment,  Matt,  that there would be like Windows,  like separated Windows  coming out at some point. I don't know if  that's and or if that's something special for the Pixel C.  Did you see that, Ron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so in the in the Android and  Developer Docs, it mentions  a freeform window mode  where, yeah, which is  basically going to be,  it sounds a lot like kind of like  what Remix OS is where it's like Android  with kind of free floating app windows  that you can move  around with, I guess, a mouse  and keyboard. I don't know. Kind of silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I asked Ron if he saw it when in fact the  article was by Ron that I read.  I didn't note that.  Of course you know about it.  That's how I found out about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's good about digging through things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I try sometimes. I don't know.  See, this was dumb.  All of this stuff comes out all at once  and there's no way to dig through  it all and you just kind of post whatever you  find. So I like decompiled  the operating system to find this  reference to freeform windows and people  like, it's in the docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You dummy. You don't have to  reverse engineer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's funny. But yeah, after I posted  that, somebody linked me the docs things and I'm  like, oh, okay. So the  thing is like, why would you do this?  Is it desktop  Android? Like is this the first step?  Because it doesn't make a ton of sense  on phones. It's kind of weird on  tablets without a  mouse.  So are we seeing the first step  toward the rumored  desktop operating system?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would be very happy, frankly,  to have that on the  Pixel C. You can stop using windows.  Yeah, well, I already did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You just make me want to buy a Pixel C, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, by the way, if you're a developer,  25% off on the Pixel C  right now. Also broken by Ron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no. If you say you're a developer,  they do no...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're a developer,  nudge, nudge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got Matt Cutts  sitting right there. You can't say these things.  Oh, OK. Sorry.  No, I'm just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure everyone who clicks that box  has done at least a few Hello World programs.  Exactly. Who isn't a developer?  We're all developers in some sense.  Learn development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good point, right?  I'm learning. I want to learn development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have multiple projects in various  stages of development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Most of them include  headers.h.  Done.  So,  at 25% off, it gets down to  like 3... Where is it here?  Is it here? 375?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  375. That's good.  So you could basically get the keyboard  for free. The keyboard's another $150  still, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have never, unlike many,  in fact unlike most,  let's say everybody but me, never  regretted purchasing the Pixel C. I really  like it. And I love  to get the hard keyboard,  the one that has the big magnet in it.  I love that. It's such a  nice system.  And it fits just right in my  man bag.  I'm going to write a blog post  on the  searching shopping for  man bag.  Because I have now become a full convert  to carrying a purse.  And one of the reasons is  because you can... These little computers  or you could be a Surface maybe or something  will fit so nicely  in a small, relatively small  bag. And  then you got it with you all the time.  It's not a desktop computing  environment, but there's so much stuff  on Android. There's so many. I can see why  as much as I love the Chromebook,  I can see why Google might say, well, if we're really going  to do something like this, it probably should be Android.  I mean, look at all the apps.  A lot more apps.  Yeah. And I'm, by the way, not using  the Google launchers. You probably figured out I'm using  Nova launcher, which is my favorite.  But it works.  People look at my desktop  and they go, what's wrong with you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm ADD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what's wrong. You have it organized nicely.  But I can tell. This is my music page,  right? Nice. And the nice  thing about Nova is you save these and then  you just apply it to the next device. So it's not like  I have to go through this each time.  That's smart. Yeah.  There's a big Google Plus  widget.  I don't know if I really will keep that.  This normally has a widget. I think I must have  erased, accidentally released the  widget there. It's amazing, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Pixel C came out in  December. So it was three  months ago, four months ago. Like you guys couldn't  wait three, four months  so that we could kind of see that, oh,  this is what's going to happen and that it's  it seems like it came out just way  too early before the software was ready  for it at all. So come on, Matt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell us the truth. Was it you, Ron,  who I think it was that had the  story that this is what really  happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That it started. Yeah, there were references  to the Pixel C board  in the Chrome OS repository  for a bit. And then that kind of went away  and then Android came out. So yeah, it was  it was weird. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  know. It was the story  was, Ron wrote it, of course,  the Pixel C was probably never supposed  to run Android. And you have,  I think, extremely strong  evidence  that this, you know,  starting in 2014, this  Riu board was  designed for  a particular kind  of new hybrid OS  that got canceled.  The Chrome OS, Touch  Chrome OS got canceled.  And then they did Project Athena,  which was, you know, I mean,  there's you could see the steps and I  think you documented it quite well. So, Matt, I wouldn't  expect you to confirm or deny,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  particularly. Well, and as a search  guy, I don't have any insight into that. You don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Sort of back and forth anyway. But then the Franken  board. And I, you know,  it might have been rushed  to get the Pixel C out. Remember, they announced  it. Was it  the Nexus? Was it the Nexus launch event?  The Nexus? Yeah.  6 and 6P and 5X  launch event. They said, look at this.  Oh, it's cool. And then nothing.  And then all it was again, it was I think it was  during Twig all of a sudden, it's on sale.  And I ordered one immediately.  And so  did Jeff. And he's had a little  problem with his, but he got his replaced and it's working.  It wasn't starting for some reason.  December 8th,  it went on sale. And some  thought the reviewers seemed to think  that maybe it was premature that there wasn't  that Android wasn't the right OS  for this. But I've been very happy  using it as just an Android  tablet. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not? I don't know exactly.  Yeah. Why they moved up the N  beta. You know, some people said  if the N beta is available, then  developers have more of a chance to play with it and get  ready for it. And also OEMs might  have more of a chance, which is also kind of nice.  But it's also a nice side benefit  that it helps the Pixel C because now you've got  better witness management. So that's  you know, three good reasons right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm thrilled. Well, I think I'm going to give you  another reason, I think.  And Ron would probably disagree,  but it's surprisingly  stable. It feels like  that there also might have been the calculus.  You know what? This is actually pretty done.  It's pretty good. It may not be done.  But it's good enough to put it out  there with people aren't going to be saying it crashes every  five seconds, except for Ron.  It is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  plenty stable on my phone. Yeah, my  6 is fine. Yeah, just  I don't know. Something's wrong with my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Redo the Pixel because I have  this has been rock solid.  And the only issue I've had is  that some apps  either give me an error,  throw an error and then continue on.  I think I had one app error out. I can't  remember which app that was.  It wouldn't run. It might have been Waze.  Waze has been flaky lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I had Waze dying  on my Nexus 5X.  So, you know, I think there was a  Nexus or  a security update and then  something happened with Waze.  So I think they fixed that. I took Waze off of my

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  6P because every five  minutes it would say Waze has crashed.  I wasn't even running it.  Waze has  crashed.  What's going on there? Yeah. And I don't use  it enough. I mean, Google Maps has a lot of  the Waze information in it now. You know, it's interesting.  My car, which uses, I have an Audi that has  Google Earth tied in.  It must be tied in live because it's got  T-Mobile, T-Mobile SIM in the car.  It's now giving me Waze  style. It told me there was an accident  ahead. Nice.  Wow. It must have, it must be getting Waze  data. So it's Google Earth,  not Google Maps. Isn't that weird?  It's Google Max functionality.  I mean, it does turn by turn and I  see streets and, but  they say Google Maps on it and it does have  the satellite view that is, I think, Google  Maps satellite view. I'm not sure  what the difference is really. Yeah, no, I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  been digging through these  car infotainment systems  and they're completely insane.  So yeah, that was some weird custom  thing that Audi and Google made,  I guess. But it works. It's  just like before Android showed up with smartphones  where you have all these weird  operating systems that like some  dude made at  the car company and threw it on  the car and will never be updated again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm pretty sure  it's QNX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's at least a decent OS.  It's a real time, real OS.  Made by Blackberry now.  Which is weird. Well, and it's also

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  interesting because everybody talks about the self-driving  cars and sometime this  week I saw an article that said the newest  Honda Civic has  the automatic lane  assist and the automatic cruise control.  And so you're starting to see  these features and it also,  I wish Jeff were on the show,  I think it also has both Android Auto  and Apple CarPlay  or whatever their system is called.  Honda does. In fact, one of our,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I meant to tell Jeff that because one of our guys bought a  Civic and it has both.  And he's very happy with it. So I meant to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, my buddy has a 2016 Accord and it'll do.  It does lane,  it will try to steer, but we're talking  about lane guidance  by cameras looking  down at the road to see paint.  Like the difference between that  and a real self-driving car with like LIDAR  and all that stuff is completely different.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's nice to see it start to trickle into the market  a little bit. Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My howdy does that. It's called  lane assist. Right.  And you can see that it's seeing the paint.  And actually  what it told me is how often  I veer into...  I think I'm an old man.  Because what it does  is it vibrates the steering wheel.  And it's like you're going  over bots dots. It's good.  And even though there's  kind of virtual dots.  And it goes... And so you go back.  And I think it will  in addition pre-tension the seatbelts  begin to break and things like that.  It also, if a car pulls in front of me,  it will jam on the brakes.  Even if I have adaptive cruise  control which is really good  for stop and go traffic. You just turn it on  and you sit back. And you still  have to steer. But the  car will keep a distance  between the car in front of it.  And if the car in front of it stops, it stops.  It's pretty amazing.  We're getting there. We're getting there.  We're getting there. Yeah. Slowly.  These are only in the very high-end  cars at this point. Although if the Hord  has it, that's a good sign.  The Civic. The Honda Civic.  I don't think he has all of that  stuff. But he has the CarPlay. I was talking about the CarPlay  in the Android Auto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Civic does have Android Auto in the CarPlay.  Which is great. And the  lean following. It does. Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The new one does. Yeah, that's the basic  model, right?  That's great.  We're getting there. That's the way it's going to  sneak in.  Bit by bit.  They kind of start to take  over more and more. And you get  the part of it is just for the human  to get more confident in the ability of the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is terrifying.  I tried Tesla's  auto driving thing.  Which they were demoing in New York City.  You want to talk about terrifying  traffic on the New York City  boulevards or whatever.  Yeah, there's a video somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were you on the West Side Highway or something?  It was crazy. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that the West Side Highway?  You're driving down it in the Trade Center, right?  Like Center. Yeah.  There's a video  somewhere online of me just screaming  as the car drives into the  car on the New York City road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you didn't get in an accident.  How hard is it though not to grab the wheel and jam  on the brakes? It's really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like muscle memory  that you're trying to turn off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It will take some time  for us to get used to this whole notion.  Or maybe less time than we think.  I don't know.  It is a very  relaxing prospect  to have just the car come,  get you, take you home.  We'll all have chauffeurs in the future.  Yeah, that'll be great. Our robot chauffeurs.  Alright, let's see.  What else?  I'm going to  jump into the fabulous  document that Jason Clant  has prepared for us with a list of all  the stories I'm going to forget to talk about.  I love that Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  introduced a transparency report  for itself regarding  HTTPS.  So the top line  stat is now 77%  of all the traffic  to and from Google is now encrypted.  That's good progress right there.  That's amazing progress.  Some of that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  let's encrypt, right?  I think this is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not. This particular one is  strictly Google.  And you guys are using Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  certs, not?  That's right.  Because Google is a certificate authority, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And let's encrypt  is fantastic. I think they just had like  a million certificates go out.  But  for the Google numbers, I think  it's something like they count almost  everything soup to nuts, like even mobile  API calls and stuff like that.  So to get to 77%  of everything being encrypted when you're talking  to Google makes it that much harder  for a neighborhood cafe  or your boss or an ISP or a government  to spy on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had mixed  feelings about Google  last year started saying, you're  not going to show up as well on search  results. And eventually Chrome is going to  ding you if you don't do  HTTPS.  I understand why it's a good idea.  And it should have HTTPS  should be everywhere.  But you know,  we don't even have a you know, there's no login  to our site and you don't even download  podcasts from our site. You download  it from somewhere else. Really, it's a read  only site.  And even if somebody did a man in the middle, I don't  know what I mean. I guess they could put  malware on it. But  we did it. I did it.  I bit the bullet.  Well, you talk to people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a lot of people probably think of it like Google  is like using some big club trying  to urge people. And it's it's much  closer to a series of gentle behavioral  nudges like in Gmail. If you  email somebody and it's not going to be encrypted,  then you'll see a little red  lock that's open. So it just knows,  you know, that's fine. Little tiny  I don't mind that push people towards  better safety and security. They did

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  say and I think you'll start to see this  later this year that  pretty soon it's going to start looking  worse and worse if you're on a non-encrypted  site. Like they'll be  bigger X's and  it'll look scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you think about it, a  lot of energy that used to get wasted on  things that weren't as useful, people  are now spending on things like making their site faster  or more like Let's Encrypt,  where you've got free SSL and  that's making a big difference.  There's very little reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  not to at this point.  Since Let's Encrypt basically  not only gives you a free cert,  but it has a script that will automatically  install it on an Apache or NGINX  site. Not IIS yet,  but that means that most  sites, it's as  simple as you push a button and the  because that was, it wasn't merely the cost.  It was  the engineering involved.  And you know, I still have a site, the Tech Guy  Lab site, the radio site, which is not HTTPS.  It's running on NGINX.  I should probably look into  getting that  a cert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could still be simpler, but I'm glad to see  the collective will of everybody  on the internet pushing things towards  less friction, less headache, less hassle  to get those certificates installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, of course, with this debate, this Apple  Department of Justice debate, I think  awareness of the importance  of encryption is really  I bet you it's 100% greater  now than it was  a month ago, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The 77% thing  is interesting because I  always picture Google services as like  your data is online somewhere and you're  going to go access it. So like  of course all that would be encrypted. But like what's left?  What are the Google things that are  not encrypted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and there's some like news.  A lot of the big trend  was advertising.  So it was like 10% in  January of 2014 and now  something like 77% of all the  advertising is encrypted with SSL. And so  for a while people said, oh, we  don't feel comfortable going to SSL because we don't know  that the ad networks will work. And so  sometimes those were bringing up the tail end.  But even there, there's really good progress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell us why in simple  terms that everyone can understand  it's a good thing for everything  to be HTTPS.  I mean, use, if you want my  you know, our website,  there's no login,  there's no purchases, there's  no data being transferred.  It's just, it's like a brochure, a read  only site. Why  should that be encrypted?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you want to go Ron or do you want me to take a stab at it?  No, it's yours, Matt. It's yours.  Okay. I'm giving this to you.  The big one would be the man in the middle of tax.  You know, you might include some JavaScript  from another site and then  someone can basically interject themselves  in between and give you malicious JavaScript.  And we saw that with like,  I forget if it was like the great firewall of China  or something where they were  adding extra things to the JavaScript that  would cause a denial of service attack against  other sites. And so even things  like where, you know, when you're getting your cookies  and stuff like that, and you  might think that, well, the  other thing is, you know, you don't want your ISP  interjecting ads, you know, if you  type in a domain name that doesn't exist or  you know, it's better to have all  of those channels encrypted so  that you know it and whoever you're talking  to knows it, but nobody in between  knows it. You don't necessarily want to have  those things where somebody knows,  oh, they go to Windows  Weekly and so they probably have a Windows  device, so that's how I would attack Leo  or something like that. Just all those

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  things add up. And if you're on an open  Wi-Fi access spot, which you  shouldn't be, without protection,  but if you are, then the  man in the middle can be from the guy sitting  across from you. Yeah.  Fire sheep. Yeah. Or your neighborhood cafe.  That was the revelation  that got Facebook  to do HTTPS was  Fire Sheep, which allowed you to run  Fire Sheep on Firefox  and sit in the cafe, sniff  the traffic going on around you. If you saw  somebody was on Facebook, you could grab  their token, the  cookie that Facebook uses  to say, oh, you've already logged in, yeah, I know you're  you, and you could sit there  and be on their Facebook page and start  posting stuff. And  I think that that demonstration, I  remember when Steve Gibson saw  Fire Sheep, he said,  this is the greatest thing ever. I said, Steve, this is  horrible. He said, no,  this is going to force everybody  to use HTTPS.  And he was right. I mean, that, I think  was a single data point  that finally got Facebook to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  secure. Yeah. Sometimes things have  to break before they get better. You know, like  the Snowden News, everybody's like, this  is terrible. I was like, this is, yes, it  is terrible, but it means everybody's going to be a lot  more serious about security. So that's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Except for the president, but that's another  story.  He really let me down.  I tell you, he's been,  you know, I'm a Democrat. I voted for Obama.  I contributed to his campaign. I'm a big  supporter and  I feel like he's been in general a good  president. And of course, no president, no politician  is going to give you 100%. You're never going to  score 100% with anybody because  you're going to do something somebody doesn't  like. But I'm very disappointed that  he was at South by Southwest  doing, saying good things, really  good things, saying  this was on Friday, you know, help  us tech community, make government  more efficient, more responsive, more transparent.  It's going to take you  and your coding abilities and that, you know, feel  good message and everybody sign them up.  And then at the end in the Q&A,  the moderator says,  well, what about this Apple phone thing?  And he just, he just ruins the whole  thing. He says, we've got to stop  fetishizing these phones.  Why, they shouldn't be private.  Encryption, we can come to a compromise.  And that, as you  probably, as everybody who's watching knows,  because I've gone off on this a couple  of times, there is no compromise  when it comes to encryption. It's just not  it's math. It's not a compromise.  There's no 2 plus 2 equals 4  or 5 or  maybe 6. I don't know. Could it be 3?  No, it always equals 4.  Period.  Did you see the John Oliver segment?  Yeah, I didn't, but everybody's raving  about this. Was it good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was great. That's the one to  send to your regular friends as opposed  to your techie friends, because it goes through  all the points and then it says, well, what about other  countries? You know, what if we have to weaken it  for, you know, oppressive governments?  And to fit  in that much nuance into 22  minutes is a pretty impressive feat. So  that's a good one to send out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think what's  I hope this has become clear. We'll see, because Apple  is going to do an event on Monday in which they will  give, this is like their closing arguments,  their last chance to say something  before the judge rules on  Tuesday, probably  we'll rule against them. I'm guessing we'll rule against them.  And then it'll be appealed and we'll go to the Supreme  Court and we'll see what happens there. But  it's Apple's last chance  to really, I think Tim Cook really  kind of figured out  the angle  on this is that  if encryption  is weakened in any  way, it's  it reduces  our security. It does not improve  our security. So anything you do  in this one case that solves  this one question  will inevitably have repercussions  that will weaken our security across  the board. And if  people get that,  I think that Congress,  which ultimately will have to make  or not make a law about this,  we have a shot.  We have a shot that maybe Congress  will go, oh, yeah, this  is bad for public safety. It's just very  simple. It's a bad idea  for public safety. If law enforcement  has a backdoor in encryption  of any kind, it's bad for public safety.  And I'm sure this is Google's, I know  this is Google's point of view as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I love that  Tim Cook has basically decided  to make privacy a cornerstone of Apple's  message and philosophy. And  yes, they're marketing, but good on  Apple. That's fantastic.  That's the ultimate pro user stance  to really concern yourself  with privacy and security. And I think  Google tends to think more about  the security aspect of it. And Apple  has been lately emphasizing the privacy  aspect of it. But both of those together  are a fantastic thing.  And I hope Tim talks about it  as much as he can. And I hope that  all the companies in the tech industry continue  to file these amicus briefs and those sorts of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  things. Did Google file an amicus  brief? I'm sure they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a lot of companies came all together  to file as one. And I believe  Google was part of that. So you  probably can guess how I feel personally about this.  So, you know, take  me with a grain of salt. Ron, how do you feel about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think everybody is in agreement.  Strong. Yeah, we  shouldn't have encryption. What a bad idea.  No, no encryption anywhere.  I agree.  And I'm in full agreement with the  president and law enforcement  that  a search warrant  should allow law enforcement to search  if there's  probable cause and a court orders it.  That's how it works in this country.  And until now  the human brain was the only place  exempt from that. The Fifth Amendment  said you can't be compelled to testify against  yourself. And courts deemed  that, well, that meant that, you know, we can't read your mind.  You can't  force, compel you, for instance, to give up a password  because that would be self-incrimination.  But the problem  is once encryption existed,  once public key crypto  became known, and it's a simple  concept that once  understood many, many coders  can write encryption routines. It's not hard.  That did change the equation.  And while  I understand why law enforcement  doesn't like that idea, there's nothing you can do about it at this point.  You can't  put the horse back in the barn.  Bad guys will have encryption.  And if you weaken  encryption in a misguided  attempt to make it  easier to do your job as law enforcement,  and I'm all for them doing their job as law  enforcement, the problem with that  is you weaken it for everybody.  And we know that from history.  This isn't even something we haven't  tried before.  We tried to block strong encryption exports.  And all it did was cause a security  problem which has lasted 20 years.  And has only now been kind of fixed.  The 40-bit SSL  browser.  So I think  there's not even any question  in anybody who's really dug into this.  I don't think there should be any question in anybody's mind.  And while the president wants compromise,  because he's a politician, and that's the art of politics,  is the art of compromise and negotiation  and working it out.  There's no compromising with the fact that the math  is out there.  I think it's just, it's done.  It's something you can do about it.  Alright, enough said.  It'll be very interesting to see what Tim Cook says.  This will be, like I said,  closing arguments for Apple on Monday.  Yep.  And I, while  no one knows, and we've even debated  whether he'll do this, I would be  shocked if he didn't take the first 15 minutes  of Apple's presentation.  To make that case as strong as he can.  Instagram wants to  do the same thing Facebook's been doing,  and Twitter has said it will do, which is to start  showing pictures  out of order.  What do you think about that?  Algorithmic feeds.  Ronna, are you a  pro or a con?  I'm a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not, I'm abstaining. I'm a non-Instagram  user, really.  You must use Twitter.  I don't really do Instagram or Facebook.  I do do Twitter, and  yeah, I mean I do Twitter with  like TweetDeck and all these crazy  stream Twitter apps.  So,  they don't pay attention to what Twitter does.  Well, I mean,  right, I want to see everything.  I really don't need you doing some weird  algorithm thing.  At least on Twitter, because that's  the point of that is kind of real time.  Instagram I  don't use, but I mean it's pictures.  I doubt anybody  feels as strongly about Instagram as they do  Twitter.  What do you think, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think people tend to be change  averse. Everybody was so  angry when Twitter changed from  stars to hearts, and now everybody's like  whatever, click the heart.  As long as they're  relatively reasonable about it, and things  don't show up from four years ago,  and they could start it out slow  and turn the dial up slowly.  It seems like  I wouldn't want to miss a great picture just  because I happen not to be online when it's streamed through.  So, power to you, Instagram.  Let's see what happens.  What they realized is that people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I kind of do this when I go to Instagram.  I go until I get to pictures I've seen  before, and they go, okay, I've seen everything.  But they realize most people don't do  that. They say, in fact, now on average,  70% of your feed people miss.  They go back a few pictures.  Twitter was the same problem. I never could  catch up with Twitter. That's  crazy talk.  But what you get used to is you go, well,  Twitter's not a  content feed  in which you try to read  the thing cover to cover. It's a  river of stuff that you dip into  ad hoc whenever you  have in the mood, and what you get is what you  get at that moment. On the other hand,  I kind of, so I didn't like the idea  of the chronological, of removing the chronological  feed  on Twitter, but actually in hindsight,  I think they did it well.  What you might have missed, and you could very quickly  get back to chronological, and I kind of like it.  So I've come around.  I'm a believer in the  modified feed. I don't know  about Facebook. Facebook's  so opaque as to what they're doing. See, Twitter  you kind of know. This is stuff you might have missed.  I presume  Instagram will be kind of like that. That's the way to do  it is say, hey, here's a few photos  from people you like that you might have  missed, and now back to your  feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, well Facebook's weird about how they do  that, and they charge for promotion  for stuff.  So there's like this weird conflict  of interest of how they do  their algorithm versus how they  extract money out of, I don't know,  big accounts and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, Facebook is just,  it's opaque, it's random. It doesn't,  and it's funny because  I think people who use Facebook are exactly the kind  of people who say, but I want to see all of  AntMod's posts in order. That's  why I'm on Facebook. I  want to know what my kids are up to.  Oh well.  Of all the people not to do  it, right.  Okay, I thought I could stir up  some controversy, but we're all in agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're all pretty  in agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not going to follow about that.  It's pictures.  It's fine.  Let's talk about Google in court.  Russia.  Google has lost  its appeal.  Google, as you know,  it's kind of complicated. Maybe Ron could explain it  better than I. Even though Android  is open source, and there is the Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Open AOSP  project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's Android without any Google stuff.  If you want to make an Android phone  with Google stuff, you have to include  all the Google stuff. Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, yeah. Usually it's  there's a package that you  kind of have to take of all the Google Play apps.  It's not all of them, but it's most of the  Google Play apps. Yeah.  And you have to give  preferential placement to  Google Search and  some other stuff.  You have to bundle pretty much all the  Google services. That always

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  struck me as fair.  Google gives away Android. Anybody can  build an Android phone that wants to. Look what  Amazon has done. They took the  Android source code,  customized it, modified it, put the  Amazon app store on it,  and shipped it out. Didn't cost them a penny.  And then if they  wanted to make an Android device that's Google  Android, which is what I think most users  want for a phone anyway,  you can include the Google app. I don't want to  buy a phone that doesn't have Google apps.  The Google app store or Google Search  or Google Maps. Wouldn't you want that?  Well, Yandex didn't want it. Yandex  is Google Search in Russia.  Google's competitor, search competitor  in Russia. And  they went to court  saying  that for Google to require  phone manufacturers  to put Google apps in  is monopolistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the courts agreed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they want the Play Store  without any of the extra  Google apps? Is that the ruling  here?  Because I mean, you  could just not take the Google apps like it's  optional. You don't have to take them at all.  Like Kindle.  Like it's, so the  They want

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  manufacturers to be able to cherry pick.  So they want a manufacturer  to make an Android phone and say, well, we'll put  Maps in but not App Store or  I want App Store but not Maps.  And that's, by the way, that's what the court  ruled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.  I feel like Google saw  this Microsoft thing happen  and then they designed Android specifically  to kind of get around that  kind of argument where here's the  source code. You can take it and do whatever you  want. And  I don't know, to have them still come back and  say that they  want to cherry pick from the Google  apps is weird. I mean,  they work together half the times.  You have to include Google Play services  because of that. Well, precisely.  It's not designed to be unbundled.  So I don't know how that's going to work. Google's going to have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  rewrite or something. And of course,  the larger concern is that the EU  may follow suit and they've made some noises  that they are considering that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the EU, they  have some serious like personal hatred  of Google over there. I don't know what's going  on with them. I don't like Google over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is funny because  Google isn't even close  to monopoly in the US. I can't remember  what the percentages is. Is it 70%?  60% of all services. Or 60 or something.  It's low. It's like 80% in Europe.  It's very high. They're much more of a monopoly in Europe.  I don't know why that is. I guess they don't like Bing  in France either. I don't know.  What is the other choice?  It's Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's Yandex. There's Baidu.  Ceznam.  DuckDuckGo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I understand if you're in China  that you would prefer a Chinese  search engine or Russia you would  prefer a Russian search engine.  I have no doubt in my mind  that they don't do as well as Google does.  And that furthermore, at least in those  two countries, they're probably heavily influenced by  government interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you see there was some article  I don't know, talking  about the Volkswagen  Defeat Device scandal  and sort of saying there appeared to be  a document leak  that was sort of saying  some members of that particular  part of the European Commission had met  with somebody who was on the lobbying  side.  And it was kind of like  the article that I read made it, and maybe  it's a rag blog that you  can't trust, but it sort of made it sound  like the  companies were able to discover how much  exactly they needed to give on  their exhaust emissions  you know, stuff.  You can justify that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, we want to negotiate.  We need to, how  far do we have to go? We'll do this, we'll talk behind  doors a little bit.  Google is adding support for Microsoft Office,  Facebook at work,  Slack,  to the single sign-on.  I don't understand that. Is it Google  that has to do that, or those guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that have to do that? Yeah, I thought it was the other way around.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is, oh, I guess  this is two Google apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can use...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you're using Google apps for work, you can use  Google as identity provider.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't understand life.  It's all beyond me.  It's too... Yeah, no, Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  apps for... Is it called  apps for work now? Whatever. Yeah, apps for work.  The pay for glass thing is its own...  It's kind of its own little box with  like this crazy extra dashboard that  I've tried to figure out a couple times  to make stuff like  Android for work function,  and it's... In the same way  that Exchange is like hard  to manage, this is like its own crazy  life form  that you kind of have to deal with.  I don't know. Google apps is hard.  A lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're the admin. If you're not the admin,  then life is good. Well, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're not the admin, then you go, I don't understand  why I have to use my... I can't use  my Gmail account with the...  I don't... It's confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it's great.  As long as you're not the admin. As long as you have  some dude who's your full-time admin,  that's great. We have Russell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Russell does that.  Russell has flipped the switch so  for instance, I can use Inbox  with my apps account as opposed to...  Nice. Yeah.  It's still not...  I understand why Google hasn't fixed this.  Jeff's always complaining about,  as you know, Matt,  about the  separation between his private  personal Google account and his apps  email and how come he can't use his apps  email for a lot of the things he uses his personal email for,  blah, blah, blah.  And I guess it must be a hard computer science  problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a fair criticism and I truthfully don't know  what the inside story on that is, but  it makes me feel like  there must be some extra work to integrate  with the Google apps for work and then  individual products are like, oh, we'll get to that  later, whereas it feels like  somewhere years and years ago, someone  should have done the engineering so that  that worked by default for all accounts,  including apps accounts.  And now maybe the genie is out of the bottle  and it's too hard to get back in or something.  I don't know exactly what the reason...  Although, okay, if you're the administrator  and you're not a tech savvy person  or a startup, then you do sometimes  want to control how quickly you get updates  and when functionality update  happens and maybe you're in a regulated  industry. And so there are some  arguments for things moving slower and not  surprising you with  web downloads and here's this  feature it just turned on, but I think  more of the complaints I hear  are of Jeff's variety where they wish  apps accounts would work better.  I hear that from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Google apps end users always seem to hate  that. I totally get this  slower, oh, it needs to be slower and more  stable and your  admin guy has to, you know,  control all of this, but  the users always seem to be really mad about it.  Why can't I do this new thing with  my Google apps account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you can, for instance,  they just added like a  switch that the admin can throw that lets  you use inbox with  your Google apps email, but your  administrator has to give permission, you know.  But that was huge.  I was really glad when that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how long ago did inbox come out?  That was like, I don't know, it's been a couple  of years, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  say apparently now you can use  the web replies, the email replies  on the web version of inbox.  Oh, I use those all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the time. Yeah.  People don't understand. They say, Leo, you're so  terse these days.  But they're always...  Actually, there's an example of artificial intelligence  being really cool and it's probably very stupid  artificial intelligence, but  it's really nice because what it does is looks at the  email and then offers three choices  of what your likely response would be.  Yeah, write on, let's do it, or...  And it's often very colloquial.  No way, I don't want to do that.  And then you pick that and your email  is answered.  I love it. It's legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like legit artificial intelligence.  There was like a Google research paper about it  and everything. My favorite  story is they did the inbox  smart reply and it would want to reply  I love you to every single message.  Which is kind of nice.  Like it searched some kind of database  of people talking and determined that  that was a good response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what people say to each other the most  is I love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But not to your boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now you know  why my emails to you  Jason Clantus are always so quick  and snappy. I wish Facebook Messenger  would have this feature.  Or Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you tell Jason that you love him often enough?  All the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That and cat pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Automated cat pictures.  The best thing to ever happen.  Actually speaking of inbox  we talked to on Monday  we had a triangulation.  I don't know if you know Jeffrey Knapp.  He was one of the guys behind  Priority Inbox.  He also did Hangouts.  And he's now at Google Ventures and he wrote a book called  Sprint. Talking about  have you ever done a sprint? The Google Ventures sprint?  It's a five day process.  Where they set a goal  on day one and it was a team of  seven people.  It's a really cool process where  they get to a prototype  and testing by day five.  Are you familiar with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've gotten to do an early  version of the sprint. There's two authors  on that book. John and Jake. I forget.  I think I did it with Jake. And Braden too.  Yes, sorry. Yes.  Three. And it's pretty cool.  Because in a course of five days  I try to come up with  interesting solutions.  It's worth checking out.  The book just came out. I was very impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  While I will never  do it because I'm far  too disorganized.  I thought, but this seems like a good  idea. Somebody ought to do this.  Not us. Not me anyway.  But it looked  like fun too actually which is kind of cool.  So if you didn't see Triangulation this week, it's a  good one to watch.  I've done a sprint with Jake. So you know Jake.  I mean Jeffrey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're acquaintances. I wouldn't say  best friends. But yeah, we've talked to each other.  It's funny because they're both really tall.  So if you're like  oh yeah, you're Jake  John on Jake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jake Knapp,  John Zyrowski and Braden Kowitz  were the three who  worked on that sprint technology.  Google's interesting that way because I have a feeling  there's a lot of interesting processes  that are used by various teams to  get to these solutions  in a timely, efficient fashion.  Engineers love process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And in fact,  if you haven't seen a book by  Laszlo Bock,  it's called Work Rules. Laszlo  is the head of human resources  at Google and or people  operations, whatever you want to call it. And  I would say page for page,  pound for pound, that book has more  insights about. Oh, I remember that. Yes.  Yeah. The experimentation that Google's  done on a lot of different why teams work  and how to make things work  well. And Laszlo is a fantastic guy  in general. So if  you pick that up and just open it to any random page,  that will probably  be a pretty useful page for you  or at least interesting about why  they decided to do things that way.  It's a pretty good book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remind me,  Jason, to book him for triangulation.  That would be a good triangulation guest.  We'll do. See if we can get Laszlo on the show.  Yeah. People  operations. He's head of people operations.  Yes.  Oh, I  love it. Are you excited about Silicon Valley  coming back? You can find out what's  really going on at Google.  That should be so fun. We had

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so on Sunday, I don't know if you saw,  but David Pogue

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  was on Twitter. And  David, of course, is at Yahoo  for as long as there is a Yahoo  running their tech  vertical, tech.yahoo.com.  But he came to us. He was at Austin in  South by Southwest. And he came to us from the roof of the W,  except the way he was seated,  it looked like he was in prison. But so  then he panicked around and it was clear he was on a roof  with a pool. And I said, you look like  you're in Hooli in the rooftop  offices of Hooli where they put people  who they don't want to fire,  but they don't want to  have anything for them to do. So they just sit there up  on the roof and then after a  couple hours, maybe let's go have lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Resting and investing. David's laughter  was pained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Slightly pained.  What is this project Google's up to  in Mountain View?  Google's project...  It's the new campus. The new campus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that the new campus? Okay, yeah. I thought they got  turned down on this.  Is this going to be a real thing that exists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they had to change the design.  The campus with the tent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, they were trying  to get, if I remember right, they were trying to get  enough space approved  by the city. And  some of it went to LinkedIn.  So Google ended up  not being able to build the crazy  spiderweb city that  they had envisioned originally.  So now there's...  But this is a littler one.  Yeah. It doesn't look quite

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like a spiderweb either, but... And by the way, not a tent.  It's a photovoltaic integrated  canopy skin. Pardon me.  Yeah. Yeah, that. Come on.  You want to work there, Matt? You know you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That looks... The slideshow  is pretty fun. You know, some of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  rooms look neat. It is.  What's... So this  is the revised  campus. Yeah, that'd be cool.  But this is just one building instead of like a whole  massive... Yeah, there  were going to be three buildings in that. It looked like a biodome  before.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So does this keep all of the  things that they were originally talking about?  Where like it's a modular design and they're going to have some kind of  robot that's going to move  walls around and  re-shift areas to match  whatever a given team  needs? This was the  original one, as you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It had three buildings  under it.  Right.  It really looks like a scene from  Under the Dome, actually, is what it looks like.  So they had to... The new plans  now are, as you said,  more traditional flat  glass walls, but they still have the tent  on the... I'm sorry.  What am I saying? The photovoltaic  canopy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need to come up with an acronym so it's spelled  tent, but still has... Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry. It's the PICS,  the photovoltaic integrated  canopy skin. The thermal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  enclosure northern something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Thermal enclosure.  Neutral. Neutral

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  tent. Is it still see-through? It just  looks like a funny shaped  roof now in the middle. Yeah.  It doesn't look quite as cool. It's so thick now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it must be see-through because they have  trees inside. They have...  Here's the roller dome. I don't know  what that is. No, see,  they have greenery and some kind of  vegetable stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is this?  Is that... Do you  have that in Google yet? The push cart with  vegetables?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They try a lot of  cool experiments at Google. I'm not saying  they would wheel key around... The kale cart's here!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anybody want any kale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who wants some appetizer kale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want some kale! The cart's here.  Some kale shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the old renders, they had people farming  outside the building. Oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what you do though when you get to be  like... Oh, see, in the  distance there's two more  biodomes. So,  you're right, it was three different structures. See these  two in the background? This is the old plan.  Oh, man.  Gosh darn LinkedIn. You ruined  our whole thing.  Charleston East.  This will be called.  That's the old campus on the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  left. If we could agree on some  building standards where you could dock  the buildings together, the building could  join our professional network at

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google. They have those.  They had that in Japan.  The  hotel that would... You could  press a button and a robot  arm would come and move your room to  another part of the hotel.  Do you know about that?  No, that's awesome.  I think it was like a thing in the 60s  or  70s.  But I don't...  It was like some sort of modular hotel.  But it was like normal sized rooms.  Yeah, there it is. Here it is.  The Capsule Hotel.  No, that's not  it. Let's see.  It was a Japan...  I can't find it. I read  a wonderful medium piece, a photographer  who  stayed there.  He scared his girlfriend because he  found out that you could press a button requesting  a move, which costs money,  and then cancel it.  But the arm will come  and your room will start shaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it won't cost you anything.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, the chat room is listing out  possible acronyms like thermal  entropy networked tent, thermal  enclosure, not tent. I like it recursive

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  where it has a tent in the word  tent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it looks like these plans are actually  for a different location, not  the original. The original  thing was going to be a North Bay  shore. I don't know if they're still...  They're not actually doing any of this  yet. This is like just some guy drawing stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They gotta get Mountain View to agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then that's the plans have gone in.  So, yeah, there you go.  This is their whole landscape plan  and layout of the buildings,  everything.  They submitted the entire plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You gotta do this. If Apple's gonna have  the spaceship and Facebook  has the whatever that is, unfinished...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The spaceship is under construction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're gonna finish. Oh, they're close to done.  They'll be done next year. In fact, we're  thinking that, you know, they just put  the roof on the  theater that they're gonna have events in.  We're thinking that Apple will start having events there  maybe for the iPhone 8  in the fall of next year.  Thermally effective  negative taxonomy, I believe.  We call that.  Google, actually,  this is I'm sure one that you're up on, Matt,  will start ranking mobile-friendly sites  even higher  come this May. What does that mean?  Well, there's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  link in the rundown towards the  bottom where you can click to the  mobile test.  But basically, it's, you know,  things that you would think would be kind of  common sense, you know.  You're not using images that are too big.  It's got a whole checklist.  And so you can type in any  URL and it will tell you whether your  website is mobile-friendly or not. So you can  type in google.com. And in fact,  I think they had just  done some extra work to make sure that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we're mobile-friendly. Does that mean mobile-responsive?  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That helps a lot.  It's like a bunch of different  things down a checklist that it looks for.  And in fact, there's documentation  on the mobile-friendly test page  where it sort of talks about mobile SEO  and those kinds of things. So you can sort of say  responsive web design.  Hey! I win!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Our page is mobile-friendly.  In fact, here's how it looks on a mobile.  Isn't that nice?  This is a nicely done  I'm sorry. This was going to be your thing.  I just realized this was going to be your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. It's totally fine.  I've actually got another one I was going to do  anyway. But what's nice about this  is last year,  they started to  they basically said this is a little  another gentle nudge to point people  towards being mobile-friendly. And it should be completely  logical at this point that mobile is  huge at this point. So just like  with Sitespeed or SSL,  now we're going to give a little bit. We had been  giving a boost. It'll probably be just a little bit  more of a boost for sites that are  mobile-friendly. So if you've been thinking about it  and wondering, are these phones  really going to take off?  Maybe it's time to  mobile things are fad.  We're going to go straight to VR.  But maybe  take a little while and optimize for mobile before  you go for VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good. I'm thrilled to see that we're  mobile-friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I tried Ars Technica  and we passed too. I have no one to  yell at. So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three for three. We're good.  Well, it should be  three for three. You're including Google.com.  That's all the internet you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, Ars Technica, and  Leo's site. That makes  it everything you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all you'd ever need.  Very nice.  Let's see.  What else? Go ahead. I don't know if you saw this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  thing on the YouTube creator blog about  blurring objects in your videos.  Growing up in Kentucky, I of course  loved the television show Cops.  Oh yeah, the perps always

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  had blurred faces, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or the people behind  the perp.  So now that functionality  is available to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could do that in the web browser?  I believe so.  Yeah, and it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just like a you draw a square  and that square stays permanently blocked.  It's object tracking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, that's pretty sophisticated.  This is another thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's got to be AI-powered  behind the scenes somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's showing up everywhere.  That's really neat.  Although I hate videos where there's  things blurred out in the background.  But if you're a YouTube creator,  you don't want to have a brand in the background  that didn't give permission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you failed to get permission,  now instead of having to spend an hour doing  something, you do like three seconds and suddenly  you're in much better shape.  I think it'd be fun to just  play with that a little bit, start blurring  random things on the videos and see if people notice.  See if you can do some hijinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was kind of stunned  at Steve Chen's remarks.  He was the creator of YouTube  at South by Southwest.  I never knew this. I remember  talking to Steve before he sold to Google  in the very earliest days of YouTube. He never  revealed that when he first started  YouTube, it was supposed to be a place  where singles could upload videos  talking about what they were looking for.  It was a dating app!  What they were looking for in a partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What a perfect name though. YouTube?  It's like if you're dating, this is me,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is you. This is me, this is you,  this is me and you together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What? Explains the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Glad to see that Steve's hair  is no less unruly  than it was before he was a billionaire.  Steve and Chad,  that's so cool. They have a new site.  Actually,  it's a Steve's site called  Nom Nom. Or Nom, just Nom.  And it  wants to harness  the hive mind for better cooking.  That makes sense.  Looks like Pinterest. I don't know  what it is.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's all videos about food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Food videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve's like me. One good idea  and we're just looking at different ways to slice it.  How many different round table shows can I do?  This actually looks pretty good.  So it's kind of YouTube for food.  And recipes.  Actually, I'm into food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a lot of geeks who need help with cooking.  And there's a lot of people out there  who enjoy Top Chef  and all those kinds of things.  That sounds kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Food Network is absolutely addictive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a perfect segue to the next story  down the row a little bit.  Twitch is now giving  Julia Child.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Julia Child channel on Twitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, here's how  we take a chicken and cut it into  quarters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is definitely  before my time.  The thing they did before this was Bob Ross.  And that was pretty cool because he's a chill guy  in pain and it's interesting.  That was really neat.  It's just cool to see him paint.  But this, I don't know, you don't get to eat the food afterwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I grew up watching this show,  The French Chef.  It was really the first  cooking show on PBS  and she was a very  unlikely superstar.  I met her. She's very tall.  Was very tall.  And every bit is kind of kooky  as she came across. This is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's great is it's very, very live.  There's no... I mean, things happen.  She stuck a  spoon in a mixer  last night and it went flying across the set.  You've been watching it all day, huh?  I was watching it last night.  She was making some sort of orange butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's totally not a... because nobody

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  knew about cooking shows. She invented it.  I'm purposely hiding the comment section because  there's a lot of stuff coming up that's weird, but it's interesting to  watch. A lot of  the younger audience are like,  whoa, this is so cool.  What is that?  Why is the video black and white?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This with Twitch chat  has got to be the best thing ever. Come on.  I'm not showing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What kind of a filter is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ZXX Pro?  The thing everybody uses now on Twitch is  these avatars that are people's heads.  Like there's a Bob Ross head.  And I imagine there'll be a Julian  Childhead eventually.  I don't get that.  So do you see all the heads going by?  Do you understand that?  Jason, you're a young person.  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Young person on set  would be this person right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, you know what it is? It's a culture.  It's a subculture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is the thing, like they announced  YouTube gaming.  Twitch has  all of this culture stuff.  That YouTube gaming is not going to have.  That's where the community is.  But yeah, all of those emotes,  they're emotes and they mean  something.  They all mean some kind of emotion.  The one everybody does  is Kappa, which is  some guy's head. He's like a Twitch  developer and he's making kind of a  sarcastic face. So that's for sarcasm.  And there's a million  other ones. Yeah, if you, I think,  if you really want to get into it, you can  mouse over it probably and you'll get,  you should get maybe  a tool tip. That's the what?  That's the what face. You can look it up  and yeah, there's baby rage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that one's the what face.  It's just its own set of the Kramer.  The Kramer one, they call  that the PogChamp.  Right.  I know what Pogs are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  PogChamp is, it's a  guy and there's a video somewhere. There  was like a YouTube video of a guy making that  expression and the Twitch staff  thought it was funny so they just cut his head out  and stuck it in there. I feel so old.  But yeah, you can, you can, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  your meme. Go, go look it up. Yeah, but it's  what happens, it's what happened in the Apple H's. When  you cut people off from  the rest of the world for  a hundred years, they develop their own language.  And that's  what's happened on Twitch. These are people who never

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  get outside anymore. I don't know what  you mean. What are you talking about?  That's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wrong. That's so wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the Appalachia of the internet is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no.  But what's amazing is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll watch

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have lost Metpets.  Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will watch Hearthstone streams a lot  and they have their own probably, right?  There's this one girl, it's  Eloise, so she's Chinese  and has ended up learning  most of her English through  Twitch chat. Oh, wow.  So she has kind of been raised  and brought up into the English language  through the internet's like worst  possible filter of English.  And it's pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is wild. Although, frankly  if you are on Imgur  every day and then you go away for like  three days, you come back and  there's like four new things you've completely  missed out on. Oh, memes, they move too fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The good news is  they don't stand on the shoulders of each other.  They're all kind of this separate thing  and it goes away in a few days or months  or whatever. I mean, you could still  to this day say what color is the dress  and people will know what you're talking about.  But that's rare. Most of these just  kind of, you're not  in other words, you can join at any time.  It's kind of like Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're like, what is Batman doing  at 2.30 in the morning on a third Tuesday?  You can look it up on Know Your Meme and you'll find out.  There's no culture there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So have you tried yet  the pay by voice Google thing  that you guys are doing  in Silicon Valley only  and in fact only at McDonald's  and Pizza Place?  I think it's more

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  than just McDonald's now.  So yeah, I had been helping with the testing  of that and it was pretty awesome.  Okay, so we don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here, this is what I've read.  You go up and you're at McDonald's  you got your order of fries and your Big Mac  and shake and you go, I'll pay with Google.  And then what?  What does the clerk say?  What's your PIN?  What's your initials?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or what's your name?  And you say what your name is.  I don't know what the latest incarnation is  that's been public.  And that's all?  Yeah, or your picture or something like that.  So they can look and they can see your picture  and then maybe they disambiguate with your name  or your initials.  So what is the clerk seeing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A picture of you?  Yes.  So the clerk is doing the validation.  The clerk is seeing your picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well no, your phone is validation too, right?  They have a Bluetooth sensor or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's actually a lot of wizardry that happens behind the scenes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's more than just a picture of you and I know my name.  Oh, a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The nice thing is  it uses the proximity APIs  that are sort of underneath the hood.  So your phone knows that you're at this location.  So it's kind of like pay by square used to be.  Yeah, a little bit.  If you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it used...  If I had pay by square on my phone  and I would open it  and then I would walk into the coffee shop  and we had one down the street  by geo-fencing it would know that I was in the coffee shop.  My picture would pop up on the iPad  that the clerk was using  and that would be it.  And they'd say, you're Leo, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think the technology is maybe slightly different  and slightly more accurate under the hood.  Well, that was the problem with the geo-fencing was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  two stores next to each other  couldn't use pay by square.  You had to separate them enough  so that you would...  But this is better than geo-fencing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, stuff like...  There's a lot of ways that you can actually know  that two devices are near each other  and some of that stuff I think has become public.  Is it Bluetooth LE or is it beaconing?  I don't know how much...  It's secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So your options,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can give you options.  It's going to be either the Bluetooth beacon stuff  or the ultrasonic pulses  from your phone speaker  that's picked up by a microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We've seen people use that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, that's in nearby for the Chromecast.  That's about it.  That's about it.  Yeah.  Is it one of those?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I assume you could do technology like that.  Yeah.  Okay, so the latest Penny Arcade...  Have you ever seen Penny Arcade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, love Penny Arcade. Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because they actually have...  They talk about something like this  in the latest comic strip.  They basically say when you try to pay with your phone  and it works, you know, and they've got one panel  that's like the guy is like super sexy  with a leather jacket and glasses  and then they go when it doesn't work so good  and then, you know, everything's going wrong.  That's going wrong. So I don't know if you can find that  Penny Arcade comic, but it's the most recent one.  And when it works with just paying with your phone,  you know, at the Walgreens, you're like,  ah, this is fantastic.  And when you pay with your voice, you're just like,  it feels so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then if you pay with Samsung Pay,  people go, wait a minute, come back here and give me money.  Yeah, how did that happen?  How did that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So like that...  What weirds me out about this Google thing is it like  it requires that you train the register, the cashier,  on how to do this.  And it's like, I don't know, you want to train all the cashiers  in the world, I guess, on this new payment thing  when... that sounds really hard to me.  Like, what was it, the one Samsung Pay guy got...  got the cops called on him?  Because I thought he was hacking the terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody...  So Samsung Pay will do tap to pay,  but they also have... they'll create a magnetic field  that takes... that works with a swipe card reader  and looks as if you've swiped a card, but you haven't.  So imagine the clerk's reaction,  because this would work anywhere.  You don't have to be trained.  It would work anywhere that they have a card reader  when you go like this and say, I've paid.  Pay no attention. I've paid.  Here's a guy going to use it.  This is how it's supposed to work according to Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like, Samsung Pay kind of works everywhere,  even on this zank you know thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who wants to pay with his phone?  Who wants to pay with my phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't look at the cameras, Mike.  You ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watch me.  Boom.  Boom!  Boom!  Samsung Pay is here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how Samsung says it's supposed to work.  They don't show them getting arrested  and dragged off to prison.  But, okay, so do you think this Google thing will become...  What's it called? Pay with Google? Pay with Magic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they've sort of been calling it Pay with Google.  So in the blog post they do say they use Bluetooth,  low energy Wi-Fi and location services on your phone.  So that much they've said publicly.  That's perfect.  And I have to admit, so I've used it at McDonald's.  Not admit, I have to say, you would think  some random guy at McDonald's would not be that interested  in learning how to take a new form of payment,  but it worked flawlessly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he has the software on his screen.  I mean, that's one of the reasons that works compared to Samsung Pay  where you don't have to know anything about it for it to work.  It's on his terminal and it pops up.  The app is called Google Hands Free,  and I didn't install it until I realized that I'll never be going to McDonald's  in Silicon Valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, it's only in one city,  so don't go to your local McDonald's and try to make this work  because it's not going to...  And Papa John's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Papa John's.  But if you're in the South Bay,  there is this awesome ice cream shop called Tin Pot Creamery,  and I think Hands Free gets you like five or ten bucks free there.  What?  Like, use that.  It is really good ice cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now Amazon has patented, and I don't know if this will go anywhere,  but has patented pay by selfie.  So, and what happens there is you actually have a gesture  that, take your pick,  that is your motion or gesture that proves it's you.  So that's like your new pin code is...  Or, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's better than a fingerprint.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It probably is.  I hate to tell you.  Who knows how good those fingerprints actually are,  and I can tell you it's a lot better than the sign with its stylus,  which nobody even checks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to hear Google's plan for like adoption on this pay with Google thing,  though, because it sounds like you need special software  and some kind of beacon thing that fires the signal out to your selfie.  It's probably similar to the pay with Square thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they did very well.  I mean, I thought they got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've seen such...  I feel like we've seen such hard adoption problems with NFC already  when that's just a terminal box that you buy and plug in  and will work with pretty much every register  to go and say you need to run the software on your register system  so that the picture pops up or whatever.  Sounds really hard to kind of get out to everyone.  That's what's great about Samsung Pay.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True.  And to be fair, to Google, they say it's an experiment.  So they're not rolling it out worldwide.  They're testing it to see how it works.  All I know is I get $5 off when I buy tin pot creamery,  and I'm like, yeah, I'm a fan of that payment system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now that you've explained how it works,  it's not as puzzling as it was to us last week  where we thought, well, the only authentication is I say my initials.  But as I understand now, it's sensing the phone.  It actually sounds like it's probably fully secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you can come up with a better experience,  then maybe you'll be able to get the adoption.  But Ron, I completely agree.  There's a lot of friction there that would have to be overcome.  The nice thing is with Apple Pay,  there's a lot more people thinking about possibilities of how to do payment.  And maybe even some of the places that weren't as intrigued before  are now like, oh, OK, people are actually paying at their Walgreens  with their phone.  We need to start paying attention to this  and figure out what a good purchase experience looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't look like that Penny Arcade wizard.  I like that.  Thank you for pointing my way to that comic.  That was pretty...  I feel like that wizard most of the time.  We showed it, didn't we?  Let me pull it back up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I showed it, but Ron was talking about something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When you try to pay with your phone and it works,  that's a very attractive thing you just did.  Yes, I know.  It's very powerful technology.  And I am at the helm.  When it will not work so good,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it would appear my magical wand has phallished me.  Mayhap the mystic weave is thin in your strange realm.  Pray tell, how many paper faces do you require?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And obviously the woman is not so impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm that guy.  See, I've been using Samsung Pay as much as I can.  Do you use it with the swipe machines?  Yeah, I use it all over town.  And what do people say?  A lot of people look at me like, we don't take Apple Pay.  I'm like, OK, it's not an Apple.  First of all, Apple doesn't make a curved phone.  And then I'm like, it's cool.  And I pull it up in front of it.  It's cool. It's going to work.  And it works.  They don't think you're hacking them?  No, and then I'll show them on screen.  I'm like, it shows my credit card.  It shows the last four.  So they can target all the last four.  I should start using this.  Last four, please.  And the great thing is on the Samsung phones,  once you activate it, it lives as a little tab  on the bottom of your window.  I'd show it, but I don't have a camera point that way.  But you just swipe up from your home button.  You just swipe up while your screen's locked.  And it says, do you want to pay with Samsung?  And you enter your thumb or your pin to activate it.  And then it starts pulsing to let you know it's sending the signal.  Hold it there, and then it'll vibrate to let you know it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they give me three choices on this.  Oops.  Oh, crap.  Now I'm getting an ad.  To make payments with Samsung Pay,  select Samsung Pay as your default mobile payment.  So you can't use Android Pay and Samsung Pay simultaneously.  But you could say use...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, because Samsung Pay wants to take over the NFC chip too, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, okay.  So you have to choose one or the other.  All right.  And then you could say, if your app supports tap and pay,  use the app that's open so I can have Android Pay open  and use Android Pay with tap to pay.  Or I should just use Samsung Pay, right?  Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you could also use Google Wallet if you have the Google Wallet credit card  and you enter it as a Google Wallet card.  What ever happened to Google Wallet?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, all right, since you're leading the way, Jason, I'm going to try this from now on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, like I said, I think it's fun.  Oh yeah, I see Google Wallet.  Yeah, I think it's great and it works great.  And, you know, Jerry, my partner, who's a diehard Apple fan,  you know, he says straight out that is so much better than Apple Pay.  How about that, folks?  Because the times he's tried to use Apple Pay, you know, you go to Luchese's deli,  they're like, no, we haven't updated our Xon machine.  I'm surprised they haven't updated their machine.  Yeah, but they don't have to with Samsung Pay.  You get to use new technology with their old technology  and it works every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a new person.  I don't know where my wallet is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing that gets me, the thing that gets me about those little credit card machines is like,  if you're bored in line, Google the model number on the front of the credit card machine  and see how much it costs.  Or is it Best Buy the other day and the thing that they had was like $1400  for this stupid machine that reads it.  The machine?  Yeah, yeah, the little box that you type into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they have to do it because if they don't, whoever is the least secure pays for fraud.  Yeah.  So that's kind of a strong incentive to get it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no reason why those should have to cost that much either.  That's a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give me a Nexus 7, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't most people just rent them?  I mean, do people really buy them outright?  I'd be surprised if they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At that price, I'd assume they probably just, they pay monthly fee with their bank.  The credit card bill, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're already paying through the nose for the credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then Square just came out with the new Contactless.  If you ever had a Square, I carry one on me all the time.  You mean like the thing that you swipe with?  A little dongle.  Yeah, they now have an NFC Contactless pay Square you can get from them.  And people can use any of the Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Android Pay with Square.  So if you use Square at the store or, like I said, I carry one in my pocket.  When I used to sell things, I'd just pull it out and be like, here you go.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't find, I got to find a credit card that supports Samsung Pay.  That's the other problem is a lot of credit card companies are nervous about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they were slow to roll out at first.  I tried mine the first week it came out and it was nothing happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bank of America doesn't work.  Let me see if anybody else does here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, when I.O. happens, hopefully I'll get to try this Pay with Google thing.  Oh yeah, they got to use it at I.O., right?  Yeah, since we'll all be in town.  I'm sure they'll have some kind of demonstration or something.  McDonald's or Papa John's already set up a little booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm telling you, Tim, off-premery.  So Matt, are you excited about I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I know. Tim, pot creamer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it'll be really good.  Yeah, but doing it at Shoreline, Amphitheater will be different.  Tell us how they're going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why are we doing it at Shoreline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Explain how they're going to do that because that's not a venue with seminar rooms like Moscone is.  It's just a theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not. And this is purely personal speculation.  I have no idea whatsoever.  But Moscone always got full and always sold out in like 20 minutes.  And Shoreline, you've got enough room where you can have the keynote.  And then I have no idea whether they're actually going to do this.  But it would be neat if you'd let the developers peel off and break out  and go visit various folks at Google because that's where the Googleplex is, is all around.  Yeah, and we kind of saw it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe they'd have autonomous vehicles come and ferry you to that part of the Googleplex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we're hoping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Sure, we have enough autonomous vehicles for everybody.  How far is it to Shoreline?  So there's the Shoreline, Amphitheater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see they have a big lawn, but the lawn is sloping.  It's not like you'd set up tables on the lawn and then there's an auditorium.  So that's really going to be for the keynote only.  I would expect so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can walk from Shoreline to the Google offices.  We've done that many times.  And in fact, as you zoom out, basically every building you see is a Google office.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they can just take over that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As far as the eye can see.  Google is north of 101.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which one has the semi-autonomous canopy tent environment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thermal electron-nuclear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Google I.O. cannot be contained by any building.  So they just did it outside in the amphitheater.  Is that the plan?  I don't know what we're going to do with Google I.O. now  since they announced Android N, where it's just going to be drinking and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Matt might know.  Is there anything you want to talk about, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what the topics are going to be, but they're always looking for...  For example, in search, they're like maybe they'll talk about AMP,  or drink, or progressive web apps, or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I wonder if there'll be some Pixel C information.  I'd love to see more...  Because I really love the Pixel C.  I think some more robust support could be good.  It's May 18th to the 20th.  We have two invitations.  So two of our...  Intrepid reporters.  Intrepid reporters, thank you.  Jason Howell and a player to be named later will be going.  I'm not sure, but I think we're going to have a cage match to see who gets the other one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've drawn straws for the cage match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're doing the lottery again this year.  So I don't... Let's see, the lottery...  Oh, it ended. You had until March 10th to get in the lottery.  And then they're going to announce...  They're announcing soon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People are sending...  Yeah, people have been getting results. I've seen a few.  I've seen a few disappointed posts out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They claim it doesn't go by the order of which you put in your entry.  No, it doesn't. No. It's random, right?  So you could have done it at exactly one minute after, or you could do it 10 hours later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the only way to do it, because you don't want to only allow people who have fast fingers to get it.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who are motivated and up early.  Yeah. That's just not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Leo, I don't know if you've seen the breaking news, but there's this competition called Pwn to Own.  Yes.  Where it...  Apparently it's going on right now.  Cansec West. Yeah.  Yeah, it's going on right now. And it looks like Safari has fallen twice, maybe?  And then somebody used Flash and a Windows kernel bug.  So Safari down twice, Windows maybe down once.  It looks like so far Chrome is eluding people, and it looks like so far VMware Workstation has not been hacked.  So interesting day.  It is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, Google has upped the reward to $100,000 for hacking in Chromebook or Chrome OS, because it's so robust.  And I don't imagine they're actually doing Chrome OS at Pwn to Own.  The rules at Pwn to Own are essentially...  You have to...  You're challenged to hack...  Let me see if I can find the rules here. I have them in front of me somewhere.  You're challenged to hack a computer with a standard install.  Actually, you're usually hacking the browser, right? So it would be Safari, Opera, Internet Explorer, Chrome.  And you get to win the computer that it's on if you do it.  And I think they've added a cash prize now to it, which I have mixed feelings about because it's so...  Now people are coming up with zero days and holding on to them so they can win Pwn to Own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, Facebook is paying more for bug bounties. Google is paying a lot more for bug bounties.  And so, you know, I don't think there's that many people that are holding on.  The prizes that I'm seeing are $80,000, $60,000, and $40,000 have been won.  And those are large amounts of money.  But a lot of people can also make that money by just disclosing, you know, out of the normal cycle.  And paying for those vulnerabilities, I think, makes everybody much more secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chrome's offering $65,000, Microsoft $65,000, Flash and Edge $60,000.  Apple's offering $40,000 for Safari.  And you get more points, I guess, for the harder stuff.  13 points for VMware Workstation.  And you only get three points for Target Sandbox Escape.  So, yeah, this is interesting.  So the only one that's not fallen so far is Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I saw somewhere a tweet, like it's literally going on right now.  I saw some tweet that somebody was saying that somebody's trying their fourth attempt on Chrome.  I think the Chrome team normally does their security updates right before bone to bone, you know,  and closes all the known vulnerabilities.  So it's, you know, it's a fun time.  It's like the Super Bowl of cracking, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you don't think it promotes somebody coming up with zero days and holding onto them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They might hold onto them, but it at least promotes them coming forward with them.  And I think that's the most important thing.  I don't want them to be locked away in a government vault or some spy agency or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, it's in everybody's interest that these flaws get exposed.  Yeah, and then fixed.  And then fixed. Yeah.  So, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a shame that there's no phones on here.  It seems to all be like desktop operating systems and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder how easy it is to hack a phone these days.  FBI can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I know Google has a there's there's Android security bounties, just like there are.  Of course, there should be a bunch of other operating systems.  It exists, but there's just there's no there's no contest for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, if you could hack an iPhone, I think you can make a lot more money than you could make at Pondone.  You can sell that to governments or, you know, let people install things on the App Store and root their phone.  So I think the rules for this contest are you have to disclose the hole that you found.  Right.  Absolutely should be that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They might know the score so far after round three from the zero day initiative, official Pondone.  Twitter Vulcan team has already won 13 points and $80,000.  Junghoon Lee, who won last year, I think a big prize, $60,000.  The Tencent security team, $40,000.  No money for Team Sniper from Tencent.  That was Team Shield that won money or Tencent sent three teams or Sean Wu.  No money there.  So there it is so far.  Trend Micro and Hewlett Packard Enterprise as sponsors of the zero day initiative Pondone at Cansec West.  Three rounds so far, but the action continues.  If you're curious, I mean, how exciting can this be to watch hackers attempt to break into a system?  Here's a thrilling image from the real time excitement that is Pondone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not as exciting as a ghost screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's more fun to watch it go.  Anyway, if you follow Zero Day Initiative at THEZDI, you can see what's going on.  That's fun. That's cool.  That's really thank you, Matt, for bringing that up.  I forgot that was today.  I think it continues again tomorrow too.  I think it's over two days.  And this time it's at South By.  It's not in Vancouver.  It's because Trend Micro kind of took it over.  Yeah.  And it's so it's at South By, which actually makes it makes it more fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pondone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's take a break.  Come back with picks, tips, anything you want to share with us.  This is always fun to have Matt Cutts on and Ronim Audio.  I appreciate you guys taking some time with us this afternoon.  Love doing it with you.  Our show today brought to you by something you'll probably both be familiar with Atlassian.  Everybody who writes software probably knows about Atlassian.  They're amazing.  Jira is the way to assign, track and manage tasks for any project.  No matter how complex we use Jira designing the website, our web team in Austin would, you know,  we would write user stories and get them up on the Jira board and they would they would work on it.  In fact, if you ever saw Silicon Valley, they're using essentially a Jira style workflow where you have a bit by bit.  You chisel away at a problem.  Jira is really phenomenal for doing this.  And it's especially for distributed teams because, you know, somebody's working on it in Austin.  We got to review it in Petaluma and Jira makes it easy for everybody.  It's all web based.  Our engineering team uses Confluence.  That's what we use to document equipment and work processes.  And Jira can be used to to manage vendors.  That's how we kind of managed our web design.  HipChat is what we use all the time.  We're all in Atlassian here for everything from planning events to keeping track of engineering issues.  We've tied in some of these great services like Panoptica to our HipChat.  So when a site goes down or servers slow, I know immediately Russell knows immediately we could see it in the HipChat.  You get instant messaging, you get video chatting and then of course, test, review and manage code in real time with Bitbucket.  Atlassian makes tools that help teams in every industry from startup to enterprise make great ideas.  Real.  We're big fans of Atlassian.  And if you're not using one of these Atlassian tools, I want you to check it out.  Atlas.  There's two S's.  Atlas.com.  And learn more about Jira and about Confluence and HipChat and Bitbucket to give your team everything you need to organize, discuss and complete shared work.  They're really the kings of this and they do such a great job.  We love them.  Atlassian.com.  Unleash the potential in your team and build what's next.  I'll tell you what's next on Twig.  Picks, tips, ideas.  Ron, do you have anything you want to share with us?  An Android app.  You love a piece of gear.  I know you're the product reviewer.  Did you like the S7?  Do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fine.  It was a phone.  I don't.  I mean, it's such a small.  It's such a.  It's like it's a spec bump.  It's pretty much the same as the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It fixed all the things I had wrong with the S6.  The S6 didn't have enough RAM, enough horsepower.  It had hesitated a lot.  And this thing is the 820.  You got to love the Qualcomm Snapdragon 820, right?  Yeah, it is.  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Next time doing one of these.  There's so many phones around here.  This phone.  What's that?  This is a.  This is a Xiaomi Mi5.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We love the Mi4.  That was a very impressive phone.  This is another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty much the same specs as the S7.  It's a Snapdragon 820 and I don't know, like three gigs of RAM.  And it's just really close to what Samsung's putting out, except it's 305 bucks.  Wow.  I think this is where.  This is like 800 bucks.  So expensive.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you get the Xiaomi in the US, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not yet.  They do have a store here that sells like headphones and other little silly things.  But the thought is that maybe this will be the first one that they actually bring to the US.  I don't know.  It has it has an international software build on it, so it will actually show up in English and.  Will kind of work here and it has I think it has a decent set of LTE bands that should kind of work here.  Maybe I'm still kind of looking at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, one place that other companies are at disadvantage, even Apple, is that Samsung makes those OLED screens.  And I think kind of keeps them themselves.  Is it is it screen anywhere near as good as the S7?  Because that is an amazing screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's it's 1080p where the Samsung is 1440p.  And and like, yeah, and the weird curved OLED thing that Samsung has going on.  The thing is, I don't really know if you'll miss it.  Like the Samsung thing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But even the colors, I just love the Super AMOLED.  I just yeah, AMOLED is like super saturated.  Yeah, yeah, so beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what I would like to see Samsung do is be more of like a integrate their various component sections more like the Samsung could totally make a 100% Samsung phone.  And they just don't like this still has a Qualcomm processor and all that, which which actually still gets made in Samsung's factories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. I didn't know that.  Yeah, it's all Samsung's the fab.  Interesting.  So they do the Exynos everywhere but the US here in the US, it's it's Qualcomm.  And I think that's because of the radio bands probably more than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. They did Exynos last year on the S6.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because the A10 was like a horrible chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So it's so they can do it.  They just chose not to.  I think because Samsung's component section treats the phone section as any other customer.  Like they try to stay independent.  Right. Right.  I don't know.  They could really play their strengths if they just came together as a unit and and released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know something that only they could build battery life on the S6 is a big seven is a huge improvement over the S6.  I'm getting really good.  Like look 80%.  I mean, here it is four in the afternoon.  This easily gets through the day.  According to G Sam, I think it's 15 and a half hours and I think that's even low.  I think it was was lower first because I was installing everything and I think it's coming going up every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's and you're on Marshmallow now.  So you get those and those is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, and also notice the screen usage 10%.  It the screen is much less of a draw of a drain than it is on any other phone I've used.  Usually a screen on almost any phone is 30, 40, 50% of the usage here.  It's very it's sips at the usage.  So I don't know.  I've and the camera you come on.  You love this camera.  You must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  The camera is great.  Samsung really figured out cameras like last year and has just been putting out some of the best stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  I won't argue with you.  It is twice as much as the Mifasa.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is twice as much.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, the all of the interesting cell phone stuff I think happens at the lower end nowadays than the super high end stuff.  The super high end phones just take last year's design and put more stuff in it.  But when they when they kind of do this competing on price thing, I think it gets more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aren't we maxed out though?  I mean, we're at peak phone already.  That's the problem.  There's nothing we're going to do.  What could you do that would make everybody go?  Wow.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  In America, sure.  But, you know, there's there was a thing in the roundup about, you know, people in China getting cell phones and and all that.  That's that's going to be the big like tech story for phones next.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  How about the Robin?  That was 400 bucks.  Did you like that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a fine like hardware phone, but they tied it to this weird cloud system that doesn't really make a ton of sense.  I mean, everybody anybody that complains about phone storage just says, give me an SD card and then they're totally happy.  And if they had just done that, I think the storage market would have been a lot happier with the the next bit Robin, because right now it's like, oh, well, you can use Clark Cloud storage, but you also have to use a ton of your mobile data to move stuff back and forth and get it up there.  And it's like that's that that stops the whole point of storage.  Like the whole point was I don't have great Internet access, so I want to have these movies and music and stuff with me.  And it doesn't do that.  So it's weird.  I don't know.  It's cool to see a new phone company, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I look forward to getting one once they start selling in the US.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Mr. Matt cuts your thing of the week.  So this is Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt, unplug your headset.  It's oh, hi.  So I has taken over while he's fixing that.  Let me just mention somebody was wondering in G Sam what the percentage of usage for the screen is when it's on or off.  And it's three percent when it's on, which is really good considering it has the always on feature, which means that even when this phone is off and just sitting on the desk is showing the time and a few little things.  I have to say three percent drain while off while women that says discharge while on off three percent.  Eighteen percent.  I think that must be reversed.  It must be 18 percent went on and three percent went off that.  Otherwise, why wouldn't you six times more when it's off than when it's on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would that make sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  Floating clock.  Yeah.  Well, nobody I like that.  See, it's just sitting there.  It has an always on it.  And that is that's it.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That might be the 18 percent, though, because that's always on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you'd left it there all day.  It's only been five hours, though.  It hasn't been on that long.  No, it hasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These this is not a good day to see the battery life.  But, you know, days past, I use it 100 percent.  Today was I had brought out the Nexus 6P to talk about not roll.  I'm telling you, I got an inside track on that one.  Android.  No, you guys.  Is that what you're betting on Nutella?  Yeah, I there's a silly Photoshop somewhere of me doing a I took a stupid Nutella bottle

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and wrote Android on it.  It's just never been to the meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There must be a fun meeting where they decide what the code letter is going to represent.  I haven't been to the ones for Android, but it is fun whenever we're talking about search

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  projects and deciding Pigeon Penguin or caffeine or what do you want to call it?  And do we want to name it at all?  Those kinds of things, because, you know, that's that's your chance to put something  out there that can even be an inside joke that people might not realize.  Yeah, to compare it, the 6P wall on off is 22 percent, 13 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's a big, big difference.  What do you what do you got, Matt, is your pick of the week?  Just something to know if you're a publisher, webmaster, search engine optimizer is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we mentioned earlier in the show that Google in May is going to be giving more weight to  mobile friendly pages.  So if you are planning on making mobile friendly websites, we will be changing the user agent  for Googlebot.  Now, that's for the smartphone version of Googlebot.  So it used to pretend to be an iPhone.  Now it pretends to be a Nexus 5X.  Well, rightly so.  Yeah.  When you see one of these guys, Nexus 5X, surfing the web, showing up.  That's the Googlebot.  That's that's it.  Odds are it might be the Googlebot and treat him just like you treat any other browser.  But that's something to know about it.  Maybe the Nexus phones are popular enough now that we don't have to say we're an iPhone.  But I think for 99 percent of websites, it won't make any difference.  It's just something to be aware of.  If you haven't heard about that, that just came out.  Do you have an opinion?  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is this?  Why?  Why did you switch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I changed the user agent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's some things that, you know, whenever the iPhone isn't under your control,  you know, for example, the iPhone didn't support flash.  And so you can you can imagine a lot of different functionalities that people might try to say,  oh, I'll just pull or I think the iPhone is capable of this.  And now with it being the Nexus 5X as the user agent, we're able to have that under our control.  We're able to check, you know, for example, we can we can get a Nexus 5X pretty cheaply.  So you could actually have these guys load the page and then have it load the page from other,  you know, devices to check whether things are cloaking and all those kinds of things.  So it's not a huge change, but it's just something where it gives us a little more ability to maybe  monitor if anything's going on.  And we should point out this is not an attempt to change the user agent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is not an attempt to any intent to hide the user agent.  It says in the user agent string Googlebot.  That's right. You know, I mean, it's not like they're pretending they're not the Googlebot.  It's just that you have to you can't give Googlebot as the hardware device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And if you're going to change your version number anyway, like instead of mobile Safari,  five thirty seven to mobile Safari, you know, like six hundred or whatever.  Why not go ahead and list some mobile or modern phone that you've already got that you own and make?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Do you have a favorite for what and might stand for Matt,  knowing that you have no inside information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have no inside information and the whole Kit Kat thing seemed to get mixed reactions.  But I like Nutella because Nutella, I don't know if you know this, but it's delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know it's delicious, but it is a brand name.  That's what you're talking about. Kit Kat was a brand name and did get some heat  because nobody wants to say a brand name.  And they abandoned that brand name thing for the last couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but everybody loves Nutella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yesterday they did a you know, the Opinion Rewards program from Google.  They use the Opinion Rewards to send out a question.  What should Android N be named?  Damn it. Specifically, the question is what tasty food comes to mind when you think of the letter N.  NUTROLL!  And the winner so far is Nachos.  No, none of those actually.  Nori?  New York Cheesecake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  New York Cheesecake. That's too compound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New York Cheesecake is what they call Android N internally in like the code base.  There's always a separate name that it gets from the developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that's the actual name from the developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, in the code. So Lollipop was, I forget, Key Lime Pie was Kit Kat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, we thought it might be Key Lime Pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so the developers give it some separate name.  Because they can't wait for the marketers to decide what they want to do.  Right. They have to have a name for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Namespace.  And I just found out if I scroll down on the 9 to 5 Google story about this, I can vote.  Ooh, Napoleon, Nutbrittle, Nachos, Nori, Noodles, Nuget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where's Nutella?  It's not even on the list.  And by the way, I'm peeved because I also do Google opinion rewards.  And they didn't ask me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They says there's no survey at this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're just watching Twig. So they don't need to ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nutroll. Nutroll. Nutroll. Nutroll.  Now I'm hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You got to think about what your icon would look like.  I don't know. But then a jar of Nutella doesn't really work either.  No, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's an Android mashup that has the little Android guy with that.  Oh, okay.  And he's sticking out of a jar of Nutella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we all know it's going to be Nutella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'd be so nice. If they handed out Nutella as the swag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  Patrick Delahanty has pointed out there really is only one name it can be.  Yes, it's a brand name.  But it's the right brand name. NERDS.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  NERDS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NERDS are good too. I like NERDS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google NERDS.  Knowing Google, if they're not going to announce the name at I.O.  they will have a spread of snacks that begin with N.  Just spread all over the show.  That'd be funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, I want to mention my pick is after having extensive trials.  Android Wear I love. I love Android Wear.  And I have two Moto 360s including the Moto 360 Sport.  But it doesn't do the kinds of things including continuous heart rate monitoring  that I really would like it to do.  And I've ended up coming up with my favorite fitness watch which does, you know,  it's not Android Wear but it still does notifications.  I can control music, play back with it.  It has alarms in it and it is much better for fitness.  Fitbit of course which is the king in this field.  And this is the Fitbit Blaze.  Which at 200 bucks I think is my choice for, it's not a great watch.  I mean you don't have a whole bunch of different watch faces and all that.  But it really is a great fitness device including continuous heart rate monitoring.  So this is the only device I have that will tell me what my resting heart rate is.  And frankly that's a very good indicator of overall health.  As I've been able to bring that down I've felt better and better.  It has a much broader range of exercises you can choose from.  Including some exercises that most fitness bands don't do  that I do a lot like spinning and Pilates.  And I feel like that's, I mean of course there's no steps in spinning and Pilates  but the fact that it has accurate continuous, and by the way I've tested it.  It is accurate continuous heart rate measurement.  And really does do a good job of tracking your overall movement.  It ties in via Bluetooth LE to the Fitbit app on any phone or all your phones.  I have it on all the phones so it doesn't really care what phone it's attached to.  And they have in this a built-in Fitstar, mini Fitstar program  that will work you through some workouts through the watch.  So of all of the fitness bands, and I've tried them all including unfortunately Android  where Apple Watch is one of my favorites.  It's pretty good but this one's even better.  And five day battery life means you don't have to go crazy charging it all the time.  It does not kill the battery to have continuous heart rate monitoring.  So I'm very happy with this.  And so my little, it's my pick, the Fitbit Blaze.  Ugliest sin, but you know what? Who cares?  You can pop it out of the, by the way see there's other bands available.  So you don't, it pops out of the band.  It's not actually integral to the band.  So in fact you have to pop it out to charge.  As usual they have a weird charger. I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what does the underside of that look like?  The reason the Apple Watch is good is because there's two green heart rate monitor lights  and two receivers.  And most of the Android, okay that has two, so that has two lights and one receiver maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is as accurate as the Apple Watch which is absolutely the most accurate device,  much more than the Android Wear devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right and the reason none of the Android Wear devices work is because they have one light and one receiver.  And that's usually it.  It's only because the hardware makers like cheaped out and didn't go with the two light solution.  So that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got a crappy LCD screen. It's not very bright.  It is always on which is kind of nice.  I don't know. I feel like this is, it's not a watch. It's a fitness device.  None of these are really decent watches in general.  Although I actually really appreciate how the Moto 360 looks.  I got one with a metal band and I think it looks the most like a watch.  I love round. This is square.  But anyway, you probably, I know you're a fitness fanatic, Matt Cutts.  You probably have a device you like to use for your workouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I rock old school the Fitbit blade or Pulsar One or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've lost so many of those down the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's like a subscription because you lose them so quickly or they break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I left one, I tell this story.  I left one at the San Diego Zoo, one in Paris and one in a toilet.  And I think one got washed.  But you could wear it that way. You could wear this that way too.  I think Fitbit really knows what they're doing actually of all the trackers.  What's your 30 day challenge, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This month is fitness month.  So I'm trying to exercise once or twice a day, check my blood pressure, eat healthy, mindfully, slowly.  Put it all together. All the things where I was a slug over the winter.  I'm trying to undo that in one month.  You actually look great. You really look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you. I appreciate that.  Even the beard is under control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It got a little out of control.  Little trimming action.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're looking a little grisly, Adams, I admit.  Although that's the new thing. All the kids now have these big black beards.  I've never seen, it feels like we're working among woodsmen.  Yeah, lumberjacks.  Lumberjacks. Everywhere. Lumbersexuals.  Hey, it's so great to have you. Matt Cutts from the Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jeez, Louise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I just did the S7. Next up is the Mi 5.  Yep.  And then.  What's your daily driver these days?  Nexus 5X, because software matters more than any of this hardware stuff.  Yeah, I agree.  And I like smaller phones rather than this gigantic stuff.  But I don't know, now with Android N, I kind of appreciate the bigger screen more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No kidding. Yeah, it uses the screen well.  I love the 6P, but the camera is so good on the S7 that it's just, it's not, and the camera and the screen, just put it over the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the two Nexus cameras are really good too. So I'm not, I'm really not worried about that.  They're good. They're competent.  Yeah, they're competent.  And they used to never be. They used to be totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, much better than the 5.  Yeah.  Thank you, Ron. Thank you, Matt. Thank you all for being here.  Awesome being here.  Huh?
