Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was an update automatic update which I got for for for KitKat  Yeah, and then and then it  The one thing I can't get it to do now  Gina is I have so proud that I had my separate lock screen from my wallpaper screen  Yeah, you know, yeah, I lost it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can add third-party lock screen apps  I guess but yeah now the lock screen the way Cyanogen mod works

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The lock screen is the same as the wallpaper for you. But why could I do it fine just before the update?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could you are you sure yeah, I'm sure I showed you last week I showed you Lenin and then I showed you marks and angles

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Guess and now if I say  Now if I say hold on a second here  Lock screen custom locked screen. Okay, so now I'm gonna go off and now what it's gonna do is this it gives me  That ugly box. Yeah, I don't like that ugly box  Right. And so then as I as I do the code it's gonna go. Well, there's one and then it goes to marks. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can get a third-party lock screen apps, I'm sure if you watch all about Android the gang over there I'll tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we just blame it on blame it on communism  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have the answer to that just be glad you didn't have a trotsky screen  You know the two that you know about the double tap to wake and double tack to sleep, right?  I love that love that and they fixed that ridiculous  But it's like my favorite feature of the phone is I don't have to search for the power button to unlock it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And remember when Jason reviewed it he and you I think even mentioned this  Both of you had problems that it would turn itself on in your pocket  That's one of the things they fix in the update  Is it oh, yes it noun as a proxy sexist proximity and says oh, it's in your pocket  Well, I'm not gonna turn on that was just a accident and that applies to the the torch as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, now that's good because the torch was the issue. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo's shining breast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Gina you last time we talked we're kind of thinking about giving this thing up sending it back because of your disgust

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Over their plan to market to women. I was I was very frustrated with their ineptitude and the marketing department. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For everybody knows the story probably by now, but just a few case you don't they one plus  Posted a contest is how you get it  You either have to get somebody to give you an invitation somebody who already has one none of us have invitations  Because we all got it from somebody else  But if you know somebody who got it  You they have invitations more likely though. You're gonna participate in a contest the most recent contest posted on the one plus forums was  Ladies, we want you to jump the line take a picture of yourself with the one plus logo on your body  And then the forum will rate you all and the top rated  Ladies will get an invitation by the phone at full price  And no nudity, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but something close to it was a desire I don't well and then I talked to Tony way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought maybe this is cultural because remember they're a Chinese company  Yeah, and  China the mainland China is considerably more prudish than the rest of the West  And I thought and Tony kind of said, you know, you see people with company logos on themselves all the time on their hands  On their arms on their faces. It does not necessarily  Mean that they thought people would take sexy pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The the marketing wasn't in Mandarin. They're trying to market to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  English speaking people should have known better and it was well only I mean if they'd said post a picture of anybody post a picture  Of yourself with like creative use of our logo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have been a totally different story and then reading people on the forum is actually really reprehensible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything this company has done has been sleazy  First of all, this is first of all, this is oppo. This is the idea that it's the one plus is a separate company is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not true. I've said as much. It's yeah, it's oppo executives one plus one oddly enough is OPO

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and basically they said oh, we're gonna do a fresh new start where we're going to launch this new company  And then it turned out that their domain name is owned by the company  It turned out that the sole owner is oppo and then they said oh no, no, there's two oppos  There's oppo the investment company on oppo the mobile company might be and the invent no, it's not true  But the the investment company supposedly owns both companies or invested in both companies  But I can't find any evidence for that and there's tons of evidence that in fact, it's the same company  So they pretty much lied about that as far as I can tell then their first big marketing stunt was that they said, okay  Smash your old phone, right and people misunderstood they started smashing their phones expecting to be put on the list for an invitation  But that's not how the contest worked you had to get the invitation first and then you had to smash the phone  It was dangerous environmentally insensitive and just wasteful and horrible then they came out to this with this ladies night essentially  for invitations where they were trying to what they wanted was what the outcome they wanted was a bunch of of  Women with the the one plus one or one plus logo on their bodies out there on the internet as a viral campaign and they  Specified women they haven't done a single thing that isn't sleazy

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Their marketing department is clearly clearly inept but and I hate to defend them  But you know when we talk about bugs in software particularly open-source open-source software, you know  I've always said like bugs are gonna happen. It's about how you respond and I do and I do believe that and and and to their  Credit within hours. They pulled the ladies first contest  Apologized asked about women in tech organizations now agree  I'm still I'm totally with you Mike like their marketing department is completely enough like terrible terrible ideas terrible ideas and certainly I mean  You know  Maybe brilliant ideas if they're subscribing to the any presses good press  Maxim because they're getting us talking about it. But you know, look they they they they apologize they pulled it and  You know look if I had if I returned every device that I had some sort of you know ethical more problem with the way  That it was produced. I wouldn't have any technology  I feel like so in the end I decided to keep my one plus one and to just be vocal about  How bad the contest was?  Because I actually think it's a really great phone and I love it at cyanogen  It was interesting to see cyanogen make a statement about the contest  Because they say  Sanjeev came out straight up came out and said we don't support any contest that objectify people period  And that's interesting  Sanjeev doesn't have the best history of being the most inclusive or sensitive company either  But I think when these kinds of things happens conversations happen, I think that's useful and again look  I might be a nerd that's just trying to justify because I actually really do like this phone  I mean, I think this company actually a really good phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's probably not better than a number of other  flagship phones from other

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's 350 bucks it's not better than this what this is is the oppo find seven well, that's what I think and I was running

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cyanogen this is this is what puzzles me  What is the what is the strategy to get attention they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Created the whole find or this whole fiction that they're this innovative new company, right?  but basically what they did was they created a fiction around an existing product and  World this is the fine. We're all being punked. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got used. Yeah. Yeah, so we could have just gotten gone out and bought the fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess fine 7a maybe the fine 7 isn't as affordable and it doesn't run cyanogen  It doesn't have a denim a denim option in the back of things  I don't know if you'd call actually denim  I know they do are they are gonna be coming out with a denim  Back and they they're gonna have bamboo and stuff like that  but so there there are some unique things about it the price is fantastic the phone is great and the  Cyanogen is great. All that stuff is those are the real things  But but they could have you know, if they would have done just another  Oppo phone in the oppo line with all these features  Nobody would be talking about it. So it worked

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it all marketing a fiction though on some level? I mean  you know like  I don't know. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not like this. I mean, this is this is it's bad marketing when  people catch you lying or they catch you doing stuff that's offensive or  You know, that's not that's bad marketing. So that you know, if you're gonna yes publicity stunts are great viral campaigns are great, but don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Blow it like this. I still don't get what the angle is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Publicize who angle is exactly what we've just done. We've just talked about yeah, but to what end you still can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they had this for sale wide widespread for sale, I'd understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but they don't Jason Howell and I were talking about this on tech news today  Just say this is the best phone for under $300 and we'll all buy it  It's it really is the best phone you can get for under $300 as far as I know it is and and you don't need to you  Don't need sexist contests and you know smashing phones and things like that  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if they're Mike if they're losing money on it, then they're not gonna come out with this broadly at this price  So there's another trick to irritate you probably coming. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is what they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't have anymore but guess what the fine seven is the same yeah thing  That's what I  Speculated that a few weeks ago on this show and and then I pulled back because I thought that's really uncharitable  But maybe they deserve it I don't know I just I I don't if you look at the spec comparison  There are differences the screens are different  Materials one's IPS one's LPTS  There are a few differences Cyanogen mods a huge difference and frankly I prefer Cyanogen mod to whatever  Version of Android Oppo is selling I like Oppo's a good company  The Oppo blu-ray player was for years the best blu-ray player in the market may still be I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have the feeling and this is just again total guesswork  This is not anything based on real information  but I have the feeling that they really did want to come out with a super innovative phone and  Said to themselves how can we really drive home the point that this is different?  This is completely different Cyanogen mod low price all these other features and benefits  How can we do that and then they constructed this let's just create a phony baloney startup out of this thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's just some point. They're gonna need to sell it or there's no then they've get what then there's no point to any of this  Yeah, they need to sell it in a widespread fashion. Yeah, and or you could okay. Let's go crazy  If I were Adam Curry, I'd say this is remember Oppo is a Chinese company  For all we know could be run by the Chinese government or have influenced be by the Chinese military  Maybe this is just a great spy  Device and we are all using it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just want to get into CUNY it could be the only device that the Chinese  Government isn't using to spy on us. You never know. We have just as another fan

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, we're gonna do it again another fan has offered us the new phone from  Who was it Jason  Chush  Show me show me so nice to have him right there is show me for  So we're gonna get one of those that's that's the company Hugo Bara went to yep  Also Chinese government run actually this was actually owned by the military. I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the Chinese government loves Apple

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very curious what's going on here?  It does it's wonderful. It's a great mystery  But you know what? It's also a great phone and and now everybody I know has one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want the I want the denim one. I'm holding out for the denim. I'm holding out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you what I'll give you this one when the X plus one comes out  Okay, September 4th, Motorola has an event and I suspect is Motorola Lenovo does not yet own Motorola. That's correct  It's still Google right so this is your last chance to get a Google Motorola phone September 4th  They probably ship the 360 and the X plus one or whatever they call it  Yeah, or announce it and I presume ships soon because iPhone comes out five days later, so you better really yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said that for those who went to Google IO you have until September 5th to send in your address for sending  Forgetting the three so they're probably gonna start shipping on the fifth of the six. There's something like that for the motor 360  Oh, that's a good little yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're gonna get one right you're all gonna get one you've all weird

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was very happy to fill out that form my shipping address. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Complaining I didn't notice it until people complained

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About the black bar at the bottom of the well. It's just the screen doesn't they need the screen needs a electronic  Base to throw up all those pictures. I want to thank you for pointing it out now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't appreciate the thing I ruined it for you. Wait, wait, wait the black bar at the bottom of what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The motor 360 the screen doesn't go to the bottom see that oh  That's now that's all I see it's Elgin's fault. Sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are just raining on our parade

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you can see it on all the screens there's how did no one notice that before well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently people did just not because mostly they use this shot, which is a black face

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the illusion is close enough  And I don't think it's gonna  We're gonna get into the definition of troll that's not rolling that's called annoying it's called telling the truth

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still want one and actually it might be Gruber that was the one that first brought to my attention because he said it looks  like a flat tire  Now I really can't unsee it of course Gruber's. Thank You Gruber  Hello Gruber

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Deflating everybody's time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the the the unspoken point that Gruber's making is that Apple would never do that and they probably wouldn't oh that's okay  They wouldn't they would be so  You know obsessed with every little detail. They wouldn't have a black bar for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you gonna do you got some of their limitations in the world you got limitations

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they're not hoping that when that thing ships that black bar isn't there it's gonna be there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why does it have to be done right?  I read an explanation it has something to do with when you have a you can't have a completely bezel-less you have to have some  Real estate at one edge of a screen like this and you need a certain amount  So they wanted to make this the watch as small as they could and this was the compromise they came to  Whereas they need the screen electronics needs  You know a bit of it there at the bottom  That's a terrible explanation. There's a good explanation out there, but  It's a technical where the gut is technology. It's where the guts goes I

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can't wait until Ron on all that Android talk we talk about this with him because he's been all about the round-screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, all right, all right class, you know, this is this is this is a Louis CK moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everything is wonderful. Nobody's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  About the black bar round screens are amazing, but everyone's upset about the bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're wearing a wristwatch that'll tell you your flight is delayed and the traffic is gonna take an extra ten minutes  So relax and you are complaining about a black bar at the bottom. Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You didn't even know that round screens existed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike Elgin who continues to write for what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you showing?  This is a this is the original post that's a close-up showing that in the black mode where it's been enhanced  And I just said enhancing anyway, so you actually posted this on Google Plus months ago  four months ago, yeah  Shuttle off. Yeah  That's why everyone hates me because I'm the bearer of bad news

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Mike writes for computer world in his spirit is copious free time  He has none. I don't know when you would four in the morning. He's writing these articles, I think  And on August 16th, you did a piece called the trouble with trolls and how to beat them  We all know the trolling problem serious. We've actually spoken about it twice on the last two episodes of this week in Google Gina  talked about  Issues people were having with being harassed on Twitter and the lack of interest Twitter hadn't fixing the problem  And until it was a celebrity until it was Zelda Williams Robin Williams daughter and now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now it's a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't know. I mean they're saying they're making the right noises out of their mouth  But I don't know if there's an easy fix for this last week. We talked about collaborative filters as a possible  Solution or perhaps adding a feature that you could say I don't want to hear from anybody whose account is less than a month old  or whatever  Twitter is a particularly problematic place because of the nature of Twitter and Jeff you've been bitching about professor Jeff Jarvis  You didn't have to say his name did you?  You know, I looked at the account. I don't understand how anybody could think that that was you the guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the case. Here's the case. No, here's the case. Well, people put up silly pictures on Twitter pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it is my name. I can't imagine you doing that. It shouldn't be your name

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree it is my name and that is the problem and so out of nowhere he went on and attacked  Nossum Talib who is very prominent author and economist. I've met him. I have mutual friends  He could attack some now you don't expect tall dollop to have to stop and do it do a textual and  Biographical analysis of who this is  Well, somebody with his name is coming in and and and is attacking and column goes back at him and everybody laughs cuz oh  He's attacking the troll. He's real right? So tall. It makes it friggin me. He's using my name and  And I finally had enough. I've lived this for two and a half years cuz oh, you know if I went after was here  Oh, Jeffers is a big fun and funny day. No sense of humor. I live with her nap years. I think guys had his fun  enough  Enough I might disagree a little bit. I understand. I understand how upset you are  He trolls someone else and that person believes it's me that affects my reputation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've had it but I mean the internet does require a little bit of if you go to his site his thing  He's wearing a beer and he's  Sight his highlighted tweet is the sermon on the mount was the first TED talk. It's a it's a jokey parody

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and this is Leo Leo Leo. No, wait, wait, wait, wait  You just did more research than he should have to do in his Twitter feed comes this tweet  That's what he sees the tweet is calling him horrible things  He responds to that tweet. He should not be expected to have to do any further research than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I understand that point but on the other hand, I also understand why Twitter might say I mean  Parity is allowed Twitter is do you expect Twitter to delete parody accounts?  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Label them so that they're clear. I expect you not to be fooled on Google News  The onion says satire Facebook is gonna do the same with those things. So people are not confused  Okay fusion is not a good thing for a platform. But here's the bigger question  That's that's that's trivial compared to what what Robert Williams family went through  Yeah compared everything that's going on right now trivial as hell what it reveals to me though, so I'll make that clear  Anything like that and the guy says he's gonna change the name. I just wonder when he is a hyperglocal thinkfluencer  Clearly parody but Leo Leo, but you're giving him a you're giving him more attention  All right much B that again requires that you that you go and go to the efforts. We just attacked you  What are you gonna do sit back and say let me find out who this no actually what I do is I mean you block

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I really block them but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would this guy responded everybody I do you know what actually wait a minute I take it back when somebody attacks me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do go to their account  I see how many followers they have how long they've been around whether they have a picture  I look to see if it's I actually do do this  I read previous tweets to see if they if this is a general pattern or if in fact, I don't think that's weird  I think that's called the internet. Welcome to the internet. We don't we saying we got to teach people critical thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're you're I think that that puts a too low a standard  But the but the now I'll go up in the altitude so and this will get to Mike's points  Zaynab to fesky wrote it were a really wonderful piece at medium talking about the need for Twitter to be  net neutral  Because that is what allowed people from Ferguson for example to come on  I'm doing whatever they want as opposed to Facebook where she saw no  Ferguson because Facebook didn't think she was interested in violence in a Missouri town and  So a truly neutral platform  But there but the bigger question to me is then does a truly new neutral platform have to be a breeding ground for trolls  a holes  imposters  Sickos and so on and and that's the question that Twitter has to face right now  Because it affects Twitter's brand at some point all the stuff going on today about the assassin video and such so so so Twitter came  along and and is  Killing accounts that that that have the horrid fully video of the of the American journalist who was beheaded in Syria  however  Because we will take down the picture of a deceased person with a family request  however on the other hand Twitter had our pictures that did have newsworthy value of  mr. Brown's body lying on the street for hours in Ferguson, Missouri and  And what a company like Twitter wants to do is to make an algorithm to say okay  This is the rule set and then everything falls where that rule set that's it and they're in a very difficult position right now  Because on the one hand their openness is a huge  Benefit to society and enables people to use it on the other hand it also brings in a lot of  Awful things and what is Twitter? What is its brand? What does it mean?  That's what Mike was writing about and and I think it's a really important discussion  to look not just at Twitter then and not just at the cases of imposters or  Certain videos to look at the larger question of what do we expect of a tech platform would it be enough if it said fake Jeff Jarvis or?  Parity account if Twitter said parody that would help yes. Yes as long as it was clear at glance

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but Twitter has an impersonation policy and they say that  People are able to are allowed to you to create parody accounts and they differentiate between  Impersonation which is against their terms of service and parody and on their parody account policy that they list requirements  The first is the avatar shouldn't be a trademark or logo or picture the account subject so that check  But the account name the name should not be the exact name the account subject without some other distinguishing words such as not  Fake or fan like fake Steve Jobs for instance right the bio should include a statement

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am in fact a professor and my name is Jack Jarvis is it Jeff right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the bio should have this is a parody there's a fan page I tell you Jeff  I think that you have reason to report this this person like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Policy I went to an executive at Twitter, and I said when this episode happened, and I said you know I've had it  I've had it and they came back to me  And they said well you have to fill out before and the form by the way says we're gonna share this with the person  And so then I sit back and I say okay  What's gonna happen is exactly what happened to me when I complained about it publicly I get tons of people saying oh you just did  You know stick in the mud asshole  and  So I end up worse off we say we have a number of parody or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Impersonating depending on your point of view accounts of our hosts do we report them in every case right none of them have ever been taken down  some have  It takes a long time  There's been one there's been one of them for me for years right  Okay, yeah, I don't really care  Okay, okay, so Twitter does respond they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slow yeah, but but the problem is if I get something taken down  Then I'm gonna more blow back and the question the bigger question is what is Twitter's policy whether I reported or not  What's their real policy on these things? What's their view so so the same with and again?  I'm not comparing this little tiny trivial bull. Yes, sorry with  The far more serious things going on is that's why I want to get past is different from the right to be forgotten  Well, oh, that's  Well, I think impersonation is  Is this an entirely different thing I think the right to be forgotten  Right forgotten is more a case of if the only video was taken down by Twitter  Which they've done again and again and again  Now that's Twitter's right to do under its under its brand it can it can choose to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Distribute things or not, but that's a huge. I'm sorry go ahead Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By Twitter doing that you're right that does play to the right to be forgotten question is do we believe this is something?  People should be able to see or not Matthew Ingram is out there today saying that this Twitter is absolutely wrong to have taken it down

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I so the problem to me the problem is that  Having Twitter itself go play whack-a-mole is  Never going to work because for everything that they whack down they do the high visibility things the things that are in the news the prominent  People but that's not the real problem real problem isn't your troll Jeff Jarvis  And I'm sorry to say that because it is a problem for you  But you're somebody who can argue anybody under the table and you have a lot of fans and people know who you are and a lot  Of people can tell that you know when there's a parody account the real problem is that there are certain  Okay, it has to be said that the vast majority of people don't have troll troubles, right?  The vast majority people use Twitter and everything's fine, but there are certain people who are vulnerable to trolls namely women  transgender people who live in conservative societies  Young people people who are in crisis like like Robin Williams daughter and  Celebrities famous people of any kind like you Jeff and so those are the kinds of  But those are the kinds of people have troll trouble and the real problem isn't a fake account like I see somebody and they will  Mention me with the at symbol on Twitter, and I see it and I go to the site and I say oh they have three followers  I'm the only one seeing this and it's not a problem  The real problem is when somebody goes and they want to be a public person  They don't want to hide that they want to have they want to become like Jeff. They want to become influential  They want to become a public intellectual or public whatever they want to become and what's happening is that women and other people are leaving  Social media altogether and it's my point of my column is that it's not a social media problem. It's a Twitter  Problem specifically and it's a structural problem and here's the problem  I agree because we don't see this in other places to any

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  important thing this is what I wanted my other show exactly was this because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really good point he's about and and it's it's a it's a sudden the the mechanics of it are are  Feel subtle, but I'm just gonna say it very plainly on a site like Google Plus  Which is probably the best site for controlling trolls Facebook is pretty good, too  And you compare that against Twitter on Google Plus  You control the  Conversation that results from your posts you can boot anybody out of that conversation  You can block anybody lock them and they won't no longer see and when you block them  They can never comment on any of your posts again on Twitter  You don't control the conversation that results through conversation is out there. It's a difference  Between having a cocktail party in your home with invited guests on the one hand and having a big  Screamfest and shouting match across the street and across the neighborhoods on the other with in one the one case you can control it  The other you can't remember when Google  Forced YouTube users to use a Google Plus login  YouTube community was flipping out and I had a lot of arguments about how great you know the the troll control was on Google Plus  And I had to make my point I went to the biggest troll I could find on  YouTube and I said I want all the trolls to come to my account and try to troll me on this message  And and I can promise every single person reading this there will be no trolls on this message board not one and there isn't it's still  There are 381 messages. You just go through them and block the ones. Yeah, nobody even dared because they know I'll just block them  What's the point?  I mean it's and it's so easy to do and when you block somebody you block them forever and that's a structural problem with Twitter  And and so it's it's really my message to everybody out there who feels like you've been trolled  I mean it can be horrible to be trolled  Especially if you don't have the scar tissue that we have you know takes years to develop the that kind of  resistance to to this these kinds of attacks  Don't leave social media. Just leave Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amen because Twitter doesn't have a  This is I think this was a really really good point and interestingly Jonathan Zungerer who's the architect of Google Plus  Came into one of the discussions and said that that's  Absolutely, right and and a key difference, and I've urged him to come in and have to say more about this  We've exchanged emails. We haven't had the discussion yet  But here's question Mike is Twitter doomed by its very architecture  to be the breeding ground of  trolls and postures

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bozos etc. I don't think so because again the vast majority of users aren't really affected

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't care that much Gina do you agree with that with that proposition because when you've defended women who've been abused on on  On Twitter, it's not about famous people. It's about people who maybe have one stalker one one horrible person going after them  It's not about fame in that case. It's about a platform for abuse right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean  I was just just reading about just before the show started Zoe Quinn who's a game designer going through an ugly and bitter  You know break up with a bitter ex-boyfriend who has you know brought the reddit masses after?  Her they're docking her they're posting personal photos and personal chats  They're there that they all these guys are calling her  You know slut and whore and worse and going to her co-workers and basically tarnishing her professional career, right?  And this is somebody who I guess has a little bit of fame within a sub community  But like we're all a little bit famous if we're you know if we speak up within our professional circle  I mean you kind of have to define you know what famous means and there's a much lower bar now than there was  And you know she you know it's affecting her professional life because she spoke out you know that she's outspoken  On these these networks, and I mean I don't think that everybody is but yeah  I mean this is the thing that annoyed me about Twitter's reaction is like when it's a celebrity complaining  They immediately you know had a response, but it was regular people whose names weren't recognizable  You know pounding that ask ask cost a load hashtag that day  He did the CNN sit down after the quarter quarterly earnings report there was there was no response  I should say there was no response dick did tweet the next day that he was meeting with his you know his team of  You know the folks who take care of these these abuse complaints, and you know and I get the whack-a-mole argument  But you know what these companies spend so much time and put so much tech into preventing things like spam  You know and I would just like to see that's that same sort of work and energy and thought go into dealing with abuse  And you know this question about Twitter is similar to the question that we had about reddit when  Violent acres was outed you know that the troll made that the red the sub reddit with the you know and reddit said oh  We're just a platform. You know we don't police would think it was on and it's kind of the same the same argument  Do I think you so you asked is the platform doomed like as a consumer product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably not do no no I don't mean that is it is it doomed is it is it doomed to have?  Bozo's and a holes because of the structure architecture yeah because the architect and and and and and and  Let's also acknowledge that in Zana piece  She argues that Twitter being open and and giving the publisher control is what allowed  Ferguson to bubble up and trend where it couldn't on Facebook and probably couldn't on Google plus would be the argument as well  So so is Twitter's openness which is an important important asset?  Do mit also be  Sleazy and scummed up all the time let me ask this question

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean I think it's what her could build in better moderation tools, and they haven't right but good go ahead Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but I think that architecturally it's gonna be very difficult because it's so easy to create another account and leaving Twitter  I understand what you am I misunderstanding you're saying well just don't participate in Twitter  You can still use Facebook and to Google plus  But it's still gonna happen on Twitter, and if other people are reading it  It's like me blocking it on Twitter  I don't see it, but it doesn't mean it goes away nothing nothing's perfect and just I want to quickly address

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina's point before I address yours you can't moderate a conversation that isn't yours

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right that's the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, whereas in Google plus you can moderate it because you own the conversation right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To the post on tweets they're not right, but that's just not how Twitter works

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But more to your point if you if you want to go from having a small number of people that you influence and that you  Engage with to a large number  Where do you do that if you do it on Google plus and you're active with?  The blocking and muting tools and the flagging and all the other tools that they have you will grow this big community  That is that is very easily 100% troll free and the Twitter will forget about you for the most part  I can't guarantee that of course people can take things to to Twitter, but they're not going to be  So when you start a conversation and people are talking about that conversation  You don't want trolls to be influencing those other people in that conversation  That's the big problem whereas on Google plus if the conversation is on Google plus  You control that and they can't influence that conversation problem would not have gone away. I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff not being on Twitter would not make any difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No in his it would have right because the the parody wouldn't be as funny if if Jeff wasn't you know the parody is making is  Supposedly making fun of what Jeff does on Twitter if Jeff wasn't doing anything on Twitter if he didn't have that presence that'd be nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To make fun of and some what I've done since in Sunday or since Saturday. I all would stop tweeting  Should we all should we all just leave Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and you kind of just well, that's the thing leave one hand. I think oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a hundred forty thousand followers in the other hand. I think I used to write for TV guy  They're 25 million readers, but but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Jeff is not the solution. It's like saying, you know, I can't get legally married in  The United States so I should just move to Canada. I don't like paying for health insurance  I should move someplace and that's crazy. That's not the solution  That doesn't mean that the problems, you know  Are legitimate and it puts the it puts the onus to change on the person who's been victimized  Right and that just gives the abusers and the trolls more power

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would that be a reason to leave would that be a reason to leave Saudi Arabia, for example?  My point my point is my point is my point is for a tiny number of people for whom trolls is a huge  Huge deal. It is a reason to leave Twitter and I don't think anybody really needs to leave Twitter  Just don't start conversation on Twitter  And let me ask Jeff Jeff has vastly more followers on Google Plus than Twitter  And yet is there anything like the professor Jarvis trolling on Google Plus?  I guess there is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Plus just changed their real names policy  So could we not have exactly the same problem soon on Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's a tree falling in the forest on Google Plus if some professor Jarvis professor Jarvis  There are lots of fake Mike Elgins on Google Plus as well, and they just don't there's a non-factor

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't spoil anything anybody. I think the key is there regardless of real names or not  Which is that you control the conversation so you got it  But there's it does mean you have to moderate pretty actively

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's totally worth it and it's fun to aren't there trolls in blog comments. I mean, oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google Plus Mike Mike Google Plus conversations for are far better than any conversations  I have anywhere else, but you can hold the conversation a log even more  But people come in as there's more trolling there  It is architecturally different. I think I want to go back to gene in question  I think jean is as always raising a really important point here  So Gina I agree with you that that and I said this about advertising this week when when  Ethan Zuckerman wrote about this was to give up because it's ruined the net it was the original sin of the net I  Agree with you that that the reflex should not be to give up on things  It should be a fix them what I'm asking is is it possible to fix Twitter is it possible?  You know you've talked about some moderation tools that would help but basically what those tools do is just try to give less  Attention to the people who are still there, which is Leo's point and those people are still getting it  I blocked probably a hundred people this week as I just said anybody who  Retweets or or praises this guy I'm blocking  I don't care who you are and I blocked somebody from the Wall Street Journal Europe, and I don't care  And I just I just blocked them all yeah, and it felt pretty good. It makes your Twitter experience a lot better  But your point is they're still doing what they're doing yeah, it's just you putting your own head in the sand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know I like Twitter a lot better after having blocked all that stuff. I don't see it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This isn't an impossible problem to solve like in an industry that prides itself on innovation and disruption  It's so weird that folks are just so willing to be like oh, you know whack them all never gonna win that game  We can't fix this so I mean you know I think like the way the Google Plus fixes  It is that comments are subordinate to post so let's just let's just get crazy and consider Twitter  So now when you view a tweet of mine that has a bunch of replies they all the replies show up on that same page  right, so it wouldn't be crazy for Twitter to say if  A tweet is in reply to another post  Maybe we consider giving the original poster rights to delete or mute or you know downvote or something  That reply I know that this is very you know this is maybe some people would think that this is a you know terrible change  To the basis of Twitter's architecture  But someone could mention me and I wouldn't have any control over they can talk about me  But if they're talking to me maybe I have more control over what shows up on the page which I you know of my tweet  That's just one one example. I'm not saying that this is the solution  I just think like that there are there are things that we can think of I mean Twitter is totally changing the timeline right now  because they're the worst advertising  Advertisers and and business value. It's just that they haven't prioritized this problem  And that's and that's just that's interesting to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would take issue with that Gina because because it's you what you're saying is there's no need to leave Twitter because they could  Fix this and what I would say is that they're not gonna fix it unless you leave  I mean, they're not gonna doesn't matter if they could fix it  They haven't fixed it, and there's no evidence that they're going to fix it all bitch and moan event eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean dick Costello is a benign person right they'll fix it if we complain enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean look I you know I don't stick around anywhere that I think is a complete  Completely hopeless I mean my issue. I just I don't think that telling with all respect to you Mike  I don't think that the solution is move to Google Plus  I mean for me my friends just aren't aren't on Google Plus, and it's a different experience is a different tool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a completely different thing. I have a solution for that at the end of the show and the tool my tool of the week  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spoil it  Move all your followers to Google Plus without their knowledge. You don't even have it should be awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is a troll all right?  I love that question because when I've been writing about trolling this week and by the way  I have to say that the reason I wrote that column the reason I've been writing about  Trolls is because of last week's this week in Google got me thinking about it and and and that sort of thing so that was  A really great conversation last week, but a lot of people don't know what a troll is and  and essentially  People think that somebody who sort of pesters somebody or you know is a troll which I don't believe it is or somebody who's  one troll  Gotten I get in a big argument with them on Google Plus  They were saying a troll is anybody who wants to be an influencer  And that's absolutely not true to me and and let's see if you guys agree or disagree with this definition a troll  Is somebody who either?  Who deliberately creates emotions in the in in the in the minds of other people that in a conversation to either?  Either hijack the conversation and get attention on themselves or to get a sort of sociopath kind of thrill out of upsetting and disrupting a  Constructive conversation that's my definition of what a troll is and I think people use the the word troll  Very broadly and unnecessarily. I think the trolling phenomenon is something very specific and very

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mike I think that's good. I also I just put a link through a piece of wrote a medium in which I and Leo  Am I allowed to say out loud the spelled out a whole word? Yes  Okay, so because it's a book title so an asshole's a theory which by the way  I assigned in a curriculum for our new degree. It was that was one of my favorite moments was to assign that book  He  Aaron James defines that person right and any any  He talks about the motive so then what I did was that I argued what the distinguish is a troll from a mere asshole and I believe it's  That he and as I point out it's usually men one has a target  two seeks to get a response a rise out of the target and  Three believes he is acting out of some ordained moral principle to destroy or to bring down his target  Okay, that's my definition of a troll. I'm gonna read one from 1999 from alt dot troll

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This has been going on for so long  in on Usenet that they actually have alt dot troll and  This is this is a definition. What is trolling the use of the word trolling comes from the fishing technique  We're a baited hook this actually might be useful to understanding this is drags through the water  It attempts to attract to catch a fish Usenet trolling is the act of posting an article or troll a Usenet newsgroup  With the intention of attracting the native inhabitants and provoking an emotional response  There at which point they're caught as a fish would be caught the phrase was originally coined as trolling for flames  That's the historic origination the posters intention was to incite a flame war  Which I think is actually really more to the point it  We don't we kind of want to impute an intent on a troll except that they get off in some way  On a troll except that they get off in some way on the resulting carnage they've made a difference  And this by the way the kind of discussion we're having is exactly what a troll want  Yeah, so here's the definition of troll from alt dot troll  It's convenient that the world troll has multiple meanings aside from the fishing example above trolls also the name obviously of a mythical creature  Generally thought of as ugly fat cantankerous wart covered smelly and completely unlikable. That's a troll  Since trolling is thought of as a detestable and unsavory activity performed by loathsome  Contempt of contemptible hooligans. I think that's another good way. I like sociopaths. Yeah, the name troll fits them quite well  They're two troll species those with overactive minds  Constantly seek out new sources of mental stimuli. I say they want negative attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would even go further and say that there are some trolls who don't know that they're trolls. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually trolls do not know that and then there are those who are permanently disgruntled or physically shortchanged in some way and seek out ways to  Compensate for their shortcomings through vicious personal attacks against others in order to achieve a mental erection

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  90s was a crazy time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not new to the internet these kinds of flame wars and trolling started with used net  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I remember we talked about a study of months ago here and I put up the link on the rundown chat  From February right in which the most succinct definition of a troll you can possibly find is a sadist, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. It came down to that that ultimately  Mm-hmm. They were sadists they they which to to to wit they got pleasure out of causing others pain  Yeah, and if you look at what happened to Zelda Williams, that's precisely what happened  What happened it's somebody got pleasure out of knowing that they were causing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Extreme pain their only interest in her was that she was vulnerable right to having pain inflicted upon her, right? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a really, you know interesting problem, I don't know what the answer is Google Plus  Your answer to everything is Google Plus works for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and a pizza  But again, I think Jeff is a perfect, you know  Jeff is so prolific on Twitter and yet where is the trolling on Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Jeff has these amazing conversations of Google Plus. There's plenty of trolling on Google. Yeah, but it doesn't  It's not a factor and delete it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the people who he's interacting with are not seeing that trolling and that's the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see another point is that is that there are platforms where you don't bother  That was Mike's real point. You know, I have a different experience. I had a troll on Google Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Deleted and blocked the person was able to make new accounts to repost to get others to repost  It turns out even if you delete and block a post there of the link is a permalink  So he was able to recover that there there if you're persistent you probably can now whether they get any traction is another matter  I think you're right. It's it's difficult to get traction on Google Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If someone on Google Plus writes about you Leo not replies  But writes about you to the way that someone might  You can't control that right? I mean, so I mean we're back to the kind of the same  I mean the the main difference between Google Plus and Twitter and that's correct me if I'm wrong is that you can delete

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comments on your posts. That's there's several there are four three or four differences  So one of them is you can delete comments in which case they if they check they can see that the comment was deleted  You can flag comments in which case the troll thinks that their message is still there, but nobody can see it  And they have and they and they have blocking and they have reporting and Google tends to be more responsive to reporting  Than Twitter tends to be if you're not famous or a celebrity or if it's not something big in the news  And here's another one that I never hear anybody talking about if I let's say for example that Jeff Jarvis is not  Following me and I have a troll who's targeting me on Twitter and I want to contact Jeff, but he's not following me  So I sent a public Twitter message  That's the only way for me to reach Jeff on Twitter the trolls can see that I'm  Interacting with Jeff and then they can go after Jeff pretend to be me do all kinds of trouble like that on Google Plus just happened  Today I got five Mike Elgin trolls coming after me this afternoon  And I blocked them all yeah, so so but on Google Plus all the same person I just I'll point that out  It's one person but on Google Plus you can contact anyone including a stranger in  Totally out of the eye of trolls you simply at mention them they get the private message and  It's it's a great way to contact people. It's very nice. Of course. They've set it up so that you can't be contacted  So that's yet another way to do it, but the sum total of all those  things on Google Plus  lends itself to  You cultivating a community with zero trolling in that community in your community

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are creating a society online and we have to this and and and we're creating a couple things at once  Code is law says Larry Lessig and the code of Google of Twitter is its law the code of Google Plus is its law  We're also creating norms and my argument about the month this stuff is that every time you egg on a troll you are trolling  You are an accessory to the crime. You are just as bad you say fight fight. You're just as bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's been our experience of the best thing to do is just  Go, you know give them nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know but no in essence the trolls have won the trolls and one because because because well  That's that's what everybody said is don't go after this guy don't do anything or anything  No, in essence, he then he keeps going and going and going  And and you've created a strisand effect here though Jeff. I  Well, I understood that I said that but I thought I just had it  I think the norms argument can only be taken so far

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean look at the Louis CK routine where he talks about what a horrible person he is when he's trolling  Compared to when he's in an elevator the situation  Will always always you know for you know  He's talking about how he's screaming like horrible things at people when he's driving  But you know when you're standing right next to somebody you'd never do that. I think that  Responsibilities. Yeah, we both have responsibilities. I don't think it's sufficient. I think that's so you're right Mike

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The the code creates an environment that brings  Certain behaviors and discourages others, but then we within that  Environment can choose to behave well or badly  Yeah, and and so what I'm really asking here and what you know you guys are trying to answer and Gina is trying to answer here is  Can we create a better society that we're building?  And or or or do we give up or do we just say well, you know  The trolls are going to be there and that's that and people are going to be abused and that's that  Well, one thing we don't want for sure is internet community where there are no women participating because they can't participate safely  And that's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For sure is internet community where there are no women participating because they can't participate safely and that would be a horrific effect

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No vulnerable people no vulnerable people of any kind  Yeah, right  And that's and that's that's Zaynep's point about about Ferguson and Twitter is the fact that it was open the fact that it could be  Controlled by an algorithm or the fact that it could be controlled by other people is what let Ferguson  Trend up to the point that got on media  So I'm fully recognizing the value of Twitter being open and I and I it's a it's a question  I'm not answering does that doom it?  To be is that is a social network. Is it doomed to be anti-social? Yeah, by the way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From the definitions we've heard here up worthy could be considered a troll  Most radio talk show hosts could be considered a troll. I mean I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is link baiting a form of trolling no, I don't think it is  I don't think it is because the idea is to disrupt somebody else's conversation  Not so it's more targeted and vicious if you want to start your own annoying conversation  Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Right. It's it's disruption if some if you set up an entire radio station  That's all about screaming  Political, you know venom then you know, that's not you're not disrupting anything. You're creating your own cesspool, right?  But if you go into somebody else's constructive conversation you wreck it deliberately. Yeah, that's yeah. Yeah. Okay  It's a form of vandalism  Exactly what it is for the same as for as for you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The don't feed the trolls policy like in my experience of what I've seen and what I've experienced  Do there are few there are few different types of trolling scenarios  One is the drive-by which is one or two days one or two or three days one person just talking crap at you  That is straight up do not feed the trolls block mute whatever walk away. I've had the long term literally  Almost been almost nine years of that one person and I've done that like don't feed the trolls  Don't don't respond to him never mentioned him don't but he keeps going and and that's the one I don't have the solution for  But then you have this the Zoe Quinn situation where you have, you know a bitter ex-boyfriend  You know awakening that the mass the sleeping giants of reddit jerks who are now doxing or the Adrienne Richards situation with the Kathy Sierra  situation where you just have this huge mass of people who are  You know creating accounts and using the network effect to attack someone, you know in a concentrated way  That that those are the situations where I wish that you know that the victim had better better tools  For reporting, you know, I mean blocking one person here there once in a while is one thing, right?  But when you have a situation like that  it just it makes it can make a  People person feel so helpless because they are because they don't have the tools and and Twitter takes months and months to respond to it to report  And someone else can't report somebody for you and all the things that we talked about  And that's where I just feel like if Twitter, you know Twitter needs to empower its empower its users a little bit more  I don't have the answers  But I do think this is something that has to be that has to be addressed and look I love Twitter  I mean, it's definitely my social network of choice. So yeah, I want it to change and that's why I'm not just saying  Oh, you know screw you're gonna go to Facebook or Google Plus because I just I just don't you know for whatever reason  I just don't feel you know, my people aren't there  I don't feel I enjoy, you know, I enjoy the community built up on Twitter for whatever reason  I mean if I thought that they really that there was no chance for change, you know, and that the platform was doomed  I guess I would leave I guess I just I'm just not there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing I observe is that people in the public eye have had to deal with this forever. Mm-hmm  Going back to Louis the 14th  Yeah, we're mad at him because he married his mistress instead of just keeping the mistress separate. Yeah, and  poor Alec Baldwin  Everybody who's in the public eye and and you kind of maybe even  Know you're making that deal you may not maybe not know how bad it's gonna be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know you're making that the belief is that you deserve anything you get if you're public

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what's happened here is just that the public eye is much much broader than it ever was before  So normal people are now subject to the same kind of public invective and it actually strikes home  I mean if you're a nobody in nowhere and  Nobody's gonna write an article in the National Enquirer about you and even if they did it probably would just kind of die  An instant death, but we're all a little internet famous all of a sudden

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm-hmm, and it's personal, you know, I could be at the park with my daughter and my phone could be blowing up with horrible  Yeah, like it's it, you know  I can wake up first thing in the morning and that's literally the first thing that I read on my phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we're all getting the Alec Baldwin treatment. Mm-hmm. Yeah exactly. We so I don't know what that means  I don't want to make this this week in trolls. So but can we move on a little bit or you can all have one final thought?  Why don't we do that? That's why I just kind of I just want to hear one summary

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Gina believes that things can get fixed to be better on Twitter Mike you kind of say move to Google Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't say that actually I think that Twitter is great for incoming information  It's just not a great place for somebody who wants to build a community of people and have great conversations  Lots of place to have conversations anyway because of the 140 character limitation  But if you want to do that Twitter Google Plus is much better than Twitter, but I would never give up Twitter myself  I mean, I like getting the incoming stream. Yeah, I'm not gonna give up either

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but I I guess my one last question is or  Point is I I presume this is the case  but I hope they're having discussions just like this there and  Grappling with it because it does in the end it does I think this may be a reason Twitter isn't growing as fast as Wall Street  To grow because people were scared of it. Yeah  Yeah, they're scared of is the bad people it brings out and if Twitter doesn't a fine way to deal with that while be  Still being more open than either Facebook or Google Plus to enable Ferguson to trend up  That's the magic of Twitter. It could be lost  You know, it becomes a scary place of bozos

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I bet Wall Street's actually more scared of is the thing that we most  Value Twitter for is is things like Ferguson  because that isn't not good for commercials and  Really what walls where Wall Street would like Twitter to go is somewhere that is a great place to put advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And and I think I don't know if you did that on purpose  But I think that's the place to talk about the next video  Yeah, which is that do we want is there is the ban on these videos which by the way?  There have been horrible videos on Twitter for a long time  But now this is a famous case that involves an American. It's a problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're talking about the American journalist who was recently like yesterday beheaded. Yes by ISIS  And they posted a video and that those videos have been circulating. I haven't I intention, you know  I've not looked at that video for obvious reasons. I don't want to see it right and yet. It's a horrific story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so Twitter's been pulling those videos down. No, they've been pulling down the accounts of people who posted the videos  They've been suspending people's accounts if they posted the video see they're good at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This video was posted on YouTube and YouTube pulled it  So if somebody tweeted a link to the YouTube video, right?  This is what they're doing  You couldn't see that even if you expanded the tweet and tried to play the video you couldn't because it's been pulled from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's on all the it's on all the video services is on  It's on all of them it's everywhere now after sharing a link to a news story about Foley's alleged killing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dick Costello announced this morning that any users who shared images of the supposed execution would have their feeds frozen  Not deleted. We've been actively suspending accounts as we discover them. Yes related to this graphic imagery images of okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so it could be a still

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People have been posting stills as I know meanwhile in the UK

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The police the government said it is a crime to link to the video they said it's an act of terrorism

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is an act of terrorism links to that is that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Matthew Riggerman's going there's a lot of disagreement  But that is a pure definition of censorship that is government forbidding some of speech and I think that even that goes too far

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mia Farrow  Tweeted blackout on group that murdered James Foley. Don't share video. Give them nothing respect James Foley. She has a point  That's appropriate for her to do as a private citizen, but it's not for government agencies to do  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right and Twitter was also killing the ice accounts  There's an argument that says that well, we should hear what they have to say so we can know how awful they are  I'm not taking a stand about that necessarily. This is but this is these are tough decisions that Twitter  Twitter has to make and so it can't argue that oh, we have to wait for somebody else to report something to us  Twitter made the decision to take this down to your point Gina Twitter made that and they didn't wait for people to to  To report accounts they're doing it on their own. So where is Twitter's line now is a legitimate question

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I started getting afraid of this  General area back when Facebook was caught doing experiments on their users  If you recall they would did a mood study to find out whether if people's  news feeds  Were negative or positive if they would turn around and themselves post things that are positive or negative  accordingly and they in fact found that it is contagious mood is contagious and I started thinking why are they testing that because they say  That all their tests are all about improving the service  So would do they are they contemplating the idea of adding to their algorithm a positivity?  Filter that weeds out bad news or negative comments by your friends and family by the way  It just remember that because you'll be happier. What's wrong with that?  Am I the only one who who read brave new world?  I mean, it's it's it's Soma is this is this where they're going is is the are we supposed as citizens if  Twitter and Facebook is the new public square  Are we as citizens supposed to just shut up and enjoy our bread and circuses and not be worried about all that more?  negative things and just because it's bad for selling things and you know  Or are they do they have a responsibility some kind to present reality to a certain extent it also has to be said that there  There's a value judgment here. There are lots of cultures where for example sexual imagery is far more upsetting than  violence  Violent imagery in fact if you even watch the Spanish language news in the United States  And you look at when they show a car accident. They just show it all they just you know in they would never do that in the US  So there's a cultural difference between  English speaking Americans and Spanish speaking Americans about how much violence is acceptable in the evening news and so that's a value judgment  That's being played there, and it's an interesting question

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So are you are you asking whether Twitter's just just to push this too far?  But that's what I do is Twitter's motivation for taking on the video commercial you bet  I'll say that is the question of course it is so by the way  This is this is a great Atlantic note Ethan Zuckerman wrote this piece in the Atlantic about advertising being the web's original sin  I responded that it wasn't  But leave that to the side in it he told the anecdote that when he was a tripod as one of the early employees  Ethan Ethan they had a problem with advertisers not wanting to be in bad sites, so Ethan said I'm sorry  We had good motives, but that's when he invented the pop-up  Because it was it was that way the ad was not actually on the site

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's why it's why my space got let's let's be clear. This is why my space  Got beat by Facebook because  advertisers were very reluctant to advertise on my space because they weren't sure exactly what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Environment their ads would pop up in and so and let's also say that my space was for this is this is this is Dana  Boyd's point my space was more urban right Facebook was far more wealthy and white and  As a result people were disenfranchised for a while there because of that yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mean if your Twitter you have a fiduciary risk your publicly held company of a fiduciary responsibility to do what's best for the stockholders  Which is to cultivate a environment that advertisers want to be on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And a less cynical view is that Twitter is a product and Facebook is a product and the product designers at those companies are creating a  user user experience  And they want that to be a good user experience right they want they want people to be to be happy and feel like everybody  Yeah, right right exactly everybody's and that's what brings in the advertising dollars, and that is the slipperiest of slopes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the other hand I am perfectly happy not to see images of  Beheadings in my Twitter stream. Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am too there there is a vast trove of things on Twitter right now that are not banned

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which you don't want to see and they don't matter very free with porn adult pictures and all sorts of stuff that you could not  See on Facebook you wouldn't see on Instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you also look at account like Brown Moses  Who's tracking this area, and he put up pictures of corpses today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because he's documenting a war and haven't we criticized news organizations for not showing the bodies in a war for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sanitizing or footage right I mean is it are the citizens of a country that that supports a military and sends people to war  Not supposed to know the realities that mean look at the effect of television on the Vietnam War and how that essentially is  Attributed the the anti-war movement to a very large extent to the to the fact that we could see the realities of it much more  Clearly than we could in previous wars are they should should they be mucking around with that sort of that sort of media?  Citizenship you know social movement kind of right which is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But now go to the other end of what we just had the conversation about so now we have  You know this is this is a I'm going to trivialize this badly, but I'm doing it for a point  You know Isis is the ultimate of a troll right Isis is is is trying to cause pain. That's their goal  Yeah, and so when you put up Isis's picture you serve their end  When you put the picture of the neighbor of mr. Brown in Ferguson you perhaps serve the Ferguson the Brown family's ends  And so trying to get context and motive in this discussion  Only complicated sit more, but is relevant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's I think a good distinction, but but but it's you can't you don't know whose end it is exactly you know it  Could be quite the opposite

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the problem. Yeah, I'm rereading technopoli right now by Neil Postman, and I disagree with  Huge amounts of it, but it's of course beautifully written and very provocative  and he argues essentially that technology has no morals and  replaces systems of morals  I'm oversimplifying don't get mad at me postman scholars like j. Rosen, but but  Inessence what you see in this case is is is the googles and twitters and Facebook's are trying to be reductive and reduce life to an algorithm  algorithmic rule set  So that they don't have to make individual judgments because any of those judgments are expensive and be there tricky

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the main thing I'm coming away with is how hard this is to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean we're dealing with primitive machines that aren't anything like actual humans at huge scale  I mean you know I like I don't I like of course these systems are messed up because the technology isn't there because we try to  You know make rules about how humans interact and those are complex and fragile and differ across space and time which in the internet's everywhere  I mean, there's a lot of different a lot of tough decisions here. Do you think that if Mike Brown's family asks  Twitter to not publish photos of him dead in the street that they wouldn't have done the same thing. I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't have the policy for it's a new policy and and then if if they were taken down at the Brown  Family's request or if Brown family said we don't want you to put the video up in the store or whatever the case may be  Then would there be other cases that say well, no you're trying to sanitize the news in the world same exact

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The video at the store now that's an interesting that's a different so because the beheading video you can argue  That's like that's that violates Twitter's turn  You know like in terms of service around violent images right but the video at the store is not violent  You know, so that's kind of a different thing. Yeah  To me like a video with the heading is  Is a lot more violent than a still of a body. I realize that these are extremely subjective fuzzy lines  but but it's  You know for what it's worth. I mean, I found the whole Ferguson thing has been so fascinating on Twitter  I found that if I had you know, if I had been gunned down hashtag  Amazing I saw media outlets changing the photos that they were using of Brown as a result of that  I mean, it was it was really incredible. I just I didn't even turn on the TV at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just watching Twitter and that's green by the way. That's how it should be handled  I feel very strongly that no organization should censor in any way but should give individuals the tools. Yes to self  Censor just protect themselves if it's a checkbox that says I don't want to see beheading videos  There should be a checkbox you can do that and that's much more effective you have control  You just you just showed that control Gina by saying well, I'm not gonna watch the TV news

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cheetahs point back to back to Twitter and trying to give better controls

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just need that give the users the tools don't try to do it for us. No, we don't need censorship

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need to that's exactly right now when the when the news of the existence of the video hit  I did a breaking news thing on Google Plus and  the vast majority of people  Talked about the news and talked about how horrible it was and there was a big conversation about Islam and all that kind of stuff  But there was a minority of people who said I don't want to even know about this  You're helping the terrorists by even posting this information  I didn't put a video there or a graphic picture of any kind  But the fact that I was reporting the news some people felt that I was  Helping the terrorists and I was even blocked by a couple of people and that's how it should work, right?  Anybody who's they get to choose? That's right  People should block me if they don't want to see the kinds of things I post where the platform has to intervene

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hmm, I don't know I disagree

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's what TV does it needs to do because it's a single channel  But that's what's so different about Twitter and all of our digital technologies. They can do that  They can know they can have the tools to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter has a rule about imposter accounts and says you can have them but here's the rules

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's an intervention by the platform an intervention in order to be make it clear, but they're not blocking those accounts they're just  Saying you have to label it in such a way, right if they can't refuse to change they block it  You don't think that's inappropriate  I think that's saying you have to you have to do these things so that people then can make an appropriate judgment  You want to empower the users ultimately you want to empower the users?  That's principle one. I agree with that principle one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, or Gina. No. No, go ahead Jeff. That's how I was gonna say  I mean, I think the helplessness issue is is where I mean that that's the kind of the worst part of it when you're when  You're the victim of this the situation not not only that there's you know, there's a threat or there's you know  Something that that that makes you feel bad. It's the feeling that you can't do anything about it  So empower empowerment is step one, but so go ahead Jeff. What's the next from there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I agree first principle is that give their user more control  absolutely agree  but then at some level  the  Just want to say the the brand  Does intervene it does care about things?  It's got to have a transparency about that and say what its rules are, right?  So Facebook won't let you put up nude pictures  That means it won't let you put up pictures of women breastfeeding their baby. I think that's where that's a slippery slope

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where they get in trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly, but Facebook decided that it wanted the for its commercial reasons. You just said a minute ago  They have to have a fiduciary responsibility  So they decide the breasts are bad business, but then cutting out  When  Just try to make an illustration here, yes  And so but the problem there is that is that Facebook tried to make an algorithm  Breasts equal no if I were a programmer  I'd find a way a clever programming way to say that if breast then like  Right, but that doesn't work because you have to make human judgment  You have to you have to come in and you do have to intervene in that case and say no no  You fool algorithm writer breastfeeding is fine. Now. I would also say breasts are fine  But put that aside because there's nothing wrong with the human body  But Facebook made a decision and and and that's their right to do and they said they don't want breasts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a better way to do it is to enforce you do have to have rules what you enforce is a taxonomy rule  That things are clearly labeled and they're not  Misrepresented that if it's a beheading video or a breast  It's clear what it is and then the users given the tools to filter and that's that's exactly how it should be  This should be proper taxonomy that you can enforce

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, but Leo you're still a slippery slope you stole the most because I remember I had a huge argument with with Ed Markey  Representative Ed Markey on a TV show many years ago when the V chip came in to  Cable boxes because the belief was of course violence on cable and sex on cable was going to corrupt all of our youth because  They're all a bunch of idiots and they're easily

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Susceptible to this horrible influence the way the way that's called the V chip has been implemented. You know that it has been implemented  And it works really great. That's fine. I can change my cable settings so that kids don't see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Various but here's the issue who decides what gets the scarlet letter. Yeah, and that alone is a  decision that can affect  Again, it's an attempt to algorithmic. Ah, yeah, you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think we're dismissing the idea that if you give enough control to users to block people or stop following people or  Whatever, that's plenty. That's plenty people don't follow that many people on Google Plus. For example, the max is 5,000  I know what it is on Facebook Twitter  It's probably unlimited or it's dependent on how many people you're following or something like that  But it's good enough as soon as somebody posts something offensive you unfollow them or you block them or whatever and over time you end

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With exactly the content you want to see I think no no Mike Mike no no cuz what you're giving up there is  the examples you gave and Gina gave of  Around you a thousand people are attacking you and yeah  But you may not see them  But you have this horrible life around you that actually you know somewhere out there is causing you misery and people are talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but over time it's bliss. Yeah, but well that's going on there's a there's somewhere between ignorance and is bliss and and actually affecting things  I mean basically if you create a cult a community within your social network  Whatever it is not just Google Plus and you thrive and live in that community and every time somebody does something like that you block them  Eventually, they're just outside kind of fog in the window of your life of your of your own life

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think in a lot of cases you're right, but there are cases where that is not true  They can cause problems people get attacked and attacked and attacked and just saying if they don't hear it  It's okay to do this. That's not a good norm for our society, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we should point out that all of these are privately held companies that could do any damn thing they please  Yeah, exactly. There's no First Amendment right when it comes to privately held companies, so  It's Twitter gets to do whatever it wants so but we can art we can I think reasonably argue that a  Good solution would be to censor less and and give users more power. I think that is the first principle

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that works. Yes, I think that's that but but there will be exceptions that yes that  Responsible humans will probably have to deal with and that's my point of intervention. Yes. Okay good. We've solved this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're gonna take a break and come back with the properly formed  Change-log we got a run. We're almost out of time here  in a trip any  shine up your changelog shoes  But first this is this is fun stuff  And I think one of the things about twig that is unique of all the shows we do is very philosophical  We get into these deep dives and I hope this isn't you know, it turns you all off at home  I think these are important topics

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is this has been a great conversation and and the reason why I'm glad we're talking about it is because I think the solution  Is for people like us commentators who have an audience thanks to you Leo and thanks to twig is to raise these questions  I we don't necessarily have answers, but I'm just really glad that we're talking about it because I think it's important  It's not easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also think that we have to acknowledge that this trolling thing which started out on the usenet and so on and has been  Sort of a geek problem is now as a very recently a big public mainstream  Problem and so it's also that's another good reason why it's good that we're talking about this right now because this is now totally mainstream

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like so many technology topics the New York Times wrote an article about it. It must be a big story. Yep  They're on it  There are trolls on the internet and the New York Times is on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very good that was that was great time. That's a parody site

Transcript:  You know, it's a really interesting story that came out this week is that Google's coming out with a under 13 year old  Sign up which is just control. Yeah parental controls and so on so the the just to summarize the story  the good news is that  Google will enable parental controls and have a version of  YouTube and gmail and probably some other properties that don't collect data  They don't collect private data which is against the law in any event and they'll hopefully be converting people who are  under the age of 13 who are using these services by lying about their age, right and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is so that's the yeah, that's right fun Facebook. I don't know if it happens on Google Plus, but it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably happens it does happen on Google Plus. I've seen kids show up my stream  I always sort of block them and delete them and stuff like that  But it's and then the downside of course is that they're targeting kids  They would be targeting children for a kind of Ronald McDonald style marketing of kids so that they they sort of develop their brand  preferences  You want to be on Google Plus right I don't know that they're gonna come out with their own clown but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That'd be great plus see the clown. That's right  I'd work for Google  You can do balloon animals in the shape of a G listen  Got the hair

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did you think about this Jeff Jarvis time magazine?  Rating its writers not only for the quality of writing the impact of stories their newsworthiness  But also that how well they produce content that's beneficial to the advertiser relationship

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know I keep rooting for these big old companies to survive somehow, but they keep shooting themselves in the foot. Oh horrific I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Showed this to Lisa. She said that's a good idea  No  At least but it's very you know she does sales right it's very tempting for the sales department to say hey Mike  If you could just tone down that story a little bit about smart things we'd appreciate it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know places. We don't I know places that have taken the traffic of a given writer and tried to calculate the the  CPW the cost per writer well, that's normal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dvorak tells that all the time the story all the time about how they would measure  You know which column you were an editor it mm-hmm you know about what it was a Windows Windows magazine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And other publications, and I've had the conversation where the basically that what happens is sure goes to you publisher  What the publisher usually is eventual you know all publish publishing companies like tech startups  They have a visionary founder who's usually editorial right and then what happens is  Eventually a salesperson rises in the ranks to become the publisher so the publishers like a super salesman even though they're in charge of  Sales editorial circulation and so on and so you always have that conversation  Can you not do that can you like you know can you and it's almost always about the headline because because publishers don't read  They don't read they don't read they see the headline doesn't sound

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watch with the sound on so it's all about your hair, so it's a constant. It's a constant battle in publishing  I take it back. I I really maligned Lisa. She did not  say  That was unfair to Lisa she understand actually that's one of the things that we've done  I think really well here is we've really made that clear to everybody that you you know you you tell the story  That's what's important, and we make it clear to advertisers to you're not going to get favored treatment, and I think  It's it's nice to be in a medium where you're a little bit more in control of this  Yeah, right where you don't where you advertisers have the expect understand that and from up front yeah look  You're not gonna get special treatment you're buying an ad yeah exactly  But I can understand how that gets to be a slippery slip yeah when I was the TV critic of people I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Called Hallmark Hall of Fame again and again and again the horrid treacle that it was  They pulled all their advertising people magazine it was a lot of money

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well Devorak tells a story. I think was Devorak it might have been Bill McCrone at  Microsoft at one point pulled all its advertising for PC magazine for one app one week  Yeah, and then said whoops they put it right back. Yeah, right  It's nice to be in a position where you have they have to advertise right? That's right  I  Think we are done I  Can't see anything else really important we can nothing we can't say for next week. It's a great conversation

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a good show so much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like Mike I'm so glad you were able to join us because I don't know you work there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you by dragging me, and I walked I walked all the way over from right over there. It was so good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  we are so thrilled I might join the team and  TNT has become I  Think what our tent really was the Journal of Record for tech news  Yeah, well you go there you know you're you know you're seeing you're gonna see Peter Kafka  You're gonna see all the people who are writing these stories come and talk about what they've what they know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really really fun to get all these great journalists in and have them talk about the stories. They wrote really like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love it. Let's because you're our guest  Let's let you kick things off with your tool of the week. I'm gonna make us all want to move to Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I consider Twitter to be a feature of Google Plus. That's how I like that. That's how I use it  I don't think it's a separate service and what I do is I have I have tweet a tweet a Twitter bot tweet tweet bot  What's it called the desktop?  third party  Version of that shows me Twitter by yeah  And it's great because it just streams in with no intervention on my part  And I can see breaking news and all kinds of things. Yeah, and  When professor Jarvis post something I get it right away, and I'm just kidding. I'm I'm this is I'm using it right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I want to show this there's tweet bot on the map

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's an input and I have several streams and so on and when I post I use a service and this is the tool of  The week called friends plus me so if you go to friends plus the word plus dot me  You can download this free tool and what it does it automatically posts your Google Plus posts on Twitter and other sites now

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a controversial point people say don't never never do that. Yeah, I used to do that with Twitter to Facebook and I yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  And it often doesn't work and I personally don't think it works from Google Plus to Facebook because my family doesn't want to see right all  The stuff that I post on Google Plus and that's moment mainly who I'm concerned about on Facebook  But for Twitter it's perfect because what happens is it takes the first line of whatever your Google Plus post is it?  Posts that as the tweet on Twitter and puts a simple link back to Google Plus  We can have a civilized conversation that you control about that topic and it works fantastic  It looks beautiful that the tweet is indistinguishable from an ordinary tweet  But the beautiful thing is you get all your Google Plus community and all your Twitter community together in one conversation talking to each other and  It's a troll free thing that happens on Google Plus rather than on Twitter  Yes, people can go off and talk about on Twitter and they do but for the most part it brings a huge critical mass back to Google  Plus now they also support  LinkedIn  Tumblr  app net if anybody's using app net and  And you know private blogs so a single tweet can go out to all of those you can schedule them you can say okay  When I post something on Google Google Plus posted on Twitter an hour after you post it on Google Plus  You can do all kinds of flexible things like that and again  The the it's a it's a freemium service so you you know the basic service is free and you can do just about everything  I just described with a free version and then you can upgrade for team support and things like that  But I recommend that everybody at least try it again. It's free and just try it to see how it  What it does for your Twitter feed it's essentially  Dragoons Twitter into your Google Plus orbit and that's a great way to use Twitter. I think I'm signing up right now for zero dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Up to five accounts free right well that's zero. That's everything. I'm just want to use it for yourself  Yeah, yeah, very cool Gina Trapani your tool
