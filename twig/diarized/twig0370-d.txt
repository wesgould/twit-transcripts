Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there we go. We're like twins almost nice. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was I would ask you what?  Sunset, but I don't think it really makes any difference at all  I don't know. What what do you want? What do you want to talk about today?  We're still waiting for the other shoe to drop on  Now that Apple has announced its phones  Will be with great interest that we'll watch and the rumor is in three weeks  Google announced its phones the codename no longer Nexus. These will be pixel phones if you had to believe  The rumors  Android police says Google's pixel phones will be the iPhone competitors. We've demanded for years. I  kind of agree with the premise which is that Google has  They've they've really kind of punched down a little bit with these  phones initially they were developer phones, right so that's fine you just a platform that's pure clean and  Suitable for a developer with the latest version of Android was sufficient, but I want especially in light of all the  Malware and the problems we're seeing out there. I want to see a  flagship phone  Come at a mountain

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  You know what they have been that to some extent I mean the 6p is pretty good  Yeah, but  The things that the one before the six pieces. It's the matter of one, but you have the six the the Shamu

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the world's largest  You have the phone that proved to me that I that six inches is too big. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Said this I just love the screen on it. Yeah, I just like a street under six inches

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we know now of course that the note seven is no longer a pretenders of the throne  Right which is  Said what a great phone  I would see but what I'd like to see is a note seven like phone made by Google with guaranteed  Android updates will they do that this time around?  Matthew you agree you seem to think this would be a good thing. Yeah, I do and and you know, I've been happy with I've had

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nexuses, I don't have one right now. I've got an LG but I was happy with them  But I think they've never really reached the sort of same  level  Competitively where they were going to appeal to a huge numbers of people because they're not sold by a carrier partly, right?  Partly and so people just weren't exposed to them  But also all the benefits of them seem just too nerdy to explain to people so oh  I you know, I get updates pushed straight from Google. Well, that doesn't most people  It's hard to explain why that's a big deal  And I just think this sort of  The finish and the production and the and just the marketing of them or lack of marketing  They never really hit the kind of same level. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Think there's a perception I don't true or not and I think Google contributes to this perception that Android phones are the cheap  phone  There are certainly a lot of cheap Android phones out there  But that's why I would love to see and I guess for I guess Samsung or the notch  $850 for note 7 that's that's right up there with Apple. It's not a cheap and you can cook on it. Yeah  You could use it as I actually had what I loved it was a great phone and mine was not problematic at all  Never got hot, but I didn't dare keep it. Yeah, I don't take it on a plane. Well, that's right  I'm not you know, I don't want to be singled out at the gate  Yeah, although how they're enforcing that there they looking at people's phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I know someone I saw someone mentioned on Twitter they had to they had to prove that they had a note 6  I think it was you're kidding that it really

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, wow. Wow. Wow, is this overblown? I mean we know that there's only been maybe 70 incidents. Yeah  Sure, two and a half million phones. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it was I certainly well being plugged in it didn't doesn't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  While I raised Samsung for their  Alacrity and thoroughness in the recall I don't praise them for their forthcomingness if that's a word  In other words, they have it is now it is I just made it over they haven't really told us what it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the problem? No, no, well, and that's a that's a big problem for them actually too because  they you know sources have said that this only affects North American or or at least this side of the  of the Pacific this  Phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Affiliate battery as a bright Chinese battery

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what it but that's not the way a lot of media outlets are reporting it  Especially the ones that don't know any better, right? You don't want to report. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I had the Chinese phone and I brought it into T-mobile and the T-mobile clerk said well, you know  This is the one made in China. You're probably okay. And I said, well, is it your recommendation that I not turn it in?  He said no  No, no, no my recommend no, please my recommendation is you turn it in  Nobody wants to be the one that said well that phones okay, and Samsung's not saying I mean, I wish they would  Yeah, there was a phony IMEI database. Don't trust that  Samsung isn't even really saying exactly what's wrong. So we don't even know if it's only while charging  Although apparently they've said we're only we're gonna send it an update  You know week or two that will only allow you to charge your note 7 to 60% that kind of implies

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an overcharging problem. Yeah, right and they have said it's the battery, right? I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's clear the battery I mean that's where the energy is so well if you look at where the burn the burn is happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's right over the bed  The battery is a slice of the phone like right here on the on the on the side and if you look at it  That's that's clearly here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Knowing what's wrong because if it's if it's some like low tolerance thing if it wants the things burn you can't tell  right, yeah  Basically something sorting out the battery and it's something is into our energy into a piece of metal and that's that starts to fire

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the mechanism for these things. It's at this point. It's gonna be very hard to know what's true  There's a kid yesterday who was burnt  They thought by a note 7 turned out by a different Samsung phone not while charging while he was holding it. Hmm six-year-old  well, the the video that you  see if  You look at it carefully and this is that this is this is the video that started at all  That's right where the battery is and there are those who claim you can see where the fire began up here right where the circuitry  That keeps the battery from overcharging. There's circuitry in lithium-ion batteries. It not only prevents overcharging but has heat sensors  So if the if the battery starts to heat up while charging will will will disconnect  and all of those  Things are designed to do to prevent exactly this which is  Catching on fire and because by the way, it's in such there's the volatile chemicals inside of lithium-ion batteries and  So they burn and it's in a very enclosed space. So that's where you get the explosion  it's like you're it's like a you're burning inside a pressure cooker and  So there are those who say I can look at the phone and I can tell where that it's you know happening  Right exactly where you'd expect it from an overcharge problem  Nevertheless, I wish Samsung would say exactly what's going on  I would love for them to say here's how to tell but apparently they don't know cuz they don't they're gonna take them all back  That must cost them a lot of money. Yes, gonna be a billion dollars or so and not to mention the damage to their reputation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well the stock cratered. I mean if you see if you look at the stock chart, it's it's bounced back

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably not fair because it's only a small percentage of Samsung's overall revenue is the mobile but those things always get I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just such a black eye, you know $26 billion of market value  It's like you had one job, right? Yeah, you're not to have your phone blow up  Yeah list of things your phone should not do one catch on fire

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By X KCD and  X KCD number 651

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, let's get it here  XKCD  651 there's somebody in the chat room says that he was on a United flight from Nashville to Newark this week and the  stewardess, I'm sorry the flight attendant  Said if you have a Samsung device you have to turn it off  We're not gonna check to see whether it's a note 7 or not. Just turn off all Samsung devices  But I don't even know if that's the right answer because if it's only during charging  Mm-hmm, here's X KCD, but if you're worried about bombs  Why are you letting me keep my laptop batteries if I overvolted them and breach the cells?  It would make a sizable explosion and his wife or girlfriend says oh god. It's okay dear in a moment  He'll realize I have a good point to return my water. Oh  Dear oh  Yep, you really don't want to talk logic with the TSA. No, just want to shut up  Do whatever they say and thank God you got on your plane  Anyway, yeah, I feel I actually feel bad for Samsung. I think they made a great device. They obviously made a mistake  This was supposedly and again, I would like to hear Samsung story  But what I've read is that the Samsung battery affiliate for the first time they'd used this  new Samsung battery affiliate and they were the ones who made the bad batteries that no recall in China because  China requires all the phones be made in China with Chinese components including the battery  My t-mobile phone as I think most t-mobile phones were made with Chinese batteries in China  Didn't have the was it TST IT DSI battery that suppose but again a lot of this is conjecture  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Feel like we should apparently the stock lost 14 billion dollars in value. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you know what to me that's a buy signal because Samsung makes bulldozers and refrigerators

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, and it has rebounded and even if it's a massive recall, right? It's only a couple billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's five percent of their business the mobile business. It's not  Wow, I just so I think there's some overreaction and at the same time like my t-mobile salesman if you ask me should I return it?  Yes  Because they give you your money back and they give you a $25 credit  The sad thing is they don't have note sevens to replace it with right and I think that  Anybody who says they'll have them in a week or two is wrong  there's no way especially now that Samsung has gone to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and  Is working on a full total real legal recall? There's no way they're gonna be able to get that phone back in the country  without  Tests and how long is that gonna take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really too bad because these are effectively lost customers for for the large part  I think right because because these are people if you bought a seven when it came out  That means you're  You're a leader in this you're you're you're willing to spend a lot of money for that big phone  And you're not gonna go get an alternative phone like a galaxy or you could get yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's nothing really available for that customer yeah there is just happens Apple just came out with a new phone  And it's the same price and I bet you Apple 50% of those note seven customers. Yeah, I would bet you  Because there isn't anything comparable in the Android space right galaxy. That's true. That's sevens pretty close  But it's last, you know, it's six months old. Nobody anybody buys a note seven wants the latest grades  Not surprisingly  Apple stock hit a new high. Yeah, yeah Samsung down Apple up. What a surprise apples  already said they're not gonna report weekend sales figures pre pre sale figures because  Whatever the number is it's just supply number because the demand exceeds the supply and I think that that's true  Right just anybody who's tried to get a new iPhone knows they're pushed back now to November same thing with the watches  Apple fans just  It there if nothing else they're consistent  And  You know so Apple's I think Apple's gonna benefit greatly. Oh, definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple fans are like that Futurama, you know meme just shut up and take my money, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't want to hear anything about it and how and how you know once you lose that customer  I'm very much guess it's a zero-sum game once. Yeah, once you lose that customer Samsung's not getting them back

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah until the iPhones start blowing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing this has happened to everybody including apples had this else had this problem Toshiba had to do a recall  Lithium-ion batteries are inherently kind of day. Remember that Dell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Video of the laptop with flames coming

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, I mean this X KC the comics is actually correct. These things are because you don't sit on your laptop typically

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you don't have your pocket, you know holding your hand

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wonder I so so you bring in your phone  You can take get a loner in some cases the loner is like like the Samsung  You know wonder mint or something. It's some weird, you know crap phone  And you just use that you're supposed to use that until the net note sevens come in  But in a month when they still haven't come in  Are what are people gonna do and  So I just took the money I said fine. Give me a credit  I'll figure out what to do, but I'm gonna I also have other phones I could use what if that's your phone  Mm-hmm. Yeah, exactly you buy an iPhone  Maybe not maybe Android people love notes love notes  I'm a huge note fan. I've had every Galaxy Note. I love them. I love the big screen. I love the stylus  Anyway, so yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's never appealed to me for some reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what if you held the note seven before it exploded you note that it  It is a bigger screen than the iPhone's five point seven inches. It is much higher resolution than the iPhone  It's old. It's a beautiful screen in a smaller package  Yeah, that's fair. So you get you know the the bezels on the iPhone  Are yeah on the on the note. There's no bezels and maybe it's just the stylus  Well, you don't have to use it. Yeah  But that if by the way, if you don't want to style it so you don't need the bigger screen  You can get the slightly smaller as seven. It's the same basically the same hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like Apple's gonna get rid of the hard  button

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a haptic button so it's it's it's there's a ring there you can feel it  But it doesn't actually it's not actually mechanicals like when they met went from the spinning click wheel on the  iPod to the static click wheels the same thing and then apparently it buzzes. I haven't held it yet though  I've talked to several who have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it sounds like they're gonna get rid of that completely and then the rumor is next year. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Figured they're gonna get rid of all  Holes, oh, it's gonna be a as close to a slab of glass as they can get. Yeah  Wouldn't even be surprised if they got rid of the lightning port, although that would be a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Disaster and there'll be no power button. It's just on all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can't turn it off. Oh, we know when to turn it off. We'll take it. Yeah, we'll turn it off for you  Yeah, we can tell well they can when you're not using it. They can yeah  What do you need an on off button for we'll take it for a question. That's Apple's philosophy. We'll take it from here  So October so supposedly rumors October 4th, we'll see the pixel phones  reading at the Android developer site developer dot Android comm  This is something developers across greatly interested in the adoption rate on various  Android operating systems  There is 0.1% of all Android phones are still running  Froyo wow 2.2 1.5% gingerbread 1.4% ice cream sandwich  It goes up though by the time you get to jelly bean and there are three different versions of jelly bean for 1 4 2 and 4 3  You're getting some some numbers here. I'll do some let's see. That's 13 maybe 15 maybe 16%  Jelly bean KitKat 27% that's 4 4  So  Almost half of all the Android devices are running for earlier  Then lollipop lollipops this nice big wedge here, that's  The last one biggest single one, isn't it? Yeah, that's a total of 24% 25% Sorry one quarter  of all  30 alright 35% Wow one more than a third of all Android phones are running five  Marshmallow  18.7% and apparently  Nougat is not even big enough to show on this chart well  It's less than the live one. Yeah, it's pleasant point 1% for Nougat, but but that's only because there's only  The only people have Nougat right now are people who have picks Nexus's  yep, and  I guess that new LG phone is gonna be the first phone shipping with Nougat  That's alright. I mean  the problem is there's massive Android malware flaws, there's a new one and  Nobody is protected not even they're just I think the September Android security update fixes it  But I don't think I have it on my 6p yet  If I I mean  And if you don't have a Nexus you're not gonna get it for a while  that's  That's not good for Android. I  Feel like it's like the presidential election. There's really no  There's no good choice  So who's Trump in this I don't know I think Android is Trump  And stay the course Apple is the stay the course safe choice, right?  Android is gonna be Android is the well  You know, it's it's different. It's it could be good  It's definitely experimental and it could also blow up in your hands. I  Think it is actually a very close metaphor  Not to get political or anything, but I feel like that we are at this point now where I prefer Android phones  But I'm nervous about the the the rapid spread of malware  There were so many apps that had this this is not this is a zero day  There were two and a half million downloads of one of the exploits in Google's Play Store  Yeah, I got hit by it. You did. Mm-hmm. How did you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it just started  Everything went haywire. So my god, I don't know for sure  That that's what it was because I'm not you know an Android  Software engineer and I don't I don't understand enough about but the phone did you wipe the phone and start over?  Yeah, literally just started having seizures  Google Play Store would not load Google Play Services the underlying service would not load  Kept saying it it wasn't there, but it was there  Tried a whole bunch of different things eventually just had to wipe the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and that's probably a smart thing to do because the worst  case scenario is that you wouldn't have any weird symptoms, but you would be rooted and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right and have malware on there and the problem with that one is, you know, they  So weird things start happening with your phone  Like a 99% of phone owners would just have no clue what to do. Just turn it off and turn it back on again  They don't know, you know, they're not gonna go looking for how do I you know?  Reinstall Google Play Services when I can't get to the Play Store, they're just gonna be like my phone is busted, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'll bring it in but I again I'd far prefer that  You do the worst case which is everything seems completely normal. But meanwhile, everything you're doing is being passed off  Security expert this is a one of these is called dress code  Forty different Google Play Store applications  One of the most popular apps downloaded between a hundred thousand and five hundred thousand times  So the advice here by the way is well  Make sure you buy an Android phone from somebody who's already agreed to take the Android security updates  To don't download frivolous apps  Like something like the worst one was a clash of clans  It was a hack that purported to give you clash of clans gold  Don't fall for that  Right, you know get your apps from well-known main, you know, it's okay. It's not Facebook and snapchat that are the problem  It's you know  Chest of gold for clash of clans. I don't know this again because I'm not smart enough  But what started happening before this?  I got Google Play pop-up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pop-ups generated by random websites and I'm pretty sure they weren't you know, that's almost surely malware, right?  Yeah, and so then all it takes is to click on  That it comes up so quickly, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're not sure what to do. You know, you don't know what to do. You don't know what to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't know what to do. You don't know what to do  It comes up so quickly right you're not sure what to do, right, you know, you don't have to necessarily  Install the whole thing or

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of depressing because I love Android and I really don't like the  Direction Apple's taking into a more and more closed environment  I like to have more power over my phone, but I just don't know  I mean, I guess my my choice at this point after giving up the note 7 is I'm only gonna get a Google made phone  That's why personally I hope that they do a flagship quality front phone. Mm-hmm. I  Want it to be the best and I want Google to make the best Android phone you can buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why wouldn't they at this point well and yet it sounds like from the Android police thing as though it's not gonna be  I know, you know top of the line HTC, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which I like  I'm glad to see HTC back in the game. Although the everything that all the rumored stuff that's leaked so far  Doesn't look like there's anything new or good or interesting about the phones except that they're made by HTC

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the complaints go ahead Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the other thing that the Google did was was make  Phones at a good price point, you know  The Nexus 5 was very well competitively priced and the Motorola ones were actually pretty committed to be priced when they were doing those as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So often it's not just offer to offer a $400  Yeah, and and you reason the way you save is the way that one plus three has saved an axon has saved  And the honor eight from Huawei has saved which is taking out some of the high  you know higher end features and then make one that is a I would love to see a  No compromises phone from Google. Yeah  Yeah, like one of each and  You know what Google this is the solution to the note 7 problem, this is solution to the malware problem  And this is I think kind of what Google's thinking is we got to take we got it  Solve this or we're gonna you know Android is gonna  End up being a you know, a ghetto by the way you compare some marshmallows 18.7 percent  It's been out for more than a year  Ios 10 which came out on Monday  14 and a half percent already in three days

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, that's one day. That's 24 hours  Yeah, it's probably it's probably 25 percent by now  And that's and that's with rumors of them breaking phones. Yeah. Yes, and then the first hour there apparently breaking phones  So yeah, I saw a lot of that. Yeah, they've Apple says they fixed that  All right enough about phones. I we have a show called all about Android. That's probably  a better place but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the other one there was the them saying they're making other seven inch one, which I'm glad  Mm-hmm. The next seven that's good because I I'd love those devices  I've still used them and I want to keep making that form factor. It's a really good form factor

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know so interesting everybody who had a Nexus set or not everybody but many many people  And I include myself as long as well as you  Love that size. There's something about that size. Now you like Shamu. You like the six inch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's the size of a paperback book is exactly the exact size of a penguin  Which means it's a really good one-handed reading device not an emperor penguin penguin publishers an actual thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, not an actual thing  I still have my Nexus 7 right here in my drawer. I use mine. It's on my desk in the other studio  I use it every day. I'm I'm over there in the other room. Yeah, but it's but it is it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a nice device. It's the weights good  It's a nice device  It's the weights good is big enough to watch TV on without feeling like you're squinting and it's it's big enough to read  it's a pretty well as a  Device you can use on public transit and in expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, what was that when they sold it was 200 something right? Yeah, the last one I bought was 150 dollars  They're going up again now if they look collectible. So this one is supposedly will be built by Huawei, which I which made the 6p  I think Huawei is a very good  Chinese phone manufacturer four gigs of RAM that would mean a probably a premium device  Ev leaks says on track for release before the end of the year  I would think and we talked about this last week with Stacy  We're we're thinking this October 4th announcement is going to be more than just phones. They'll announce the availability of the Google Home  Amazon echo competitor 4k Chromecast form K Chromecast. This could be a very big event  It would make sense. Google would wait till Apple wait till all that  Okay. Now we're gonna show what we got

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the other thing is would they have some of the VR stuff they were talking about it in the spring  Cuz that is that the daydream?  Daydream and they optimize hardware and things for that and the piece I'm wondering is does that affect what cameras they use if they?  Will make the VR capture devices that may be interesting as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting, although I have to say I'm starting to think that VR  Was a flash in the pan. I hate to say that  It's the new 3d. I think it I I really had higher hopes for it  It plays better than 3d in the sense that the first time you use it you get very excited  But the problem in 3d, I don't think that's the case. But the problem is it is that many people it nauseates many people  Yeah, it's a it's a good experience, but not a compelling not the one that you want to spend hours a day in that sweaty visor

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was talking to a  Guy who's in the business and and I mentioned that the couple of times that I've tried I get motion sickness, you know  using a electric toothbrush, so it's a it's a  Big problem and I was saying, you know, I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to use any of these devices  And he said that they're they're hoping at least that they can get past that. Yeah using technology  So they've been resolution years. Yeah, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That so I've the in it's kind of like big tobacco the  The industry or big sugar we're learning now the industry  Line is oh, it's latency that's making you right queasy  right and we can fix that with faster hardware and  They say that and they've been saying it and they say it and every time the new Oculus Rift came out  They said look the latency is way down isn't as much better and it's not I'm convinced  It's the disconnect between the convergence distance your eyes  Being if you have two eyes converge on a point that is the point you're looking at and then in in normal world  That would also be the focal distance. You're looking at your finger  You focus on that and that'd be convergence and just as in 3d  By the way, there's the same problem with 3d in VR your convergence focal distance is not the same  Right, and I don't think they can fix that  That's what that's what makes you barf

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One is there's two effects going on at once one is  Focal distance and convergence you're right that that is an issue. The other is that there's two ways you judge distance  one is  Are they you know?  Are they differently focused? I've got separate things  The other thing you do is you move your head side to side and watch things move against the background, right?  And that second one hasn't been possible  Until the next generation of VR because it what because the feedback loop wasn't quick enough  So that one does make the difference does reduce the nausea quite a lot  But it means that they've got to keep that that loop tight. But yeah, the other problem of  I'm focusing here, but my eyes think it's over there. That is a problem. Yeah, that's that's doable. That's part of what's there are  Things that there is headsets that do that, but they're mostly focused on the AR world and they're not cheap enough to ship yet  In mass quantities, but you can act but you can do the overlay stuff that works at different depths by having a light field  Thing that projects right but yes, but they're still in like research labs and they're not shipping this year

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm really interested in that though because I actually do think that mixed reality or whatever you want to call it  Augmented reality different companies have different terms. I think that actually has a lot more I agree potential than than true sort of  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That you don't get as nauseous because you have real-world grounding points exactly Tim Cook just said that in an interview Apple's CEO said  Yeah, we think augmented reality because VR seals you off from the world augmented reality. You're part of the world  We think I think Apple that's where Apple's putting their dollars and I think we've learned a little bit from the VR experiment  I'm I'm really thinking by the way  Thank you haven't done in the chat room has passed along an article  Where I love I love this a VR researcher says well the problem is  You need a virtual nose  How to reduce VR sickness just add a nose a massive nose sitting in the game frame

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah  That doesn't feel right to me  You know, that's a nice try but  That's not gonna help with either one of those problems we just I think you can make VR

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tenable, but I think it's for a variety of reasons  It's gonna be hard to get people to spend hours in a VR helmet. I think it could be great for some things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I was fascinated by this company that's focusing on  medical applications  not just for  doctors and sort of operating but for you know patients who are bedridden  To be able to escape and see you know parts of the world they may never see again  I mean, that's fascinating. That's not a broad kind of mass market application, but still interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm as somebody who's probably gonna have to visit the world that way in the next 20 or 30 years  Yeah, I'm looking forward to VR in the in the nursing home. Yeah  Because yeah, it'll open up a whole world to you and you know a lot of this I think is in first talking to somebody  Yesterday or on Monday  Longtime  Computer science guy and I said I think a lot of this is influenced by the fact that we all read Neil Stephenson snow crash  Yeah, and we just want the metaverse. Yeah  And he agreed he said yeah, everybody was really reading Neil Stephenson 20 years ago  That was the thing and we're all trying to figure out a way to jack in and be in this virtual  environment  But just the desire to make it so doesn't it  Desire to make it so doesn't necessarily make a second life will come back  Yeah, he was by the way  This is the guy who wrote the alpha Ville Herald or whatever the newspaper in Second Life among he also invented gopher pop male  Yeah, and  It was very instrumental in VRM early VR ML  Experiments who was this guy we interviewed on Monday mark McKay. Okay, his name great great interview  Remember VR ML. Yeah, remember  Yeah, and he was a big and he was a big proponent of Second Life and he said well the problem with Second Life is  This is kind of similar to the problem in all social networks  When people are anonymous, they just act badly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not it's not about anonymity it's about social norms  It's about how people have sort of decided that place behaves what it's like  So if there's a culture of misbehaving then people join in that misbehavior if there's a culture of like working together and being polite  They'll join that culture

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Something like that, which is the story or the purpose of the goal of the place also will help that right exactly  And he talked about Eve online, which is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game  He said there are areas in Eve online where you are evil. That's part of the gameplay you choose evil  But it's but it's it's fine because it's sustained by this storyline in this in this rationale, it's not chaotic evil  Twitter is chaotic evil. I  Don't know I  Really took place I read an essay about this a couple of weeks ago. Oh good. Is this on a pay us a piggy knee or figgy knee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, this is on this is on  Not even that it's a published publication what like I'm like on dentrees

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, you know, all right, you find it and we'll talk about it when we come back. We're gonna take a little break  This is I always love twig because it's our most intellectual show where we get the most abstract and interesting stuff  I think we couldn't have three better people to do that right now Kevin Marx from Indie camp org  Let's put that on the web dot org. Sorry take away the camp leave the web  Indie web org we'll put that in your lowest third I think  And  from net app and a host on floss weekly and often co-host on new screensavers Aaron Newcomb  He still gives that his Google Plus handle. That's right. I still use Google Plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I still prefer it way more than Facebook. Oh, I do too

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, what do you notice myself using social media a lot less in the last few months me too  I've kind of I think I'm burnt out on it. Yep. I just want to keep to myself  And that's why Matthew Ingram is in Ontario  He's a he's a fortune.com and another great thinker. I love the big thinkers shows  We'll have more in just a little bit. But first a word from a brand new. I'm very excited  Sponsor who is a very old friend. Maybe you saw our interview just a couple of weeks ago with David. Hunter Meyer Hanson DHH  I've interviewed his partner Jason Fried many times  You remember 37 signals they're now base camp last couple of years have been base camp base camp  Three is all new and man it just gets better and better and better  I you know the key and we we experience it here is as a as an organization as a company grows or a team grows  From the easily managed, you know handful of people to somewhere about 10 to 20 people  It just gets more difficult to have the communications  To stay on track to to to work together and that's what base camp solves  Jason and David and the people at base camp spent a lot of time thinking about better ways to work and  Base camp three is the tool you're looking for it brings everyone together  It's and the tools are fantastic. It's a cloud-based workspace. So you don't have to host a server  It's easy to use. It's always secure and it puts everything  Jason calls it a single point of truth a single so everything is in one spot all your company's projects and communications  Everyone knows what they need to do can keep track of what they're doing and what others are doing  Where things are on any project everyone stays accountable, but it's really better than that because it's not like enforcing accountability  It's about communication. Everybody wants to do a good job and base camp makes it possible  The idea behind base camp is that in a as in a real base camp where mountain climbers  You know gather around the campfire talk about their preparation to say summit  The same applies to business when you're working on a project you sit around the campfire and you communicate  This is all based on research user hardcore  User research they discovered six core things that businesses of all size needed to do their work best  Message boards they call those campfires to stay with a metaphor that way everybody's on the same page and you also have a history  Automatically so you can look back real-time chat real-time pings  So you could say hey, what's you know, ask a question  Automatic check-ins to make sure projects stay on track to-do lists so people know who's responsible for what?  Of course, you've got to have document and file storage not only your own  But it'll integrate with whatever you're using whether it's Dropbox or Google Drive and all of that  So everyone can access and work on the most up-to-date versions and then a schedule a calendar  That integrates with all the existing calendar solutions. So, you know where things stand what's what's coming up what you need to do  This is the only product that gives you all the tools in one easy to use platform  That saves you time and training and onboarding too. It's also used a lot for client projects  So it's not just internal collaboration  Although it's great for that, especially if you have a remote team members  But you can use it with your clients to in fact  They have great setups so that your clients only see what you want them to see not the whole base camp things like that  You can create as many base camps as you want. You invite the right people to each one. There's no but now this is the thing  I love  It's the reason I want to use it. There's no per user fees. Jason does not believe in seat licenses  companies of all sizes use base camp teams say they can't live without it a  Hundred thousand businesses are using it today. I went to the base camp site a couple of days ago  8,000 people signed up for base camp last week  last week  And it's free you could try it for free  So it takes no time to learn they have of course lots of great tools to help you learn how to use it  But you can sign up right now for a free trial get your team on board when you're ready  Play around with it and look at the pricing because nobody has better pricing  They really make it easy for small or large  And to do this and because they don't have 29 bucks a month no matter how big your team is  What yeah, this is awesome base camp comm slash tweets not even that right now  It's free base camp comm slash tweets set it up. Give it a try  This is such a good solution if you I'm sure you've heard about it  Maybe you've read their books rework these guys really think a long time and what kind I love David and Jason. They're really smart  Basically Ruby David Hannah Meyer Hansen wrote Ruby on rail so he could write base camp  So that's that's kind of high recommendation  base camp comm  slash  Twit not twig twit we got one offer code, and I like that too makes it a little bit easier alright  What were we gonna talk about we were gonna talk about social media?  We were gonna talk about anonymity and you had an article that you were gonna share with us Kevin Marks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I have stuck in the running order and also me in the chat  It's called how Twitter got angry. I  Read this I think I read this after our last conversation. Yeah, we're on here  Yeah, and I pitched it to fast company and I said would you like to publish this issue? So

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know I went like two thousand words long so I went run we straight the entire thing  But the but it's I'm remaking the argument that I made before is that Twitter started out as a place  That was primarily about following people and choosing who to follow it showed you who?  It shows you stuff by choice, and I got quotes from Evan and people talking about that early on  We believed which was a recipient driven utility you choose what content appears in your timeline  It was what Jason Goldman said in 2008  I know that that was the shape of it the idea was that you saw stuff that you followed the at replies  Were there but they they were they were off to the side you had to go and look for them specifically in the foot  They weren't the first thing you saw we got to the site first thing you saw was the people who's chosen to follow  And that shaped the kind of discourse you had there because you were mostly seeing stuff you chosen to see  and when the  When it became a mobile app and the app replies became notifications  That changed the character of Twitter because suddenly the most important thing was what someone was saying to you  And it stopped you being about who you chose to follow and it became about who chose to shout at you  Now that doesn't affect most users  initially because  people weren't aware of the mechanism and  The effort to do an act is not that high but it has an effect on people whose stuff takes off  Because suddenly they get lots of out replies and that will appears  And even in even if it's a benign thing, so I had a tweet last week that  Has got nearly a million views so far which is I think it's probably the most pointy word thing I've ever written  and  Just the fact that happened meant that I my phone was like buzzing continuously because I was getting replies and reposts and things to it  And this is this and this wasn't it that people were being mean to me  they were just sharing it and commenting and  Doing that but just did the sort of the level of traffic that was coming through changed my experience of Twitter and maybe  The tweet will take some explaining as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, this is why I hate Twitter because it's a lot of very succinct inevitably shortened  Often highly abbreviated out of context messages. I read my Twitter stream and I feel like I'm having a stroke like I am an oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand it does it is going on around in jokes. Yes. Okay. I'll put the top with the tweet in the chat. Hang on  So this  This tweet was  30th of August I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How to talk to a woman wearing headphones  be a Kardashev type 2 civilization in  HD 164 595 when I read that by the way  There's Jodie Foster in a headphone with a looking, you know  And this is from contact looking at the dish when I read that I go uh-huh and I go to the next tweet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so so the point is this and I thought that would be people's reaction because there were two this was reaction to two news stories from  Two weeks ago  There was the how to talk to one wearing headphones thing where some  Douche has written this thing about there's one where headphones what you do is go up to her and wave your hands in her face  Get it headphones off so you can tell her she's cute

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That'll make friends and influence people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and people were saying how dumb is this guy and then that then there was a running gag of how to talk to one wearing  headphones right with it and then the same day there was a story about  picking up signals from  The star HD 164 595 that may be aliens which turned out to be human signals  Yeah, which is which yeah, we said turn out to be like noise. So from so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You combine two completely junk culture tidbits into an incomprehensible tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I thought 10 people get this joke, you know, I thought it would be funny to  Know people who were following feminist Twitter and yeah, so I yeah whatever and a million people have seen it and it's been shared  Whatever and and that gives you a good feeling  Um, well what it gave me a good feeling in that  I now have a great list of female scientists to follow because they were the basic ones who were sharing  Yeah, they knew about that meme because they knew about the meme and they think like Jodie Foster  So I followed probably a thousand people who shared this now  Maybe more and then you followed it up with how to talk to a woman wearing air pods being a parallel London with zeppelin's and upgrade people to

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cybermen for some reason that only got retweeted once in three hearts. Yeah  Yeah, there you go. Well, that was see it was it was a week later

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter is like  Maybe people didn't  Get the maybe people didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You love this and you find this valuable but but it's one reason why I don't miss twitter at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one of the things that fascinates me about it is you can have a tweet like that that will go completely viral  And thousands of people will share it and then you can have one that's  Arguably better or more intelligent or and no one will click on it. It's completely random  It's like the time of day or what memes are going around or  One person shares it who's got a lot of followers and then other people see it that way  I've had two or three where that's happened and it's been shared, you know  150 000 times and I have no idea what differentiates that  From the other ones that get like 10 clicks

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's true for all media. No media has that power distribution and you know anything you publish you'll have this like skewed  Distribution of people reading it and twitter just um, well, I wonder how much the algorithm is involved as well though, right twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, well, it's a little bit now. Yeah, it's a little bit involved

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it's it's a that's part of what i'm saying the other plus what this is there's a feedback loop in that  Stuff that shared gets more shared because if it's retweeted then more people see it and more people like to retweet it and then they're more  Like to like it or whatever and so that that that signal spreads out  It does amplify it more but it's at its core is driven by people so that the part of the power of twitter is that ability  For it to sift through the go the global meme space  And all of us as individuals being synapses in that mean brain sharing this stuff out further and making it come to the top  and so part, you know part of the reason they put trending topics and and the um  The other bits at the top of twitter is to say look we found this interesting stuff  um and  Things can take off and and spawn out that and they're not predictable things  They can be my mind mine's a small ripple compared to some of the things that take off on twitter  But there have been big things that do take off and that mechanism is a powerful thing  but it also means that  um that combined  With the the way at replies work is is a bit of a problem because it means if you do spawn something like that  Then you you get a bunch of people who think well  Hey, you get a bunch of idiots who make the same joke back to you or we explain people do something worse  um  Be you get um people who are going to be abusive to you because you're suddenly a big target  And you're not geared up for it. You're you know, you're not if you're not verified  You're not marked as a famous person. You don't have as many tools to to damp that stuff down

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I have to say I I always I would be nervous about getting a lot of retweets because that pretty much guarantees  That you are going to now start get up. You're going to get trolls for temperation and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so they've one of the things that has changed  They just released it when I when I wrote this but they've now got a thing that um, they've got a quality filter  They turn on by default. So it won't notify you about um, I know and I've turned that off because that otherwise

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I won't see people who are doing damaging  Trolling what is that? What good is that? Do I've never understood what twitter's attitude is. We'll just block it  Uh, that implies that the trolling is only damaging to you  Or you know like something you should see but in fact it can be much much more damaging  We have one there's one idiot troll we have out there who tweets all using at replies every one of our sponsors  And I have to see that because I have to see if because I will hear from the sponsors if I don't quash it  So, uh, I mean he's trying to put us out of business. So, um  How does it help me if I don't see it doesn't help me at all  In fact, the only reason I see twitter is because I I have alerts that let me know that he's at it again  So I can go in and get his account suspended which I do two or three times a day now  I think that's fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know whether kevin would agree, but I think part of  Where why twitter got to where it is now?  Is that in the early going the company was very fixated on gross allowing speech?  No, not just free speech. Yes, right  Yes, but allowing speech of all kinds and and being the free speech wing of the free speech party, right?  And those sorts of things so their default was to allow speech and that has value obviously for a whole bunch of reasons  But it I think it stopped them from thinking about the things that they could have done  To stop that sort of trolling earlier

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just I life is too short to read twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, you gotta read all of it. But part of the point is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm too old to waste my time on this on absolute drivel. Even the best stuff is drivel

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what's fascinating is my daughter one of my daughters is obsessed with twitter  She's on it all the time. She's 18

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, she that's because she's so I know she thinks she's gonna live forever. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She got mad at me because I did what kevin described. I retweeted one of her  Tweets because I thought it was funny. Oh interesting and she's and she said why did you do that?  You ruined my life and and I interesting and I said, what are you talking about?  I thought it was funny. So I shared it and she said yeah, my phone started blowing up with all these  You know mentions and at replies and morons and she said please don't do that again

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't that but that's very intelligent of her. So maybe twitter's better if you're under the radar. I don't know  Yeah, well, but I think she feels that way. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but the other thing I mean you can still use it in that way you can still use the pace to talk to your friends and  so on but  A lot of its power is this amplification. But um, so there's two there's several aspects this one is  Yes, you're right  You hiding it from yourself is not really enough  You want it to be that if you say this person is blocked everyone else who goes to your page doesn't see those  So the default is that the idiot can scribble on your wall?  um  and everyone will see it and the you know, for a for  For the people who follow the idiot that's probably okay  But for by default if you've brought them why should they be showing up on your wall?  That's a sort of control of your space issue. So that that would be something that in this game

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shows up on the wall of every sponsor and many sponsors aren't sophisticated enough to recognize trolling  So then we have to talk to them  I mean, yeah twitter is facilitating one person who wants to put me out of business and they do it  You know, there's nothing I can do to stop it. Is that a good thing?  No, I think the sooner twitter goes out of business the better for the world. I think no, I disagree with that twitter  Has been a I would disagree twitter has been twitter is a force for good. Oh god. I totally  I think you will come around. I think in a couple of years you will come around and realize that twitter has actually been a very  damaging to the  I disagree

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The things that make twitter good  And bad are the it's just like the internet the thing the same things that make it good  Are the things that make it bad? Well, i'm interested because erin you're you had this you had the reaction that to when I said

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That I thought was interesting which is I feel like maybe I personally and maybe others will be moving into a  Post social media  World i'm ready to do it. I am I am kind of done

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I feel the same way and and part of it's just because i'm busy with tons of stuff going on  And it's hard to pay attention to all that especially twitter because it's at this person at this person at this person at this person  And at the end of it it says sounds good  Okay  That was helpful. So for me a lot of my my twitter angst is just the fact that it's just not usable for me  I can't share what I want to share  I can't give a longer description than I want to give to or answer somebody's question  It's really hard for me to answer questions on twitter  And so finally I just say, you know, could you private message me your email and i'll be glad to help you out  But I can't do it through twitter. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And like you said interesting google plus was actually a perfect platform for that, but it was a perfect platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, why did it fail?  Well, because they were late to the game and they couldn't attract the audience and the users maybe this is twitter is what we want

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's what I think it's what some people want  It's not what I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think twitter's strengths outweigh its weaknesses

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it has lots of weaknesses. Its strength is that it is a web-like space

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're right there matthew and  That's that's one of the reasons I like it because I like web-like spaces  But um the other thing that so that's uh, yeah  That's the first or effect of the app notifying you and annoying you  The other thing that's slightly odd about it is that because it amplifies this anger  It also seems that when you go and look there the most liked thing you are to see is something angry  by someone who's um  Got more followers than you or who has his tweets more popular than yours  And it's like the my friends are having a better time than me problem with facebook  Which is that you only see the you only see the happy things get lots of likes on twitter  You only see the ones that gather lots of reactions  And because they amplify the bad reactions you tend to see a lot of anger as well  So it becomes normative that Twitter is a very good platform for that  And when it becomes normative that Twitter is the place you go to shout at people  And you know, there's there's some value to that in terms of if you're complaining about the government or politicians or  even if it's if some company has messed you about and you want to  Shout at them shout at them and then wake up their customer service team  There's there's value for that for the individual even potentially for the people on the other side of it  But it goes very wrong when it's when it's targeted at another individual  And when it's a normative thing that  As you say this guy can go around and shout at you and shout at your advertisers and there's there's very little you can do about it  So there's there's a structural problem there because it amplifies that that shouting and that is a structural characters 140 characters is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amplifies the problem as well because you can't there's no room for nuance  you have to compose something that's you know, more or less like a  Bumper sticker or or a t-shirt slogan so you ask your wild would have loved twitter  Yeah, and so people who do that well, particularly the ones I follow who are part of weird twitter or funny twitter  Some of them are hilarious. Yeah, because they've they've refined that to an art form  But unfortunately, it also encourages people to be to distort things and to sort of make  announcements or pronouncements that are  Kind of true, but not really because there's no  Room to kind of go into into depth. Well, um, and those don't get any retweets anyway, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but don't you feel like you're more misunderstood on twitter than on any other social platform because of that  I mean I I have to explain things and it's like no, that's not what I meant  I just didn't have enough room to fully explain what I was talking about and that's it drives me bananas  Um trying to have to then you have to go back. Oh, that's not what I meant  I meant this and then they it's like ah, you know, I could have avoided I spent so much time dealing with this  I could have avoided the whole thing  All of my stuff goes out to twitter by the way, I like to use it  I like people to follow me wherever they want to or whatever they're comfortable with but I don't like to use it  It's it's a little it's my least favorite social network. It's like trying to communicate, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Complicated concepts through text messaging. So you you text someone they text you back. It's good for things like hey  Where should we meet up or you know, I saw this cool thing, but it's not good for having long  Discussions. In fact, it makes those worse. So if you're having a disagreement with somebody  Texting is the worst possible thing and twitter is probably the second worst possible thing  And I remember my my wife saying to our daughter. She was having this text fight with somebody. She said get off  Your phone and call the person or go over there. Yes, because  Texting and and social media is a great place to start a fight  It's not a great place to stop a fight

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, or to reach an understanding the lack of nuance in text really can actually create fights  Yeah, misunderstand misunderstandings and totally. Yeah, that is kind of  With with my friends. That's that's our rule now is say it in person because you lose a lot of nuance on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have a good quote from Jack which I stuck some I saw that and actually is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder because it's also in fast company if this is Jack's response to you or  if it's uh, is it related you can only express yourself he says  If you feel safe to do so  You need a sense of income. Is this in the context of what he wants twitter to become?  Yes, so this we're not a social network as people think about it. He says

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and this is quite a long discussion of of words what is up to but that that piece I thought was interesting because  He's basically recognizing that there is this problem with people not feeling safe because they get so shouted out and they need to fix that  and they're working on that so that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's an encouraging thing there's other issues too. I mean half uh, half of my twitter followers are not real. They're spam  And I would say that's true of a lot of uh, high especially true of people with high follower accounts  And I think that uh, what you're going to see soon is an exodus from twitter  People are being fooled right now. They think they're talking to 37 million people  When they don't realize that 15 million of those are not even people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you've actually started to see it already. Yeah, I think there's already an exodus going on. I think it's going to snowball

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there has there has been but  and twitter is going to need to um  Rebuild that sense of of conversation that it can be at its best and it's hard. It's hard to go back as google learned

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Once people start abandoning you it's hard to convince them to come back  They're doing all these streaming things too. They've just announced that twitter is going to be on apple tv  I don't want to the last place I want to do is sit and watch at twitter on my big screen tv

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't feel like they're actually they want to focus on those things because there's not enough return to it  They'd rather cut a deal with the nfl or the nba  and and stream clips of  Of shows because that's where where the money is there's no money in  Making it a more appealing community for people that are interesting  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but the value the the reason to what is valuable for the tv stuff is that it's  And that's where the back channel does make some sense  It's if if you've got a shared conversation about something that can make more sense and you can make that stuff go here  And they've you know, it was it was the thing that got me back watching live television  Um was the sense that there will be a conversation about on twitter that I would want to see at the same time in the same  Way that we have a chat room here  Watching us and talking about us being able to have that for a for a broadcast show is is powerful  So I stayed up to the middle of the night to watch the royal wedding because I knew the british twitter would be really funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. That's there are times when twitter shines. I'm not denying that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a there's a coherence to that strategy that does make some sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, and but they're basically mining all the content people have put it into put it into twitter  To create a kind of this feed zeitgeist  Zeitgeisty feed of information and news. I guess that's a way to monetize it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also you know, it's also the place that you go to to talk about the thing that's happening now  Facebook has has like a half day lag about that stuff  You won't be having a conversation about  What's just happened on facebook because it takes a while to bubble through the system there  well, it's what you can have a conversation about about what just happened if there's if it's a news event or if it's a  You know if it's the the me's or the grammy's or whatever it is  Or even if it's just a tv show that you haven't that happens to be airing and you know  This happens more in the uk that does here because here the tv shows are all spaced out over three hour gaps  But in the uk when great british bake off is on twitter is talking about great british bake off and then when  And top of the pops comes on twitter is talking about top of the pops  and  The subset you see will be the subset of britains that you follow and maybe the ones that they retweet if they see some funny  Ones and it does work as this like parallel  Conversation stream about what it is you're watching and so I think it is good for those things. It's not so good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When when you're trying to have a nuanced political discussion

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I try to avoid political discussions

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Reason to get off twitter, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean  Actually bars aren't any good for that either. So it's not just twitter, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know there you can you can all people often do raise the arab spring as an example of twitter at its best  I think you can  Clearly point to trump's ascendancy as an example of twitter at its worst  I think he has he is the perfect person for that medium and I think that's an indictment of twitter  I mean if you want to get political, uh, he certainly knows how to use it  He knows how to use it better than anybody i've ever seen  Uh, and in fact, it's a shame because his handlers are bowdlerizing his twitter  Uh, and his the the handlers tweets are not interesting in the least  They're horrible. They're boring. They're they're the analysis and they um, yeah  It's the when you see it on android late night. That's that's the real donald trump  When you see it daytime and it's hashtags and it's you know, it's it's campaign you can it's there's a clear difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But also that they think she did linguistic analysis and found that they were different as well. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The words used so forth. Yeah, and I think the campaign  Whenever you think about trump the campaign is completely misguided. They should let trump be trump  And that's what he should be on twitter  They shouldn't be trying to because then you get this weird disjoint where no, that's that's him. Well, that's not him  That's that's on the same feed. Let's be true. He was he was the first

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sort of major politician. I would say that oh really got it. Oh, how how you can use twitter but but  It's all about his whole life about reality

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twitter was almost made  For for this person for him his whole life has been about self-aggrandizement  Promotion, yeah reality shows were made for him, too. He this is where he shines

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I think he understands it's the it's all about the pronouncement and the sort of uh,  You know just saying you can say anything you want on twitter. Nobody's right. Nobody's right  And it has nothing to do with whether it's true or not true. No one's going to notice or care  You're still going to get lots of you know activity and then everyone will be writing about  The thing that you said

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Even even when it isn't true and and by the way, that's where amplification is powerful, too  Because I think if you if you look at how many votes trump got in his  Nomination process. It's still not a huge number of people. It's very easy on twitter to appear  To be huge huge  Yeah, uh it because it's such a great amplifier  Anyway, so there's good and there's bad. I agree and I think the bad outweighs the good in my opinion, but um, you know  You know to each his own i'm less than facebook. I is not that interesting either  I'm less and less interesting social media in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like interact with your friends online

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the thing that breaks my heart is people ask me questions on twitter all the time  There is you know people listeners and viewers that want to interact with me  Um, I just choose not to use that in that medium to interact. Uh, I don't know in your super

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's what it's in your super. Well, I didn't put it there. How do you interact with them? Um, I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I can't  Yeah, my google plus is too you should just take those out  Uh, you know and a long ago I said I stopped responding to email as well for same reason  If you got several hundred email messages a day  Asking things like well, which phone should I buy?  You would stop answering email too. You can't  Reasonably handle that you know, i'd have to hire a team just to do that and it's just as bad on any other platform  as well twitter I was able to do for a while because  You know, it was a small number of people that used it. It still is  Uh, but yeah, it's not a very good place to do it  I prefer to do it in public because that way I could share at least others could do it on your own side  Yeah, I should start figuring out some way to do it on a blog or something like that. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So i've got a question if if this group the four of us were  If the four of us were going to build the ideal social network the one that would take over the world and be exactly how we  Want it? What would we include?  In that in that social media tool, what would we include and what would we not include based on what we know about facebook twitter?  Uh and google plus because I think there was a lot a lot of good in google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I actually think there was too. I really had high hopes for google plus  I loved it and and there were a lot of good things about it. It was great looking  It was good, especially for things like photography. I know a bunch of photographers who used it a lot  But it just you know, you can't start with it. I mean  You can't start  Good you are. Yeah, I mean  Dozens of people have started great things long after the not so great thing got going and network effects just kill you every time. Yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but you know, there are other things that have taken off and have have got different characteristics to them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what was the perfect social? I think that's a great question. What would be the perfect social network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think you can have one  I don't think you can have I think they have different flavors. I tried to do social for a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I really like the idea of it being you know, only like hardcore  Uh geeks, but the only people I only see quarry doctorow there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a great place to follow. Yeah, once you pull a quarry doctorow they will appear. Yeah  Yeah, yeah, and that's and that's and he's not that's the proxy thing of him as well. That's his well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the problem. You could tell it's not him. He's not there which is  But which is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is the thing that went wrong with with buzz?  Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's why google did not create a right api for google plus they learned that lesson on buzz

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, right, but that also made it problematic meant it made it worse. Yeah. Yeah, there's no way to get stuff into it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, and that's that's actually what my like top of my list is a good api  I think they need to have a good api well documented api. It's easy to use  Allows people to do what they want to do with it  It's difficult to do a good api, but I think that's top of the list  You know, what's the problem with all these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that could have changed google raises hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that is exactly what indyweb is about. I mean that it's about running the api  Let us do those kinds of things. So we've got the um  The micro pub api to allow you to publish that you can then publish out to different sites  Yeah, and we've got the web mention model that lets  The site say i've linked to you over here  so you can you can work out what that link means whether it's a like or a  Follow or a comment or rsvp or whatever. Yeah, so we we've got the models for doing that  So we've got the api stuff, but the challenge is always  it's still the you've got to work out how to follow people and  Give yourself a feed of things and then decide what to see it  Then you've got to balance out how crowded that p gets versus how quiet it is  And that that that's a very hard and subtle thing to get right

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we do you know google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole thing with circles and including certain people in certain circles  Was a great idea because you could keep  You know these folks who all only wanted that content in this circle and you could keep people who wanted other things in this circle  But it just was too labor intensive. I think it was a great idea, but it just took too much fiddling

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, so it's got to be dead simple to use  I mean I I think of like instagram and snapchat and those things that have kind of  Disrupted even though there was existing platforms there. They've kind of disrupted and got in there and been successful  I think the network effect is is very powerful as you said matthew, but I think it can be overcome with the right tool  You're right. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think we're i mean instagram exactly. I I think we're I think we're one thing  Right. It was just share a photo the end  Right, that's literally it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. See my my solution to this probably isn't the right one  I would try to take all these good things put them into one platform a new a new social media platform and try to get  Everybody to use it which probably wouldn't work. Uh, you'd probably have to specialize as some of these other platforms have done  Otherwise as you say you never do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh overcome the network effect unfortunately, and I think if you look at what snapchat has done  What's fascinating about it is it is nothing like what it started as so so they were very smart  I think in starting with one specific  Really really small functionality  Disappearing messages and then and that I think served a huge need that was not being served that ephemerality  You didn't have to worry about your instagram photo or your facebook post, you know living on forever and ever  So you could be a little more free a little more open with what you posted and there wasn't so much pressure  And they've gradually added  Things to it to the point where it's now this fairly robust kind of media  Entity how long they'll be able to do that. I don't know but that's an interesting strategy to start with one tiny little feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know why we always get in this conversation  I don't want to get in this conversation, but leonet. That's what we need leonet. Yeah, I think the problem with social networks is people  Yeah, they're made of people and most people are great. I love people  Uh, but they're enough. Uh, all it takes is you know, these these few  I used to say I like I like certain people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Specifically, I don't like people in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, oh, yeah, there you go  Um, all right, let's take a break and move on we can talk about amazon  We can yeah, I like people i'd hang with you anytime mat matthew I would hang with you and kevin marx  I I do hang with you aaron newcomb  uh  I'm not against people  uh  Just some people  Uh, let's uh, and I think really human beings are not I think part of the problem is biologically we're not made for this kind of environment  This is not this is too many people  I'm not sure I buy the dunbar number of 150, but I think we can handle a smaller number of in of actual relationships  You know, I i've always fought this notion because this is what everybody, you know who hated the internet said  But i'm starting to come around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So me following 10 000 people on twitter is a bad idea. I think I followed close to that number

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  um  But I don't you know, I don't know. It's just  It's no fun all the fun's gone out of it as  As they as uh as they said in uh of mice and men  Uh our show today. Oh, this is fun is brought brought to you by a better internet a better internet would be nice  Wouldn't you how many of you have wi-fi that doesn't work?  Or a router that kind of stops working and you have to reboot it. How many of you are suffering with buffering?  Are moaning about dead zones  Wouldn't you like wi-fi that works you need this this changed my life. I actually was not uh, the I was I was  I tried everything  I tried repeaters. I had uh power line repeaters. I had  Massive routers. I got a second internet connection. I did everything and then along comes euro  Eero and everything just works again. So instead of  the single router model  Eero is a mesh system throughout your house one or more doesn't have to be just one  But one or more of these euro devices they're they look kind of look like a white apple tv. They're about the same size  They have a power connector two ethernet connectors and a usb connector on each and every one  You can if you want wire all three and then they'll get in a mesh with each other and work with each other or  The way I have it I have one base station and then I use the euro app on iphone or android to add additional stations  You know at problem spots  Suddenly my whole house has the fastest wi-fi I have ever had  There are no more dead zones. There's no buffering  No buffering suffering  It's wi-fi that works  It's kind of an enterprise grade wi-fi system. You can set it up very quickly  I don't I hate to use that term because I think it'll scare people it is very easy to use gives you all the power you want  Wpa encryption automatic you can't not use it might like that  It's very easy to manage it using the euro app  And the euro app does some really interesting things for instance  I've got a current bandwidth test that's always being updated. So I know what i'm getting it's kind of slow right now  Must must be something going on in the network  Thank you comcast I can see what devices are on there by name I can actually rename them  I can reserve I can do port forwarding a lot of the fancy stuff. The other thing that euro does is really interesting is  It's it keeps track of the devices. It knows that that's a roku for instance  They optimize the network for the device that's attached to the network  So that's really cool. They also are pushing firmware updates on a regular basis. You don't have to worry about it's automatically updated  And it looks great in the house. I mean, I don't have to hide these I have them all over the house  Because there's no antennas sticking out. It's very it's very straightforward  And because it has two ethernet ports  You can connect it to your cable modem as I have and then to a switch  Or a hub and allow yourself to have many many many more devices hardwired as well as wireless  All I can say is this solved a multi-year  Problem with bad wi-fi in our house and I you can you won't get  You cannot pry the euro out of my hands anymore  In fact, maybe i'll take this box home and add some more of them  That's the other thing you can continue to add euros as your needs expand  We've got free overnight shipping for you if you visit euro eero.com  And select overnight shipping use the offer code twig eero.com offer code twig  right now  Eero it is an end the buffering suffering with euro  A big fan really really big fan. You know what else i'm a big fan with my echoes  And the echo dot is back and folks it's 50 bucks. I think competition is going to be great  Because we're going to see the google home soon  Sonos has announced it's going to work with echo at 50 bucks  This is a great deal the reason you want the dot is because it binds pairs by bluetooth  Or hardwire to a better speaker. So this is kind of the top of the echo  Without the speaker the echo speaker is fine for voice and for talking to  But if you're going to use it for music, you want a better speaker on it  So I have this paired by bluetooth to a nice set of powered speakers  50 bucks means I can put more of these in the house. I  Love the echo dot  It along with the echo tap and of course the original echo are huge sellers for amazon  90 bucks a little expensive at 50 bucks  Wow, i'm impressed  And apparently amazon is also responding to google home  We've heard that one of the things google home will do is give you notifications  A nice at least in the video a little polite chime when a google now notification pops up  And you can ask the google home what what's what's that for amazon is according  To the verge to circuit breaker chris welch bringing spoken notifications similarly  to uh the echo  This actually i'm sorry. Let's give credit where credits do this is from jessica lessons very good information  But that's behind the paywall. So I pay for it. But if you don't you might want to read the verge's article  Any thoughts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is just a peripheral for the the main one. It doesn't work on itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, the dot can work by itself. It's just exactly the same. It just doesn't have its own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Full-size speakers a little speaker and if okay, so I can buy this and shout it and it'll it'll find me things  Oh, yeah, it's exactly the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just if you cut the top if you slice the top off of the echo  And the reason I like it is because you can have better speakers because I use the echo for music a lot  right, yeah  But I think notifications would be very interesting. There's going to be I love this. It's going to be a fight  There's going to be a competition  And that's good news because I think that this idea of speaking to your house has legs  By the way, if you want it echo will also read you a twitter feed  Just to just to circle around 180 degrees  You can't get twitter on your echo as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm i'm interested to see what sort of google home I am too  I'm really interested in what they sort of how they play it or how they because I think there's so much potential there  They've got so much intelligence  In that company and they've got so many  You know other google services if you're like me that you use just to be able to integrate  some  Obvious things with that and with voice and with you know, a sort of google now type  I'm just i'm really looking forward to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm surprised they haven't already and I think that google's  Achilles heel here is that they haven't been  Very good about their own devices about doing their own devices making their own devices  Even when they partner with other companies, sometimes it doesn't pan out very well  And so I think i'm with you. I wish they would have done this years ago. I've been i've been  Chomping at the bit for google to come out and say okay. Here's your here's your intelligent light switch and you know  They have nest so they have some intelligent thermostats and smoke detectors and things but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, but nest I think was kind of a train wreck, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean in a lot of ways and that's tony fidel's fault. I think yeah, did you know tony?  Kevin marx, I feel like you might have worked with tony fidel at some point  No, you're muted by the way. Oh, I know because there was a plane going over

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The plane go over. I'm muted myself. Sorry  Um  I didn't know I didn't know tony fidel and  um  it's  internet of things is another one of those ones that that seems to had a lot of like hype and now everyone's going what was that  about and that the  in some ways the um, the echo is a more compelling  Random piece of hardware to suck in the house than the light switches and doorbells and and smoke detectors and things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's the the the the big benefit at least  Talking to people who love their echoes is just the idea of  a smart  Device so it's not just a single. Yeah, you know a light switch or a light bulb or your oven  It's a something you can talk to something that can read you things something that can turn the music on something that can tell you  What the temperature is someone that can tell you who was starred in that movie that you can't remember  I mean those things have value  The the real key is is can you do it consistently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but who could do it better than google, right? Right, right  Which is why it's puzzling that amazon owns this space. Uh, I guess just from a vacuum filling a vacuum  Although the amazon pointed the way maybe google didn't really know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh how to handle this until they said it seemed so, you know when they came out with that sort of echo looking  um  Wi-fi hub. Oh the on hub. Yeah. Yeah, I thought I thought obviously that's a trojan horse, right?  That's what they're gonna do is they're gonna turn on right and then  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What is that is that is achilles heel for google? I have to say it is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well the thing the thing that um, well there's a couple things here  But the thing that google has that makes sense to me in this context is the chromecast  Um, if you can combine those two, I think that's strong and and amazon has the fire tv as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I do not really have them work together echo is doing with sonos. So you'll be able to say to echo  Play frank sinatra in the living room and it'll know which speaker  That's exactly what google should be doing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  With yeah, if you say play play play this week in google on my tv

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And i've got a chromecast and they did demo. I believe they demoed that at google i.o. That was one of the features. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it makes perfect sense and and if it can you know, it doesn't take long for it to work out where the different gadgets are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that that works too. Um, and I love the chromecast. I've been using that for oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just worry that it will be a fragment as iot has been all along a fragmented world  Where nothing talks to anything else very well and it's a pain or to get things to talk  You have to really go to extra effort and really become a true geek or buy them all from one company

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so you need to buy the amazon, right? Well, we know that's gonna be the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's no way amazon's gonna talk to google's gonna talk to apple. They're all gonna be siloed  inevitably, that's the world we live in now, which is why I support indie  web because  Siloes are bad for users. They're good for companies bad for you. It's so frustrating. Look at look at your iphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kansas call other iphones, right? I'm sure apple would love that to be the case  But oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, their messaging is just like that and they beefing it up beefing it up and you can't use it with anybody  But we're actually going back person. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your instant messenger couldn't talk to my instant messenger. It's so frustrating

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the the other one that's relevant this was the was the story about the speech generation that um, so top of the running order  Um, did you listen to that stuff leo that I thought that was really impressive. Let's play it right now. This is where

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um top of the running order the deep mind link deep mind. Oh, i'm not sure I want to talk to deep mind  Now i'm nervous. So deep mind is uh, this is  Uh, this is the ai the go playing computer, right? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's the london-based ai company they did the go playing computer  And they've just been replying the same kind of recurrent neural networks to  speech understanding generation

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is going to be better speech generation

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so they basically they built this model that is  Looks at looks at the audio at multiple scales at once and so it's like a a layered model of the audio where it spans out over time  um, and then they they feed stuff into it and see what it comes out with and  um  They what they've they've measurably got better text to speech than the existing text of speech they have there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So let's listen. So there's so listen to the three. Tell me what this is parametric  Concatenative and wave net. These are different ways of using ai

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's different ways of generating speech. So parametric is having something that you give it a bunch of um  Of like a like a sense of synthesizer model and you give it a bunch of parameters and it plays it that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, let's play that the blue lagoon is a 1980 american romance and adventure film directed by randall klyzer

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, sounds just like google now probably that's how google now is doing it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um concatenative is we take a lot of samples and join them together. So you record some of both voices

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also what a lot of systems including google now use the blue lagoon is a 1980 american romance and adventure film directed by randall klyzer

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that is not fully synthesized. Those are real samples, but stitched together. Yes with a bit of a bit of nuance

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is the ai

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the ai one the blue lagoon is a 1980 american romance and adventure film directed by randall klyzer. Oh, screw it. I'm out of work

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh crap that sounds just like a human

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so basically they build a model. They just feed it raw audio samples and it builds this hidden model  And then if they put words into it their words come out so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I have enough audio recorded of me that's why that's fully available freely available on the internet  There are hundreds of thousands of hours of me  That would be more than enough for them to create a leo. They need they needed something. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The training set they gave it had  It's in the it's in the white paper, but it was it was like 160 voices

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We could play a game human or computer  The  Sounds like chinese to me. I don't know  Um, so how many samples do they need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me find it. Hang on. So they they they you leo you could create your own and then just  They say so this is this is the vacation. So if they train the network without a taxi 109 speakers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not that speech. There's nothing much at all. Yeah, so in other words if I just gave

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They could easily do it with me. I I uh, most of our stuff is creative commons. They can do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here we go. So we go to the um, so if you go down a bit further they have

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is babbling. Are you want to hear some babbling? This is weird  You know, do you remember you might not be old enough to remember there was a guy in the 40s who appeared in many movies  He was a double talk expert. Yes, and he would talk and it would sound like he was saying something but he wasn't  And that's what this sounds like  Yeah, this is what my french sounds like  It's nothing it's just sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what happens if they just let it they don't give it any signal  They just generate stuff, but they've got but human sounds they got breathing. They got lip smacking. They've got incandescence

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And uh, not incandescence they've got in and you know what I mean they've got  Yeah, so now, uh, this is these are different voices same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see the avocado is a pear shaped fruit with leathery skin smooth edible flesh and a large stone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds a little mechanical the avocado is a pear shaped fruit with leathery skin smooth edible flesh and a large stone

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The avocado is a pear shaped fruit with leathery skin smooth edible flesh and a large stone  I think i'm in love the avocado is a pear shaped fruit with leathery skin smooth edible flesh and a large stone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow interesting the second one sounded the best the second one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The avocado is a pear shaped fruit with leathery skin smooth edible flesh and a large stone

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what? That's just personal taste because I like this guy avocado is a pear shaped fruit with leathery skin

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Smooth edible flesh and a large stone. She sounds cuter

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, so that isn't a phrase any of those speakers said  Um, I think not. Yeah, they trained it on these 106 speakers for of the 44 hours from from a corpus sample  They had so part of what it's reproducing is also the recording quality. You can actually hear the differences in miking there as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, here's music they can also do with music. So this is a music without this is the same thing without any  Information babbling but the babbling music babbling  Yeah, it's kind of like john cage  It's very john cagey. Okay, and then I presume that they could then give it instruction  Although I love the idea of the computer kind of writing doing its own composition. Yeah. Well, yeah, well that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other it depends on the integration window  So they've said it's only got a fairly short integration window where it jumps about a bit  And they they said they could tune it to have a longer integration with this so it could generate like a four-minute piece

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or something like that. I think we're not far off from scarlett joe hansen, frankly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the thing that's impressive about this is that it gives the promise a very good text to speech  But it also gives the promise of being able to  Replicate someone else's voice fairly accurately  So yeah, certainly your voice will be will be straightforward to do because you've you've given them lots of samples  The other weird thing is that it will only be what they've got recordings of so it will be people in there in their  Stagiest most recorded voice, but right  If it's if it's an actor that this will be a way to to recreate an actor  The other thing is that you probably you may be able to do depending on how they tune it  To have someone have one person's voice perform another's voice  So take the cadence of one person and then feed that into another one  So it's it's sort of it's very interesting. And again, it's like a lot of this ai stuff  they're not  Choosing what the model is and letting it form its own model of what the speech is and in the same way that our brains do  And clearly that it's at the point where it's it's doing interesting stuff. So this you know  This ties back to the you know, the alexa thing  um in that if you if you can talk like this you can talk a lot better than than the existing ones, um,  And the other part will be that it may be better at doing  um  The sort of the way the current ones fall down is with proper names is that they don't have enough information to render them well  Um, so there may be some ability to do that better  But it's I this was actually fascinating to me because this is this is very impressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Piece of you know something coming to fruition. I really I mean we knew this would happen. It's just it's pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they using all the data they get from google voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not in this case. No  Um, this was this was this was research projects that they used some existing data sets, but they certainly could  I mean they could they could you know, it's google they could feed the whole of youtube through it and and see see what that gave them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here is uh al kelly who's the double talk guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  On ernie kovex very early. I know you are all aware tv show of the great coverage  Is being done by nbc on the convention by the way this this this could be today by the way  This is ernie kovex continue of course and all the highlights will be brought to you  I know you've read a great deal about what is happening at the convention, but i'm sure  That you would be interested in the technical end we have with us tonight nbc's chief engineer chief engineer pelman

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this guy did many many movies over the years

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And uh, it's actually pretty good. I know that the technical end may seem a little boring  But i'm sure that you can make it simple enough for all of us to grasp just how the cameras  Will be handled at the convention that nbc  Uh has planned what is the planning for nbc with the cameras at the convention? Well, mr

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  fried i'm very happy to say this  That nbc is not only taking every technical angle  Which is going about to bring every convention user fees in every hotel new corner five or wherever  There's been a phase to give the people a knowledge of what has caused with a sword but also to say and they will find  That is the grand first safe of cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Okay, just enough. I just had to play a little bit  Of it  That's a little bit like the turbo incabulator. Yeah, it's so good  Uh, I had mentioned several times after we heard that android n was going to be nougat  I'll do it. I'll say nougat for your benefit kevin marx. I don't want to offend your ear  Nougat for those of us in the united states and I mentioned that when I was a kid  I remember going to a town in france. It was famous for nougat  Well, it is it's called montel ymar. In fact, if you know the  Beatles song sweet tangerine montel ymar. This is the the famous french nougat town  and uh  Google's going there. It's only 35 000 people in the southeast france. It's the world capital of nougat nougat  and uh google is going to celebrate  with google france and the montel ymar city council have been  Are going to have a big party on the 21st  All things nougat will be on display plus bug droid green cocktails a buffet of local organic foods and activities  For the kid, but most importantly google is going to donate an android statue for permanent display in montel ymar  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure the french are very happy about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think they like google that much so uh, yeah  But I but this uh, I remember going there when I was a kid and you know  That's the kind of thing that makes a lasting impression. So it's nougat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it supposed to be nougat nougat? Yeah nougat nougat nougat

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They also say schedule aluminum and tissue and tissue  Well, how do canadians say it say what nougat nougat, okay  Unless you're in montreal, then they probably say nougat  Yeah, yeah, I say delicious  Uh, are you loving are you all loving nougat on your new uh on your nexus phones? Are you happy with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, i've had it for several months. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And yeah, I like it. I think you know this and i'm seeing this with ios 10  We're really at the point where it's hard to make a major difference. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is hard. Yeah, we're kind of I mean the the requirements in notifications and things like that are good. Yeah  But it's for them to respond directly in there the app switching is good when I remember to use it  Um, but yeah, you know, otherwise it's just another version of android that works better  But it's there's there's no like well shaking part to it really

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so so you guys are running the dev the dev preview because I know you have a nexus 6, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been running the dev preview because oh  for the nexus 6  Google brick my phone  Um with the previous upgrade and the way to fix it was to install the nougat. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we have the the full one our real one on our nexus 6p though, right?  That's not the dev anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That should be the real one in the excuse me. The one for the nexus 6 should be coming out in the next few weeks  Which is what i've been waiting for because I always I have a special upgrade part because mine i'm rooted and all that stuff  I have a special  Upgrade process that I have to go through so I have to uh, wait for the aosp official aosp  Release before I do that. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do feel like you're right though leo that  phone technology  Like what else? Yeah, we're kind of can you get yeah, so you've got two cameras  Maybe a phone will have three cameras. Well, that's how by the way intel solved the problem of oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can't go past four gigahertz for chips. Oh, we'll just put more chips in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That'll make them happy and maybe you'll have rounded corners on your screen or maybe you'll have let's put in two cameras  It feels like a lot of it is just yeah, it's fins. I call it fins on a cadillac. Yeah fins

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean putting in more cameras and microphones does make sense because you can do more things with it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think I mean look at the echo the array mics and echo and the echo are quite impressive what they're doing  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's so there's there's that sense of it  The other thing is so part of it is apple is doing a bit of the synthetic aperture stuff  But they're only doing the two lenses that are next to each other  If if you if you think about the vr stuff and you say, okay, i'll have a lens  It was me for a lens here and a lens here. Suddenly you've got a stereoscopic thing to look through  Yeah, if you take that lens and align it with the lens on this side  Then you've got the ability to take a spherical thing that way  So I suspect we're going to start seeing thinking about those issues of like, okay  We'll have multiple lenses on the camera and turn them on in parallel and the obvious ones are  Making these ones back and forth the same making these ones symmetric  And then you can you could do the focus pull trick that apple is doing but and you can also shoot stereoscopically  So we're going to see a bunch of these coming out as the as the lenses as the as basically  The cameras are already cheap enough  It's about getting enough bus bandwidth to to have multiple streams enough cpu to combine them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the most interesting sort of theory I saw about apple's air pods was that  They're going to start becoming the sort of control  Yeah center for your phone because series in them sure exactly exactly and I don't mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean I will look like an idiot with little drool drooly, you know spit coming out of my ear  Those microphones really look stupid  But I don't I would wear them all the time if it had enough functionality. It could be used as a hearing aid  It you could use music but you could communicate because it's it's the ultimate wearable  I think this is ultimately what apple's plan is in the long run  No  But the so what is the to me the reason alexa works? I'm sorry echo works  Is because I don't address anything. I address my home  I just speak wherever I am it listens and responds  Uh, and that's kind of what you want and if you got used to and i'm sure apple would hope you will do this  Wearing your air pods all the time  You could have the same thing  Uh, I suspect that's where we're headed. I don't think this current generation quite does it five hours of battery life for one thing  Is a problem. Yeah, although as somebody pointed out if you alternate ears  You could go longer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean it's actually attractive to me because when i'm cycling i'm I often  Travel just have one ear plugged in so I want to be able to hear the traffic as well  And i'm listening to a podcast. I'm not trying to listen to music  So i'm listening to somebody talking one ear while i'm listening to traffic with the other ear  So that would actually make some sense in that so if you're looking on ways to uh, uh, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Innovate on a smartphone the ways are in things like wearables  Yeah, and uh, you know stuff external to the phone. I guess cameras  I mean the there's going to be a lot of growth in cameras because you have a super computer  Attached to sensors. There's a lot you can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's uh, and that's also project tango, right? Yeah, although I guess that phone's delayed now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a little disappointing although i'm not sure I care about mapping out my living room particularly  They'll have to show me how that's going to be of benefit  Yeah, I can see why a store would do that. In fact, we're going to pay  700 bucks to have somebody do the 3d  Photos of the new studio, you know  So when you do google maps and you get here you can walk inside and walk around that's really worth it. I think  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could use vr for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and you would right if you had cook if you had cardboard you could do that. Yeah, you could be here  We've done that before we did uh the very first show we did out of here. We uh,  Used at osmo, which is nokia's  60,000-dollar 3d camera to stream the show for people who wanted to they could look around they could be in the studio  It's just I think it's of limited after a while you got I gotta take this off  Yeah, here's some scary news from bruce schneider security god  He works as cto of resilient and ibm company is a fellow at the berkman center and a board of vff member of vff  Someone over the past year or two has been probing  The defenses he writes of companies that run critical pieces of the internet  These probes take the form of precisely calibrated attacks  Designed to determine exactly how well these companies can defend themselves  And I parenthetically I think it's against a ddos and what would be required to take them down  We don't know who's doing this, but it feels like a large nation state china or russia would be my  first  Guesses and the reason they know it's a nation state is the volume of packets that's being sent against these  And it's probes because they're not sustained. They're just trying it out  And seeing what happens one week with the attack would start at a particular level of attack and slowly ramp up before stopping the next week  It would start at the higher point and continue and so on as if the attacker were looking for the exact point of failure  This goes hand in hand  With the news that uh two israeli men have been arrested for running  A ddos for hire company for as little as 30 dollars a month. You could ddos anybody don't even have to know what you're doing  You just hire them vdos was their name and uh, you could ddos anybody  With fairly significant ddos's and we're talking attacks ranging from 10 gigabits per second to hundreds of gigabits per second  They uh, I guess they'd commandeered a network they had set up and they were selling it. They had a price list and everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were running in the they were running in the public domain  They weren't running on black net or dark net or whatever they call it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  uh, they had they had all sorts of interesting kind of strategies to get paid and uh, and and uh,  How to work it they although it brian krebs writing and krebs on security thinks they've earned  Uh in excess of over six hundred thousand dollars over the last two years. This is a this is a capture of their website  How do I purchase a vdos plan this is very web 2.0, uh, the bronze is  1999 a month silver is 29.99 a month  Gold is 39.99 a month and if you want to go for the vip 200 a month  They call it booter, but it is essentially ddos. And of course they took yeah  You have vip service sounds like a great service. Of course, they took a bitcoin because uh, why not  But they had all sorts of other ways, uh to to to handle this and what's scary is that you didn't it's barely even a script  kitty anybody  Could could you know hire these guys for as little as thirty dollars a month? Wow  uh and uh ddos  Scary cool feature. Yeah pretty neat, huh?  They use servers rented in bulgaria  The worst the the the rest actually was preceded by a hack  Which revealed a database of customers numbering in the tens of thousands  Uh krebs website after publishing his story guess what happened to uh brian after he published that story  Uh ddos 140 gigabits a second  You know the first rule of fight club you do not talk about fight club  Thank you for setting up vdos  Let's take a break  and wrap things up with any picks or stories we didn't get to or anything you  You want to talk about we will give you all three a chance to do that kevin marx indyweb.com. I'm sorry  Yes, indyweb.org  Damnit do we have.com? I'm wondering you should try see it's I mean who else would have it?  Um really matthew ingraham always a pleasure from fortune.com  Senior editor over there and of course our good friend aaron newcomb  from uh floss weekly  And aaron and and we're pleased to see russell russell randall came back  This week and uh you you it was the two of you and I think you took the lead  But it's really great to see randall back in in fighting form  He spent a lot of time in the chat room too, which is great. I think a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it was really good to have him back. He's doing he's doing great for those that watch floss weekly and he'll be back

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Running the show next week. So it's good. He had a little intestinal distress that actually caused a more serious, uh, uh  Collapse and was hospitalized for a couple of weeks. So he's but he's all better now  Our show today brought to you by rocket mortgage from quick and loans  Bringing the mortgage process into the 21st century  Fast easy. It's completely online and I think quick and loans figures anybody who watches this show  That's what they want. They don't want to make a trip down to the broker's office with a box of you know  Bankers box full of papers.

I know you've got the great benesia maker space under your belt and that's working great. Yeah, that's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, you know as most people know I am a maker and that's why uh, and and also, you know, jeff usually has a number  He's not here. You want to do a number I take over that role. Usually I do a project  But i've got so many things going on. They're all about halfway done  Uh as usual so instead of doing that, I thought I'd do a number. Okay, the number today is 10 million

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mm-hmm

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  10 million 10 million. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it turns out that's the number of computers  That uh raspberry pi computers that have been sold isn't that mind-boggling. That's amazing  There's a picture there of the pi zero five dollars  Uh for a half credit card size computer  Um, so I use those all the time. I think that's a million

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure even in the in the gang, uh, just never thought it would be this like this. This is amazing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well in fact, I think he even said, you know, their highest expectation at one point was three million  That was their their not their stretch goal  Like that was their dream goal like I can't you know, I can't even imagine selling three million and they've exceeded that by three x  Uh plus so they're doing really really well  Um, I recommend them all the time  what amazes me is that they've been able to pull this off not from a hobbyist standpoint because  You know, these things are obviously interesting to to to people like me, you know  You can just reach over and pull off your computer and take it with you, you know, put it in your pocket  Whatever. It's a lot of fun  But but they've they've broadened this out really to educators  They've also got distributors and resellers who are selling this thing at uh without any margin  um  Which is I think unheard of I don't know of anybody else that sells things  Without any margin the reason they're you know able to do is because there's a lot of other stuff you need to go with  It that does have high margin. Um, but um, even at that you hardly ever hear of anything being sold  without margin so I I mean, I think they've just done a fantastic job all credit to them and uh, if you haven't tried one out  Go pick one up because they're awfully fun to use. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Agree, and there's so many projects you could do so many great things. We talked  On security now yesterday how you could do a vpn with the raspberry pi there's so much it's just it's just uh,  Incredible highly recommend it. Yeah, and and congratulations to the  raspberry pi foundation  Remember in the early days it was they were they could barely make enough to keep up  I mean, they really didn't have the supply down now. They can crank them out. That's great. Yes, especially the uh, the uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The normal size pie it's it's now version three figured it out  They're able to crank those out pretty well and the zeros for a long time  You couldn't get them. You couldn't get them. You couldn't get them  And now you're able to at least get one at a time from  Uh several different places. So yeah, um, they're catching up on the on the threes. I think that it's at five dollars. There's uh,  There's probably more skin in the game for them to get the thirty five dollar one out there  And in people's hands in the five dollar one, but boy it sure is a powerful little platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Another number from our our own patrick delahanty. Uh, he did some research there are fifteen thousand four hundred shows  publicly available in the twit database  And if the average show length is two hours  Well, let's even make it one hour. There's plenty of leo  If you build a bot to build a bot and google if you want to be my guest I could retire early  It'd be wouldn't be that hard just ran about twitter every week. Right? That's all you'd have to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matthew a different one. They'd have to yeah, that's right. Make up a plausible. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  leo rant bot  Uh matthew picker tip or anything you'd like to share with us a story I missed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was something interesting actually was in the lineup. Um youtube launching a  Community tab I thought was interesting. Yeah, and that's just started now, right? Yeah, so it's you know, it doesn't sound that  Fancy really I mean so you get a tab where you can kind of connect with your viewers and you can share more contact  Content and interact and so on but I think I think that could be a really uh,  Just a great tool for lots of people who spend a lot of time on youtube  Comments as we know on on youtube are flawed at best. I mean they make twitter look fantastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So i'm looking at my channel  Is this the discussion tab or is there actually a new community tab?  I think there's a new community tab. Okay, so I don't not everybody will have it yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know that it's gotten rolled out yet. Yeah  But it got it got if you know the vlog brothers the greens  Yeah, it was developed with them. They've they've done a really amazing job of  Of connecting with their community and and that's building all sorts of things on top of that  Yeah, I think it's something that youtube has kind of not really  Devoted a lot of time to in the past and uh, so it's interesting to see that happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there it is on the vlog brothers site. I guess that's uh says it says community. Yeah, and anybody can participate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and so instead of having to have your own site or your own blog your own or push people to your facebook page  You can do it all inside youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So is it google plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shape it looks a little bit plus even it does it does look a little bit like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's uh, let's see you got comments  So you can make a post and then there's threaded comments after it you can vote it up or down  Yeah, it does kind of have that feel  To it. I this is an addition though, right google plus didn't have the thumbs up thumbs down thing, right? That's great  That's kind of reddit style commenting. It's really more like reddit, isn't it? It is. Yeah. Yeah, it's gonna be interesting  Yeah, and they're getting great engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Media consumption. Yeah, well, that's pretty impressive. They've made a series of videos how to vote in every state  Uh, so they they take seriously their responsibility, which I think is great  Um, wow  Wow  That's kind of an eye-opener  Thank you matthew. Uh, how about you kevin marx? Let me guess indy web.org

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Indy web.org. Um, there's homebrew website club tonight in sunnyvale  um next week in san francisco brighton and places and um  The the weekend after that not this weekend the weekend after that. There's a there's actually a camp in brighton  Which is the full weekend?  Um fun, okay, do a quite bright so there's that coming up  But I wanted to show you a little thing that I had to get an indy web thing open together this week  So if you go to your are you running chrome? Yes  Okay, install the plugin. Okay  So add this to chrome. All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh, actually carsten's doing let me do it carsten at this at this side  um  So I have to go to get that link  Um, it's in the in i'm sure it's in the notes here. So let me just it's j.mp slash indy me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's easy j.mp

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  mp slash  Indy me me i n d i e m e  There you go, and then i'm going to add that to chrome  Okay, verify me. It's been added to chrome now what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now go to kevinmarks.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay  Oh because you've been verified

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what this is is distributed verification. Yeah, um, so you see my little links on the right there. Oh  These little green things that are appearing is it checking that those places link back with a real me  So I was looking for me it's looking for real me  It's even links with roll me on them then it's going and loading that site and see if they link back with a real me  Um, and then if you because it's a browser plugin if you click through to twitter  um  You will see the verification work the other way. So click through to my twitter  Mm-hmm  And scroll down so you can see the link on the side

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh check so it's really modifying existing pages. It's not something. I mean that you have to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so, but the the real mes are already there on lots of sites there on on twitter and wordpress and um,  github and  You know known and lots of us basically use real me because it's a standard we put together  13 years if something like that for saying these these sites are both me  Um, so what I what I realized was that we can actually do verification this way  um in a very distributed way because if if my site's linking to that site the other site's looking back then that that's clear it is  The same person or at least the person who controls both the sites. Maybe they've hacked all your sites, but you know at least it's it  It's not someone saying i'm leo look and i'm linking to your site because when the link back doesn't show it  Won't show that so yeah  If you go to twitter.com at leo laporte it it links to leoville and leo will link things back  You get a you get a green tick on it. Yeah, I just went to my keybase page

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unfortunately, i'm getting red x's on everything. I guess I have to add some real me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tags you have to let real me links links back and part of the problem is that some sites really have one link  um, so  It works better if you've got  You know if you've got a central hub that you link everything to so it's like twitter and github will only have one real me link  um, whereas um google plus will let you have an arbitrary number and um  Yeah, other sites will let you have more. Okay. So but the point is it does it did do it on twitter though

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I guess I must leoville.com. Oh, that's you know, why because that's with known  There you go. Yeah, so no one has done properly. Yeah. Yeah, but but but but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I made this  Because I suddenly realized hang on when twitter was talking about the verification thing  I thought well, we've had we've had this verification thing for a while. We just don't show the check marks  So I made the browser show the check marks  So now you can see it sees them as verify and it works on well it should work on  New social and things as well assuming they've actually marked up the pages and not then generate the javascript

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to get twit.tv to relme and tech guy lab. So that is a meta tag that doesn't appear  in the  Page but it appears in the html code. What should that relme be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so if you if you've used source on one of the links or  What pieces of one of mine it just it just ahref equals the place you're linking to rel equals me  And put it there and it's put in by default by as I say by twitter and github and google plus and a lot of sites already

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good. I'm glad i'm glad to hear that the more but this is this is basically distributed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Verification so you get little check marks next to next to places that have actually verified and I may turn off the red ones  Eventually because they're kind of obnoxious

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's fine, rel  So you see all of these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, they're mostly actually the bottom. I think they're at the bottom. Here's a relme

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. Let's keep looking. There's got to be some more. There's 21 of them. So there's a bunch of them  There we go, there we go  So this is this is a uh, this is your kind of your your link list and you see the rel equals  quote me quote  Next to that link just to say that's my site. That's my site. That's my site. That's my site

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then each of those sites i've done the same thing and done a link back  um, so if you if you if you went through to  My blog or flicker or whatever?  The link back is there as well and it'll show the check mark the other way around as well  So the point is is is mutual linking?  But it's a way of doing verification that doesn't require one central site to have to hold the key because it's distributed

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of why I use keybase keybase. Of course also keeps my pgp key  But keybase has a verific as a kind of  Much stricter verification thing. You have to be able to modify the dns of the site in order to get to verify it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is which is which is more work and the point about this is yeah  This is just a modify the html and actually many sites would just do this by default because it's it's a sensible thing to do. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
