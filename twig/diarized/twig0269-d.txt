Transcript:  Doing some kayaking you know waiting for winter to come yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Awesome yeah, and of course it's where you are right it can be certainly last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we were snowed under for a good long time so nothing  I get this I get to San Francisco now and then so I get a break

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See in these parts San Francisco is the coldest spot in the area so anyway come to Petaluma if you want to warm  Warmth and sunshine well let's jump let's jump into the news Google palace to pressure removes new snippets from German search results  I betcha Jeff you have a few things to say about this basically what's happened is that people said hey?  We want to cut to the profits from  That gravy train that Google's got going on where they you know basically put little snippets of news articles with the link  And so Google said well  You know just in case we're just going to go ahead and remove some of that information and it's probably going to affect them  So Jeff, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be careful what you wish for my friend exact  VG actual Springer, which is the big  Conservative news Corp like German publisher which has been waging war on Google and brought together other publishers to sue Google  They got this law passed. I've talked about before we've done a reggae beat on the life student should correct  and  And it's an ancillary copyright law and then  The law went through all kinds of changes and then and then snippets itself were not  Forbidden but then  The publishers it's too complicated for for morals  But the publishers then sued Google saying that they were Google was still stealing from them and wanted  I think 11% of Google's revenue or some such thing and so Google you know does what of course Google needs to do  They just said okay fine, so we'll take down the snippets  They will still put up headlines, but no snippets and no photos  And I'll bet you anything the publishers will lose traffic  But of course the publishers are now going to turn around and and say I just tweeted this  There's already starting to say it. I predicted they would they already are saying well  You're using your your your overdue info your oversized influence here to take down the content that we sued you to take it out  It's a cluster F in Germany. I was in  Mountain View brought out their paid only expenses nothing no no fees  to speak to the  Support engineers and sales engineers for what they now call work  a joke people under 50 won't get  and  So I did my spiel about Germany, and they said afterwards. I saw they said well you wound the Germans up here  But it's a huge huge issue while I was there also another story happened where a privacy commissioner in Hamburg has told Google  They may not  Create any user profiles without a full explicit permission from every user which is absurd and ridiculous  And of course every publisher has user profiles everybody has user profiles  And indeed I argue that publishers do a better job of it  But Germany's really become I spent the entire plane ride coming back from California just now  Writing a piece about the German problem that I want to place somewhere in the German press

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now they would have a they would have a case I would think if a significant number of people used Google News or Google Search as  Their newspaper just reading the the snippets and the summaries or whatever and never clicking on the links  Is this entering into the case at any point the degree to which?  Google search is being used as an alternative to clicking on the links and looking at the actual sites

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know that's that's part of the argument that's been made for some time  I actually haven't heard it lately that the people just read the snippets and they don't need to read us then but of course  We know that snippets cause links to happen and and and there hasn't I've always wanted to do a study at CUNY  And I've never managed to get it going  But I need cooperation of publishers to do this to find out what what is the optimum size of a link if it's too short  If it's just a headline, I will bet you it will not work if it's too long  Yes, if it's the whole story one could argue it takes over the whole experience  However, I've seen with repost on us that five to seven percent still click through to the source to read more  If it's a you know a description that attempts you and wants you to go to the story  Then I think that will probably increase the click through  And and so we don't know yet. What's  What's optimal?  You know for linkage, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like the thing that I keep saying since this this argument about Google and Google News first came up  Which feels like ten years ago  maybe it wasn't but it feels like that long and my point is if you're if a headline and  Two sentences from your story is enough to give people the value they need from that story  You're you have a problem with your story  It's not Google's problem that that two sentences or a snippet from your story is enough  For and people don't want to click through or don't see the value of clicking through  It's if you don't make your content compelling enough so that that's enough then that's that's your problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not Google's but isn't the standard generic newspaper format to be reverse pyramid style where the first paragraph?  Tells you the basic information the second paragraph tells you so it starts out very large and ends up getting more specific  And so if that's actually the style the newspapers are using and in fact if Google is taking the top part of it  Aren't they really giving you the main part of the story the nut of the story or whatever you want to call it  I mean, I think the the the proof is in the pudding if people are actually using as an alternative which I don't believe  Then that's one thing but but you know a lot of times people skim people are skimmers now. It's that's another problem  That we have in our democracy now that people aren't really reading more deeply

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna disagree in a couple ways Mike  I think first the fact that we skim we hit more stories and more facts and more things than we knew  Talking about skimming if you've got your news from 22 minutes of the evening news all you've got was the skim edge right right and  And now you get more number one number two. I wouldn't presume that people don't read in depth  This is part of the logical fallacy of the of the links are theft argument as opposed to links are gifts argument  Well people just read the link and they didn't read our story well who said they were ever gonna read your story anyway  Yeah, you're trying to prove a negative you're trying to say that they would have come to your story  Have they not read the link to your story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't quite work out either but people used to walk by newsstands all the time and look at the headlines  No one complained about them stealing the news by reading it right, you know off the paper and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and now we see a movement a born in here in and seeing that the  Getting away from the mass media metrics of reach and frequency unique users and page views raw eyeballs  Into higher value metrics of attention and so chart beat company in New York that does  pixel by pixel activity on on on pages metrics for those  Was certified as a Monday to be the first place to measure attention and so you have the financial times working with chart beat  to sell ten thousand attention minutes of  You know CEOs in Europe you have a medium  Selling advertising by time rather than by eyeballs and attention and your impressions  So you you have a movement now going to say that we're gonna sell attention  That doesn't mean by the way that you have to spend two hours reading the story  Tony Hale the CEO of chart beat argues that for  Circa for example  Going back 20 times a day can be just as valuable as spending 20 minutes there to the hour and their measurement

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their measurement is over time too. It's an aggregate. It's not just you know exposure time to a specific story  They look at exposure time over a month or whatever so if you come back enough and read enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's also a branding element here and also a  Some assumptions that are being made and and you know I did my best to play devil's advocacy  but in fact, I'm completely on Google side and against the the German  lawsuit and so on  Because what I found as a blogger is that I often promote my own stories on  Google Plus and elsewhere and what I found over the years is that if I give enough of the story  Sometimes more than my my editors and and the publishing companies they work for are comfortable with then and and actually  Promote the idea that people can get get all they want  Dip into to it and really understand the story just from my little summary then the  Link the which is a promotion an ad basically for the story itself is more likely to go viral people will share it  They'll comment on it more that plus one more if they understand the whole thing and there's got to be some kind of  equivalent metric for search results because you know if you give a really good juicy summary  That's enough to really get you know that's gonna spread like a story and then that's all promotion  So personally I found that being super cryptic or just giving a little tiny bit and being stingy with  Giving people a real sense of what the what's on the other side of the link works against you for promoting  Traffic to to the sites itself, so I think they're making an assumption there that I think needs a little bit more examination

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's interesting to me is if this if Google is actually  stealing  eyeballs or whatever by having  previews or snippets  Twitter does a lot of that to their Twitter cards the expanded view of articles  They've got effectively photo headline in some cases the first paragraph of articles. I wonder why no one you have any do you have any

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Insight into how those work versus just a simple headline in terms of click from tweets

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I do I just set them up for for think up actually the publisher is actually setting those up  So there's a few different styles and Twitter cards you can do the big image  You can do the small icon you can do you know the summary and the headline  There are some special Twitter cards like you can show photo galleries and that kind of thing  So if you ever see a news article that has that Twitter card enabled like that publisher has has set that up and  Enabled that and you have to get white listed and you have to have these you know particular tags and your in your markup and stuff  So then that's a different thing than what Google does which is a Google figures it out and shows it kind of on their own  With with Twitter you're actually  Setting it you do it right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just find it interesting that lots of publishers seem to see the value in doing that to the point to the point where they  Actually set it up themselves  But then you have other publishers who to obviously don't and in fact see that as a negative thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See well, there's a little different because people are commenting so someone is saying something  About about the article in their status update on Facebook or on you know in the tweet and then there's the attachment so  Yeah, there's and of course those look those sites they send a lot of traffic right as does Google  You know just to your earlier point about writing headlines and snippets and having something  You know that something's wrong with something is wrong with your story if the reader is satisfied by just previewing a snippet  I I wonder though about how that has has created the sort of rise of the up worthy style  Curiosity gap, you know  You won't believe what happens when this kitten jumps into a bucket of ice kind of style headlines that that we've talked about here  They get shared so much and go viral on Facebook. Sometimes people don't even read it  Right. They're like that. Yeah, this is this is great. So I I wouldn't I wonder about that a little bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know necessarily bad but the clickbait style. Yeah, no, I I actually was thinking more in terms of  It's similar. I guess to what Mike was saying  I think you're if you if you have delivered value to readers in the past  That is you the individual you the writer or you the media outlet and if you've given them something  Before that they feel was valuable then they're not going to just  Do you see what I mean? They're not gonna yeah  They're probably gonna click through because they expect that you will have things that are worth reading  Whereas if you if you do go for the sort of  Clickbait stuff you actually wind up doing the opposite of what you think you're doing  Because then the reader does click through and doesn't have a good  Experience or feels tricked or whatever and so then it actually you're further in the hole than you would be if you hadn't done that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but this this all goes to the to the outmoded mass media metrics that we operate under of  and advertising  Operate under of just of impressions and volume rather than value  If if if journalism is a service as I like to say these days  Then the service is accomplished if you're informed and know what you need to know  However that happens  We only have a model that says you have to come and read our whole story and spend time  Looking at as many ads as we can plop in front of your eyeballs  So we can rip off the advertisers charging them for these supposed impressions of you that model doesn't work either side doesn't work for the consumer  It doesn't work for the advertiser now Google came along and offered a better deal, which was performance. That was a step in the right direction  The magazine Publishers Association just for the first time this week started  Revealing their audience across all platforms for 147 brands and 30 companies  Chartbeat as I said earlier is now going to do with attention. I don't think either goes far enough  I think we have to go to is that you have a valued relationship with a news provider and  We find new ways because of that relationship because of the value we can bring you to to give you something back in return  And we haven't begun to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Felix Salmon wrote some about something what he called promiscuous media, which is media that  content effectively that lives wherever it needs to whether it's YouTube or medium or  Twitter or Facebook content that's effectively  Designed or intended to live there in that environment on that platform not to just be a call out to please click and go to  Our site but in order as you pointed out in order for that to be seen as valuable you have to you have to be  Monetizing your content in different ways than just driving as many people as possible to your specific corner of the web

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now part of this go ahead. I'm sorry Mike. I was gonna I was gonna I was wondering what you guys thought of this  Was a few a few weeks ago, maybe a couple months ago, but the saved you a click controversy about the the vox piece  Headline was did Tony Soprano die at the end of the Sopranos, right?  And they had the answer but it was six paragraphs into the piece and there's that Twitter handle saved you a click at which  No spoilers put the answer  And and then someone wrote I forget who it was  Maybe I mean because it was at a verge writer another box writer, but someone wrote this very angry  You know long piece explaining why this person had done  Yes stolen experience and this person had done all this work to write this amazing long story that like built you up to the big reveal  and that's and that took it away and  Yet, you know as a very casual not even really a big fan of the Sopranos, but still sort of wondered I was like, oh great  Thanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To me I actually went and read it. I mean even though I got the answer what from saved you a click  I still went and read it. So I guess I don't know maybe I  Care you cared and it interested me enough  I wanted to find out all the you know  extraneous color and detail around how they found that out or what the explanation was or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well the juice really didn't stop me from clicking. Yeah, the juicy nugget that they that was revealed was a good nugget  It was something that that suggested that the story would be interesting to you half the time those kinds of headlines  Say you're not gonna believe what Bob but when you find out you're like, that's not even interesting. Exactly  And so it can be a tease but I I'd go to Jeff point Jeff's point on this as well  Which is that you know without those sorts of Twitter feeds you might not ever see that article anyway  There's so many articles out there that you never get anywhere near them and somebody who's subscribing to those types of Twitter feeds  There are several of them out there and there I really like them, you know  You're you're not gonna see those things anywhere else. They're you they're teasing stories  You're probably not gonna see elsewhere if they are specific to  Buzzfeed or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you know and you know bringing it back to to Google News those publishers just like the ones in Belgium where the same thing happened  Not only will they see traffic decline, but they're they're missing the the point if the point is to reach  More people with your content and convince them that you're smart and you have things that are worth reading  Then whether they read that specific article or not isn't really the point  and so  You know their viewpoint is we it's our content  We should control it and they they feel like they already have all the audience they need so Google's stealing it  You know, that's a completely different way of thinking about kind of what your job is as a newspaper

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. Well, we're going to come back and hear about Facebook's apology to quote affected drag queens unquote  We'll find out which drag queens were affected in which were not  But first I want to tell you about our first sponsor today, which is Citrix go to meeting, of course  Good communication is crucial for business  You don't want to leave Jeff Jarvis out of your meeting and so you want to make sure you use a great tool like Citrix go to  meeting  Enabling you to connect with remote clients co-workers and everyone else you want to meet with let's face it  There's so much wasted money and time on business travel for meetings that could be done over Citrix go to meeting  So you definitely want to use the proven solution for meeting and collaborating online if you sign up for go to meeting before October 10th  This is an awesome deal.

Well the sisters of perpetual indulgence  got a big victory today the  Facebook actually apologized to members to  The effective community of drag queens  I'm gonna read the whole apology by Facebook here the apology part of their message  Which is quote I want to apologize to the affected community of drag queens drag kings  Transgender and extensive community of our friends neighbors and members of the LGBT community  For the hardship that we've put you through in dealing with your Facebook accounts over the past few weeks  They said they would revisit their real names policy to make it possible for  Drag queens who have stage names to use those stage names  As their name on Facebook and  This sounds to me, I don't know how you all feel about this, but this sounds to me like a complete  phony baloney response to this because basically they're saying if you're a performer and  You have a stage name and you use that stage name as your actual name in real life  Generally speaking if you really go by little miss hot miss hot mess  That's really the name you go by in real life  Then you can go ahead and use that on Facebook and we're gonna let you do that  that doesn't sound like  It's gonna fit how many people are professional drag queens. I mean, you know, they haven't solved any problem here. But what do you guys think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to agree Mike. I I wrote about this when it first happened. I've been a big  Proponent of anonymity online for a long time, even though I know lots of people blame it for all the world's problems  But I I fundamentally believe that allowing people to comment and behave anonymously has value  And so Facebook has always been  To some extent trying to suck and blow at the same time. They've been trying to say well  You can use a quote-unquote fake name, but only if that's what you go by in real life  So as you pointed out if you're a drag performer and you can you can say well  This is what people know me by if you're effectively a celebrity in some sense  Then you can do that but regular people can't and so the you know  Although that community was what sparked this issue that's not the sum total of the issue  I mean or the problem there are  Lots and lots of users who are trans and gay and fall into all sorts of categories who cannot use  The name that they want and what they get is Facebook asking them for their birth certificate or their driver's license that  From from what I could tell that is not going to change now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's a solution that seems kind of obvious to me and and Gina maybe you can help me with this because I  Don't understand why all the social networks don't do this the solution to me seems to be that you if you they want to demand  real names of course  Twitter and Google Plus don't demand real names Google Plus doesn't anymore they did for a long time  But why don't they just?  Demand your real name to be privately given to the social network and then allow the public to see your pseudonym  That way they get both  The best of both worlds they know who exactly who you are they can you can use your account  As your identity you can use it for buying things you know all that stuff  But then you never have to reveal it to the public what's wrong with that solution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think for some communities particularly imagine  You know a kindergarten teacher in a very conservative part of you know of the country who you know  Is it is a drag queen performer at night who literally has you know is living a double life?  And doesn't necessarily want to out him or herself you know I mean I mean there are situations  But my legal name by the way is Regina McTrapazoid. I just go by Gina Trapani because it's a lot easier here  I mean this isn't just about drag queens right it's about broadcasters and musicians and artists and book like people who write and use  Penn names like it's about people and you know I mean that and the real name  I don't even like when people say real name. It's legal name. It's your given names  It's the name that your parents gave you and that's on you know a sheet of paper that says you were born right?  But that doesn't that isn't necessarily who you are and as far as I'm concerned like people should just be able to say  This is how I want you to refer to me and period that's real. That's real enough for me  So I just I don't know this whole identification thing and your legal name is this and what if I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't like it, but there's no technical reason. There's no technical reason right I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Technical reason and in fact this came up during the Google plus you know Nimours or whatever you want to call them, too  There is no technical reason why Facebook couldn't do that  There's a reason why some users might not want to to present that name even privately to Facebook because they don't trust  The company to keep that data separate and they don't trust you know  They can't trust where that information is going to wind up  But you know it to me it feels and I could be wrong  But it feels to me like Facebook mainly wants you to use your quote-unquote  Real name or given name because that's what advertisers want here's I don't think yeah, I'm sorry to interrupt you Matthew

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But here's the thing that really bugs me is that certain types of names?  Can be used  Pseudonym and you know you I could go to Facebook right now and start a cat an account  I could make up a name and I'd have an account they'd never know  Right, but if that name happens to be little miss hot mess hot mess  They're gonna say well it doesn't sound right or if I have some other outrageous name  So you know the vast majority of fake name there are huge numbers of people on Facebook using fake names without consequence

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, right when you've been reported or someone has marked you as abusive  You know what's the first thing the police ask you when they pull you over show me your ID right like and but that's a way  that authorities assert power and  You know show me who you are show me your credentials my you know working at a college campus first thing you ask a student  Who's doing something wrong what you know show me your ID?  It is this it is a power move it is kind of power relationship, and I just don't like I  Get the Facebook has this problem where they need to make decisions about whether or not people are actually  behaving badly or abusing someone and and and getting their actual legal name is some indicator whether or not this person is is for  Real I don't know, but I feel like for the majority of Facebook's users  They should be known by how they want to be known and and that's that should be it and to be honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels to me like Facebook. You know apart from the advertising  Element or whether that's what advertisers want they you know reading Chris Cox's description of how it happened  They all got lumped in with a bunch of these other reports and someone flagged their accounts  Maliciously or whatever and they didn't it feels to me and obviously they have a billion users  So this stuff is not simple, but they could do the things we're describing if they wanted to  They could make it easier for people to use pseudonyms  They could structure things so that you could do that and they could still achieve their objectives  They just clearly don't want to or they don't want to devote the time and resources to making that happen  So that says something about their priorities

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was there really a departure a mass departure to LO or was that just a phony baloney  Trumped up this sort of rumor that people grabbed on to and reported as fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I can't remember the joke what's the name of it? What was the name of the other?  And what else and and and I'm on diaspora I'm before that  Yeah, I mean I had a reporter called me today about this  And I said I'm I'm dubious of the killers if you think that they're making a killer that you're not being creative enough  You're not really inventing something new and of value and you're not gonna kill whatever you think you're killing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not gonna work. It is true that LO did seem to attract a whole lot of artistic  Users, I think partly because it was designed and created by designers  And so they reached out to friends in the creative community  I don't feel like there was a huge influx of people running away from Facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly right some people started LO accounts, but they didn't close their Facebook account. So what's the point?  I mean eventually they'll be annoyed by LO because it's pretty hard to use  I think for the most part and they'll just gravitate back to where people are that they know and that's the thing that  Enables Facebook to get away with all this kind of stuff  Which is that they have a monopoly on everybody?  Everybody's on Facebook because everybody's on Facebook and you have to be there if you want to interact with the people  You know, that's the bottom line and they can they can harass you they can violate your privacy. They can lie to you they can  Censor your news feed they can do anything they want and they'll be you know  For the most part most people aren't gonna leave there are reasons people leave  Sometimes they leave because they don't they're not sure about the privacy policies  So they go to snapchat or whatever so they can have these conversations that are definitely private

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but people don't leave because of this kind of stuff. Well, and you know what Gina said I think brings up a good point and  the sort of free speech implications of Facebook and Twitter and other platforms are I find fascinating because effectively  Our sort of public square our digital public square has been privatized  and so we have a whole bunch of shopping malls where you can go and wave signs around and say whatever you want and  behave the way you want until the mall cops come and say you have to get out of here because they own that building and  so, you know all of these decisions that places like Facebook make as  As sort of minor as they might seem are effectively  Laws for this sort of social space that we as you pointed out pretty much have to belong to  And so all those decisions have real-world implications and social and political and sort of behavioral implications

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah with LO  I mean what was interesting to me about LO is is just that the I think there was a huge spike in LO  Registrations and hype and media and then it was getting getting talked up a lot  I don't think people were leaving Facebook, but LO's whole  Value proposition was we're not Facebook. We're not gonna sell you ads  We're gonna treat you like a human being and not a set of eyeballs  And so it was interesting to me that people responded to that  But this has happened so many times people responded to that with diaspora and they raised a ton of what was back then on  Kickstarter a ton of money people responded to this with app net and paid a $50  You know subscription fees like this is a this is something that resonates with users particularly savvy users  It means something I think there's a whole group of you know  I think there's an ardent group of people hoping that one of these  Either federated or anti Facebook not Facebook networks will actually prevail in the end  I don't know if they actually will but there's interest here. So that interests me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a continual sort of  need or hunger desire for something else for something that sort of treats you like a human being and and it just keeps  Emerging from time to time under a different name. The thing I notice is  Certainly my daughters who are you know in their early 20s teens  Have no interest in Facebook and never go there. So what they're using are completely other networks  For other reasons in many cases because they offer different forms of privacy or anonymity  You know Facebook is non-existent for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, well speaking of young people using social media Google Plus today announced Google announced today that Google Plus now has a new  Setting a new feature that enables you to designate your profile as for adults only you can  Basically, it's an audience editing tool on Google Plus. You let you set filters based on age and location  So you can actually zero in and and and say, you know  This is only for people in certain locations and this helps companies comply with local laws around this sort of thing  But it seems to me that they're paving the way for enabling maybe a little bit more freedom about what sort of content you can put  on Google Plus  Because if you can age restrict it then you can go ahead and and have more  Adult like content that may be in the future less likely to be censored right now. There's you know, any sort of  Anything that's more than PG-13. I think they pretty much  Not language-based you can pretty much say anything but for pictures and that sort of thing anything above PG-13  They will block you or they'll you know, take you out of the system or whatever. Is this is this a good idea?  I mean and also one of the criticisms that's being leveled against this is that you can't designate  individual posts as being either  Adults only or not you you can only say everything that I do is for adults only or nothing  I do is for adults only but what you guys think about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is similar to it doesn't Twitter have a setting where you can say mark my media as privates or sensitive  And I think it applies to all of your tweets. So then if you if you attach an image or whatever, it's collapsed by default  This is interesting. I hadn't seen this. So why so so okay age I get  Why would you restrict your Google Plus posts to a particular geographic area?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No idea. Um, possibly. I mean maybe if  you know if you have local laws you're concerned with if you're in a certain community and you have business in that community and  There's a law for that area or that country or that county or whatever it is  You can comply I guess and it doesn't apply outside. I'm not really sure I haven't played with these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's say you're a German publisher for example. Yeah, for example. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  marijuana dispensary

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay. All right. All right. Okay, so to sort of check this out you go to your Google Plus profile settings  I haven't done this myself, but this these are the instructions posted online and you select the audience tab again  This is Google Plus profile settings audience tab and open a variety preset and customizable post filters and you can choose  These new filters that are in there now  So that's a kind of a an interesting new wonder if they were getting criticism for you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Age inappropriate content showing up in people's streams or something  I don't this doesn't feel like a feature like that lots of people would be crying out for well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're they're their algorithmic filtering is so horrible  If you go to your notification, I mean my notifications is 50%  Fine and 50% What are you giving me? Why are you giving me this?  It's like somebody in some other country just saying hey  And it's a picture of themselves like standing in a parking lot and I what there's you know out of all the users on Google Plus  This is what you've determined your algorithms have determined that I really want it's crazy  But sometimes you're going through that filter and I was like, whoa all of a sudden  It's quite inappropriate and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's to make up for the fact that their filters can't do that already I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mike are you still is Google Plus still your sort of primary writing platform?  I know that you've been really bullish and very active on Google Plus for a long time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have like two million followers or something or in two million circles or so I do I do it's still growing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still growing at about two thousand per day, which is pretty crazy  Wow, it's it's very active. I'm it's my primary for a long time  It was my exclusive social network  But since I've been at twit I am using Twitter and some other things because that's I got to go where the whole audience is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, did you actually write? Did you write full things on Google Plus?  Was that a strategy that you used in the beginning or I tested that I wrote a few columns

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what I did was I had some circles of  Editors and and other people who had volunteered and I basically did my drafts there and they you know  I had people commenting and stuff. It was pretty cool  But I don't do that anymore for the most part  I do use it for crowdsourcing I use it for all kinds of stuff and I do really like it a lot  I just find the conversation so good there and I I have zero trolls zero. I mean, you know, that's not exactly true  I never encounter trolls more than once and when I encounter them, I block them and I never hear from them again  And it's just fantastic for that purpose and I love it for that purpose  And I also like the fact that it's got a clean user interface  I still like all that stuff and I like all the people there. I've actually made a few things  I've actually made real friends on Google Plus, which is one of the rare things that you can do with a social network  Met them in person and all that kind of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I've had an account for a long time and I I post content there lots of not just my own posts  But photos and whatnot. I have a lot. I mean lots of circles  300,000 or something and I post things there and I get nothing. I might get like one comment  Yeah, I get so I'm obviously doing something wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you are go ahead yeah you are I was off for a while so sorry that's weird because I  I've actually been abusing Google Plus thing that I haven't used as much as I should but I tend to get comments  I tend to get stuff  The the the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the horde on Google Plus is an odd creature  They respond to certain things and don't respond to others and it's just amazing and one of the things they respond to is  Heavy use and primary use so if you were to use Google Plus as your primary  Place where you're posting things all the stuff that you post on Twitter, which is all great stuff  If you were to do that every day after a few weeks  They would start gathering and that you'd get this buildup of momentum. I guess it's just not a repeat  You know I do it from time to time, but not it's not regular activity

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what I would probably do it more if Google had an open API where I could use third-party  To post to it. Yeah, and that's really the solution that I think most people don't I think we need a big movement of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Calling for interoperability between the social networks because right now it's considered first of all socially  Unacceptable to to sort of auto post using the various people hate cross posting  For some reason I actually think it's a it's better than everybody living in their own little individual silos and also it's better than  Having to spend all your time chasing down conversations on all these multiple things it'd be great people see it as a spam  I guess yeah, I know Kevin Marx yelled at me for cross posting once

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's it's actually a good solution if you do it right the way I do it as I use plus me and so on Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It works great Facebook doesn't work so great, but on Twitter is what it's called friends plus me plus sign and then me.com  And it's just a tool you just enacted and then everything you post on Google Plus goes to Facebook  And then everything you post on Google Plus goes to Twitter with a link so essentially the first line of what you post which I tend to use as a headline  It's a perfect tweet, and it gives you a perfect link and that link goes back to Google Plus  And so I actually am inviting Twitter users to come to Google Plus and have a conversation with the Google Plus people  It's one conversation. I have to manage one place and it's a it's a great solution  And I think when people complain to me that I'm cross posting. I'm it's like  Why is that why is cross posting better than that's that's home delivery Mike exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, yeah, I agree  When I was at speaking to the to the the work people I held up my Chromebook and that alone got applause  And I said, you know, I take I take about as much crap for this as I do for like a Google Plus and that also got a laugh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good one all right that must have done well in a room full of Googlers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did I did and by the way by the way there were 250 Googlers in the room and so I was talking about this  Well twig came up of course as I said how many of you watch twig and and a good I'd say third raised their hands  And then I said, oh what if it's only Googlers watching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right how many employees that they have and how many is one third of those employees yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As long as they're patronizing our sponsors

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right. Get them open up the Google Plus API

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Alright, so we've got another story coming out of Europe and and and Jeff I'm gonna defer to your pronunciation. Is it Gunter?  Otenger how did I do?  Yeah, so he's the  Yeah, thank you. He's the new Commissioner EU Commissioner who?  Admitted Monday that he's the one who derailed the settling of an antitrust investigation against Google  Well as a lot of people trying to credit for that now yeah exactly  Well, he is a politician and he said that if I hadn't been opposed to it the Google case would have been settled back in March  He's and then now they're saying that there's fresh evidence and solid arguments from 20 formal complaints  Persuading them that Google needs to present a better settlement offers this of course is around the whole issue of Google providing information that competes against their competitors  And I don't know and this is related of course to the focus on the user campaign and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a user campaign at all. It's it's it's it's the publishers. It's actual Springer and company same exact people. They've they've run this  Campaign they run big ads and papers. They brought in News Corp, which you know we talked about the Robert Thompson letter two weeks ago and  And  They're running that they're making Google into the into the big enemy and so they derailed they succeeded in derailing  Disgruntling now what's what's troubling about that as I watched on Twitter?  And then translated as best I could tweets from the newspaper conference in Germany  Two days ago, and you had Angela Merkel the Chancellor going and paying homage and and and regretting how they've lost  Their newsrooms and what a shame this is you have the head of the SPD the left party in the Bundestag  Coming forward and saying that we have to contain Google's market power  You have the Justice Minister of the country previously as we talked about the show calling for Google to be broken up  and Google's been frankly sitting there either being silent or  According to a friend of mine a bit a bit rude and and haughty  And they haven't found at all the right way to have this discussion and it's gonna damage not just Google our big fear  Is it's gonna damage the net this is spreading from Germany. We have the tax on links being proposed in Spain  We have the right to be forgotten  Techno euro panic is spreading and it's gonna have a huge impact on the net  So now you have at the EC the person in charge of this replaces somebody who was actually pretty forward-thinking  In most ways nearly Cruz  It is now the head and he's bragging about how he's all for the right to be forgotten  He's bragging about how he sided with the publishers to kill the settlement that are already made in the EU  You have German politicians and in the pocket of these media companies  The company the politicians they're supposed to be covering instead  They're running to these politicians to get help with their failed businesses. It's a really sucky situation there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it absolutely is and and you know, sometimes I in my moments of darkness  I wonder whether the Europeans just want to shake down American tech companies for the money  I mean in this case there certainly Mike that's absolutely all the publishers. I have heard them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shortle and giggle about this there. They're smart people. They know better  They know that Google is not going to pay them 11% of their of their revenue for linking to them  I mean, well, how stupid can you be?  They're not that stupid when when Matthias Duffer the head of Springer argues that he's scared of Google  I don't believe that for a second there laughing thinking we got Google over the barrel  But there's unintended consequences galore here. And when I talked to IFA in Germany, I argued this is going to hurt Germany badly  Would you invest in Germany right now? I sure as hell would not I would not if I were a tech company  I'd get as far away from there as I possibly could and it's just at the time that the Berlin startup scene has taken off  What I heard when I was in Berlin is that you can only get angel many in Germany because Germany Germans don't want to risk anything more of their capital for these startups  So what happens is the VCs in America come after the good ones and they make a move to the US or they buy them and make them come to the US  So so this atmosphere is going to cause a brain drain in Germany just what it most needs the ability to grow its technology world  Now what Google should do I think is actually counterintuitive here  It should invest like crazy in German technology. So it's not alone trying to argue against the Luddites  Right now Google's alone as the boogeyman enemy against failing institutions that have not figured out how to adapt the new world  And government and publishers are in a holy alliance together and it's ugly. Sorry for the rant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Matthew Ingram, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I couldn't agree more with Jeff. It feels to me like a just a plain old revenue grab and it feels a lot like countries  I'm not as as informed about the sort of internal politics as Jeff in Germany, but I do know that in lots of European countries  They are afraid because their economies are weak there there they have no real startup sort of, you know, ecosystem going there  And they're afraid to be to be honest of large American web companies like Google and Facebook  And and so I think they see them as they see these types of laws as a way of of asserting some control over them and potentially generating some revenue  That's what it feels like to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this a German cultural thing? I mean, it reminds me of the of the beer purity laws, Jeff  Where basically they have these very stringent requirements for what can be put into beer and Germany has fantastic beer  But the variety that they have in Germany is sort of the bot they're behind the times in terms of the crazy experimentation that's going on in the rest of the world  Is this a German cultural thing? I mean, they have a lot of public support for this these sort of sentiments

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, actually, actually, they don't they don't keep in mind this is very important Google has its second highest market share in Germany as anywhere in the world  And so it's ninety ninety three percent, right? Yeah. Sixty three percent in the U.S.  So so full, you know, I'm gonna get my math right here. Half higher than the U.S.  That's that's gigantic, which is to say that the German user likes Google and has no problem and uses them  It's this campaign by publishers and government, but perception can become reality  And and it's going to become reality if Google doesn't figure out the right way to fight back yet  And they haven't figured out they're either silent or haughty and that's not the right thing to do. And to be honest, I think the whole NSA thing hurt a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely American web companies. They you I mean, Google said we have nothing to do with this  And meanwhile, there's all these reports about, you know, the FBI or whoever NSA tapping cables and putting boxes in their in their colos  And and so everybody I think just got nervous about what was happening to their data when when they were using these companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and that reminds me of the you mentioned the NSA there was a story that we don't have on the dock here this morning  I'll just mention it briefly, which is that Eric Holder, who's the of course the attorney general of the United States gave a speech yesterday  Where he is was essentially throwing Apple and Google and the bus because of their strong encryption  And he was speaking in front of a group of people who were gathered together to protect children from predators  Online predators, sexual predators, kidnappers and other threats that some children face  And he was, you know, as a kind of a think of the children kind of a speech and these these dirty rotten Silicon Valley companies are adding this encryption  That prevents police and the FBI from successfully prosecuting criminals and predators  And, you know, it really bugged me because those this new encryption movement is a reaction to the NSA and unconstitutional mass surveillance by

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's that fits their argument, though  The whole argument is you need to let us spy on you at all times because you or someone you know may be doing something bad  And so we need to install cameras in your house and, you know, suck in all your data because you might be doing something bad  You could be trading child porn or you could be thinking about joining ISIS

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so we need to be but this this is the real right to be forgotten  This is the right for you to to to couple up your own piece of paper to to, you know, erase your own file  That's that's still right. And that's still the essence of privacy is is what I control  And when you lose control over the government, no, I every time I go to Europe, I apologize for being American with the NSA  It's it's it's important with the NSA has done and it needs control  And I think that encrypting everybody I when I was at Google, I said screw the government in this case  Who who's who's your daddy here? It's your users and you've got to enable encryption of everything or else people are going to trust you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the most perfect segue for our next conversation, which is the focus on the user campaign  If you haven't seen this, it's an organization that's going after Google  It's an organization comprised of Google's competitors Yelp, TripAdvisor, Holiday Check and others  And they created this amazing video. It's it's actually a really great video. Let's go ahead and roll that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When the Internet was first getting off the ground, its information was overwhelming  No one no one knew how to access the data. So it wasn't very helpful  Then Google came along organizing the world's information  They made it universally accessible and useful through an algorithm  This formula looked through all the information and help sort it out and presented to users in the way we've all come to appreciate  This changed everything how we did business and relationships, how we accessed information, even how information was provided  And once the most relevant sources were being rewarded and delivered to the user  People came to depend on these results and lean upon Google's stated goal of focusing on users  Which led to one of the biggest evolutions of Google search when Google started to deliver more specific results in the form of answers  Instead of just links to sites, Google started looking at other types of information  Knowledge-based Google Now etc.  It sorted through the information of the world to try and deliver the actual answer you were looking for  How do you do that?  They actually make a compelling argument in about a minute or so  It's graphic  This is the innovation of those providing good information  So what was once a trusted platform to find relevant answers is now being questioned because if it's not being done in the best interest of the user  Who is it valuable for?  Right now Google is being investigated because the interests of users, institutions and businesses that have come to depend on Google are being threatened  The solution? For regulators, Google, innovators and most importantly users is for Google to start acting more like Google  That's what it means to focus on the user  Allow the best unbiased results on the first page without giving preference to Google Plus or anyone else  The trust of users, the health and innovation of business ecosystems and the rights of everyone to have access to information depend on it  You can protect the integrity of search  Download Focus on the User Local to see examples of the unbiased results that are possible  Share this message and contact members of the European Commission  We can keep the internet honest by helping Google continue to focus on the user

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think Jeff? That sounds reasonable  Hold on, no, no, it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Keep the internet honest? Really?  For a couple reasons  Back to the trusted algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, sorry Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, fine, if Google is required to link to Yelp in some formula, then does Yelp require to link to Google?  I have the same problem with the German publishers  They made a video very similar, kind of all this is cute, we're going to make it all seem so cute, make you understand you idiots video  In which they said, search for shoes on Google and my god, they show you their advertisers  Well now go to Bilt, the largest publication in Europe owned by Ashleigh Springer  See that there's a little link on top for Shua in shoes  What do you see there? You see Bilt's advertisers and nothing else  What do you see on Google? You see their advertisers of course, you see the rest of everything you could possibly want about shoes  I just searched on hotels in Madrid  Because I'm going there soon  On Google  At the top I see their ads, I see ads and sponsored things, it's clearly labeled  A lot of ads, Google sells a lot of ads, there's a lot of demand for it, that's true  But I don't see that there's, what they were accused of doing in the video was presenting algorithmic listings and paid listings looking exactly the same  Show me how  That says ad, that says ad, that says sponsored  On the right it says ads  So show me how that's true and then maybe you convince me, but I don't see it  Right below there is TripAdvisor  First listing, TripAdvisor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a, and is it, does it also disable their point to a certain extent, invalidate their point to a certain extent  That these are just competitors who are trying to compete by essentially changing public opinion, which is I guess the definition of propaganda

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well no, they're not trying to change public opinion, they're trying to change policy opinion, they're trying to hide behind government  This is the great irony of News Corp and Actual Springer fighting this  Because they are both conservative bastions of conservative thinking  Don't like big government, have been awfully critical of the EU  When they can't make their business work, what do they do? They run behind the skirt of the EU government  Gina, you were trying to say something a minute ago and I interrupted  This is my bad habit

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, that's okay, no, I was, it was just interesting to me that the video had this concept of like there was a trusted Google  And now there's not a trusted Google and can we just get back to the trusted algorithm  Good old Google, before they had this  Whoever trusted the algorithm  Right, this is the algorithm  And also weird that Google+, I never see Google Plus results in search results  Very rarely do I see Google  I found that interesting that Google Plus was the thing that got plugged into the machine and was stuffing results  I mean, I gotta tell you, I just ran the search for hotels in Madrid, this is on my 15 inch MacBook  And partially because this big image bar across the top  Like the actual results that aren't ads are below the fold, like I actually do have to scroll in order to get to that first  Images take up a lot  The images do take up a lot and those are not sponsored as far as I can tell, that's just an image  I think they are, I think they're commerce links, aren't they?  The images? Are they or not?  It's just encrypted.google.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's rating, I wonder, oh that's a good question

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That could be Google Plus, that could be Google Local, which is, you know, remember the Zagat guys  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I mean, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's also in Maps, so it's the same database

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, and Maps is taking up a chunk on the right there, which is just a useful search result  Most of my searches don't look anything like this, this happens to be a very highly sold search results  But anyway, yeah, no, the video is just interesting  I mean, are users complaining?  It sounds like the publishers are the ones who are complaining  You know, like this idea that this is about the users, right?  Like, I don't know  Well, be careful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Those other tech companies, be careful because they're going to come after you next  You're American tech companies and you're being demonized  And so you play in with their hand and they're going to turn right back around and say  Oh, you have to link to our stuff, we're going to come after you and ask you for money for links  Watch out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the only possible solution is that Google is somehow regulated and forced to rank links in a specific way  That is the only other option to allowing Google to do whatever its algorithm or its desire to place ads tells it to do  Unless you accept their argument that there's no visual difference between

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm not sure that's exactly true  But if there in fact is no visual difference between their Google Plus result and what would be the natural result  Then that's one option  But I agree with you, that's not what they want  You could say there has to be a flag

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then they said some good results are not being included and then you see the result drop out of the list  So then Google would have to be required to have a certain number of links to a certain number of external sites  Within a certain, you know, and then you've got a Google regulator

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that implies that there's a tiny number of other companies that are going to be privileged  They can't add results from every single company that provides hotel information

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a recipe for disaster

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely  By the way, the best source of recommendations is person to person  So Jeff, I'm going to give you a recommendation  The very best pizza place in the world is in Madrid  You got to go to this place  The guy's Italian and he's a recent immigrant to Spain  But it's called Pizza Teca

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a perfect name for you to like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly, but Teca is spelled T-E-C-A and the URL is La Pizza Teca  And it's just the most fantastic pizza I have ever tasted in my life  No man, with an oven in your backyard  Exactly, right  The guy ferments his dough for three days and then he adds yeast at the end  He told me it's something he learned from his grandmother  Anyway, it's a great restaurant  But back to the tech news in just a sec  We're going to come back, we're going to take a break  And then we're going to come back and talk about, I don't know, maybe Julian Assange  And some of his comments about Google and Eric Schmidt's response and so on  But first, I want to tell you about Personal Capital  Personal Capital is a good service  It's one of our sponsors today and it's good because money is good  It's good for you to hang on to the money that you've earned and they help you do that  One of the ways they help you do that is right now we've all got our financial stuff scattered all over the world  On different sites, in different financial companies, in banks, 401Ks, all over the place  And Personal Capital is really cool because it brings together all that data into, it puts it together  So it shows your money, what's coming in, what's going out  And it lumps it together in a way that's very intuitive and easy to understand  And I really appreciate that  I also like the fact that they have an Android Wear application  Or an Android application that supports Android Wear, I guess, is more accurate  They were one of the first companies to support Android Wear  And I had been using this app, I don't know, for about three hours  And I got a message saying that I had some kind of a fee that was going to be charged against my bank account  If I didn't take action, I took action, I avoided a $35 fee within the first few hours  And that's essentially what this free app does  It saves you money and it shows you your money so you can make better investment decisions  So it's really a great thing, there's no reason not to use Personal Capital  Set up your free account, go to personalcapital.com slash twig  And Personal Capital is free and it's a smart way to grow your money  And we thank Personal Capital for their support of this week in Google  Well, Vanity Fair has a big article about, I don't know if you guys saw this  But it was Julian Assange did a kind of an Obi-Wan Kenobi type of hologram interview  Where he was basically going after Google and saying that Google was the NSA or working with the NSA  And quite an interesting thing  I don't know, we didn't queue up a video of that, Chad, but if you can find that  It's actually in one of the story links there  Very bizarre, let's take a look at this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what has presented over the last ten years has been some fluffy graduate student  Colorful, like its logo, playroom of ideas  And a different sort of company, not even a company at all  Something that gives free services  It's not that, it's a normal company  Just like other normal companies in the US that are very big  And it should be seen as a normal company  Unlike other companies, however, it is engaged in a very ambitious project that is not normal  In terms of its business  And that is to collect as much information about the world as is possible  Store it, index it, make predictive models about people's interests  And use that to sell advertising  And of course the National Security Agency comes along  Given that Google is doing basically what the National Security Agency is doing  In terms of collecting information, storing it, indexing it, and attaching it to people  And sticks its fangs in  And sucks the information that Google sucks  And that's going to be the case no matter what Google does  Unless it leaves the US jurisdiction

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I'm probably in the minority, but I actually love advertising  I think it's the most moral form of monetization for most online services  And I'll tell you why  Because basically those people who use the advertisements  And buy the products and services advertised  Subsidize the services for everybody, including people who can't afford it  This is especially true with social networks and so on  And that's why I don't like any sort of social network that charges admission  Like app.net, I was kind of against that service  And of course contextual advertising in principle is a great thing  Because I don't want to see ads for Wrinkle Cream  And maybe I need it, but I don't want to see those ads  I don't want to see irrelevant advertisement  I want to see relevant advertisement  I want it to be so relevant that it feels like I'm getting search results  For things I would have searched for if I had thought of it  And of course to me that's the big problem with Google and Facebook  And everybody else who claims to harvest our personal data  For the sake of serving up contextual advertising  And they don't know how to do it well in my experience  I think they're terrible at it  I don't really understand why  But anyway, what do we think of Julian?  Of course he's in the Ecuadorian embassy in London still  And that's why he had to be beamed in  What do you think of his comments there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't stop focusing on that  I'm just thinking that I'm going to cancel all my airplane tickets  And I'm hologramming in everywhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to admit that is awesome  That looks amazing  I would do that  New plot after Twitter  Sit in your living room and get beamed in by holograms  Fantastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a high-res 3D version of what we're doing here basically  Amazing  Yeah, that is fantastic  But he's been trading barbs with Eric Schmidt  Because they both have books essentially  And I don't know, I haven't read

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you read the vignette that Julian Assange mentions in his book about Eric Schmidt?  Eric Schmidt's girlfriend came to see him  And was effectively  His allegations as I recall them are  That he was talking with someone about  The government, about the NSA, that type of stuff  About WikiLeaks  And he got a visit from Eric Schmidt's girlfriend  And someone from the State Department  Or I think it was  Might have been Jared Cohen anyway  Someone who was either associated with or had been associated with the State Department  So his allegation is that effectively Eric Schmidt is a couple of steps away from being a government operative  Which is the type of thing that Julian Assange likes to say  I don't know if I believe that  But certainly his claims in the video that Google is a business  Clearly it is a business  Clearly it is trying to gain as much information about its users as possible  That seems pretty  I have no problem agreeing with that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all very weird  And that vignette, I had not heard that  But that is very strange  And it's quite a leap  Some people have worked for the State Department  I don't think that necessarily means that Eric Schmidt is  And besides, why would he work for the government?  He's got a much better job than anybody in the government  Including the President, if you ask me  It's true  So, yeah, kind of a weird type of deal  Well, Google is getting into the streaming music service business  They've upped the ante on their music business  These are based on essentially rumors  That Google is going to be unveiling another streaming service  And they're going to  We had a conversation on this on Tech News today  And the big question was  Why does Google torture itself and torture us  With all these different sources of music?  They've got YouTube, they've got Google Play Music  They've got all these different things  Why don't they just have one kind of iTunes thing  Or one Spotify-oriented service  And just let everybody buy into that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they actually know what people want  I don't think they actually know what people want  Yeah, so they're trying a bunch of different things  Those projects probably don't even talk to each other

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, what people want is Spotify, essentially  Spotify has, I think, 20 times the audience that Google's music service does  I happen to think that the secret is in YouTube somehow  They need to turn YouTube into not just a place where people have videos  And people use it for the music heavily  But they don't have a way to use the music on YouTube legally  As a music service that just downloads as an audio-only file  That streams and has thumbs up and all that kind of stuff  Like Pandora or something like that  But I think they could do that, they should do that  I think they're just lost in the woods  They've got so much complexity  I think if we went out on the street and asked people about Google's various music offerings  People would just be super confused about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I will say, since I live in Kinnakistan  And we get things three or four years later  We just got Google Play Music relatively recently  And so I signed up and I uploaded everything I have basically to Google's cloud  And then I've been using it on various devices  And I have to say, I really like it  Obviously I don't have access to a bunch of things that other people do  Like Pandora for example  But I think it is actually pretty good  And in particular their music recommendations  Since we were just talking about their ability to recommend things  I actually think they're pretty good  They've clearly gone through my stuff  And they suggest things that are more often than not pretty good to listen to  So I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a great service, it really is  And the quality of the audio seems really good to me  It could be my imagination  Maybe it's just because I like the price that makes it sound better  But I think the audio quality sounds really good  Well, we've got a story here for Jeff  Basically what people have been saying about the Chromebook and slamming it is  You can't do real work on it  Well, now Photoshop is coming to the Chromebook  Yeah, so now if you can do Photoshop on the Chromebook, what can't you do?  Anything?  Well, I mean video editing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we've talked about that before  There are services where you can do video in the cloud  YouTube  Yeah, that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true  So it's like, I don't know  Yeah, I mean  This is more of a symbolic victory, I think, for Chromebook fans than anything else  Because, of course, you can do 100% of what the majority of people do with a laptop on a Chromebook  Jeff, you and I know that  But people will say things like, hey, you can't do real work like Photoshop  And now Photoshop is coming to the Chromebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A caveat here, I think it goes just to those who have a subscription to Adobe's suite

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's still hideously overpriced  I mean, we're talking about Photoshop, but that's part of the Photoshop experience  Is they're going to empty your wallet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Feature zero  Exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did say when I was with the work group  That, you know, I held my Chromebook and I said  That you've got to find that you're still going to find the middle  And I think robust hardware matters  That if people really get involved with Chromebooks and really start to live on the cloud  And you have friends and neighbors who are doing it and can do it  That's going to drive more people to your services  And so the hardware strategy is odd as it seemed, I think, is actually very important

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they need a little bit of sexy, too  I don't know if you agree, but if there was a sort of MacBook Air looking device  And it was a Chromebook  I would be on that, like a fat kid on an M&M  It would be because I love the Chromebook cloud  Everything I use is in the cloud  If I'm not connected to the internet, I'm basically not really doing anything  Except playing solitaire  But if the design was a little bit better, you know, just a little bit  Then I think that would make a big difference for a lot of people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You are so right, in fact  I ended up, I was on the fence after testing Chromebook Pixel for a while  I was on the fence between a MacBook Pro with Retina and a Chromebook Pixel as my sole laptop  And that's exactly what brought me over to the MacBook Pro with Retina  It's just the design is stutter  It's just so good  Yeah, it's so good  And if this thing, and I decided that I was going to use it like a Chromebook  I was going to try to be as cloudy as possible with the MacBook Pro  But I ended up getting sucked into all these other things simply because it's there  And it's kind of how you do it  But yeah, give me a Chromebook that's like a MacBook  Even in the ballpark of having the elegance and the lightness and the usability  Although admittedly the Chromebook Pixel is close, it's so close  It's a high quality device, the screen is beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Pixel is a nice machine  I'm just too married to my, I realize that I'm just really married to my routines and the ways that I do things  And I've invested some time and money into software  Particular bits of software that have certain shortcuts  And so I have two things about the Chromebook  I probably could get it all set up so I could do my development and push to Git and run my tests  And do all the things that I normally do during the day while I'm coding  I probably could, just the thought of letting go of my favorite text editor  And the commands that I use and having to learn a whole other thing  I'm like, ugh, so much time, it would take so much time  In addition, the other point which I brought up in the past in our discussion of the Chromebook  Is like, you know, if someone hacks my Google account or my Google account gets shut down for whatever reason  And I can't get in touch with anybody at Google  And then I can't use my computer, that's just not acceptable  I mean, already it's like, well, if they shut down my Google account, I couldn't use my Android phone, right?  You can't use your Android phone basically unless you're logged in  I was setting up two-factor auth, so I turned it off and turned it back on  And my phone was just like, boop, boop, boop, boop  I got all these notifications that I got logged out of Play Services  And the whole thing was just sort of rendered  And I was like, oh, this is actually everything's connected to my Google account  Which is a free account on Google, a company that we know  It's not like you can call up and be like, hi, can you unlock me?  You know?  You could do that, Gina  I could because I have this amazing platform  But it would be a Twit special, me sort of begging

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it is funny how your first comment about how you get so used to your workflow  Even if it's not in your case, but probably in mine  If it's screwed up in some way or you've kind of hacked together some kludgy kind of way of doing things  You're just so used to it  And so moving to something new, even if it's arguably more efficient or better  It's like moving houses or something or being uprooted and having to move to a different city  And you don't know where the coffee shop is and you don't know how to use the bus  And it may actually turn out to be better, but getting used to it is hard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although it has to be said, and I think, Jeff, also you can verify this  There's a psychology that is causing resistance to living in the cloud with Chromebook  And that psychology is something along the lines of, I know where it is, it's right here  It's right here, it's mine, I control it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At this meeting and I said, they sound stupid to you guys, but you've got to provide backup  And I said, we discussed this for like an hour on Twig  And this will go away, but you need to do it now  You need to provide an API to backup on other virtual services and onto hard drives and such

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely, it's exactly the kind of thing that Google is in a position to provide very easily  They just offered unlimited cloud storage with individual file sizes of no bigger than 5 terabytes  For the education users  They got all the storage in the world and they should absolutely just throw the switch and make that happen  But the point I was going to make was that when you actually use a Chromebook significantly  The psychology reverses  And when you go back to a regular laptop, you're like, this feels really flimsy to have it right here in my possession  I don't know exactly what's happening on the Chromebook  You always have this sort of peace of mind  I'm not going to get a virus  I know exactly where my stuff is, no matter what device I access my stuff is  I know I'm going to get the current version  The peace of mind is actually in favor of the Chromebook when you start using one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually felt that way even though I don't use a Chromebook  I mean, I'm so connected, everything I do is on the web  Even when I'm writing it's WordPress  I'm not using my own server version, but it's not on the device  And I thought I had lost my laptop  I left it somewhere, I thought it's gone, someone's going to have taken it  And you know what? I didn't even care  Because there's nothing on there  And there's certainly nothing on there that isn't backed up somewhere  So at worst someone sees a few of my photos, I don't even care  I could have literally bought a new laptop and instantly had all the same stuff I had before

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What about your naked selfies? You're not concerned about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that stuff I have encrypted

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thing that bothers me, and maybe this bothers me because I know a little too much about how this all works  It's this idea that there's this single point of failure  This idea of like back in college there was a mainframe and there were all these dumb terminals, right?  And like the dumb terminals could come and go and get connected  But if something was wrong with the mainframe you couldn't get to it  And that's kind of what Google is  Whereas I'm a coder so I work with Git, which is a distributed version control system  That means that on every single machine or device where you're interacting with the repository  There is a full synchronized copy  It's distributed and it's federated  And I can push to this server, I can push to that computer, I can push to that server  So there's no one single point of failure that someone other than me is controlling that I'm dependent upon  And so that distributed, federated, completely synchronized peer-to-peer model  Just doesn't exist with commercial web apps because they're not financially incentivized  To do that, there's literally no reason for companies to do this  And this is the conversation we've had about Diaspora and Twitter and interactivity between the social networks  It actually slows down innovation and means lots of arguments about standards and it's all really hard  But like developers who I think in a lot of ways are kind of the canary in the coal mine figured out  That version control systems that involve this singular canonical copy  Where developers check out and then push back into it and there are all these conflicts  And if the server goes down, you're all out of luck  That doesn't work, it's incredibly risky, right?  That doesn't work and that's why in modern software development you use distributed version control systems  In which there's a full copy on every machine where the person is working  And so that's what that single point of failure, the one entity controlled central place where it should be  That makes me uncomfortable

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting, sorry, we're seeing I think that's that sort of I think of that as the BitTorrent model  The peer-to-peer model, we're seeing that sort of bleed into other areas too  Even media, lots of streaming, I think Popcorn Time or whatever it is  A lot of that media is effectively peer-to-peer distributed  It doesn't exist in a specific place, it's being constantly streamed from multiple users

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, exactly  I want to see more of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I want to see that backup feature  I absolutely, it's the perfect idea for the Chromebook  Anyway, Sundar Pichai if you're watching and I know you are Sundar  I know you're watching every minute of the show  Give us the backup, we need it  Well in just a second we're going to come back and do the Google changelog  But first I want to tell you about our third sponsor today which is Prosper  Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending  We talk about the BitTorrent model for content  We also have a BitTorrent model, not really, for money  In 72 hours you could have $35,000 to cover your needs  What would you use it, what would you do with that money?  Would you pay off your credit cards, your high rate credit cards?  Would you start a business, do home improvement projects, rebuild your kitchen?  Find out how easy online application is for Prosper  Provide a few details and see a rate online almost instantly  You can go there immediately and check it out  Personally I see this as an alternative to crowdfunding for some people  Of course crowdfunding sites is a fantastic trend  But it's not for everybody  And the reason is that Kickstarter projects and others are a huge amount of work  Before, during and especially after you reach your Kickstarter goals  And so if you just want to start a business and don't want to fritter away all your time with the fundraising  Prosper is the way to do it without deferring your time and energy on the fundraising itself  Prosper is Silicon Valley's answer to personal loans  And with Prosper's innovative peer-to-peer lending process  There are no outrageous fees, no raising interest rates  And you'll never set foot in a bank  Remember the bank, those guys that created the financial meltdown?  Prosper has more than 2 million members and over a billion dollars in funded loans  For a limited time, Prosper is offering Twit fans a $50 Visa prepaid card when you get a loan  So go to Prosper.com slash Twit  And that's a special rate just for our audience  Up to $35,000 in just 3 days and a $50 Visa prepaid card  Go to Prosper.com slash Twit  Well Gina, are you ready to do the Google changelog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm always ready, let's do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here are the trumpets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Google changelog

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right on, right on  We have some really cool new features coming down the pipe in Chrome  We know because the earliest version of Chrome, Canary  Which is of course the most unstable sort of developer version of Chrome  Often previews these features  And there are two new ones that I'm kind of excited about  One is kind of goofy, one's really useful  You've already seen in Chrome that if you've opened up a tab and it's playing audio  You'll see a little icon on the tab letting you know that the audio is playing  That alone is useful, but in Canary  They've introduced a feature that lets you pause that sound by just clicking on the icon on the tab  So really nice smart stuff there if you've got say an ad or something  Or some sort of music playing in the background  You just click on the tab and you can pause it  Again, that's in the Canary version of Chrome  But we'll see that, that most likely will come down to the stable version in the next

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're not pausing the video or audio or are you just muting it for a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I believe it's muting, so I don't believe it's pausing  I believe it's muting, so it's like shut up  We don't want to hear you right now  That's great  Because that icon shows up even if it's a video or a flash element that's playing audio  So it's muting  The other thing we're seeing in Canary, there's a hidden endless runner game  So you've seen in Chrome when you're offline  It's got that sort of like that 8-bit dinosaur, which I love  Well in the Canary build, the little dinosaur still shows up  Can't connect to the internet when you're offline  But I think if you tap the space bar  You can start running that dinosaur through the desert jumping over cactus  And it gives you all something to do while you can't get on the internet  I love this kind of thing  This kind of thing is like a classic Easter egg  Excel had one of these games where you sort of fly around  There was a Tetris game  Anyway, so this is kind of fun  You'll have something to do with the dinosaur when you can't get online in the new version of Chrome  That's in Canary right now  We already talked about Photoshop on your Chromebook  That is pretty cool  Just to clarify, I was like how is Photoshop running on your Chromebook?  It's actually like it's streaming Photoshop  So Adobe is going to be running Photoshop on a server somewhere in the cloud  You install this app for your Chromebook  Which gives you like tunnels you into the remote server  And connects to your Google Drive  So you're streaming Photoshop over the web versus running a local Photoshop app  So people are beta testing this now  Not clear how fast it is  Particularly with giant images  I would love to try this out  But they're testing it now  And I assume that people who have emptied their wallet will get this eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Imagine if that works, what else you could do that with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it is  You've got to need a big fat pipe  Sure, I mean I guess if communication between Adobe servers and Google servers  Although it's fast enough, then the saves to Google Drive should work, right?  I mean if you're basically just tunneling, it's like remote controlling a computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The original upload of a material to the cloud is the cost  But once it's there, you're working on faster processors

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has to save to the NSA servers first, but that shouldn't happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have very fast servers

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they've got a shortcut straight to the NSA servers as well  New in Gmail, you can now view images within your message full screen  So this is similar to how regular non-image attachments work  Now this works with images  You can click on large images within a message  You see them full screen in Gmail on the web  You can click on the Google Drive button to save the image directly to Drive  Or the arrow button to download them to your computer  So subtle, but nice change for those of us who email images around  And finally, thank you for this, I believe this was Jeff  Google's beefing up their mobile ad offerings  So Google's introducing new mobile display formats  And tools that will roll out over the coming months  So advertisers have these new mobile lightbox ads, engagement ads  How many more buzzwords can I say?  They dynamically resize to fit any size across devices  This is part of Google's multi-screen size, multi-device world  That we heard a lot about at Google I.O.  So you have existing ads that fold and unfold and collapse and expand  Depending on the device you're looking at  And these new formats  So Google's trying their best to crack the mobile advertising nut  And I'm sure they'll do pretty well  So advertisers will pay when users engage with the ads to expand them  And the ad type will be available soon in the AdWords ad gallery  For Google Display Network campaigns  That's all I got

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fantastic  End check  And we have our tool tip and number of the week  Why don't we start with you, Gina, since you're in the mode of talking right now  What do you got in terms of our tip of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A little something from Reddit  And Chad, this actually might have been from you  I did not know this, but Google Drive has got this really neat thing  So if you need to insert a special character in Google Drive  So like you say when you're in a Google Doc  And you go to the insert menu, special characters  You can actually draw the character that you're looking for  I never remember the names of these characters  Yeah, you can draw it  And it will search for the character that looks like what you just drew  What a world  This is pretty crazy  And you know I tried a couple of things  And sometimes it was more accurate than others  But really neat if you're like, yeah, I'm looking for the little doofy doofy  The necklace that Prince used to wear

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to use that as part of my signature

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the euro sign and the pound sign  The shruggy all the time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A shruggy  They should have those

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fantastic  Alright, Jeff, your number of the week

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright, so speaking of Sundar  He says that Drive now has 240 million active users  Up from 190 million since June  This is the one that really interests me  Chromebooks, speaking of Chromebooks  Are approaching 50% share of the EDU market  Up from 5% only 18 months ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so happy to hear that  It's such a perfect education device  That is fantastic news  My son, by the way, he works for a company called Tinker  And they do education  They teach children how to do software programming  Using a drag and drop  It's like Legos for software  And he said that they just take to the Chromebook  It's a perfect solution  He goes and he does actual training with kids  And it's perfect because they can just log in  They can do their projects  And they love it  And it just works fantastic  So that's great to hear  Any other numbers, Jeff?  No, I have one quick question for Gina

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you believe the reports about the Chamu Nexus 6 Moto XYZ?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Moto Nex

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do, I do  I think that it makes sense that they're going to come out with a new device when they release L  It sounds like it's going to be big  5.9 inches  Which is bigger than the OnePlus One  Which is pretty big to begin with  This is 5'5

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is 5'5

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's going to be a big phone, according to rumors  But yeah, it's basically going to be what rumors are saying  A Moto X-like device  Motorola is going to manufacture it from facing speakers  Pretty excited about that  Coming, obviously, with L  Yeah, I think that it sounds credible to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Timing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, yeah  I forget now what the rumors were about timing  But I imagine it's got to happen before the holiday season, right?  I mean, that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got to be imminent

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got to be imminent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's a picture circulating now that looks pretty credible  We had a big discussion of it today after Tech News Today  And it looks pretty real  Now, Matthew, do you have anything you want to throw into this?  A tool tip, number, anything like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it have to be Google related?  No  Okay, so this is something interesting  I literally just came across before the show  Clay Shirky, who some of you may have heard of  Media guru  Happened to be in Hong Kong  And wrote something about the Occupy Hong Kong protests  Which is fascinating  And I definitely think you should read it  Just a sort of one man wandering around taking photos  But he published it on GitHub  That's fascinating  Yeah, his blog, if you've ever been there  Looks exactly the same as when WordPress first launched  45 years ago  And so maybe he's given up and gone to GitHub  But I find it interesting because he's clearly experimenting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is GitHub not blocked in China and maybe WordPress is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I don't know, that's a good question  I was speculating  I just find the GitHub model for text for sort of writing a fascinating idea  And so I'm interested to see him experimenting  I went to look at his article  And I think it had only been up for an hour  There were already three poll requests  And they were effectively typos that someone had noticed  And suggested a correction  I think that's a fascinating sort of exercise in distributed writing  Sort of peer to peer editing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've asked folks before how GitHub could be used journalistically  And I'd love to see this be a really interesting experiment in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I'd like to see as it goes on  It's about a controversial topic  There's got to be lots of people interested  I think it could become a kind of  If people could add to it  And effectively take it and change it  And stretch it or add new things to it the way you do when it's software  I just find it fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is fascinating  And by the way, Tommy Flowers in the chat room corrected me  And said that the plural of Lego is not Legos  It's Lego  And so if Facebook can apologize to the drag queens  I can apologize to the plastic yellow people  I'm very sorry about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like Moose  It's singular and plural

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never heard that before  Apparently it's true  It has to be true, it's in the chat room  Okay, so my toy of the week is PathTalk  Now PathTalk is a messaging app that nobody uses  And it's a pretty ordinary messaging app  And there's no reason to use it  Except for the reason that they gave us this week  And that reason is that they now have a new tab called Places  You go to the Places tab and you select a business of any kind  And then you ask them any question  Or ask to make a reservation or something like that  They say, we'll get back to you in a few minutes  And then they come back with an answer or whatever it is  And the way this works is this is a human powered concierge service  They call the business  They get the answer and then they chat you back as if they're the business  So here's an example  I sent a text on this to the North Coast Brewing Company  Their tap room  I said, do you have Ligonetus Maximus on tap?  A couple minutes later they got back to me and said  Hello, sorry we do not have Ligonetus Maximus  In case you'd like to try out our drinks  We're going to be open until 9pm today  Have a great day  So that's a human being?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is a human being

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so this is especially great if a business is going to have a long hold time  Or they're going to give you the run around  And you have something in stock  They have to go check and all that kind of stuff  They do all that stuff  And then they come back to you with the answer  Obviously this is a money losing proposition for PATH  But for those of us who don't want to waste time  It's really fantastic

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's called PATH Talk  It's a human powered concierge service  They also actually use a little bit of intelligence  For example, if you call to make a reservation  And you say, you know, can you make a reservation at so and so restaurant at 7 o'clock?  And there's no availability  They'll make the reservation for 7.30  And go back to you and say, how about 7.30?  I've made the reservation for 7.30 if you want it  And if you say, no, I don't want that  Then they'll go and cancel it or whatever  But they actually have, you know, the real people who are making real decisions  And there's a human touch to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Mike, are those human beings that PATH employs?  So they are PATH employees who call the restaurant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My guess is that this is offshored and outsourced  That's just my guess  Because otherwise they'd be nuts to just have people, you know  Sitting in New York City paying New York City rent and paying New York City whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They effectively pay them to do this?  I believe so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is an acquisition by PATH  I don't recall the name of the company offhand  But they acquired a company that did this  And apparently they're using it as a reason for you to go use their messaging service  I don't know how long it'll last  They also have, in addition to using what is actually the four square database of companies  They're also augmenting it with their own  And an interesting experiment that I had was I asked for the business hours  And instantly I got back the posted business hours for that business  And said, oh, their posted hours are XYZ  They still contacted them to verify that today's closing time was XYZ  And they got back to me with that information as well  So they have some automation  They have a database that's four squares  And they also have their own database of information  Really fantastic  So far in my experimentation it's been kind of thrilling to use  Because usually information like this is cumbersome to get  And they do it all  So it's just a great thing and it's free

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we know that humans don't scale  That's right, they don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Use it while it's still around, kids  Yeah, use it while it's still around  Exactly, that's exactly right  Well, do you guys want to talk about anything else or should we close up the show?  What do you think?  Any other topics?  I think we're good  This is a great show  I think we're good  Good show  I love this show  So great to be able to talk back  I listen and watch this show every single week  And it's just so great to chime in  It's like I sit there and I talk to myself in the kitchen  When I'm doing the dishes and listening to the show
