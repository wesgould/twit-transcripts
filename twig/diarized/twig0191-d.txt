Let me introduce our panel.  Gina Trapani is here from SmarterWear.org.  That's where she blogs, founding editor at Life Hacker,  a hacker and author of Think Up, the great Twitter app.  Nice to see you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One more thing on your CV, host of All About Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All About Android. Oh, yeah.  Have lots of fun.  And on the Twit Network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We also want to welcome Jeff Jarvis, who's here from his office at the City University of New York,  where he teaches journalism. He's the author of Public Parts,  and What Would Google Do?, and blogs at BuzzMachine.com, and is currently offline.  Guess those Bash Shell commands didn't quite do the job.  Oh, poor Jeff.  Let me also introduce on the far right here, Andreas Ekström.  Andreas is a Swedish journalist.  He writes for, let me see if I can get it right, Andre, Södsvenskan,  which is a weekly newspaper out of Malmo, Sweden.  Good to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very impressive. Thank you for having me on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm practicing.  Swedes invariably speak much better English than Americans speak Swedish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is true, but we're a small language of only about 10 million speakers,  so it kind of makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and it's language that's the topic.  And the reason we're having you on, I know the French have the Académie Francaise,  which kind of tries to keep vulgar English words out of their language.  But I didn't know that Sweden has something similar as well.  There's a language board?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it's a government, actually, it's a government agency.  And what they do is that they have their job to monitor, develop,  and maintain the Swedish language.  As I said, it's only about 10 million people that speak it,  and we're under constant influence and constant change from English  and other languages.  So what they do is they try to monitor what's going on with the language,  how is it developing, what new words do we need,  do we need to invent something to not have to borrow an English word.  And that has actually been the topic and what we're going to talk about today.  There's been a good reconnection there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is it commonplace in Sweden to say, Google me or let me Google that,  that kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, for sure.  I think Sweden is one of the most Google-y friendly nations on the planet.  Last time I checked the stats, Google had a market share of 96% on search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's more than in the U.S., where it's more like 80%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, way more than most countries.  I think maybe Spain and Germany can be up there and compete.  It's actually about 65% in the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  65, is that all, Jeff?  Holy cow.  It's that low here.  It's 80-something in the U.K.  It's 90-something in Germany.  But I've never heard anything that's that high.  Yeah, it's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, I guess the last few, I guess they just being around  and then that's about it, I guess.  We don't really use anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's interesting is that the Language Council of Sweden,  did they add, let me Google that to the language?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what happened was that every year they put out a list.  So these are the new words that we have found that we encourage you to use.  And that's always big news every year.  So these are the new words.  And one of the words that they put out was un-Googleable.  So a word for something that you just can't find through Googling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would think they'd add the word Google before they add the word un-Googleable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in the official Swedish Academy encyclopedia,  the word to Google as a verb has been there for a while.  Oh, it has.  Yeah, it has.  And it's in German.  And Google.  It's in Japanese as well as Google.  It's in several languages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Google didn't complain about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I guess not.  But now they did complain.  So they had this, it's been big news in Sweden this week.  So what happened was that some people working at the legal department of Google  decided that this was not cool.  So they started, they actually started correspondence with the Swedish authority  and they started to get more and more people to take the word Google.  And so they started to make more and more calls to Google,  and they started to get more and more people to take the word Google.  And so that's what happened.  So I think it's important to think about the word Google.  I think there's a lot of language here saying that,  okay, so you want to put the word un-Googleable in the language?  Okay, that's fine.  But we would like you to define it not as impossible to find on the internet,  but it's not a word that's gone from being a brand and now it's just a regular word in the language.  So Google, I guess, wants to avoid that development by kind of protecting this.  And the interesting thing is that the Swedish language council, they folded.  The lawyers got them tired, I guess.  They kept on writing long letters to them.  And just finally the other day they said, you know what?  Screw it.  We're going to give up.  We're just going to take it off the list so we can keep on working with other things.  And of course that whole thing exploded.  That's an irresistible media piece here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they didn't say, we'll modify the definition to be something you cannot Google.  They just said, we're going to kill the word entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're just going to kill the word.  So nothing is anymore.  You can't say un-Googleable, I guess, in Swedish anymore.  But then of course on Twitter and everywhere people are saying,  yeah, I'm going to make a point of saying it every day now just because Google doesn't own the Swedish language.  It creates great opposition.  But also I say generally people are in a pretty good mood about it.  But it's interesting because, I mean, to what extent can you say that a big international company can control a national language?  We know with some letter writing in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The issue is it is a trademark issue.  I don't know if this is true in European law, but it's true in American law.  If Google did not defend the trademark, then it will go the way of...  This is why every time that I've used Xerox as a verb, I've gotten a...  You get a letter?  I would get a letter from Xerox attorneys saying, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They can't stop me from doing it.  But if they didn't defend it, they would then have enough cases on...  They would lose the trademark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're going to lose it anyway. That's the point.  I mean, Kleenex, Zipper, Escalator, Linolium, these are all trademarks that became common words.  How do you stop it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Xerox is still Xerox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You still say I'm going to the Xerox machine even if it's a Canon.  Yeah, sure.  When you Xerox your butt, you don't say, I'm going to photocopy my butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had no idea that Escalator was a brand name.  I thought that that was the word.  That's what happens. Aspirin.  You know, I'm surprised that they didn't...  Well, first, I mean, on one hand, it's like, yeah, it's annoying that Google, the company, could change the Swedish language.  But at the same time, I think it's surprising to me that the Swedish government thinks that they can dictate what language is.  I mean, language is what people say, right?  Not what a document reads.  So what they do is they don't create the word, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They look around for it to see, has there been a new word used?  So they look for the new trends and then just make sure that they pick it up and say, so we've noticed that people are starting to say this.  So they don't really make up new things, but they pick them up.  But that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would not allow such a word to besmirch the language.  They block words.  They force people to use some utterly made-up word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the whole notion of a government commission that determines the language is so anathema to the United States that we don't even really quite understand.  You've got what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we have 20 government officials that just work to protect the language.  And I am a big fan.  I love what they do.  I love what they do.  And I also think they were kind of smart media players here by folding, because obviously by folding, they get 10 times the attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  It's up for Google, too.  Google tried.  They fought.  They won.  And the word's still there.  Andres, to me a favor, say it in full Swedish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, let's hear the Swedish word, because it's not un-Googleable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it would be o-Google-bar.  Oh, I love it.  I'm going to use that for now on.  That's pretty awesome.  And the thing is, I don't really like it.  And this is only for the other five people in Sweden who always listen to Twig.  But for you guys, I would prefer it to be o-Google-lings-bar.  It's a small difference, but it would just make more sense with the Swedish language.  So that's a bonus information for my few Swedish friends who always listen into it.  What's the difference?  Well, it's just a...  More grammatical?  Yeah, it's just a grammatical thing, the way it makes more sense to incorporate in the language itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Help me learn this, because you taught me Sudsvenskan.  Sudsvenskan, that's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me hear it again.  This word would be o-Google-bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  O-Google-bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very good. You're a natural.  O-Google-bar.  Let me try a theory with you guys on why Google picks this fight.  Let me see what you think about this.  I think that recently Google has put a lot of PR efforts in making us talk about certain things,  like we're all excited about self-driving cars, we're all excited about Google Glass.  That has a somewhat red herring quality.  Now everybody's talking about a small Google detail,  which means that we're not talking about those big issues of the usual big issues,  like too much big data, privacy, and all these things that really could possibly throw Google into some real trouble.  Do you think that's a part of a strategy of making us talk about small things rather than big things?  Jeff would be the expert on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so. Absolutely.  I think that Google wants to be talked about in certain ways.  We'll talk about it later, but the Google Glass thing, they're allowing 8,000 people to buy it.  There's a huge deal being made about this, and so well, they've got 8,000 customers.  That's all they've got.  All of them tripping over each other to buy the product.  I think they're brilliant at that.  And it's, yeah, we're just being used, and fanboys like me are out there tweeting away, and yeah, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That seems a little, I don't know, paranoid.  I don't think they're actively cultivating this, what do magicians call it?  What do they call it, Chad, when you say, look over here, misdirection.  They're not actively cultivating this misdirection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but they like to be talked about, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and truthfully, they probably love it that people say, let me Google that, or can I Google you?  But they can't just let it be. They have to at least show that they've, and I keep seeing the articles say, pressure from Google and stuff.  I don't think it was pressure.  I'm sure that the Google attorneys just did what they're supposed to do according to US trademark law to try to preserve this trademark.  The issue is not whether people say it's Googleable or Google bar, but more that if some company came along and called itself Google Search,  that they'd have a defense in court saying, no, no, this is our trademark, and we have at every turn defended it.  I think that's what it's all about. It's not. I think they like people saying Google bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the lawyers have to do this.  I certainly like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They really could lose the trademark.  I like saying Google bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that when I glanced at the story, I thought the story was going to be that Google didn't want the concept that something could not be found by Google to exist at all.  They're saying that they don't want Swedes to conflate not being able to find something on the Internet with not being able to find something with Google.  That's different.  It's quite the opposite, in fact. It's almost admitting, yeah, some stuff's not findable on Google.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the opposite of their mission, right? Their mission is to make everything findable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's not the opposite of their legal obligation, which is to preserve the trademark.  So they wanted to always refer to Google, not to some generic Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, because if you conflate Google in the Internet, then you get to sticky a bad place, right?  Then, yeah, then you're in a dangerous spot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unbingable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're trying to make up words. Let's just say like unyahooable, unbingable, un-duck-duck-go-able.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unyahooable. That just sounds Swedish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unyahooable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and so I'm sure that there, you know, if you ask Larry Page, he's probably saying, we love it that the Swedes say something's ungoogleable or go Google it or that people in the US say it.  But we just want to stop it because we have to defend our trademark and it's just a legal obligation.  And so saying they pressured them is really, I think that that's overstating it. They probably just did what they need to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they were pretty persistent, though. I've actually accessed the correspondence. It's been published.  And they were pretty, I mean, they were polite, but they were persistent.  They're lawyers.  Yeah, they're lawyers. The Swedish council is just like, you know, screw it. We have other words to worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that they just wore them down. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, totally. And I kind of think, as I said before, it's, I mean, it's a pretty smart, you know, the head official at the Swedish language council to fold because that makes people like myself really excited or upset and gets us talking about it.  And I think so we have the biggest language debate of the year in Sweden. So I guess they're just really happy up there.  It also says the Swedes have better things to do.  All right. Yeah, I guess. No, there should be a couple of things that maybe we should put some more focus on.  But as I said, I'm pretty excited that we have some people who stand up for such a small language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andreas Ekström is also the author of a book about Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The one and only in Swedish. I had to write one. You know, it's translated. It's well translated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google, did Google complain about, here's the cover chat on my computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, actually, that's the cover. I asked the PR people at Google if we could have a little fun with the logo as we made the cover.  And they said, fine, go right ahead. So they were very, very cooperative and generous with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, Jeff, you have a competitor in Sweden. I know I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Andreas, thank you. Jeff and I spoke at one point when he was coming to Sweden to lecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we met before. Yeah. Well, it's so great to meet you, Andreas. And I thank you for joining us.  I love your show. My pleasure. Say it again.  U-Google-bar. I love it. Ike Music.  He writes for the weekly Sudsvenskan in Malmo, Sweden.  And his book is called what? Google Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google Code, which translates cleverly to the Google Code. The Google Code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Andreas. Great to talk to you. Thanks, Andreas. I love that.  I've forgotten how to say it immediately, though. We need a reggae chat room.  U-Google-bar.  Swedish is such a melodious language. I would want to preserve it, too. And French.  But it's one of the things that's kind of interesting about English as a language, and American English in particular, is that we embrace these neologisms like crazy.  And there's no government agency says you can't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, we started out by changing the British English, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. U-Google-bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good. You're good. Google-bar.  I'm not even trying. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Jeff, still there? Wow. Look at this quality of the image, too. It's spectacular, Jeff. You look great.  Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. Oh. And this is on the Pixel.  This is on the Pixel, yep. We had to do a little manipulation before the show.  This is the command line. We did. We actually, we made Jeff apt-get nano so that he could edit an XML file, a configuration file on Skype.  But he did it, and it worked. And it was only because Gina and I could not translate from our fingers to our tongues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We couldn't figure out the VI command. We had slash and then we had escape, colon, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when you do it in VI, it's so fast, you just go blub blub blub. Yep.  And so I'll go in like slash and then yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google-bar. Google-bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a break when we come back. There's lots of Google news to talk about.  We brought Gina Turpani, Jeff Jarvis, Lea Laporte this week in Google, brought to you today by Hulu Plus, brand new sponsor on the show.  Either of you ever watch TV on Hulu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brown Coats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brown Coats. HuluPlus.com slash twit. We thank them so much for their support of the twit network.  Make sure you sign up and watch today free for two weeks.  Somebody asked, does this offer outside the U.S.? I don't, doesn't say, but I would guess not. But try it and let us know.  Try it and let us know.  You know, it's funny because what we do, internet broadcasting like this is totally global, as you can see.  But advertising, this is a whole new area for advertising. They've never thought in terms of global.  At best, it was national.  And agency, you know, an agency makes an ad buy, they make an ad buy for the country they're in.  We have been training our sponsors though. More and more, they're aware of the global audience, which is great.  Good. Yeah.  I have been reading articles about the Yahoo acquisition of Summly. Have you been following this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's interesting? All I've heard is 30 million dollars, 15 year old.  That's all you hear. That's all you hear. 30 million dollars, 15 year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, he's now what 19, right? But he started as the age of 15.  And Marissa Meyer, blah, blah, blah. And that becomes a story.  And in fact, Marco, you got to read Marco's blog post about it because he has some funny things to say about the whole thing.  Apparently, this guy, this kid has been bothering people since he came out with it.  He writes, what's actually wrong with Yahoo's purchase of Summly?  He's 17. You're right. He's 17. I'm sorry, Gina. The company is a year and a half old.  Yahoo paid, we think, nobody knows for sure because Yahoo is not saying, 30 million dollars for it.  A lot of geeks, writes Marco, have been yelling today about the Summly acquisition.  It's actually a textbook acquire. A startup that appeared to be missing its growth targets was acquired for a fairly modest price.  And it was at least shut down by a big tech company in need of talent.  But what's interesting is apparently the whole point of Summly was it would take some text and boil it down into a few lines.  And he says, Marco says, I only know that because I tried it while I was being barraged by Delaloccio with manipulative fake urgent emails in late 2011.  He said, the summaries weren't good enough for me to try more than a few times.  But the press never talks about the actual product in their articles about Nick.  They talk about his age and how much he made. Apparently...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But he also got Stephen Fry to make a commercial with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and he got investments money from big VCs. I think that was probably more of it.  But according to at least one blog, the company didn't do any natural language processing of its own.  And it licensed the technology from another company.  And you got to read the emails. Marco doesn't repeat his emails, but he points to a Gizmodo article that's titled, Oops, How I Made a 15 Year Old App Developer Cry.  In which the author, who is Casey Chan, Casey does app reviews for Gizmodo, quotes emails from this kid that are the most annoying emails I've ever seen.  At one point saying, aren't you going to... you got to write a review, Duck. If you don't write a review, I'm going to be out of work.  I mean, it's just, you got to read these emails.  Now he's 15 or 16. So, you know, of course he's a kid.  But I have to wonder if a lot of this acquisition is really not about the PR that Yahoo is going to get.  Because it's not going to get technology and it's not going to get an accomplished programmer.  In fact, it sounds like it's going to get a pretty annoying kid.  And what the point Marco is making is that the press doesn't care. The press covers the great... which is a story we all want to write.  17 year old makes 30 million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tech millionaire, 17. Did we mention how old he is? He started reading at 15. Do you believe it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it amazing? I love the internet. You can do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm tired of the one with white stars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When she's next ready to buy, I forget the name of the video company for 200 million said reports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, see, this is the question others are asking too. Is it now clear that Marissa Meyer is not going to be a content company?  That Marissa Meyer's Yahoo, I should say, is not going to be a content company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's one argument going on now is that she's going to buy platforms and try to get us to create all the content for her, which is not unlike her last company.  It would make perfect sense. They spend a fortune on content creation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except that, yeah, all of the money Yahoo makes today is as a content creator.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's an advertising company. And the question is, it can put that advertising on almost anything, including our stock.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, wonderful blog post from Marco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a really good post. And I like how he said that David Karp, who was his co-founder at Tumblr, didn't made a point of not telling anyone he was 19 when he started Tumblr because he did not want that to be the story.  He knew that that would be the story if he if he if he talked about it.  We saw this with Aaron Schwartz, right? Everyone talked about when he was age. Yeah. Yeah. It was a big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Marco said he didn't even know he was working for Karp for a year before he found out he was 19.  I love that.  Yeah, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody saying, oh, come on, a few days publicity for 30 million dollars. It doesn't add up.  They're going to get a lot more than 30 days publicity.  A few days publicity. And remember what it tells you is Yahoo is a go go tech company with money to spend to get the latest tech.  I mean, I don't know.  Or it could have just been a look.  There's two choices. It was it was either dumb or it was a brilliant maybe a dumb PR move.  Maybe it was both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's also another company. I don't want to say who it is.  It does. And I saw at Davos that does something similar and does in fact a lot of technology.  And it had a similar offer out on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say that Apple invented this 15 years ago.  It was called. Was it called Casper? What was it called?  In fact, I remember the demos of them running a slider on an article and you slide it to make the article longer or shorter to some lot summarize it.  Remember that? Yeah.  That was years ago.  It was grandpa. Yeah.  Grandpa, I remember this.  And and not only did they invent this technology and they put it in OS 10.  Nobody wanted it. You used it. And it's it's it's gone.  Oh, it's still on the Mac.  It's still available as a service.  I don't have a Mac in front of me. Yeah.  And the services menu.  Summarize.  In any event, this is nothing new.  And according to Marco, the summaries that Sumley made were worthless anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's also a copyright question with this is that if you take my article and alter it to that extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I have two apps that I really am interested in on the iPhone.  Circa is one. These are news apps.  And the other is some guy and I wish I remember his name.  Dave, I think, is his name who summarizes both these summarize articles.  They do link to the full article.  And that's what Sumley says. Look, it just all we're doing is generating traffic for you.  You see the summary. If you're interested, you go to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Circa has a staff that's rewriting the facts into its format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. That's it. But now and their claim would be the same.  Yes, but we're writing it in such a way that you're going to want to read the original. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, Circa's point is not to send links out.  Circa's point is to deconstruct the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And short little paragraphs.  Well, are they in trouble? People mad at them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because they're not rewriting anybody except they're taking knowledge.  But information can't be copyrighted.  The fact that the Pope quit is just a fact the Pope quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you don't do it algorithmically, but you use human beings, it's OK.  If you don't do it algorithmically and you use human beings, it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Circa doesn't summarize a single article.  Right. It's like it's just an event, a news event. Right.  I mean, they're basically writing their own news items.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's frankly like my favorite news magazine, The Week, which does it just has little clips from a lot of news sources.  This is what they were saying about that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the Evening Edition is similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Jeff.  The AP has tried to argue for what they call hot news, which is to say that if this happened and we know it and you don't, we should have some right to that for a while.  And it actually goes back to the turn of the last century when The Telegraph came in and some would have an advantage of ours.  I'm just back from India where I was last week and I found out that there was one publisher there that's managed to,  I think it's India, get the hot news doctrine accepted around cricket scores.  Maybe Australia, where if we know it and you don't have anybody there, you shouldn't just take our scores.  Well, the problem with that is that it's just information.  You know, so-and-so won, so-and-so lost.  How can you own that knowledge for a period of time?  But that's the next fight point in the courts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Circa does no reporting of its own, right?  We're just summarizing other people's articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's have staff around the world write the stuff.  And, you know, I've done, I do the spiel about how we have to disaggregate the article into different assets and paths.  They call it points and bridges.  So the background paragraph in an article today is ill serves everyone, right?  If you know what the article is, it's a waste of your space.  If you don't know what the article is, it's not enough.  What should the background paragraph be?  It should be a link to Wikipedia.  Right.  What should the lead be?  Maybe it's a link to a Twitter feed.  Oh, how interesting.  Players and timelines and background and explainers and all kinds of things, right?  These are different assets and different paths through them.  So I've been writing about that for a couple of years.  And David Cohn, who's at Circa, says that's kind of where they're headed.  What they've done now on an iPhone app is just take the article into different hunks.  And a few things happen that are interesting.  One is that if you've already, if you're following the story and you've already seen this part of the story,  it won't show it to you again.  It'll just give you what's new to you.  Two is it changes the structure of the database.  So if there's a quote, it's not part of that narrative.  It's a quote that's off of the database.  And four different stories can hold the same point.  So it becomes kind of object oriented journalism.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very interesting. Yeah.  Um.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got me at object oriented journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that concept, right?  Yeah.  But there's still some writing involved and some thought involved, isn't it?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is cir.ca.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a web interface? I didn't know. I was just using it on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, that's just the site that lets you get the idea.  Oh, it goes to it, yeah.  It's easy what it is.  Is this Ben Haas thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember when Ben was kind of brainstorming this.  He did it at a food camp.  How can we make news better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is what he ended up coming up with.  I actually like it a lot.  The only thing wrong with it is that it doesn't...  It's like real news.  I just want to read technology news. I don't care about anything else.  If there were a technology version of cir.ca.  There's a technology section, but I don't care about politics and the rest of that stuff.  Although I did, you'll be glad to know, change my Twitter icon to an equal sign.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good for you, Lea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook. Did you, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't. I'm laying low. I'm trying not to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So do you think it's... Oh, you're laying low for other reasons. We won't talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. I just mean I'm watching the Supreme Court thing going on.  I'm just trying not to get too hopeful.  I'm just chilling out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're too invested in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm almost too close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm curious because somebody... I did it on Google+, Twitter, and Facebook.  And somebody said, oh, another shallow little pseudo political involvement move.  Everybody just changes their icon and that's all.  But I think there's some power if you see a bunch of changed icons on the social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes me feel really good. It means something. It's meaningful to me.  I think it's meaningful. It's meaningful to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's meaningful to anybody who sees it and says, wow, there are a lot of people who believe in marriage equality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. Absolutely. I probably should change... I should change my icon.  I've been trying to not be too anxious or too close to it.  I'm trying not to think about it too much in the hopes that we're going to get a good... the decision that I want to see happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was shouting at the radio yesterday as there was... I guess it was Alito who said, well, this is newer than a cell phone. It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh. But as everybody said, you can't judge the tenor of the court on their questions and oral arguments because they ask weird questions, especially Alito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We'll find out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, Google. You can keep it to yourself.  You weren't here, Jeff, last week. By the way, was India fun? Did you have a good time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  India was great. I mean, you know, I was there three days. I'm an expert. I saw all of India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't understand how you could do that. The flight's longer than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely absurd. But I quite liked it. I was charmed by the people in the place, amazed by the media scene there.  I went to the Guardian Activate slash Google Big Tent event in New Delhi.  So I got to meet a bunch of Google people here at Schmidt, which we'll talk about a little later. And so it was a lot of fun. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neat. Well, we missed you. But one of the things that happened during the show was Google launched Google Keep.  And so Gina and I, we were all playing with it.  We were all like, oh, messing with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were keeping. We were taking it down.  It was because of you that I was able to get it on my screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. You got the widget. Yeah. On your Nexus 4. It's the lock screen widget.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So O'Malley, I thought, had a very interesting comment. He says, Sorry, Google. You can keep it to yourself.  Fool me once. Shame on you. Fool me twice. Shame on me.  He says, I'm not switching to keep from Evernote. And I'll tell you why. Two words. Google Reader.  And I thought this when Google killed Google Reader that maybe there was going to be that there might have been a strategic mistake.  Because are you going to trust Google not to kill the thing you like?  And if you don't, then are you going to try new Google products? Buzz. Same thing.  I put a lot. I invested a lot in the buzz and it made me hold back just a little bit on Google Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that was my first reaction when they killed Reader is what are we going to worry about next?  There's a story I put up on the rundown that speculates on other things that Google kill on.  It's a ridiculous list. It includes apps. Just arguing doesn't make enough money.  I don't believe that for a second. But yeah, you're going to wonder about anything.  You know, could they kill voice? Could they kill anything?  And that's an issue. I mean, I'm now completely invested.  When I wrote my review of living the Google life, which is on my blog, I second paragraph became this is now a cautionary tale because of what they did with Reader.  Here I am completely invested in. I'm living the Google Ville. Not Vida Google. I'm in it. Right?  Right. If they kill something, I'm going to invest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And part of the problem is we don't understand what makes Google kill or not kill a product.  It felt like Google Reader was used by a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it wasn't that many people. It was shrinking.  But I heard the best explanation I've heard so far. There was an argument made in Forbes that there was a privacy issue.  I thought that was interesting.  Somebody who knows is what was said is friction.  That when you've got to make every new update to the rest of Google, you've got to keep that up to date.  It's not so much that there was spending a lot of money on it, but it was a pain to have to bring it along.  And, you know, nobody's using it as shrink and let's just say now the bad conspiracy theory is they want to kill RSS and go publishers.  I don't buy that. I think it was just as a small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did an interesting thing. I mean, they essentially killed all these small RSS readers by doing Google Reader and then they killed Google Reader.  Whether that was intentional or not, it did have a kind of detrimental effect on RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It did. Well, it'll be interesting to see what comes out now that it's going away.  But yeah, because it became the back end for so many desktop readers, right?  And because it was such a good web based product.  Here's the thing, though. I mean, you know, in all respect to all and I see his point here, but he's saying almost saying Evernote is great at this.  This is what they do. They've been doing this for years.  I'm not going to switch to keep. I'm going to stay with Evernote because I know that they're not going away.  But the reality is, is that any of these companies can go away, right?  If Evernote doesn't have enough users, it could go away just the way Google Reader could go away because it doesn't have enough readers.  The key to the thing to focus on is take out. Can you export your data?  If something does happen to this product, if this company goes under, if it gets acquired by someone you don't like, if, you know, I don't know, if you get locked out of your account, can you take out your data?  And is it useful in the format you can export it in? And can you import it into something else or use it and what you have?  I think that that's really the big that's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google has it. So does Evernote.  On the other hand, you could also say, but because Evernote has this one business, it's very unless the business itself folds, it's very unlikely to use to say, well, we're going to kill that.  Little thing. It's not right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is I mean, I do agree with Oman that everyone has been doing thinking about this and doing this work and making this product for way more years than Google.  They put, you know, they've made a lot of I never know it's a great product.  And honestly, I think keep is interesting to me. Keep sound.  Keep looks to me like this is just Google showing off their drive API and showing developers.  This is one kind of small thing that you can do with the drive API.  I think that's cool, but it's not enough to make me switch from Evernote because I'm a big Evernote user and I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I like there is a speed bump for me, which is that they killed Reader.  And so I'm not going to no matter how easy it is to get my data out, I'm not going to I'm going to be careful about investing too much in any Google product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's what you see, Dave Weiner's new product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that was kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know what to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm forgetting. I should know. I am, too.  It's the world's simplest thing.  He's just using the HTML5 capability to store locally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called it's called Little Outliner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Dave, I wasn't it's a small picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it. That's it.  No, Little Outliner, Little Outliner.  It's a little outliner, little little outliner dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Dave Weiner, please, you can't get it from elsewhere.  But he's working on that.  And it is even simpler than keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's the king of outlining.  He invented more, which was the outliner on the Macintosh and was one of the I think the first in the category.  And that's where he made his money.  And he invented RSS, too.  And Little Outliner is a HTML5 outliner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And stores in OPML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of interesting.  And it stores it on your computer or where does it store it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On your computer locally.  Locally.  And does it work with the pixel?  You open the address.  It's just there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It should work with a pixel, right?  He says it takes advantage of a little known HTML5 feature that allows you to store data locally.  Maybe not little known, maybe little used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is nice.  This is cool.  Isn't it cool?  Little Outliner dot com.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's just that one page.  You just go back to it and everything you typed is there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Isn't that neat?  So I'll do a little outline here.  He's using Bootstrap for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, he is.  Yeah.  Is that the Twitter JavaScript?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Twitter framework, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm just typing into this.  And so if I close this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be storing as you go.  And you close it, it'll be back there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  And I can put in links.  So we'll put a link.  There's a tallock.  There's links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what gave it away.  You can see the blue button on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, you know, you understand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just use Bootstrap a lot.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the look.  All right.  So now I'm going to close that tab.  Just nothing.  Just close it.  Boom.  Gone.  And then let's open another tab and go to Little Outliner.  Whoops.  Let's type it right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, it worked.  Bingo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just tried to open an incognito window.  Oh, how does that work?  Yeah, it went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's attached to your session.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Makes sense.  It'd be hard to think of how to do that otherwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's a little demo on the site.  A little video demo.  That's cool.  I'm not sure what the point is.  Except that this is an HTML5 version.  Except that this is an HTML5 demo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I've learned not to ask that when Dave does something.  Because I usually don't understand it at first.  I didn't understand podcasts, honestly, at first.  Right?  And Dave has a vision that, you know, it's Dave and like, I have Williams too.  I'm not going to...  Right.  Dave's too fascinated with medium.  I'm not sure I get medium fully yet, but I'm not going to count at Williams out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first time I went to Europe, I was a kid in fifth grade.  And we brought a book called Europe on $5 a day.  And by the way, that was 1967 when you actually could go to Europe on $5 a day.  It was written by a guy named Arthur Fromer.  The Fromer's guides for many years were the backbone of my travel.  I love the Fromer's guides.  Google bottom.  And they're gone.  Gone.  Well, the print versions are gone.  The print versions are gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Europe on $5 a day.  Look at that.  Isn't that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a classic.  They're on skiff.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, that's so 60s.  That book cover is very 60s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I love Fromer's guides and I actually lived on them every time I went to Europe.  Even recently.  They were very reliable.  Google purchased them in August of last year for $22 million.  They bought Zagat as well, remember, and they killed the Zagat guides.  Those long red books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't know that the guides are killed.  Yeah, they are.  They are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm pretty sure they are.  Why would they keep them?  They killed the site.  They killed the app.  Why would they keep the paper?  I don't know.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know that for a fact.  Go to Amazon.  Go to Amazon and see if they're for sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does the pixel prevent you from going to Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to touch anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like I'm...  They are still for sale and they're still up to date.  In fact, the 2013 New York City restaurant Zagat guide is there.  I have to think though eventually they're going to kill it.  And what they did kill is the website and the app and they incorporated it into Google Maps.  And I presume they're going to do the same thing with Fromer's.  Okay, they didn't kill the website.  They killed the ability to go to the website and get reviews.  Didn't they?  I know they did it on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was actually made in Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At CUNY.  Oh no, you can still do it on the web.  That's interesting.  Because I bought a subscription every year.  And I got an email from Google saying, well, you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the paywall they got rid of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they gave it away.  They don't bother charging for it.  So I guess you could still go to Zagat and enter in cities.  But you have to wonder if you're Zagat, how much longer?  They killed Fromer's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, Fromer's, New York City with kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to get that book, Jeanor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  I got to get it before I can't get it anymore.  I guess it was published last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was one thing I was a little worried about when Google acquired NICS software.  They bought the Snapseed app.  They did kill the Snapseed desktop version.  And I was like on Tenterhooks, because I use NICS software's plugins on Lightroom and Aperture and Photoshop.  And I just think they're the best plugins for photographers.  Well, good news.  And this is funny, because literally, February 18th, I updated my NICS software collection.  I spent, I think, 150 bucks, no, 200, 300 bucks to update my NICS software collection,  because I hadn't updated it in a while and get the latest versions.  And literally, three weeks later, Google has now dropped the entire collection to $149.  And if you've ever in the last five years bought any NICS plugin, the rest are free now.  But I'm told I'm going to get an email saying, we'll refund the cost of your upgrade.  I hope that will happen.  But now $149 and highly recommended Mac, PC, Photoshop, Lightroom, or Aperture.  So they killed Snapseed desktop, but they didn't kill the NICS collection.  At least not for now.  But again, I'm gun shy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just makes me nervous.  What will they kill next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Update all the things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, da da da da da.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also, you were talking about Google Glass?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you wear it?  There's a few interesting things here going on.  They've picked 8,000 people who will get the privilege, like you, of being able to buy Google Glass,  because they did the if I had glass hashtag.  I just found out that one of my students in my entrepreneurial program, Andy Krupa, is one of the winners.  Woohoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome.  So when do you get your glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They get it in the wild, but his program, his business, his mother died of Alzheimer's,  and he wants to be able to use cameras to help people with cognitive difficulties.  That's huge.  See their day.  And in fact, he was just in the office, we were just going over this, just talking about where Google Glass is,  and then he sent me an email just now saying, well, speak of the devil, he got the message.  So what happens is that on your original post on Google+, Google is now coming in and just leaving a comment there saying,  welcome to the program.  You win.  Wow, that's great.  Now, of course, what this means is I'm checking my Google Plus notifications every three minutes,  and I haven't gotten crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should win, Jeff.  Yours was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But anyway, I'm delighted my student has won one, and there's some really neat things coming out.  There's a teacher of journalism.  Maybe he won it out of me who got one.  There's other things.  There's about five or six of the first winners are on the rundown, Leo.  But this is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I guess my question would be, they're getting the Explorer edition, as are we, Gina, right?  The right to buy it, $1,500.  My question is, is it a developer version?  Or just, you know, it might be a little buggy, but here you go version.  What are you going to get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I was getting it live, they were saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet you and they will all get the same thing, which is probably a past developer.  I think they're showing it around so much, I'll bet they're nearly ready for production.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sarah Hill works at the Veterans United Network, wants to use Glass in a VA hospital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sarah Hill is one of the best users of Google Plus.  She was a local TV anchor who put Google Hangouts on the air and did a great job with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I remember that, yeah.  She wants veterans to see their war memorials without having to go there.  I might point out you could do that on a computer without the Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I would. We like Sarah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like a good idea to me.  Hershel Taghap handles social media for restaurateur Tom Douglas Co.  and wants to give a first-person view of life as a line cook in a busy professional kitchen.  Now that would be cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shannon Rooney would help her Japanese grandma revisit her homeland without having to leave her house.  Again, it's not telepresence unless you have something on the other end that is telepresence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but here's the thing, Leo.  If you followed the story of Monica M., who has various disabilities,  don't allow her to get out of the house very easily.  She can't get around. She's a wonderful, wonderful woman on Google Plus.  And she and a photographer initiated the Distance Hangout.  Well, a photographer got on, I forget who it was, I should know this.  And he got in a rowboat and he put his phone on top of his camera and just showed her and then the world what he was seeing.  And they could direct him and say, oh, go over there, take a picture of this, go over there, take a picture of that.  Right.  It's not just that you're taking a picture of this and then sending it hours later to grandma.  It's the grandma can say, oh, I remember this, go to the left a little bit, see if that's still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what Shannon's proposing is that she go to Japan and their grandma be at home and then she's OK.  That's I thought her grandma was watching through glass.  How about the same thing with the veterans so that Sarah would go to these memorials and say, OK, veterans now watch TV because I'm going to walk around your name or see things like that.  And they could give her feedback. OK.  So these are uses, telepresence uses.  Yes.  David Moriarty wants to revolutionize clinical trials by moving away from writing and transcription and towards image and data sharing with glass.  OK. Anthony Brown is a zookeeper who just wants to hang out with penguins.  And honestly, who doesn't?  So both of those.  I mean, that means we're going to look through his eyes at penguins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At penguins, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Max Wood wants to improve firefighter safety somehow or other.  But mostly we're going to get to look at a lot of fires being fought, which is awesome.  I don't know who wrote this copy.  Probably Gizmodo, not Google.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what am I going to use mine for?  What are you going to do, Gina, the day in the life of a programmer and mom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, there's going to be lots of baby hanging out with with with Nona for sure.  That's probably going to be the first thing.  And then, yeah, I don't know.  I think it's just going to be I think I'm going to go like hang gliding or something.  Right. I mean, that's what the commercial said that I should go do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bicycling, running, skiing, skydiving or just playing with friends and family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to kidnap Gina's brain to do journalistic things with them.  I think there's a lot of things that can be done.  And we talked about this once some time ago.  I think there's so amazing things you can do with the idea of witnesses having these and journalists having these and how we do news updates and all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if I get I probably get tired of mine, Jeff, so I'll just send you mine when I'm done if you don't if you don't get one because I will see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be shocked. Meanwhile, all these neat, nice things are being done with Google Class.  All these good possibilities are there.  But the techno panic has gone berserk.  So two things, there's a guy who did it's on the rundown.  Thirty five horrible things that could happen with Google Glass.  Number two was it will it will start a surveillance society.  Come on, Jesus, we don't even have them yet.  And all this panic is going on.  So my response on Google Plus was to write 21 horrible things that light bulbs will do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like an episode of Downton Abbey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. The electricity could fly out of the socket and kill you.  Actually thought that would happen. OK, number one, they get hot and can burn people.  They can explode. They can damage the eyes.  People will get electrocuted.  The system requires new and costly infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that inspired it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the dispassionate estimate of the Edison light.  Oh, you mean the one about the squaw, the Kodak and the squaw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, the tribute to the Edward Campions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Edward Campions arguments about Google against Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at his list. It goes on forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every horrible thing that could happen.  Yeah.  That's a panicking.  I mean, yeah, we can be concerned about some things.  Of course we should.  But Jesus, that's all you concentrate on.  That's all we're going to get.  It will destroy whatever threads of privacy we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I keep hearing about how Glass is going to enable more creep shots and more,  you know, especially after the Adria Richards thing.  It's like, oh, well, if everybody can take pictures of everybody at any time,  then everybody will be publicly shamed always.  It's just seemed like a little much.  And then we already have laws getting written to ban them during, well, driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if somebody says,  I know pilots have a heads up display.  They managed to fly their jets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing is this isn't really a heads up display.  It's a screen on your head.  A heads up display, you look through it to see what's going on.  Like it's on your windshield.  This is you look up to see the screen.  It's not you can't see through it, right?  Well, we don't know yet.  You can.  There might be an augmented reality.  No, no, no, it's a piece of glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you can see it's translucent.  So it is heads up.  Yeah.  Except that it's not anywhere you want to look.  Except that it's tiny.  It's like over there.  It's not going to take over your full field of vision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it won't look tiny to you because it will look like it's a screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I'm going to get a headache.  That should be number 36.  It will give Leo a headache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also have on the rundown an organization.  One of these fake organizations that's going to protect us from everything that started  and is putting out banning the cyborgs sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop the cyborgs dot org.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stop the cyborgs dot org.  I love it.  But is this serious?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop the cyborgs was founded in response to the Google Glass project and other technology  trends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's true.  If the if the armed forces get a get a can tap into my feet of Google Glass, it'll make  a drone strike easier.  That we know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I you know, I'm not completely against this notion.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I wrote a piece weeks ago.  We will figure this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's bad to pay attention to this, but I don't think you should throw  the baby out with the bathwater either.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is all happened in the anime Ghost in the Shell.  Really?  This is from the Ghost in the Shell?  It seems like I mean, you talking about people hacking into your glass and and using  using tactical, you know, you know, being able to look through something to get a technical  representation of a room.  I mean, that was definitely in that anime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But fortunately, we have they've they've got some Creative Commons licensed posters.  Yeah, there's no Google Glass allowed.  So we now have the universal sign for no Google Glass allowed.  It's a slash through an eyeball with glass on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're selling T-shirts.  This is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? So there's like a movement.  Do you think this is a legit like this will actually gain traction or is this just some

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, this is just publicity while during the launch, right?  I mean, I wonder if we're going to see.  I mean, there's plenty of places that say no cameras, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Already, even though they can't stop camera phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The locker room at the gym says that although I carry my camera phone in there every single day,  I take pictures of the of the sign posted on Instagram.  You understand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you do a picture in the gym, you'd be you'd be hauled off.  And, you know, you know that.  So you're not going to do it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that's the problem with glass, but we'll see.  I think some of the points people make that it's just going to increase the self absorption of our society  as people stare not at each other, but off to the upper right hand corner of their vision.  That's not so far off.  But we're doing it now with phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually started writing a post based on a conversation from two weeks ago.  The idea that maybe the conversation you're having in real life in front of you is not as important  as the conversation you're going to have in your room glass, which offended you terribly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same thing happened with telephones.  You know, it still bugs me.  People will answer the phone while they're talking to you.  Like whatever we're saying, this is more important.  But that's just dick behavior.  That's all.  There will always be dicks.  Let's you know what I'd like to do.  I'm in the mood for some trumpets.  Chad jumped up.  What were you doing?  Were you lean back?  He had his foot on the feet on the console.  Sometimes I lean back like this.  Whoa.  And he jumps up.  Maybe we should do the Google.  I should do it faster next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Change log.  The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About Gita Tripathi with the latest from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A couple of cool Google Plus changes.  The Google Plus app for iOS and Android got a bunch of changes.  Some of Snapseed's photo enhancements that we just talked about made their way into the mobile app.  So you can do there's just more options to edit your photos.  You can do basic edits.  You can rotate and crop.  You can get filters.  You can adjust saturation and contrast.  So lots of better photo editing in the Google Plus app.  You can now share your current location with specific circles on Google Plus.  So you have to enable that.  Share your location.  And then now this is it.  You can already share, you know, show the places that you have lived, right, or been.  But this is your current location, which you can, you know, choose, say, you know, have the share for my phone automatically.  Or you can opt out entirely.  And what else?  You can also, let's see.  Sorry.  Lost my, lost my, oh, there's a lot more communities features as well.  So we've seen a lot of communities features like moderation and turning up and down the volume of how many posts you see on the desktop.  The mobile apps also got that.  And the little change that made me wince until I saw how it would actually work.  You can now use animated GIFs for your G Plus profile photo.  Make Kevin's.  Yeah.  Make Kevin's.  This does not show up when you're looking at your stream.  OK, so it doesn't show up when you're just looking at a post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody quick, make an animated GIF of Jeff doing that.  I want that for my profile.  That's my new profile.  So does it show up?  When does it show up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It shows up when you actually go to the person's profile.  OK, so it's not in streams.  You're not going to have a lot of that's a different animated.  That's the one I like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So if you notice on that rollover on the screen that you have up, it's the still shots.  The first it's the first frame in the animated GIF.  Right.  But but when you have to go to the go to the profile and actually see it to get the Harry Potter effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The extended middle fingers are we in again?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What else do we have?  Oh, the Gmail.  Chad, did you make one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did my background, but Chad knew.  But what I do like is when you hover over the thing, it makes it really nice in the in the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chad has his kitty cat looking back and forth as is.  But that's the big picture, not the profile picture.  I didn't know you could do both.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so that the cover photo does move when you mouse over.  So it's interesting.  The Gmail app for iPhone got an update and you can now swipe left or right to move between conversations on the iPhone without needing to return to your inbox.  And it's easier to take action on multiple messages in Gmail for iPhone.  So you can you can select a message in the inbox and it enables an edit mode.  And once you're in edit mode, you can tap on messages to select them and choose to archive, delete or more kind of kind of batch batch actions on a set of messages in iPhone and the iPhone app or Gmail or the Gmail app or iPhone.  What else?  Oh, Google Maps got lots of new transit information.  So live departure times for seven lines, the New York City subway system, buses and trams in Salt Lake City area and the metro rail in D.C.  So this is really cool.  I tried this out with my my most frequently haunted New York City subway stations and you can see next time next train next train leaves or arrives.  So that's right on Google Maps to be really, really useful.  And finally, this is really, really cool.  Google's Knowledge Graph is showing up in movies on Android tablets, so movies from the Play Store.  If you're watching them on an Android tablet and you pause the movie, the the the the Apple actually show and circle the face of the actor that you paused on and show Knowledge Graph cards.  Right. So in this screenshot there.  Yeah. So if you're watching a movie, say with Jack Black in it and you pause it, it will say it will circle Jack Black's face.  This is using facial recognition.  This is not using the movies metadata and it'll show you the Jack Black sort of informational card that you would see in Google now or on the right side bar, the Knowledge Graph and search results.  This also works for sound.  So if you're listening to if you're watching a movie and you hear a song during the movie, if you pause it, it will give you the information about what song that was using their sound search technology.  So really cool.  I'm just sad this only works on Android tablets for Google Play for movies from Google Play.  I want to see this everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you'll soon see it on Google Glass as you watch the movie in the theater, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, maybe maybe if you're watching anything in Chrome, that won't be the least bit annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For movies, I just want to be able to walk up to someone at a conference and be like, show me their you know, do they have a Wikipedia page?  Show it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, life is going to be like pop up video now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's.  Is that an ancient?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that a reference that nobody?  We get it.  Yeah, we get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Life is just an animated gif.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, look at the animated gif I just put on my page as my not my not my but the by little animated.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, yeah, just a little.  It's not subtle.  You don't have to go crazy with it.  Just a little bit of it's Harry Potter.  It's just a little blink every once in a while.  I think it looks just like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really good.  That's a guy named Will did that on DVNR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're trying to get him to do a whole animated.  I thought for April Fools, we should just do Twig as an animated show like the Ricky  for Gervais show, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We just take the I think we can do that.  Dang.  April 1st is on a Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know we're going to April 1st, 2014.  Takes a long time to do animation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's time to get it.  Get it ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it'd be kind of interesting, though, to do like Ricky Gervais does that show, right?  So they just record the audio and then I think it can be done programmatically where the  lips just move because they hear sound or something.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the changelog.  The changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's interesting to me is, and I don't know if Google got this as a signal from their  experience with Google+, or if they knew it all along, but it's really becoming apparent that  look at Instagram and look at how the photographers have taken to Google+.  We're becoming much more of a visual society.  Pictures really do represent a thousand words and more and more we communicate via pictures.  And it seems to me more and more Google is really moving in that direction, you know, that they  understand it's really about visual.  Is that new for Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google Plus app on the Android actually reduced some of the photos and put some more text on them.  You wanted to do that.  No, I'm saying it's what it did.  It did.  Oh yeah.  The new design on Google Plus is slightly less emphasis on the huge photo.  Well, maybe they went too far.  A little more context for it, which I kind of like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's still pretty visual.  Oh yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can also get a photo only feed, I think, on Google Plus now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's new where you have just the photos.  And that was one of the things that made me think that is that maybe that's one of the things that's going on.  I mean, look at the photo only feed is just, you know, actually these are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's my photos.  Those are your photos.  Yeah.  So how do I forget how to do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But maybe you can only do it on the on the website.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I have nearby.  I don't see.  It's definitely on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not on the maybe it's not on the app yet.  It's definitely on the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This app, though, we were talking about this on all about Android last night is really kind of like I feel like it's Google's best designed kind of the forefront.  It's getting so gets updated so often and it's just really nicely designed.  I feel like it's kind of the best of Android design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it do you think more more so on iPhone or do you think Android is keeping up with the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I honestly haven't used it very much on the iPhone.  Oh, how funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it seemed like they were updating it that the iPhone was the one that they were putting the most attention to and then later adding Android.  But, you know, I don't actually this Android looks pretty good.  So.  So it is so visual.  Yeah, it really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think that Google I think that might be an example of why Google Plus is important to Google because they can watch how we behave and what glass was going to be even more important and they can adjust their products to become more how what we want.  And in this case, more visual, they can make a photo only feed and they can add animated gifts and stuff like that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, when you think about the dimension that say Street View added to maps, you know, something to look at a map.  Right.  Yeah, they want everyone to be able to go down to this and they want everyone to be able to contribute Street View photos basically, you know, they want everyone to be equipped to the camera and make it as easy as possible to snap a picture and upload it to the cloud.  That I think that's I think what glass is going to be right.  Glass is going to be the easiest way to take a picture of not uploaded to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now they have Fukish Fukishima on Google Street View.  If you'd like to see the devastation of the the tsunami in Japan, they've added some imagery to Google Street View.  I don't know if it's before and after or it was closed.  I guess the exclusion zone is the area closed off to visitors after the earthquake and that's what they in particular have images of.  So they worked with the Japanese government to let cars drive through here.  Oh, this is interesting.  Because, no, you can't.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder who got that assignment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, is it exclusion zone because of radioactive pollution?  This is where the nuclear plant was.  Yeah, there's some devastation, but boy, it's interesting.  It's totally deserted, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little eerie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it should be there.  It feels like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need that eagle sound that they always use.  I can't do it.  Hmm.  Glass will be 3G, right?  We have asks in our chat room.  Yeah, because it's tied to your smartphone.  So it's always online to answer your question.  Moving on.  I'm sorry, I was distracted by putting my animated GIF on Google+.  Eric Schmidt says, it's Apple's fault.  Apple says, screw you, Eric Schmidt.  Well, not so fast, Eric.  Eric Schmidt implied that now, Google Now for iOS was stuck in the App Store approval process,  at which point Apple checked and said, not only do we not have a Google Now app,  there's no Google app, there's nothing from Mountain View waiting in the queue.  So you're wrong, Eric Schmidt, you're wrong.  It's easy to blame Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was at Big Ten in India, Alan Rusberger of The Guardian asked why I can't have Google Now on my iPhone,  and Rusberger said, take that up with Apple.  That was the exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's interesting.  So it's the company line now.  But it wasn't true.  But it's not true.  Unless they have a signal from Apple that says, don't even bother, kids.  The real problem with Google Now on iOS is that you don't have access to the kind of information you do on Android.  Apple locks down a lot of stuff.  So I don't think now could know as much about what you're up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  Although Now does have access to all your Google information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your Google stuff, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yes.  Google Rep confirmed, yes, we have not submitted Google Now to Apple's App Store.  Sorry.  I mean, maybe Schmidt was implying actually that what you just said, that there are restrictions on iOS which make it difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  We don't even want to try because Apple won't really let us do.  But you can get, look, you can get the calendar, you have to ask permission, but you can get the calendar, you can get the contact list,  ask permission, but you can get it.  You have all the Google information.  What more would they need?  Location information, you can get that.  Location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Access to Gmail.  I mean, that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no humidity sensor on the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm waiting for Google Now to say, you know, you seem a little moist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Perhaps you'd like to buy an antiperspirant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Powder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm talking about the Galaxy S4 has a humidity sensor.  Yeah.  Facebook's managing editor steps down, says we don't need those thinking reporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know they had one.  Yeah.  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're right.  They don't.  They don't need no reporters.  Apparently they had what?  A managing editor for what?  Facebook News?  And who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't know.  I do not know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any any other stories before we get to our picks and tips and tricks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hold on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anything else you want?  I don't want to use any numbers or anything like that.  Anything numeric.  I'm trying to see what else there was.  Facebook hosts 250 million monthly gamers.  Paid out two billion dollars to developers.  The Winklevise say, yeah, we're done with Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're good.  We're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We got enough money.  We didn't mention Twitter celebrated its seventh birthday this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Happy birthday Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I joined Twitter first in 2006, December 2006.  So it was like nine months old.  I quit a few months later and rejoined in April 2007.  I was the number one most followed person on Twitter for a while.  For a while when I had five thousand followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's saying something.  Grandpa comes back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin Rose and I were battling for the number one position over five thousand followers.  Remember that.  We thought it was a big deal at the time.  Little did we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Android teams building a smartwatch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, everybody.  Apparently Samsung is everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  LG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  LG is everybody's building glasses too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's got glasses.  They got it all.  Everybody's doing everything.  There's no new ideas under the sun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I know there's one more here.  Well, I should mention that just for the sake of the record here, since we are the podcast of record, that the lightstone should strike.  Yes.  As past houses of the German.  Oh, no.  That's bad news, right?  Just wanted to say it.  Just wanted to say it.  The other little story in my little world was a New York Times social person went crazy this week calling the saying that hashtags were too ugly.  They're ugly.  They're so ugly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're just unesthetic.  They're not pretty.  I don't like them.  Hashtags are everywhere.  Path just added hashtags.  Christmas Cena invented the hashtag, right, Gina?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Chris, Chris linked to it from Google Plus that just said hashtag burn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This the reporter Daniel Victor.  Oh, no, this is this is a story in the Neiman journalism lab.  Who did the New York Times story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aesthetically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's usually doesn't troll, but this one this one seems like a little one after the links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think there's plenty of people using hashtags.  Oh, no, Daniel Victor, social media staff editor at the New York Times.  That's him.  So what is the Times?  Hashtags are dead and the Times is on it.  Are they going to are they going to stop using hashtags?  I don't think he really I think he doesn't understand what hashtags do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, they they they they organize things.  They're a platform.  They enable people to gather around an idea.  He says, I use it for news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, according to Twitter, Super Bowl was used three million times.  The hashtag Super Bowl over about five hours.  Look at all those people who might be interested in our jokes about Beyonce and yet getting any single person's attention is short of impossible.  But but what happened as a result is that the trending topic was Super Bowl.  You knew people were interested in Super Bowl.  You click that link.  You could see the Super Bowl tweets.  That's how it's supposed to work.  What's wrong with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he said that doesn't scale because he can't read the mobile.  In that case, guess what?  Twitter doesn't scale because you can't read all.  Welcome to the Internet, buddy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this Internet thing is not going to work because I cannot read it all.  I think it's going nowhere.  It's overwhelming.  Did you know there's like millions of pages?  I can't read that.  Can't read it all.  There's no evidence people are actually using the search tool in that way.  In most searches, the quantity of tweets is overwhelming and the quality underwhelming.  That's a Twitter problem.  That's not the hashtag problem.  This is that same article we see every few months about Twitter's stupid.  I just discovered it and it's stupid.  I don't like it.  I like your belly girl.  Twitter is just stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stupid.  I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why are everybody on Twitter?  Where did my space go?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I want my space back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't like Twitter.  I don't like Twitter.  I don't like Twitter.  I want my space back.  Oh, I love this one.  This is a store.  Where is it?  It's not in the US.  It's in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I forget where it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Australia, I think.  Yeah, Australia.  Talk about not getting unclear on the subject.  Although I understand I'm sympathetic with the desire.  The store posted this in the in the store window.  As of the 1st of February, this store will be charging people a $5 fee for just looking.  The $5 fee will be deducted when goods are purchased.  So in other words, you're going to pay admission to go buy something at the store.  Why has this come about?  There's been a high volume of people who use this store as a reference and then purchase goods elsewhere.  These people are unaware our prices are almost the same as other stores.  Plus, we have products simply not available anywhere else.  So it's going to cost you $5 to come in here, buddy.  Wow.  Unclear on the concept.  So, but what do you...  I understand this is called showrooming, right?  Yes.  And I understand.  I mean, if I were a camera store, I'd be kind of depressed because probably people come in every single day.  They say, well, let me see what's the coolest thing.  What's lightweight? What's neat? What's cool?  Thank you very much.  I'm not going to order that on Amazon.  I don't blame you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I understand that. So what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to change your entire business model just like media have, just like everybody else.  Welcome to the world.  Yeah.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm telling you, as a shopkeeper, you can overcome that by offering better service, better support, fair prices.  You don't have to undercut Amazon, but Amazon's not that cheap.  And now that you now that they collect taxes on the show, pardon me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was involved because of what Google do with a bid to develop a very large unfinished mall in New Jersey.  And the guy who came to me, his concept, I don't want to give it away, but it was straightforward.  It was the go with the trend and physical space becomes marketing space.  Right.  And fulfillment happens from wherever it's going to happen.  Right.  Nothing wrong with that.  People still love to shop.  They love to look at stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just make it a wonderful experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Give them a cup of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know I am in the center of the universe.  I used to go out at lunchtime, you know, and some days I would go wander in a record store or in a bookstore or an electronic store.  I can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't browse in the real world anymore.  Yeah.  They don't make it easy.  Nope.  Charging the bill.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Charging the bill.  Charge of five bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Five bucks the door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sort of late addition of the change log.  Thanks, Mx, in the chat room.  The official Android or the, yeah, the Android official blog just posted that the Google  Translate on Android is getting an update that's going to involve offline translation.  So you don't have to have a connection.  Yeah.  Which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can download.  Yeah.  I see it.  Here's the update.  I can download French ahead of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you're traveling, you're not sure what your connection is going to be like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great.  Translate without a network, offline language packages, Android 2.3 and above.  And now it can translate vertical text in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean with your camera.  That's really cool.  Google Translate is so cool.  And it was so funny that Samsung and their Galaxy S4 announcement made a big deal about  their Samsung Translator, which as far as I could tell was like Google Translate only  not as good.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except Samsung.  Yeah.  It's true.  It's interesting though using this thumbtack icon, the same icon that you when you download  music offline, bring Google Play and play music.  That's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all get it.  I'm tacking this.  That's the ultimate skeuomorphism.  I'm thumbtacking this to my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thumbtacking this right to my phone.  All you need is a wooden background.  And a piece of paper.  There's my language back thumbtack to my cork board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What language should I translate to?  Chinese.  We'll be right back with your tip, your number and your...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ran out of time.  Cut you off.  Cut me right off.  It's good to do it in Chinese because then nobody knows if it was right or not.  With your tip, your number and your tool of the week, but first a word from Podio.com.  Podio from Citrix lets you manage all of the data.  You know, nowadays work is data driven, isn't it?  We're knowledge workers.  All of us are knowledge workers.  And the problem is you've got your team, sometimes not even in the same space.  They're all over the place.  You've got your emails.  You've got your data.  You've got your spreadsheets.  And you need a way to pull it together, to collaborate, to work together.  And that's what Podio does better than anything I've ever seen.  All the information.  In fact, I can log into my Podio account and show you how we're using it for sales now, which is so cool.  P-O-D-I-O.com.  Here's the best part.  It's free.  So you can go there right now.  What I want you to do when you go there, though, is set up a workspace.  Pick a topic or, you know, if it's sales or whatever, set up a workspace so you can try it and you'll see the amazing thing.  There's OMG Craft Employee Network.  You said you shared it with me, right?  Oh, I was going to say I was Lisa was showing me what we do with sales.  It's really kind of cool.  Did you share it with Leo at Twitter TV?  Maybe you didn't share it with my business account, but you see you have the activity stream.  You can see all the employees.  You can check.  You can have a little Twitter.  You can talk back and forth, but you can also do assignments.  They have apps that are fantastic.  You can add you can create your own apps easily, but you can also add there's a very large store with tons of different kinds of apps available in it.  It's really remarkable tool.  Keep track of all the information you use in your day to day life.  Let's see.  Guest expense voucher.  Procedures document.  Is that it?  We're using this for a lot.  Vacation.  Keep track of vacation time in here.  Staff bulletins.  It's amazing.  Try it free.  Podio podio.com.  Sign in.  Make a workspace.  Whatever you want to work on a project or all sorts of stuff.  And then invite your team to join in and you can do it here.  We could wonder why I'm not.  I'm not seeing it.  So we keep track of all of our leads in here.  This is actually just can you see this over the shoulder?  This is Lisa's computer.  So all of the leads we keep track in here.  Look at me.  Look at me trying to use the touch screen on your Macbook here.  Can't do that apparently.  You got to get a better computer Lisa.  So we keep track in progress.  Who's responsible for it.  Project kickoff and completion.  This is amazing stuff.  Really a huge tool.  Podio.com.  You got to try it.  But if you try it, you set up a workspace, I think you'll get some idea of what it can do for you and your business.  And we thank them.  And Citrix, the folks who make it, for their support of Twig.  All right.  I'm ready, Gina Trapani, for your tip of the week.  Hey, Gina, you're muted.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm muted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But first you have to unmute yourself.  First I have to unmute myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Second time in a row I've done that.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, Jeff Reff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know, Jeff, badass.  You wouldn't do on the console.  He did a good job.  He did a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You did a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're vying.  Text files is the command line.  So, okay, tip of the week.  Last week when Google Keep launched right before we started the show, we were trying to figure out if there was a way to start it up from Google Now.  And actually there is a way to do this.  So Google Now, if you tap the voice icon in Android, there's a note to self action.  So you can say, like, note to self, go pick up milk.  What that used to do is just transcribe, you know, go pick up milk and email that to you.  But what Android Now does, it has a hook into note taking apps.  So not just Keep, so Catch and Evernote both hook into this as well.  So if you want to do a quick note to self, you can launch Google Now.  You can say note to self, pick up some milk, and you can pick up some milk.  And on the first time it'll say, hey, what app do you want to handle this?  Gmail, Catch, Evernote, Keep.  You choose the one you want.  You tap always.  And so you can do a quick note to self using the app of your choice now courtesy of Keep.  It seems to be a new thing that launched around the time that Keep launched.  But it does work with other apps, which is kind of the beauty of Evernote.  Sorry, Android is that you can really share to any app you want to handle in action.  You can configure it to do that.  Oh, that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just saved the note, though.  Maybe I'd already told it Evernote.  Let me see where it saved it.  Oh, no, here it is.  Complete action using Evernote, Gmail, or Keep.  That is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so note to self, voice action, Google Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, note to self.  I'm going to always use Evernote.  There you go.  Wow, that's cool.  Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you might make fun of me for this.  One of my very favorite shows on the big tube is Shark Tank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to make fun of you now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I like Shark Tank.  This is where an entrepreneur sits down in front of a bunch of people like Mark Cuban  and pitches his idea, and it's kind of like American Idol for investment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like the Entrepreneur's Stars, which is pretty cool.  Yeah.  So, right, so I'm going to look to the side here.  But at SharkTank.tvquotes.net, they've done a compilation of the total investments.  And the Sharks have invested in four seasons, $20.04 million in 109 companies.  Wowie zowie.  Wow, that sounds like a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is pretty amazing.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The general, the deal valuations, the equity, what the ask was versus what they got.  For our Shark Tank friends, my colleague here at CUNY, Jeremy Kaplan, pointed this out today,  and I was in statistical heaven going through this.  So for those Shark Tank fans, it's actually having an impact before actually investing in companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it seems like they say no a lot.  Like I watch the show, and it sounds like they say no a lot.  And it sounds like they also don't invest a whole lot.  That number sounds high to me, but I guess I have been watching it all four seasons.  That's great. That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is Dragon's Den? What network is that on?  That's BBC.  That's the British version of Shark Tank.  Okay.  Yes.  Can you watch it on BBC America, or do you have to pirate it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I think you can. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody in the chat room knows all about Dragon's Den.  You can watch it in Canada, too.  Our friend Scott Jordan, who runs Scott Evest, was a guest on Shark Tank.  They didn't invest, but he says to this day, and this was maybe a couple of years ago,  he gets 100 search terms a day, people searching for Shark Tank,  who end up finding his website, Scott Evest, and go there.  So literally, it's a very good way to drive traffic, even if they don't invest in you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm friends now with the co-creator of the three doodler we talked about a few weeks ago,  and I'm begging him to go on Shark Tank. Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think he needs to. How much money did he raise on Kickstarter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He raised more than two million, but again...  He doesn't need to. It's just a pen that extrudes plastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, but it's not about the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have some doodles here in the office. Wait a moment.  Oh, you got yours. Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So for those of you... Steve Gibson was talking about this on Security Now earlier today.  He was all excited about this.  So for those who don't know, it's a pen that you draw, but you can draw...  Now, did you do these, Jeff, or did he do these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My students did. I was in my office with it, so the three doodler...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, that's great. Boy, if I could only do that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there a cube in that? Is there what?  It looks like someone made a cube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, in fact, one of my students made a little dog, which you can find on my feed.  I'm just amazed. What security issue could there possibly be with this?  I can't wait to hear. No, no, there isn't. He loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay. He just liked it. He just liked it. No, no, no. Not at all. Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's 3D. You can make a key and break in to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there's no...  Although, you saw that one of the interesting things that's starting to happen  is people are using 3D printers to print gun parts so that you don't have to buy...  You don't even have to be licensed to buy a gun. You just print it.  That's exciting. Fantastic. That's great news.  That's great news. I'm just looking at all the stuff I've purchased.  Or pardon me. See, that's my fault. It's not a store.  Kickstarter is a marketplace of ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A charity. A creative charity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A charity where people with more money than cents get together with inventors.  So this is what... Look at this is the array of things that I have purchased.  Diaspora was the first one. Didn't get that. Dice didn't get that.  Pebble Watch still waiting. Joey Bra got that. Cone... The Cone Coffee Maker got that.  Didn't fund the Space Folk album. They wanted to make an album on the moon.  Didn't raise enough money. I'm sorry.  The Nifty Mini Drive got it. Didn't work.  I'm getting the Oculus Rift that's coming sometime soon. That's the 3D helmet.  If Google Glass gives you a headache, that will.  This is cool. The bamboo cases for the iPad. I actually have those. Those are good.  The ostrich pillow I got. I don't understand why I invested in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a poor choice.  How drunk were you when you bought that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm drunk whenever I use Kickstarter. I'm drunk with power.  $195,000 raised for this thing that you put on your head.  You put your hands in the holes.  It's got a little face hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a face hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a face hole. This guy's laughing all the way to the bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You all look like a-holes now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The face hole might be a good title for this episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The face hole.  Don't say I didn't get anything from Kickstarter. Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, you have a bad choice. You have a problem with making the wrong choices on Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I make the wrong choices on Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't back Veronica Mars?  That should be your profile picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you back Veronica Mars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a huge Veronica Mars fan. I was right there.  I backed it before it even hit $50,000.  $50,000. I was right when it-well, that's not true.  It must have been like maybe $250,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they raised what? $2 million? $3 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The goal was $2 million and they blew it out.  Blew by that.  Yeah, let me check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now what happens? Is the movie company going to make it now and then give the money to the investors?  $4 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $4 million. Right. So the goal was $2 million.  And they set all new Kickstarter records.  They reached $1 million and $2 million faster than anybody else that has.  So I believe that the deal with Warner was that Warner would, if they could prove that there was enough fan interest, then Warner would back as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is like a petition. This is like an online petition except people put their money where their mouth is.  Or in my case, put my nose where the hole is.  Put your nose where the face hole is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tonight I might go to a concert by Natalie Dawn, who's also a star Kickstarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, no, there's definitely some people who've done some.  I think that's where I think Kickstarter makes a lot of sense.  Creative enterprises, movies, TV, music, to support you in making that and to gauge interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've only backed video games.  And have you gotten any of them?  Not yet, but video games take a lot longer than Dostridge Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure you'll get those any day now. And they'll be really fun to play too.  I don't know. I'm a cynic.  You are?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like Double Fine Adventure. I'm excited about that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to TechCrunch, Google Glass will be made in Santa Clara.  They're setting up an assembly facility right now in Santa Clara, California.  That's in the U.S. of A.  Not Santa Clara, Spain.  I don't have a tool. I'm just stalling.  So thank you, Jeff Jarvis.  You are the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo and Gina, for taking me through the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was very exciting. I feel like I wasn't much help.  But way to go.  Jeff, every single thing I've ever made fun of you, technically, about, I take it all back.  You're total bad.  He did a good job.  He did.  I was nervous. My palms were actually sweaty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I thought I was going to ruin it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did come within inches of saving an empty file on top of the file we were trying to change.  But we were able to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, I'm going to have to do this all again because this is the loader machine from Google.  I'm waiting for mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's all right, because you and I will both have one by then.  And by the way, that was another scoop from Jeff Jarvis.  April 8th is apparently the pixels with LTE are supposed to start arriving.  Looking forward to that.  Jeff is the author of Public Parts, which you should get.  Read, consume, bring with you at all times in case you run into Jeff Jarvis, then ask him for an autograph.  How autographed?  Gina Trapani is the author of the Google Wave book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, please, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And she still trusts Google, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I built this app called ThinkUp.  And Anil and I, my co-founder, we just launched a new homepage.  You should check it out. ThinkUp.com.  We're going to launch a software as a service.  So, we're on the waiting list right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, are you going to go to the Twitter, the invite only Twitter developer conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't gotten an invite, so I don't know.  I probably not. Not as far as I know.  Boy, I would think you'd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I guess because you're not doing a Twitter app.  Maybe you're not one of the people they think about when they think of developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I may have to nudge my contacts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, we'll be able to purchase a kind of hosted server running ThinkUp?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we're still finalizing details, but that's the idea. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to host ThinkUp for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're not going to run into the issues with the Twitter API, you know, the 100,000 people and all that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not because we're not a client.  We're not a way for you to read your Twitter stream, right?  We're not a client. We're pretty firmly in the analytics quadrant.  So, we're not going to hit that ceiling.  And we're doing everything we can to be compliant with the display requirements and all that good stuff.  And we work with Google+, Facebook, and Foursquare, and Bitly, and lots of other networks, too.  So, yeah, we're in good shape.  But get on the waiting list. You can do some stuff from the homepage right now.  And we will start, hopefully, rolling out soon, next few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can vouch for even if you just want to, you know, just for fun, I can vouch out how cool this is.  There's chats.  Yeah, yeah, there's chats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, that's the 1.0. That's our stable 1.0 version.  We have a 2.0 beta that's kind of more of a stream than a dashboard, which we're working on hard now.  We're trying to get that to stable release.  But yeah, these are the kind of stats that you'll be able to see.  But our new 2.0 version, we're trying to kind of tell you, instead of just showing you a chart,  we're trying to tell you what it is about that chart that's meaningful.  Or neat.  Yeah, yeah. So, you don't have to stare at bars and lines going up and down.  So it's going to be kind of a stream of insights that pop up.  So if you get, you know, see a follower spike or if you get a retweet spike or if someone with tons of followers retweets you, for example,  you'll get an alert about that.  So that's what we're working on now.  So if you're super geek and you're on a web server, you can download the 2.0 beta and install it on your own web server.  If you're impatient, want to try it out.  Otherwise, get your name on our waiting list and we'll get you a spot as soon as it opens up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just added my name to the waiting list. Very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yay, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
