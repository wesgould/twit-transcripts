Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi big head, howdy.  Good to see you.  How's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did I miss the show last week?  I feel like I haven't seen you in ages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was here seven days ago, but I, my heart longs for you Leo too and I'm not on Wednesdays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel good.  I feel like I'm back here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love him more than you do.  Stop it you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is disgusting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I love him more than you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is also here.  I'll tell you from BuzzMachine dot com, the author of What Would Google Do and a brand  new book called Public Parts, which you must buy.  Period.  Just buy it.  I'll tell you, I was at an event yesterday.  I spoke at, it used to be Webmaster World.  They now call it PubCon.  It's all about, it's for webmasters about marketing and promoting your site and social  media SEO search engine.  Matt Cutts is speaking there today I think.  But somebody asked at the end of my talk, he said, I listen to Twig.  I love Twig.  What do you think the future of Google is?  And I said something apparently that really upset the crowd.  I heard later that there was murmuring.  I said I think Google's in trouble because I think search is changing so rapidly and  the idea of a web page search may not have as much currency going forward.  And what I talked about is Mike Elgin's contention that Siri will intermediate search and that  Apple at least is, in fact Mike wrote this great article.  He said this is what Steve meant when he said go thermonuclear on Google, not only taking  all the Google apps off of the iPhone, which is in process.  Apple's bought three mapping companies.  They're clearly going to do a maps.  They've already replaced Google Places with Yelp in the Siri search.  And he believes, and I think he's right, that Siri will ultimately appear on all Apple products  despite Apple's protestations that it won't.  Recently yesterday I think somebody at Apple said, we have no plans to put Siri on any  older devices.  And we will never put video on an iPod.  No one would ever want to read books on a small device, etc., etc., etc.  I think that people are going to get conditioned to doing their searches not typing into the  browser but asking Siri.  And at that point Apple has re-intermediated search.  We talk about disintermediation, right?  The idea that a travel agent no longer makes sense.  You just go right to the airline.  You buy the ticket.  That's what the internet has been doing all along.  But Apple's kind of re-intermediating saying we'll stand between you and your search engine  and we'll decide who to choose.  We'll let Siri figure out where to find what you want, what it is you're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's even better than that.  Number one, the whole notion of search becomes antiquated, right?  You're just asking questions and answers.  And the notion of a brand to the answer goes away.  Siri just told you the answer, which Google's been going to too, right?  We're going to give you the flight details directly.  Now Apple outdoes them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google of course has voice search and I've been using their beta version of that.  So they have that capability.  But in order to use it, you have to go to a Google page.  If you use it on a mobile device.  Now really what this is going to do is make the Android iOS war be an all out shooting  match.  It's not a cold war.  I mean, Android of course will continue to be Google dependent, I would presume.  So maybe this is just an Apple only concern.  But I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Siri doesn't present any Google search results?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It will.  If you search the web right now, it will search Google.  Okay.  There's no reason why it has to and it could use something else.  And when you...  Well, let's put it this way.  When you say find me a locksmith, it uses...  It does not use Google.  It uses Yelp for the reviews only.  Okay.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, can Siri give the best search results without having Google involved?  Sure.  You think using other services like Yelp and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we know that Bing is as good as Google, right?  Is it?  Is it?  I think so.  It's close enough.  I don't think the user's going to care that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's the interesting thing.  If the answer is audio, that's my point earlier, is that there's no brand involved.  And so does Google sue Apple at that point and get off of Siri?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right now, if you say, for instance, how many calories in a bagel, it will give you a branded  Wolfram Alpha text box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But as soon as Siri starts reading the answer back to you...  Then you don't know who it is.  Then you don't know who it is.  So the notion of a web page for many transactions, right?  Many exchanges becomes ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And replacing Google with Microsoft probably isn't something Apple anticipates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't matter.  It becomes a copyright.  You know, does Google...  Here's the interesting thing.  Can they copyright results?  Exactly.  Exactly.  Is the order of the results a copyrightable event?  Probably is.  But is Google really going to want to do that when people are going to say, well, whoa,  whoa, whoa, whoa.  And you're saying that ain't copyright.  You're going to try to copyright your...  Same thing, isn't it?  So an answer is an answer, man.  It's just information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's also a open source project that just posted a ginormous archive of spider searches,  they say, because we can't let Google own all of this.  So just as there is open street map to replace Google Maps and open source street mapping,  I wouldn't be surprised to see kind of open source alternatives to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd be eager to hear what Gina says about this too.  But I, Google fanboy, wrote the book, now out in paperback.  But Google's at a juncture where they've got to be careful.  The other question, I think, nobody needs to get into this too, but Android on the fire...  I was talking to some folks at this conference I was at, and they believe that Android becomes  badly disintermediated there, that there's nothing special about it.  They just used it.  Google's in an interesting position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, what do you think?  It's true.  I mean, Amazon doesn't have to use Google on fire.  They don't mention Google.  They don't say anything about it.  But I don't know.  Have we seen the search?  Is it going to be a Google search?  We haven't seen it yet.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We haven't.  Yeah, it's interesting.  I mean, I still think about Google as the best search results out there.  I mean, I tried switching other search engines and it just didn't work.  In terms of an open source search engine, yes, search engines are becoming easier to  build and it's kind of old school.  Finding web pages isn't the most important thing anymore.  That's the point, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the social part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It may be that Google continues to be the best way to find a web page.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  But you've got two...  You've got a double whammy here from both ends.  From one end, you have...  It's just questions and answers.  It's not web pages.  Just give me the damn answer to the question.  Get what I want.  Right?  The other thing that's interesting to me is discovery does not come through search or  brands.  It comes through sharing and social.  The two hit at the same time with Google in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if, for instance, it searched Twitter?  And for some search results, that would be better.  Or search Facebook.  Or conditioned its search results via Facebook, which is what Bing does, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, part of this isn't just search, too.  It's also alerts and things.  It says, oh, Leo, you care about the story.  We see that it's trending right now.  Siri is watching out for you.  Siri becomes the fabled agent of your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what I really see happening, actually, and this is happening a number of ways, is  that Apple is moving towards this closed Apple-centric environment where they do all the work.  They do everything.  And some people will really like this.  Some people will prefer it.  I might prefer it.  I love Siri.  Some people might say, hey, this is great, especially on a portable device, which is  kind of closed anyway.  Look, this is great.  And so Apple, but it's not going to be universal.  Not everybody's, maybe not even a majority of people will use this.  But for those living in the Apple universe, it's Apple, Apple, Apple.  There's no Google.  There's no anything else.  There's Apple.  And then there'll be the rest of us living somewhere else.  So what you're really saying is the wild west.  And what will the consequences be?  Security issues?  Porn.  Porn.  For some of us, that's not a consequence.  That's a benefit.  But I think our audience, clearly our audience, and not just for this show, but for all Twitch  shows is always going to choose the wild west.  But we aren't the majority.  We aren't, you know, that's not who this is aimed at.  Apple doesn't care about us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the App Store model, right?  Yes.  We approve the apps that come in here.  We present content in a very specific way.  We have rules about how it can be presented.  So you're saying Siri is like another information delivery mechanism where Apple does the scrubbing  and the curating and the editing and says, this is how you will get this information  and they can cut out Google from this, right?  In the Steve Jobs book, didn't they talk about how Jobs had approached Google and said, kill  Android and I will give you home screen real estate on iOS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't see that in the book.  That might have been somewhere else that came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe somewhere else I'd seen this.  But he basically offered, he said, you know, I will guarantee a few home screen spots on  iOS if you stop doing this.  And Google was basically like, no.  So it looks like they're doing the opposite.  If what you're saying is true, Leo, that they're going to cut off, cut off Google services  from the iOS experience, either to get them back for Android or because they feel like  they can offer better, a better experience through other services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, here's the I mean, it's I think it's pretty clear that that that is Apple's overall  business strategy.  Yep.  And I guess the question for this show is, does it matter to Google?  Do they care?  I mean, is it going to be 10 percent, 20 percent?  I mean, there are 150 million iOS devices.  It's but but Google.  See, maybe Google was prescient.  Maybe Google was smart when they said, oh, Android, we've got to save ourselves from  this potential future.  So let's do Android.  Right. But here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And they will have their own voice.  They'll have their own Siri.  Right. They'll have Geary.  But  it'd be funny if they call it Geary.  I like it.  It would be like that.  Yeah. Every little year is any preferable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It'll be a robot with gears.  Yeah. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But, you know, what you're you're you're getting the gears of my head going here.  You can hear the noise because it's not Web versus app.  Now there's a whole new layer.  Right. There's a layer that's apart from visual presentation.  And that's a new app, right, purely, but it's a whole new layer.  They're not saying the whole world is going to become audio.  It's not going to be.  But how much share does that take away and how much is that that that that?  And the thing is that Google could have argued that on the iPad, people are going to  the browser anyway and on the browser, they'll still serve ads.  So we're OK.  But what this really starts to kill is browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and this ties into a conversation we had earlier on security now,  because Apple has announced that in March it's going to require anybody who wants  to be on the desktop app store to sandbox their apps.  So they are going to have very much a tight control of apps as well on the desktop.  So I don't think it is mobile only.  I think it is. This is this is Apple wants to control.  And it's clear from the book that this is Apple wants to control end to end.  They believe that they can give a better user experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please allow me to issue the important buzz caveat, which is that as I'm declaring,  the Syriac takes over the world, it may not know it's true.  It's got to be.  It's a bid. I'm not saying it's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a bid. But it is.  It's it's it's something really.  Ben Parr wrote in Mashable very interesting article yesterday.  Two schools of thought, the key difference between Apple and Google.  He Ben is kind of crazily listening to in the Plex and the Steve Jobs biography  at the same time.  Oh, wow. Which must be very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would Google do in there?  Yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And he says, and I know that you've observed this also, Jeff,  that Google is data driven. Right.  Everything they do.  Engineers are king and they have a deep respect for data.  And they look at the data before they do anything.  Apple is design driven  and in fact doesn't care about the data.  Because Steve always felt like the data is after the fact.  It's too late by then.  You can't ask a user what they want.  And so that is in a way two different.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Belief systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He says this is part writing clearly no one school of thought is right.  Apple and Google are both wildly successful and profitable  profitable companies that change the world.  Design focused companies tackle different kinds of problems  than data focused companies.  That's true also.  Design focused companies like Apple or Flipboard  will focus on creating revolutionary never before seen products  because, of course, data can't predict.  Data focused companies like Google have a better chance  at revolutionizing existing markets  because their products are better and more efficient.  I don't know if I would agree with that.  Here's another question for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this goes to some of the stories that come later.  But I think that's a good point.  It goes to some of the stories that come later.  But does the leader is always closed.  The second is and third as a defense go to open.  So Apple, even though may not be the biggest in size,  is the biggest in quality.  So it's very closed.  Google's response to that is be very open.  Search is number one.  It's very closed.  But other functions other people have are open.  Does that go anywhere?  Does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's throw.  I mean, not to sound like a total Google fan girl,  but let's not forget that Google was certainly way first  with voice interaction.  I mean, that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what Apple does.  Yeah, right.  They come along second and say,  Steve's a tweaker.  He's a tweaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, exactly. But Google rolls it out and says,  how are people using voice?  They've had Google voice out for four years now.  I mean, I'm surely they're using Google voice transcription data  to get better at transcription.  So they're using the data to very slowly improve the product  while we all make fun of what our Google voice transcripts  sound like. Right.  But then Apple comes along with much more polished product.  So this actually this is kind of like open first and then closed.  Jeff, which is what you were suggesting,  that it's OK, the other way around. Right. Right. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why I started getting my head around.  Right. So if you're Google, what's your strategy?  Again, Siri may not take over the world.  I thought that having a front and back camera on on the iPhone  would change human interaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I knew it wouldn't. I always knew that nobody wants a video call.  Nobody. You're right.  I was wrong. Maybe it happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if you're Google and if you do see a threat from Siri  and you say, you're right, Gina, well, we've had voice.  What should they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What should Google do now that Siri is out and is so much better?  Is that the question? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And not just that it's out and better, but OK, fine.  You make their voice better.  But then how do you get us to use it in ways that are integrated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think that I mean, you know, Apple sets the bar  for what people expect from voice interaction.  You know, you see those serious, serious commercial.  I haven't actually used Siri yet, but I'm dying to.  You see those Siri commercials and you're like, this is amazing.  Google's had voice commands forever. Google now, you know,  kind of Apple did the same thing with the iPhone.  And even though Schmidt says they started Android before the iPhone got released,  the iPhone got released and suddenly everyone's expectations  of what a touchscreen smartphone should be.  So in a way, Apple has done this with Siri, too, like Google voice commands  were cool and kind of nerdy and, you know, we would have our wives laugh at us  when we tried to use them. OK, I'm going to talk to the phone now.  Right. But now Apple has released Siri and it's really cool.  I've got this personal assistant that I talk to, you know, into my phone or whatever.  So Google now, you know, really has to has to kind of do what they do.  Right. Catch up and surpass with, you know, with the nerdy take,  you know, the nerdy improvements and then you know, you know,  OK, makes it human again.  All right. All right. Princess of the nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The developer bucket I was throw you in.  OK, so so how does if Google's going to play catch up here and play scale here,  they're going to have to open up the voice thing as an API.  True. Yes.  Yeah, that's how that's what Apple has to do, too.  They both have to. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you as a developer, how do you get the voice to work?  You're salivating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that there's there's huge potential for what you can do with voice.  I mean, how many articles have been written about like the funny things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that you can say to Siri and what the responses are?  I mean, people people love to delight in this stuff and not just the jokey.  You know, will you marry me, Siri?  You know, and you're getting a fun response from that.  I mean, opening up those APIs and having tons of developers being able to build  on top of those APIs, give Google an advantage that Apple won't have as much.  But I think that's the key.  Right.  So if you're going to go open, pursue it aggressively.  Open, open, open, open APIs.  Do it. Do it aggressively.  That's your best hope.  And you've also got to tie it to the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. If you want it, you want to give a command to your device.  Mm hmm.  But you can do that to your web browser.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you can't have it.  You can't have it.  You can't have it.  You can't have it.  You can't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't have it.  You can't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't have it.  But you can't have it call somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, right.  OK, some devices don't have a...  Add to your calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. What Google could do is really integrate like crazy into Docs and Calendar  and Plus and all that, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Absolutely.  Yeah. I mean, it'll be interesting.  I wonder if in a few years making a website will involve making not only a  touchscreen interface, which now making a website involves making a touch screen  interface, right, has to look good on an iPad or an Android device.  But making a website will also involve making a voice interface.  Wow. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say I now make all my appointments through Siri.  And when I can't, when I have to type it in, I get angry.  It's like, I don't want to do this.  It's too much of a pain in the ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You really do want to marry Siri.  You love it, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Think about this. You press the button.  You say, make an appointment for me Thursday at five to get the car washed.  And it does it.  That's so much easier than any other opening the calendar, going to the day,  blah, blah, blah.  I just forget as well as I am.  It's so much easier.  Wow. Curtis B has a very interesting point in the chat room.  He's saying, well, don't forget where Google makes its money is embedded ads  and search results that even if that's what I'm saying, even if Apple continues  to use Google, that's and they could say here's your search results.  But there's no ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Siri is not going to say what it's a voice response.  Siri is not going to say Google says, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or or Google does say Google says it cares.  It doesn't matter. Google, give them all the credit you want.  There's still no ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But when you ask Siri a question to get data back, there's a verbal response.  But there's also an on screen response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't yet. It doesn't yet read the for instance, Wolfram Alpha.  If you say what is the color blue, it shows a swatch of blue.  And it says from Wolfram Alpha.  If you say how many calories in a bagel, it shows the Wolfram Alpha search result.  They clearly licensed this from Wolfram Alpha.  By the way, brilliant.  Yes.  It's one of the most valuable features of Siri.  You know, I don't know.  We're in the flux here.  Of course, all of the people at this pub con who are who spent their last three  years trying to figure out how to optimize for search engine results are going, no,  please don't.  Google, please.  I just got my head around how to get my page in the search results.  So Google has a new algorithm.  We now have brand pages and Google Plus Scobel says Google screwed it up.  I'm inclined to agree.  We're going to talk about that in just a bit.  Gina Trapani, Jeff Jarvis.  We are talking about Google on this week in Google.  Before we go any further, though, let me talk about Ford a little bit.  We have sent out invites.  If you didn't get your invite to the barbecue we're doing on the weekend on this  Sunday and on December 4th, we got way we got hundreds and hundreds of requests.  I think we sent out 65 invites to both days.  I hope we'll see you at the barbecue.  It's going to be great fun.  I can't wait.  Sunday is our next one and we've got some really good food coming.  On the December 1st one, it's our first one.  With December 4th, we will not do a barbecue.  We realize the weather is likely to be pouring rain.  So we're going to just take it indoors just as an update on that one.  Either way, though, it's going to be fun.  You can watch Twitter, watch the game show and all that stuff.  Now let me talk about Ford a little bit.  Ford, of course, has some great speaking of voice technology.  Ford Sync, where you talk to your car.  It's amazing.  Your car now talks back to you, by the way, with the app link.  OpenBeak is the first to do this.  You could say, read me my tweets.  Read me my timeline.  Read me my replies and it will read them to you.  On some phones, you can it will read you your text messages, which is awesome.  This app link is very cool because Ford, I think I know this because Alan Malali,  the CEO, told me he said phones iterate much faster than we can iterate a car  design. So what we decided to do was tie into the smartphone.  So when new capabilities come to the smartphone, we can take advantage of them.  That's this app link API.  Brilliant.  MyFord Touch.  Did you see this?  250,000 MyFord Touch users are going to get a USB key in the mail.  They get in their car.  They plug it into the USB port.  It updates touch.  This is called 21st century automotive design and Ford is the absolute leader.  You can find out more about it at Ford.com slash technology.  Or better yet, go to your Ford dealer and ask to drive the new 2012 Fiesta with  AppLink, the 2012 Focus that turns into a Wi-Fi access spot.  So many cool things they are doing.  I'm just really thrilled to be associated with them.  We're really pleased to be partners with Ford in this because I think Ford is of  all the car companies right now, the most forward thinking, doing the most  interesting stuff.  And I'm just I just think they're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But polishing the blue oval.  I'm sorry.  The Ford is a Wi-Fi hotspot, right?  So you could just be parked around that when you're tailgating or something.  You're all online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have access.  They have WPA passwords.  So you're.  Yes, that's cool, though.  Oh, yeah.  Your car is an access point is hysterical.  Anyway, Ford.com slash technology.  Thank you, Ford, for supporting this week in Google.  So I immediately went yesterday.  I know Eileen did for all about Android.  You created a brand page.  I created a brand page.  A couple of problems.  Anybody anybody can create a brand page, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's a fake one up there right now.  I was hoping to get somebody from Google Plus.  Oh, good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Python support scripts is not going to help you.  So there's problem number one.  That's the official one.  Our official page.  It's only got one post on there because here's the other problem.  I registered it.  Only I can do anything with it.  That's the Scobel.  Scobel's comment.  And he's absolutely right.  He registered Rackspace quickly.  You know, you want to grab those brands, right?  But now he realizes he is the only guy who can post to the Google Plus Rackspace  brand page unless he gives his and I'm not going to give my Gmail credentials  to everybody in the company.  So we need some delegation capabilities.  I'm sure Google is going to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope they've got to.  We need other admins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really useless for me because I don't have time to post all the  twit stuff and there's no automated features either.  So there's no way I can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. The API is read only.  Right. So we can't auto post.  Right.  I was kind of disappointed with the pages rollout because we waited so long for it.  I thought this notion that it was there was going to be something special about how  you interact with it or how you know how you.  Is there anything different from a regular page?  Not not that I've seen.  I mean, you know, you add to the circles the same way.  There's no doesn't look like there's a way to verify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's auto follow.  If somebody circles you, you auto follow them.  If they uncircle you, you auto unfollow them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, if you turn that, I think you have to turn that on.  There's a drop down.  So when I go to my page,  my my Leo Laporte Google Plus page, because I own the twit page,  there's a drop down that says, which page do you want to use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. And you can post as that page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can post as twit. Took me a while to figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is the the scruble problem is he's going to screw up sometime and say  something that's going to get him before the SEC.  Right.  Boy, things are going great at Rackspace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And they're quiet.  Apparently, Vic has said we will have administration capabilities.  They're going to add that. But it seems like they should have had that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shouldn't they have rolled out with it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My real concern is the land grab.  Everybody's going to get all of our shows.  We are not going to control any of our show pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There has to be some sort of verification process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they're all big on you using your real name,  then that it follows automatically that you've got to have trust  in the brand name being real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there is. I've noticed on some brand pages,  like Pepsi and the ones at Google, there's a verified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. OK.  So that's just going to matter rolling that out.  But I'm not verified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Show me again. I don't think it's verified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that requires that they kill the non verified Pepsi pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See the little box next to twit?  That's all it says.  There is a checkbox on some try Pepsi plus Pepsi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, you're so right.  I was disappointed as they didn't think through what your relationship  with a business ought to be.  Yeah. See, there's a verify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I thought they were doing.  I was like, oh, they're going to do something different from Facebook.  You know, they're going to rethink how there's going to be some kind of twist  to the way that you interact.  They're going to know that there's a big difference between a company  and a person and those differences are going to come through  and how you interact. And I can't wait to see this.  And then it rolled out and I was kind of like, oh, this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It should be going after Doc Searle's vendor relationship management model  where suddenly you get a new chance to have a new relationship with the company.  They could have thought that through and really knew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently, apparently somebody in the chat room said this makes sense.  This is Google ish.  You can put a minute tag on your website to put the do the verification.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So you can tie it into your website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's going to not help me at all on the show pages  because they don't have dedicated websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, some folders dedicated to a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So somebody could make it and I'm sure has by now  because we have a very intrepid audience.  Has probably made a twig page,  but I don't have a twig site that I can verify it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, don't you have the slash pages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it has to be the TLD, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has to be the top level domain.  I don't know.  Well, we'll try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your TLD isn't necessarily a brand.  Yeah.  OK, well, it's a company page.  Is it a company page or a product page?  Does Procter & Gamble have one page or does it have 500 pages?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, apparently the way they want to do it with us  is there's a twig page  and there are not dedicated show pages  and Eileen and I conversed.  She said, can I create an all about Android page?  And I said, of course you can.  That's exactly what we should have  is every show should have its own page.  But we have no way of verifying those show pages as far as I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you are General Motors,  you're going to have, sorry for the example here,  but it's just because it's mobile.  No, that's good.  You're Ford and you're Lincoln Mercury.  Right.  And you're right.  Shouldn't you have more than one page?  That's obvious.  I'm trying to think of a better example.  I don't know.  Does Ford want to have a Mustang page?  Ford is a better example.  Ford should damn well, darn well,  want to have a Mustang page versus a tourist page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't looked into this deeply enough.  Maybe there's a way that you can do this verification  by postcard or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's General Motors right now,  verified and not verified.  Well, what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If I do plus General Motors,  do both pages show up?  Well, that's not what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let's go to the free speech end of it.  Now, if you want to do your,  I don't like General Motors,  I like Ford page,  should you have the right to do so?  Well, no, because the name has to be real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could make a General Motors page that has  as its logo, a Ford logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How much have we seen on Google Plus?  And I hate to say this out loud  because now it's going to happen.  But how much have we seen sock puppetry?  Are there other Leopold pages up there?  People try to be you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure there are, but I don't know.  There are on Facebook.  Despite Facebook's claim that they verify everything  and there's not much you could do about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's one other Leopold,  but it looks like somebody who genuinely has the name.  It's called Leopold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not an uncommon name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's sonorous.  It sounds good together.  Let's go to Plus this weekend.  What do you get?  Just now I'm worried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh-oh.  Well, here we go.  Here we go.  So we've got,  I just did a little Plus this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's this week in photo,  this week in marmalade.  Mentalist.  This week in,  this week in blackness,  this week in Chicago dance calendar.  I mean, I could do more searches,  but these are the pages.  That's interesting.  Oh, well, I don't, you know,  I think this is,  it's beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, always, right?  I'm still hung up on this idea of like treating,  treating people,  equating people and companies.  When I started to circle companies and brands,  I thought,  well, are these,  are these things going to be flagged differently in my circles?  Am I going to be able to see that,  And I thought what was really interesting was that the promo video  for Google pages was this like really cool,  friendly guy who runs this little bike shop  and wants to serve his customers and does hangouts.  And it focused on this one gentleman who seemed like a very  savvy business owner, right?  But the reality is that most big companies don't have just one person  behind them.  And, you know,  it's just,  there's a huge difference between businesses and people.  So, you know,  Google Plus is supposed to be all about people.  So it just surprised me that the,  that that brand and business pages are,  behave exactly like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, especially because this Google Direct Connect,  this new feature where you just plus brand name is supposed to  you know, you follow Toyota,  you type plus Toyota in the Google search box.  Yeah.  And then it goes right to the Google Plus page  and you hit enter and you're circled them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is me not being a Google fan girl.  That was such,  I'm Direct Connect really,  really disappointed me.  This feels like the marketing team beat out  the engineering team.  Like the fact that they,  that they stopped using the plus sign  as like a very common search operator  for years and years and years in order to do direct connection.  Direct Connect bummed me out.  Got to say what's true.  Yep.  Not happy.  I like you have to opt in,  right?  So this doesn't happen automatically.  You have to opt in that the first time that you do the plus  search,  it says,  hey, do you want to direct connect with brands this way?  And you can say no, thanks.  So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But everybody's going to say yes.  Why would you say no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you know,  I mean, that's convenient.  Right.  It's convenient.  But I still can't believe that they gave up the regular plus  search operator to,  to,  to do direct connect.  It's no longer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's no longer engineering driven.  It's very clear.  There's some marketing in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It felt like it really did feel like a shift to me.  I was like, oh, Google's,  Google's doing this is all about driving traffic to Google Plus  and less about serving sort of people who know how to search  the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know,  the other disappointment,  Gina,  fanboy now disappointed is,  is back to your prior point.  If they were going to make people and  companies exactly the same,  then why the hell didn't they let them in the plus from the beginning?  Right.  And just have it to be a data point.  Are you a person or are you a brand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well,  I mean, it seemed like they almost they didn't just didn't think about it.  The whole thing has just been strange.  I want to,  I want to believe that there's there are new features coming out for brand  pages and company pages,  you know,  differentiate them more.  But,  you know,  the whole thing has just been strange.  Google Plus launches.  Everyone starts to make brand pages.  They say, no, no, no, no, no, no,  don't do that.  Don't do that.  You know, they're coming.  They're coming.  And then they came out and OK,  they're functional,  but they don't do anything more than  Facebook pages do.  In fact, they do less because there's there's,  you know, very few administrative administrative  functions that Facebook pages have.  And I'm a big believer.  I really think that social media updates  for an organization or a brand are so much more effective when they're personal,  when they're signed by a human.  Right. So like Barack Obama tweets on the White House account  and it sees more responses,  you know,  when he signs it,  so it sees more responses than the White House has ever gotten.  Right.  Because they generally use it as sort of this like faceless voice of the institution.  Who wants to talk to a factotum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So when Eileen,  you know, says something in our page,  people respond to Eileen as a person.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.  So the Twig page, you know,  if Leo and you and I and Eileen could post to the Twig page  and have it clear who's saying what,  I mean, that would just that would make it a,  you know, much richer experience.  Oh, incredible.  It would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they say they're going to do that.  They've.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what they didn't do is ask companies  and ask us in public.  What they should do about,  you know,  We could have told them this right away.  Just ask what would Google do, Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's an obvious flaw.  Yeah.  Well, but OK,  now I'll make the argument the other direction,  but that is the kind of the ideas.  Publish, then iterate.  Publish, then iterate.  So.  This is Google's approach.  This is how they ask.  They do it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And then we go, ah!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  which they have, which they have been doing.  Presumably they will iterate.  Yeah.  But there's going to be this interim

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  where there are a lot of phony pages created  and I don't think they really understand the onslaught  and the difficulty they're going to have  in validating these pages.  It's going to be a nightmare for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have this fantasy that,  of course, which is absolutely untrue,  but that there's a conference room  somewhere at Google  and there are 10 people sitting around  watching the show right now saying,  Oh, I thought of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's true.  I think that's true.  in fact,  I met a guy who does the Portuguese  localization of Matt Cutts work  and he works out of Dublin.  And he said, I just want you to know,  everybody in Dublin watches.  Hello Dublin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi Dublin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So no, I think that they do pay attention.  So who knows.  New algorithm for  search to make it more timely.  Would you explain this to me and Jeff,  Gina?  Because I think you probably understand it.  Maybe Jeff. I don't know.  I don't understand it.  Gina, you go.  You go.  So the problem is stale results, right?  At cobweb pages,  you get a result that of a page that isn't,  that's no longer up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about earlier, right?  That expectations about search are changing.  When you have services like Facebook and Twitter,  you expect your results to be totally real time.  And there for a while,  Google had that deal where real time  research results from Twitter were embedded inside.  I loved that.  Of the results.  And that deal came to an end,  so it's not happening anymore.  So it looks like this is,  I mean, Google changes their search algorithm  constantly and tweaking,  but they're concentrating on getting results  to be more real time.  And now this is an area where it's not easy  for other folks to compete as well as Google, right?  Like this is Google's competitive edge.  So they've got the scale  and the capability to do this kind of thing.  So yeah,  I mean, it's just a matter of getting fresher content  up faster.  Nothing very technical about it.  I mean, certainly a lot of very,  very technical stuff behind it,  but for the users,  from the user perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there's another angle here,  which is that there's a new pressure  to do this,  which is sharing as the new means  of discovery and distribution.  Your shared stuff is going to be much, much fresher.  Right.  And so the things you're going to learn  from Twitter and Facebook  and whatever these means are through sharing  are going to make the search results look staler.  But the problem then becomes,  you go to the other problem,  is that I don't want just the freshest stuff.  I want the canonical pages.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  That's a good point.  So the Wikipedia pages  and the IMDB pages,  those pages that are just,  you know we're up to date  and you know they're authoritative by nature.  But that's a really good point  they made, Jeff.  This is part of the plusification  of everything, right?  There's this added pressure to share.  So there's this pressure as a publisher  to be on Google+,  to be in lots of circles,  to verify your account  so that it shows up for your name  and that your name shows up.  And when you share links,  it shows up that you shared them  for people who are following you.  And so this is kind of,  this is another pressure  on folks who are concerned  about things like SEO.  Get your stuff shared.  Your stuff is more interesting  and more authoritative  if other people have shared it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So how is it working?  Any feedback on,  I mean I just searched for Jeff Jarvis.  Search result number one was Buzz Machine,  as it should be.  Then About Me on Buzz Machine.  Then your Wikipedia entry  and then your Twitter account.  I mean this looks the same.  I don't see,  maybe Jeff isn't the best example.  What if...  I'm boring.  I don't do anything.  Yeah.  Let's do,  what's timely?  Oh, Kim Kardashian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know where your mind is, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a calculator on the web  that says,  you put how long,  when you got married,  it tells you how many Kardashians.  I've been married for 142 Kardashians.  Okay, so first result,  I think this is not new.  News for Kim Kardashian.  That's not new, right?  That's always been there.  I don't see,  I don't know how this is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What would be talked about on blogs and such?  Something timely and topical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean one of their examples is like Occupy Oakland,  for example.  Okay, there you go.  Like a news event.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or Steve Jobs.  So let's do a search,  Eileen, for Occupy Oakland.  I don't know.  Is that going to...  Yeah, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do we get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's more,  yeah, okay, so in the news,  of course, that's always going to be up to date.  Then the ABC News link,  that's pretty recent.  So they're using a new crawler.  There's Jon Stewart,  that's good.  They're using a new...  But that's four days old,  six days old,  six days ago,  one day ago,  three hours ago.  They're using this new spider called caffeine,  I love the name,  that continually crawls a site.  Although I have to say,  I don't know if you've ever seen a spider  that crawls a site.  I look on my logs for our sites.  Google's almost always,  there's always three or four Google bots  on our site all the time.  So I don't know how that's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like this also works well  for recurring events,  so like presidential election,  for example.  You're not going to want the Wikipedia page  for presidential election.  You don't want the most recent election.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is...  to say people are looking  for fresher results,  Ergo will give them fresher results,  they're looking for more long-lasting results,  we'll give them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it says this change impacts  almost 35% of search results.  That's interesting.  I don't know that this is something  that you can see.  I mean, they're not marking,  you know, hey, this is the new category.  Joe Paterno, look for Joe Paterno.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a really good...  Well, once again,  what is this new SEO strategy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, all that SEO strategy  is going, whoop,  out the window  and becomes a social strategy.  Right.  You want to rise up,  you better be talked about,  or else you ain't going to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  See, those canonical sites  like his Penn State page,  his Wikipedia page,  those still are very high.  In fact, they're number one  and number two right after news.  Then images.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That also may be because people say,  who is this guy again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now seven hours ago,  six hours ago,  two hours ago,  seven hours ago,  one day ago.  So now all the rest of these results  are in fact the latest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you really want to try to look up  Joe Paterno's, you know,  win record and that kind of stuff,  once again, if it's Wikipedia,  you have to go through a lot of pages on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  before you get back to the football.  I think his Wikipedia  was the third result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I know what I'm saying is,  if you wanted to read sports stories about him  rather than scandal stories about him,  how many pages do you have to go on Paterno?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a very good point.  Yeah, I mean,  and Joe Paternos of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's not a good...  Maybe the end of his tenure there  and it may be the big story of the moment,  but is it representative of Joe Paterno  canonically as a topic?  I mean, it's not a football.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right, no, it isn't.  He's...  Go ahead.  At the bottom of the blog post,  the Google clarifies that 35% of searches  will have at least one result affected by this change,  but only 6 to 10 will be like noticeably different.  So Paterno is probably noticeably different.  But, you know, a year from now,  the results for Joe Paterno should be much different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's hope so.  Because they not only make them more up to date now,  but continue to improve.  Right.  The next break is Mark Zuckerberg  underestimating Google.  Bradley Horowitz says he's delighted  to be underestimated.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  We're talking about Google.  This week in Google with Gina Trapani  from SmarterWear.org and ThinkUpApp.com,  life hacker founder and, of course, Jeff Jarvis,  the author of Public Parts, brand new,  from...  I almost said Simon Schuster.  It is.  It is Simon Schuster.  Yes.  How is Mr. Simon and Mr. Schuster?  How are they doing these days?  I think they're doing very well.  Nothing much on the up-to-date  Google search results on Mr. Simon and Mr. Schuster.  No.  Not many changes of late.  I want to talk about Squarespace.com,  the secret behind high-quality websites.  And notice I say websites, not just blogs.  Great for a blog, but for any kind of website.  Squarespace.com has the best...  You know, usually almost everybody  has a website builder, you know.  But usually the trade-off is easy to use,  crappy websites.  They look like everybody else.  Squarespace has...  It's all about the software.  It's web hosting, plus this exceptional software.  So, yeah, sure, other web hosts have  site-building software.  Don't confuse that with this.  This is optimized for creating  and managing a website that looks unique,  that looks brilliant for both beginners and experts.  If you know CSS and JavaScript,  there's nothing you can't do.  You get hundreds of design templates  to choose from, completely customizable.  And if you're a beginner, you could use your mouse  to drag, drop, slide.  There are iPhone, iPad, and Android apps  for updating your site on the go.  You know, I'm really pleased that the Android app  has the full feature set of the iOS app.  It came later, but they duplicated it,  and I think that's great.  That means you can do blog comments,  you know, kill spam, see your stats,  all of that stuff.  They've got a great special support team  to give you help 24 hours a day,  seven days a week.  And the modules that come with this service,  so you pay for hosting, plus this software,  include the blog module, which will import and export  WordPress, Blogger, Movable, Type, and Type-Ad.  Did I say import and export?  Very important.  The form builder for collecting email addresses  and other information.  The Flickr photo widget, the Twitter widget,  the social media buttons, Google Maps integration.  Website tracking with the best built-in  search engine optimization.  Permissions access handling.  They did what Google Plus didn't do.  You can have many authors on your blog.  They support it all.  I just want you to check it out.  Go to squarespace.com.  There's a trial offer.  You just click that big green button.  You don't need a credit card.  Literally, just two weeks.  You try everything 100%.  And if you'd like 20% off your new account  for six months, use the offer code TWIG11.  We're in November, so.  TWIG11, T-W-I-G-1-1.  And you'll get 20% off, 20% off for the next six months.  I love Squarespace.  We use it for our own Inside.twit.tv blog.  You know what we did the other day?  It was on Twitter.  I said, everybody watching, try to bring down  our Inside Twit blog.  We will bring down any site because  there's thousands of people watching.  They will all go there.  They will bring it down just by going there.  And we were not able to bring it down.  You can't bring down a Squarespace site.  I don't care.  You cannot twit it.  We put our This Week in Twitch show there,  which is a, Lisa Kensel, our CEO,  and I talk about what's going on with Twitch.  I don't know what we're doing there.  We also.  It looks like you're killing flies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is my next post.  How to kill flies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, our staff is so innovative.  They have brought in Venus fly traps  and pitcher plants.  And it's working.  It is working.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All natural, baby.  We had a fly infestation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't seen a fly all day.  And we actually shine a light through the Venus fly trap  and you can see a fly inside.  Oh, that's awesome.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had that weird tape.  We were using fly paper.  That killed a bunch because there's some  gross flies on the tape.  I think we can throw away the fly paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is organic.  It's natural.  It improves the CEO.  I'm sorry.  The CEO and the CO2.  It certainly improves my disposition.  Anyway, that's a Squarespace site.  If you want to take a look at it,  go ahead, try and bring it.  Try to bring it down.  Squarespace.com use the offer code  twig11 for 20% off.  I did not.  I was traveling so I wasn't able to see  the Charlie Rose interview with Zuck and Cheryl.  How was that?  I didn't get to watch it either.  I read the stories about it.  It is online now so you can see it in full.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't get to watch the whole thing.  I started to watch it.  I was really happy that he had both  Mark and Cheryl on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody said that Cheryl really  felt like adult supervision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Call it like you see it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eileen, you saw that.  I would disagree.  I actually thought that they looked like  they were more compatible working together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're clearly a great team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think that if you watch the interview,  they seem to...  It seems like they think I die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't plead each other's sentences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unlike the last video which I saw a couple  months ago with Schmidt and Page on stage,  it really still felt like he was doing  apparent supervision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It could be just me,  but I really felt that.  I felt a little more like they were working together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's on YouTube so I'll have to go see it.  Now, one of the things apparently that  Zuck said in that interview was that he felt  like Google was trying to build its own  little Facebook.  I don't think he said it like that.  That was cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Slightly condescending.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google is trying to build a little Facebook.  I don't think he said it like that,  but anyway.  Bradley Horowitz says,  I'm delighted to be underestimated.  Bradley, of course,  the VP of product.  As they say on Family Feud,  good answer.  Good answer, Brad.  He rejected comparisons between Google,  Facebook, and other social networks as  being little more than fodder to give  the media advertising and click-throughs  with the Google man insisting the company  is focusing...  Who wrote this?  This is from The Next Web.  I'm reading somebody's writing here.  I'm not quite understanding it.  Google, the company is focused on  making its services better and not  watching the competition.  Yeah, right.  It's just chance that it looks exactly like Facebook.  It's just chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to say,  Zuck kind of earned the ability  to make that statement.  I mean, come on.  Google Plus is...  Google is clearly playing catch up  with Facebook, with Google Plus.  Even Steven Levy in the Plex described  how they had that panic moment  of like, oh crap,  Facebook's doing something really important  and if we don't do something about it soon,  we're going to be left in the dust.  Yeah, and of course,  I think Bradley's response was appropriate,  but I find the whole thing really amusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's Charlie Rose in this pink tie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you're right, Gina, too,  is that Zuckerberg's been saying  that every business is going to become social  and I guess the extent of that is even Google.  Right.  Games, music, news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The question is, can they?  The question is, can they do it and survive?  Can they make that pivot?  It's a pivot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we were just talking about it a minute ago.  That's where they're changing search.  By being fresher,  search is in fact more social.  How do they know it's fresh and hot?  Social.  Sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Yup.  Zuck also said that Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft  collect data behind your back.  On the other hand,  we collect data right in your face.  I do.  He says, but I have to say,  I admire Zuck for not saying,  Google stole our ideas  and we're going thermal nuclear war on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's had a little trouble talking about that.  He was to avoid that line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he learned the lesson.  He downplays the notion  that Facebook's at war with Apple, Google, and Microsoft.  He took some nice little shots,  but mostly I think his message  was the message that Facebook paid those PR people  to spread, which is that it's not just us collecting data.  Everybody else is collecting data.  In fact, he says that they're collecting more data  and behind your back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Zuckerberg's been saying to me,  what he said to me when I interviewed him  was, when you get a Green Day ad on your page,  you know it's because you said you like Green Day.  There's nothing mysterious about that  and that these are things that you're doing for your life.  Whereas everybody else,  that he created an application that does that  because you want to do it,  whereas everybody else is kind of getting it on the sly  because it's not part of what you're really doing.  It is a byproduct,  whereas at Facebook, it is the real product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He also says that Facebook gives you more control  and he acknowledges that's very important.  I think it's truer now than it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  He says that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sheryl Sandberg said that it's like caller ID.  Remember when caller ID came out,  people were up in arms,  they said it was a violation of the caller's privacy  that they have their numbers revealed.  It's now mainstream and it's expected.  And she says, so people get used to it.  She says people get used to it.  Does that seem a reasonable thing?  I think that actually does seem reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good metaphor,  but you know what?  Prank calls don't happen the way that they used to  since it's a caller ID.  People change their behavior about how they use the phone  for the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't it annoy the hell out of you  when people block their caller ID?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I hate it.  It's like I want to know.  You want to know.  I pick up the phone differently depending on  whether or not I know who it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I presume that there,  it's not somebody I want to talk to.  Unfortunately, one of my wife's best friends  has blocked her caller ID.  So I see caller unavailable.  I go, oh, it's Michelle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I have that one person in my life  who, you know, one person who's blocked.  I know who this is.  I won't let them tell anybody.  Well, I think that Cheryl's point was a good one.  I don't think that saying Facebook collecting data  about you is as harmless as caller ID  because of that behavioral change.  I think that people are still learning  that when they say, oh yeah, I like Green Day,  that they're not just sort of saying I like Green Day.  Yes.  They're providing a signal to Facebook,  give me Green Day.  Right.  And I think that there's a difference.  There's a difference between, you know,  just having a thought and publishing a thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you think users know that that like button is,  that's not just telling Green Day I like you,  but they know that that's telling Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think our audience does.  Our audience does.  But you know, sometimes I'm reading an article.  I'm like, oh, this is a great article.  And I just, I go to hit the like button and I'm like,  oh, you know, this is going to show up in my stream.  everyone's going to think that I agree  with everything the author said.  And I think, I think twice about it because I realize  what the implications are,  but I think it's just so easy to just say,  oh yeah, you know, I like this.  And then suddenly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that changes too with the verb,  you know, changing from like to reading.  Yes.  Which is what they're trying to do too,  There was the Washington, was the Washington Post  or the, the Washington Post or NPR,  I always get their knickers and nuts about this,  scolded a journalist for retweeting something  when they should have shown that they didn't agree  or something.  So someone was proposing a new notion,  which I don't much like,  that we have RT, we have MT, modified tweet,  and the next one was NT, neutral tweet, retweet.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, like I just think this is interesting  and you should see it,  but I don't necessarily agree or disagree or endorse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And basically it should be, it should be DFBT,  not a defy me tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh boy.  There should also be like CYA tweets, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, better, better, you win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Required tweet.  Yeah, the boss is looking.  Rose asked Zuckerberg when Facebook would hit  a billion users, Zuck said,  if we do well, end of 2012.  Yikes.  Wow.  That's a significant number.  He said one of the ways that will happen is through China.  Danger, danger, Will Robinson.  Sandberg said you can't connect the whole world  and not connect China,  but because of the restrictions of China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're trying to get us ready for whatever compromises  they're about to make.  Oh, that's interesting.  You're right.  And this is, this is, I mean, this is planned PR  and they're going to start.  Exactly.  They've got to go through the Google territory now with China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the way things are going in China,  they're going to have to make a lot of compromises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's a real problem.  Yep.  the problem Google made was  they made different rules in China.  Right.  And they thus violated their principles.  So Facebook, in my mind,  had better hold the principles here.  And if it treats China differently than it treats the rest of the world,  then what are their damn principles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if China requires that someone provides  their identification card in order to sign up for Facebook,  with micro blogging services in China right now,  where you have to provide your identification cards  so that they associate every single account with a real person,  do you think that that's a reasonable or unreasonable compromise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's really interesting, Gina,  because basically that's kind of what Google's doing.  That's what Google's doing.  Google was great with Google Plus.  It's true.  Papers, papers, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where are your papers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's a problem, don't you, Gina?  I mean, that's the whole real name thing.  Yeah, but I don't think Facebook's going to have a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think they'll agree to that.  You know, and this will just be a matter of making sure they really do it.  All right, well, here's the next thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the next thing, which I got a problem with that,  but fine, let's say that they, oops, darkness,  Facebook's a bad job.  So the next thing is,  what's Facebook's policy on handing over your private stuff?  Well, that's the thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, right.  Once the identification card is provided,  then the government has the ability to see  and verify everything that you publish.  Facebook says...  Oh, no, no, no, they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not if you haven't befriended them  and you've made everything private to somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Facebook says we comply with the local laws in every region.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, but here in the U.S.  that means subpoenas and it means that it's,  we hope, discoverable.  What if China says, no,  we just going to have to read everybody's stuff?  We get to read everybody's stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and we get to delete the stuff that we don't like.  I mean, that's the next step.  That's the next step, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How far will Facebook go?  What are their real principles?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All I know is I can get porn on my Google TV.  It's a little bit...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was thinking Jobs is just in his grave.  He's just spinning in his grave.  He's just spinning in his grave.  I'm still waiting for the update

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to my Logitech review to Honeycomb.  I'm really excited about that every day, every night.  I reconnected it and every night I go, settings, no update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Me too, me too.  Although Matt Howey posted a photo of his Sony unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the Sony's happening, so...  Jobs is smiling about something else today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, victory.  Adobe has decided that they will no longer support  Flash in the mobile environment.  So not just iOS, but across the board.  You know, it never worked well on Android.  So they said...  And it's actually a victory for not just Jobs,  I think, but for HTML5.  Oh, yeah.  They said straight out, it's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Growing up points to them for saying it.  Yep.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but there's definitely, and I told you so,  coming from beyond the grave, that's for sure.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he did the right thing.  I think it was right to do that,  and I'm glad Adobe finally let it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that what you said at the time, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Was.  I did support that, because Flash is,  first of all, a major security problem,  but mostly it's a pig.  Yeah, that's true.  And what I said, I believe,  and we should go back and look at the tape,  but what I believe I said was,  this is going to be good, we're going to get rid of Flash.  It doesn't belong on the...  I don't like Flash in general.  It reduces accessibility on websites.  It makes, I think it's not an asset on a website,  and HTML5 is available.  There are better solutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it makes things less searchable.  Now Silverlight is also getting some bad signals too, right?  Never liked that either, but I don't know.  There was also news about that today too.  I can't remember what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't remember either, but Microsoft is all in on Silverlight,  so I think that that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I heard that there was some lack of support on Silverlight.  Let's see if this new, fresh Google search works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's do a fresh search on that.  It helps if I spell it Silverlight.  How about the Nook tablet and the Fire?  We're going to get those next week.  Amazon's Fire comes out November, what, 15th?  And then, and the following that,  the Nook tablet comes out November 17th.  It will be 50 bucks more.  They're touting the fact that it has twice the memory, twice the speed.  Will anybody even notice?  Will anybody even care?  If you can get Amazon for 50 bucks less,  don't you think you're going to do that?  I think that Barnes & Noble's got a challenge here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I haven't seen enough about the Nook.  Does it have more of Android in it?  No, it's the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's basically the same,  but you're buying it from B&N, not Amazon.  We have breaking news from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Breaking news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not really breaking news.  Tom Merritt, ladies and gentlemen of TNT Tech News Today,  which...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Silverlight 5 will be the last Silverlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Holy cow.  That was the story.  Holy cow.  Microsoft was equivocating at their last conference.  They were over Silverlight.  They didn't want to say about Windows 8 and Silverlight,  so now we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a developer, I just love to see how mobile devices  and smaller screens are affecting decisions about web design  and about the way that we make the web simplifying design  and also getting us back to the place where we're trying  to preserve CPU cycles and preserve memory.  Those constraints, I think, are actually a really good thing.  Yeah.  Cut out hogs like Flash and Silverlight, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Moving fast because we want to get a few more headlines in  and we got to get going for TNT.  Eric Schmidt responds to the Jobs book saying,  I've decided not to comment on what's been written  in a book after his death.  According to Reuters,  Steve is a fantastic human being and someone who I miss very dearly.  As a general comment, I think most people would agree,  Google is a great innovator and I would also point out  that the Android effort started before the iPhone effort.  So that is his response to...  A game of last word, yes.  Yeah.  I guess he does have the last word on that.  What about fact check?  Is that the case?  I mean, the Open Mobile Alliance,  the Android pre-Google Android certainly predates iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But there's no way to tell how much the iPhone did  or didn't affect what Android is today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The first Google phone...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was released.  They shipped before.  Before?  Well, the iPhone came out.  Yeah, the iPhone came out before the first Android.  Oh, sure.  So there's no way to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember getting the G1.  The G1 was very disappointing.  It was.  It had a slide-out keyboard.  It was a break.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I remember that Colleen,  who's a big Google fan girl and ended up going to Google, of course,  did not like the iPhone.  I had the iPhone, original iPhone,  and she said, no, wait till November, wait till November,  wait till the Google phone comes out.  So I don't know.  I think that the fact check on what Eric said  may hold differently.  That may be the last word.  Let's see what else.  There's a new activity tab on Twitter.  If you go to your Twitter webpage, you'll see activity.  Looks a little bit like, in fact, exactly like  the Facebook activity stream.  Favorites, follows,  and tweets from people you follow.  So look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it exposes interesting.  You can see who your friends have recently followed  and favorited.  It exposes more activity on Twitter, which I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that.  I think that's useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's also the right area over here, too, activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, my friends, we're going to get to our...  I'll give you one chance,  because I know you all have pet stories  before we get to our tool tip and number of the week.  Last thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to have a lot of drunk readers,  so I have to mention that there's a Chipotle nutrition calculator online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can Chipotle responsibly and healthily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And somebody went after me saying,  oh, watch out Jarvis,  but I don't have the barbacoa.  I just have the veggie with black beans and lights.  And the new brown lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nutritionix.com slash Chipotle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The barbacoa is so good, though, Jeff.  Is it really fattening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it really bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think anything called barbacoa is going to be pretty bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why?  It's just barbacoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I already got my Glee review in in the pre-show,  so I'm good.  But I had to say Glee at least once.  If you didn't see last night's Glee episode, then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't.  It's the sex episode, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The sex episode, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Parental guidance suggested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, parental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe that's what they meant on my Google TV.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, that porn app, by the way, is not an Android app.  It's just a Google TV optimized website.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No way anybody could stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Exactly.  And no one wants to watch porn on their TV anyway.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know what to say.  That's all a pause here, Gina.  I just, I'm thinking.  I don't know what that means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I expected something from you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying to think what that means.  I don't know what that means.  I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on, you want it on a smaller screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Some people want it on a bigger screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually an age thing, Gina,  because back in the day we didn't have small screen.  I think size doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I've been told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You had to get the VCR, lock yourself in the den.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Back in the real day, which I didn't have the courage to do,  you had a really big screen.  You had to go to a movie theater.  Yeah.  In a raincoat.  How strange is that?  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't think porn really took off  until you could get it at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to live across from Brooklyn Heights.  I lived by one and I'd sit in the McDonald's  and watch the guys skulk in across the street.  And it was just so...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It required a level of shamelessness.  Which is no longer required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Exactly.  Leo, have you ever thought of doing this week in porn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, we had Eric Ries on  the author of The Lean Startup the other day,  which I thought was great.  That was a really good interview.  He's really interesting.  One of the things he said is,  you know, entrepreneurs don't go for the money.  If you're in it for the money,  just cut to the chase and do porn.  You know, you want to make money fast, do porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not true anymore  because abundance has hit porn.  Porn was a scarcity market.  Because only so many people would stop and...  Right.  Now everybody's doing it.  ...due themselves.  Now there's no shortage of people who will take their clothes off.  Not that I know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's go to the tip and the number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry that I started this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And now Gina Trippani and her tip of the week.  Nice tips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm glad Gina started it, not me.  I went too far, but Gina started it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look, the fact that I can embarrass you too,  I keep it on lock, okay?  That's all I'm saying.  Let's talk about something really innocuous.  Google Calendar.  This is a really good productivity tip.  If you and your friends and your coworkers all use Google Calendar  and you have the pleasure of scheduling a meeting  with lots of attendees,  when you enter their names,  Google Calendar will now suggest good times  where everybody is free.  So there's a little suggested times link in the attendee list.  This is really awesome  because it's always hard to find a time when everyone's free.  The only bad thing is everybody has to be using Google Calendar  or in order for this to work.  So this works really well for Google Apps users  who your whole company is on Google Apps  or I don't know, your softball team  or whatever is all using Google Calendar.  But you'll see that suggested times link  underneath the attendees list  when you create a new meeting or event  with multiple attendees in Google Calendar.  And there's no porn involved.  None at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  None.  Zip.  What's going to happen is when the company fires people,  you're going to see somebody still show up there  and be sad every time.  I would have invited them, but I can't now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm free all day, every day now.  Suggested time, anytime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff, your tip of, I'm sorry, your number of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not terribly momentous,  but CrowdScience, this on ZDNet,  put out a study of people liking things  and they say that one in ten Facebook users  have liked wall post pictures, comments, et cetera,  I thought it'd be close to 100%.  Yeah, 60% of wall posts, 60% pictures,  60% comments, 12% videos and so on.  The other was why do they do it?  28% show support,  28% enjoyed what was being said or shown,  14% liked the brand,  which actually I think they should be pretty happy about  that that's high up,  10% keep me informed about the brand,  7% informed friends about the brand,  that all amazes me,  then get discounts and get a sweepstakes.  So nothing momentous there,  but I found that the low number on liking  was kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to mention as my tool of the week,  Google Authenticator.  We've talked about this before.  It's an app for Android  and iPhone has a version as well.  You run the app and it will give you a token.  And now, of course, in order to use Google Authenticator,  you have to have a site that does  what we call two-factor authentication,  a password plus the token.  By having it in your cell phone,  somebody, in order to crack that account,  would have to know your password  and have your phone itself,  which is, I think,  a really good secondary form of authentication.  And the tool I use for password authentication,  LastPass, has just added that in its update,  so that if you use LastPass,  you're definitely going to want to use  Google Authenticator.  It used to be you had to have your own  authentication program running on a USB key.  Now you just have it on your phone.  So a really good way to secure  LastPass and all your passwords,  Google Authenticator,  it's free from Google, iPhone, and Android.  And no, Eric Schmidt is not the tool of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That LastPass tip is a really good one, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Isn't LastPass great? I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  LastPass is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And adding second-factor authentication  through Google Authenticator is fantastic.  Yep.  LastPass has both free and paid versions.  A paid version is a buck a month.  Worth getting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, totally worth it.  I paid for it, just for the mobile app.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina Trippani is at SmarterWear.org.  That's her blog. You got to read it every day.  She does a lot of great stuff.  And of course she works on this amazing ThinkUp app,  which is being used more and more by people.  Did you see that Steve Martin  is putting out a book of his tweets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you're the enabler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm excited.  The book of tweets is going to include replies.  And yes, there was a point at which  I was explaining to him how to get to the CVS file,  the CSV file.  And so yeah, I think ThinkUp helped him out with that.  So I'm excited about that.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When he said,  he asked me,  I said, I need a way to collate my tweets and replies  because I'm thinking maybe a book.  This was a long time ago.  And I said,  well, let's get you together with Gina and ThinkUp.  And so he's got a ThinkUp account for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you hooked me up.  Yeah, he has great data, incredible charts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I expect there'll be an acknowledgement  for you in the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would expect.  I hope so.  That'd be exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's neat.  And his tweets are hysterical,  so I think it'll be a great book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're his gateway to the tweeter.  And of course,  don't forget Jeff Jarvis at BuzzMachine.com  and his book is Public Parts You Must Get It.  It's in better bookstores everywhere.  And a really interesting discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But not in airports,  which pieces me off.  So people, when you go to an airport,  do me a favor, ask for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  You mean all airports or some?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because they're bozos who do airport deals.  if my friends all ask for it in airports,  is that a good thing?  And they said, yes.  So harass them.  OK, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm going to take my attention to that.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you, Gina.  Thank you all for being here.  We do this show at 1 p.m. Pacific,  4 p.m. Eastern Time at twit.tv  so you can watch live.  And 1 p.m. Pacific is now 2100 UTC.  Eileen Rivera, our producer.
