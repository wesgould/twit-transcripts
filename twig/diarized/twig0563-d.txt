It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we cover very little Google.  I'm just going to try that, you know, I'm warning you.  There won't be any Google.  No, there will actually.  There's a lot of Google this week.  But there's a lot of Google.  Let's do whatever we want because it's our show.  We get to do that.  Jeff Jarvis is here.  He is the...  Oh no.  Rate my Skype room 10 out of 10.  The new top professor for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.  All credit to my wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  She was very happy and very proud.  Really?  She won.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is her decor.  Oh, are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not yours.  So all those pictures over that way, right?  I got...  He complained a little bit.  He's brought a few large pieces.  Yeah.  But I'm quite fond of what she put together there.  That includes two incunabula,  pages from very early books,  a few statues of Gutenberg,  a big image of an ink factory.  It's all very Gutenbergian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very fancy.  Very fancy.  Yeah.  He said, rate my Skype room as a Twitter account.  And he said, yeah, that was the one flaw.  Although he gave you 10 out of 10.  So that ain't much of a flaw.  But he gave you one...  Let's see. Let me pull it up here.  He said, books, depth, chairs, French doors,  would prefer one to two big pieces on left.  He feels like that's not balanced, I guess.  But I quibble.  10 out of 10, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty good for the Lenny Tau Professor  for Journalistic Innovation at the Craig No-Mark Graduate  School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Pretty, pretty...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm retiring now because my life is complete.  I've done it all.  Once I hit my Skype room, rate my Skype room, that's it.  I need work no more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As we mentioned last week, Stacey has the week off.  I'm so pleased to have Ant Pruitt with us though.  Yay, from Hands On Photography, Hands On Wellness,  his latest show.  Good to see you, Ant.  Yes, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You too, Mr. Laporte and Mr. Jarvis.  Something's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Something's different.  I can't put my finger on it.  Did you just shave your head?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's gotten tenure at the University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did give myself a haircut the other day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you do me?  I don't want to see you bald, Jeff.  Actually, we saw you bald.  You shaved your head like I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  I just shaved my face.  I was not stupid enough to shave my head like you did.  Yeah.  I goaded you into it, as I recall.  Did you?  Is it your fault?  Good, I can blame you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was for charity.  We raised money for UNICEF.  I took a tattoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might have been my fault too.  I don't know, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The hair grew back.  It's all for the good.  It's all for the good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's still there.  Oh.  I guess I should put some Google in here.  Just to...  Just to...  Just to prove them wrong.  So, you know, it's funny,  because it's all perspective.  According to IDC, Google shipped  7.2 million Google Pixel phones in 2019.  Which sounds, you know,  that's like less than one week of iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say, that's not very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds not so good, and yet...  It's, I think, more than they've ever sold before.  Google considers it a cause to celebrate.  It's more than one plus cell sold.  Credit to the 3A, which was, of course,  the low-priced version of the Pixel 3.  And of course, we haven't seen the 4A yet this year.  Google's probably not gonna release that  until next month, according to rumors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's the thing about those numbers are,  it's the 3A.  You know, that's the perfect price point for someone  trying to get into a clean, air quotes,  clean version of Android,  and good enough hardware at the time.  It's not gonna be flagship style,  but it's still gonna be good enough for most people.  So yeah, they should be able to sell those phones,  but in the bigger scheme of things,  it's still a little bit disappointing.  Just a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It is the best year Google's ever had  with its own house-made handsets.  52% up over 2018, the year previous.  So I guess it is cause for celebration, but it's...  Didn't Google get rid of the Pixel people?  Yeah, I think, I feel like they might have.  They were very unhappy with sales the year before.  It was a terrible year.  It does, it's dwarfed by Samsung and Apple,  but maybe Google, I don't know what,  we never knew what Google's ambitions were in this.  What, were they trying to beat Apple and Samsung?  Surely not.  Were they trying to create a phone  that showed the best of Android?  Possibly.  It used to be the Nexus line  was a low-cost phone for developers.  That's clearly not true with Pixel,  although I agree with you, Ann.  I think the less expensive phone is the best buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love my 3A XL.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love it, love it.  It still bugs me that their flagship versions  just don't ever quite live up  because you just gave out three different points.  And I would lean that point too,  is what they were trying to do  is more so of competing with the Apples and Samsung  as far as flagship devices,  because why in the heck would they price these things  as a thousand dollars a pop?  And that's flagship, right?  Size and these things, they just don't quite live up to it.  I appreciate good old Uncle Leo  hooking me up with this here Pixel 4 XL,  but this thing is not worth the money  that Uncle Leo paid for.  What don't you like about it?  That is not much of a difference from my Pixel,  from the Pixel 3, or even heck, my son's Pixel 2  that he's using.  It's not much different from a user standpoint.  The cameras-  Sure your son would trade with you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he would, he would.  But the thing is, if we did trade,  I wouldn't see much of a difference performance wise,  other than if I wanted to go out  and shoot something with the camera.  But just regular swiping through,  it is not that much of a difference  and it's clearly not worth that money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We will be able to put Android 11 on it,  apparently today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll leave that to Mr. Howe.  He likes breaking phones.  Yeah, I'm not gonna do it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Not gonna do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nah, I got that.  This from the Android Developers blog,  the Android 11 beta available now.  I don't know if that's the public beta or the developer.  Hasn't the developer beta been out for a while?  Also-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, the developer preview's already been out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so this must be the public beta.  Let me see if I can, should I do it?  No.  Should I do it?  Come on.  You can, yeah, if you don't-  Jason, read the blog.  Jason's your mic.  You should read the blog.  I should read the blog, I should.  So all you have to do is you have to say  what your eligible phone is.  Go ahead.  Let's see.  Oh boy, this is worse than last year.  If you install a beta version,  you will not be able to unenroll and revert back  to a lower public release of Android  without wiping all locally saved data on your device.  You may also encounter issues restoring a backup.  Sign me up to receive program updates.  I'm a developer, no.  I agree to the terms of the beta program, yes.  I'm gonna do it.  Why not?  Why not?  I swear-  Oh, oh.  What, Ro?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did I not check all-  It's saving you from yourself.  I guess you have to check all three.  Do I have to check them all, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  That's crazy.  No, surely not.  Oh, maybe I did.  Oh, I see, there you go, yeah.  Well, I'm not a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like you're a qualified investor kind of thing.  And they're gonna-  You're surely on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're sure?  Already.  This is more CYA.  CYA, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, CYA.  So now, if I go to update my device,  it won't happen right away,  but I'll check anyway, because you know me.  Come on, come on, come on.  Where's my update?  Where's my update?  Checking for updates.  Impatient much?  Yes, very.  Oh, it's gonna do it.  It's gonna do it.  Already.  It's gonna do it.  Oh.  A beta version of Android R.  What does the R gonna stand for?  Are we up to R?  Wow, I didn't even realize that.  Pi, and then Q was nothing, right?  It was just Q.  Right, it was just Q.  So now we're up to R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  R.  We're up to rice pudding.  Rice pudding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'll pass, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  R, Rolos, Rowe.  R, as PS Chops in our chat room says, R for regret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will give them credit with these beta releases.  The last two at least seem to have been okay  when you look at the message boards,  because everybody goes in expecting it not to be perfect  because it's a beta install,  but it wasn't a whole lot of complaints.  And then you take it along  to when it actually gets to production,  a lot of that stuff is still there  and they've even added a few more things.  And it's been okay.  But still, it's not something that I wanna do.  Not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have done it in the past and regretted it, yes.  But I mean, to be perfectly honest, it's not my main phone.  I'm kind of more the iPhone guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought you were an iOS guy.  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watch it, watch it.  Truth's gonna come out.  Truth is gonna come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a long time, I was an Android guy  because I liked the flexibility.  I liked the fact that I could change the launcher.  I liked the widgets.  And really, I don't think there's much of a difference  between the apps.  I just liked the freedom that Android represented.  But unfortunately, with great freedom comes great hackage.  And fragmentation and lack of privacy, et cetera, et cetera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this is the Leo reverting to his norm.  You just keep on giving up everything new.  You give up Facebook, you give up Twitter,  you give up Android.  I'm trying, au contraire.  And you're the host of the show from now on.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got it.  Okay, I, okay, take over.  No, au contraire, mon professeur.  I am merely trying to navigate through the  Shilla and Charybdis of technology these days  is a very difficult pathway.  And you've got the shoals of privacy to the right.  You've got the shoals of hackers to the left.  You're trying to somehow get your way down safely.  And I feel like, admittedly, I'm giving up a lot of control  with the iPhone, but I feel like it's safer.  It's safer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fair.  We're not gonna say right or wrong,  but I think that's fair though  because of how Apple closes things down  and tend to be a little bit more buttoned up on things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I admit it's a gated village.  It's a gated, but you know, okay,  you can be the host of the show, Ant.  You win.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After your nihilism last week,  I have a book for you to read.  Okay, go ahead.  Humankind by Rutger Bergman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, I've been hearing about that.  It's good, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, that's the one  we already talked about the story  from the Lord of the Flies real story.  You're dubious that anything could be good about mankind  as is your new nihilistic way.  And the book, I think it falls apart at the end.  It gets really...  Yeah, just like humankind.  No.  So you need to hear just a few hopeful stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have fallen apart at the end.  We're doing it right now.  This is when we fall apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ant, are you basically a pessimist or an optimist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not nihilistic.  He's realistic.  That's what I want to hear.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what's happened to you, Ant.  Oh no, I thought you were the nice guy.  So I just read about...  Oh no, as I have been.  This is shut down as if I could everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to make this my pick,  but I think it's a propose today.  I just read about a new operating system called Collapse OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Winter is coming.  This is... Winter is coming.  He believes that by 2030,  the global supply chain will collapse.  YTK.  And you won't be...  Y2K for the 2030,  you won't be able to get all of these complex processors  and no one knows how to make them.  So he's made an operating system  to preserve the ability to program microcontrollers  through civilizational collapse.  You can do a TRS-80.  Oh, that's perfect.  Oh, not even that good.  I mean, we're talking a Z80 or worse.  The idea...  You don't want it too fancy  because you won't be able to get them.  What you want is processors.  You can take out old stuff  because you're not going to be able to get them anymore.  Bare bones.  Collapse OS.  So that's my nihilism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That fits your mood.  Yeah, that fits your mood.  Yeah.  Winter is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all coming down around our shoulders  and you don't see it.  You're the dog sitting there saying,  this is fine while the house is burning up.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't.  I go back and forth.  Oh, we're having a little trouble with that.  No, he's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the folks who hear that as the show goes on  and Skype is being nihilistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Skype doesn't like me today, but it's okay.  Rucker Bregman wrote Utopia for Realists

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and now he's got a new book,  which I think just came out, right?  They called it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just finished listening to it last night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Sapiens of 2020.  I loved Sapiens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It falls over the end  where it gets a little bit to Malcolm Gladwell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is that whole category,  the Daniel Pink, Malcolm Gladwell,  Yuval Noah Harari category of optimistic.  It ain't that bad.  Are you sure?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Are you sure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you sure?  It's media's fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Media keeps showing you all the worst.  So, okay.  So Amazon, I'm at the Amazon listing,  Humankind, A Hopeful History,  and then it's Books You May Like,  The Great Influenza,  The Wages of Destruction,  The Deficit Myth,  Lifespan, Why We Age,  and Why We Don't Have To.  It's not good.  Look at it, it's the same people.  All right, I'll read it.  I will read it because God knows we need some good news.  First two thirds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you just need a few hopeful stories.  You need to...  Is that pose Ant gave us a minute ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can pick...  You need a little bit of that.  You can pick and choose good or bad.  That's a proof.  There's plenty of examples.  Yes.  Of either.  Yes.  I'm more interested in the trend  than any particular anecdotal information.  What do you think the trend...  Here, hey, here's some good news.  The Pixel Buds.  They might work again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After I've returned two pair of the...  Thing.  How can you not be a nihilist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How can you not be a nihilist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything is crap.  I feel bad for my son because he was so excited about those  and he ordered a pair.  And...  So what happened, Dan?  It was the first day.  He was fussing about the connection on the first day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, same over here.  I went through another pair.  I upgraded the firmware,  which is not easy to do by the way.  And yeah, they were...  I loved the design.  I loved the sound.  I loved all of that, but they didn't damn work.  So did your son return them or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he still has them.  Okay, there's hope.  I think it was one of those lesson learned.  He might be okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's hope.  So this is the original post going back to May 1st.  Pixel Bud audio issue,  cutting in and out while moving my head.  This is what everybody's reporting,  static and un-pairing, right?  And finally, here's a response from Google employee,  Chelsea W.  I've got a quick follow-up on some of the improvements  that Google has identified and are expecting to roll out  in the coming weeks.  Decrease instances of phone call cutouts.  Don't decrease them, get rid of them.  Improve auto recovery when one or both earbuds  lose connection.  Improve media playback stability  for phones that have software audio encoding  separately this week.  This week, this was yesterday,  firmware 296 will be released  that decreases the audio hissing static noise  some of you might experience.  Did you have that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did your son have that?  I didn't have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't mention anything about static.  He just mentioned the cutout all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing you don't have.  The problem you don't have  because it's cutting out, it doesn't matter.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what he mentioned, it's just always cutting out.  Now to Google's credit, for me personally,  I didn't necessarily start getting into wireless earbuds  until late last year because historically  I never had a good relationship with wireless earbuds  or wireless headphones because there was always  some sort of interference or just connection issues  with me whether I had the phone in my pocket  or the phone in my hand.  So I always just tried to stick with a wired connection.  Same here.  But now I have two different things  that I've been using here recently  because they've been consistent with keeping me connected  and not having any of these issues.  So when my son was telling me  about the Pixel Buds cutting out,  I went and looked online and saw that everybody  was saying the exact same thing,  which is pretty much what I've said about Bluetooth  wireless earbuds for the get go.  So maybe it's not Google, it's just the spec.  Well, no, that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was your son having the problem inside or outside or both?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't say, but I'm gonna-  Usually it's a weird, weird thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most of it, people report it's outside.  Now figure that out.  I don't think it's Bluetooth.  I think it's something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because I wear Bluetooth headphones  and admittedly, it's not as good as wired.  Halfway through a call, they'll drop out and stuff.  But basically, they're much more stable  than anybody's reporting for the Pixel Buds.  Those are abnormally bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's Bluetooth.  I think it's some kind of adjustment.  I think it's the in-ear sensing and it cuts itself off.  And then the two communicate in some way  that I don't think is Bluetooth.  I don't know what that is.  I just figure it's going through my head  and I got too much gray matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're so smart, both of you,  they don't work.  Your son is very smart and it just,  it can't get through the metal plates.  Oh, he's got you fooled.  Well, you were the one who's always calling them,  what, rock heads, boulder heads?  Hard heads.  Hard heads, maybe.  They can't get through the cement.  Had enough Google yet?  Well, don't worry, there's more.  We got more.  Google sued for secretly amassing  vast trove of user data.  This is a complaint filed in federal court in San Jose.  The lawsuit argues that while Google lets users  turn off data collection during use by Chrome's web browser,  other Google tools used by websites themselves  scoop up the data anyway.  In effect, you could, and by the way,  is by the world famous law firm of Boies Schiller Flexner,  LLP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The company-  I didn't quite understand that explanation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because if you go, let's say, in incognito mode,  or don't even use a Google browser at all,  there's plenty of sites, including, by the way,  Twitter, use Google Analytics.  Oh, okay.  There's Google Ad Manager.  So essentially, it doesn't even matter.  And Google's strategy all along,  and if you use an Android device,  good luck not giving Google information  about what you're up to.  A consumer suit was thrown out of similar ilk,  was thrown out by a judge in December,  accusing Google of illegally tracking  and storing geolocation data within its mobile apps.  Arizona's attorney general filed  a similar complaint last night.  Google says, we're looking forward  to setting the record straight.  We'll follow Brown versus Google  in the Northern District of San Jose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, with a case like this, what is the solution?  Because just as you said,  Twitter LLC will use Google Analytics for analytics,  because that's good data, right?  So what is the solution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we need it.  Is it a class action?  I presume it is, but I don't see.  So let me look at the pleading.  So usually the solution is they give a buck 50  to everybody and move on.  I don't know, maybe they'd like to get Google  to stop doing this.  I don't see that happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were some headlines about,  you could get your $5,000 from Google.  It's just stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no.  Not many people ever get rich from these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we never got, what's the,  the consumer data company we were all supposed  to get money from when I signed up.  Equifax, no, Equifax.  The Equifax suit.  Nobody ever got it.  Hoping to get your $125,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and then they realized everybody wanted money.  Yeah.  You greedy bastards.  Nobody's getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So nobody, y'all wanted it, so nobody's getting it.  You ruined it for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I am kind of stunned  to have to report this,  but Google Plus is shutting down.  Do what now?  Apparently, remember when they shut down Google Plus?  They said, well, but it'll still run in G Suite.  Right.  Now it's not even, they call it Google Currents.  I never knew that all this time.  I have G Suite, I never knew.  Never knew, well, that's probably why  they're shutting it down July 6th.  Jeff didn't bother to tell the world about it.  I mean, that looks like Google Plus, doesn't it?  Who was the one code jockey?  There's one guy.  He didn't want to.  That was always the knock on Google was that  everybody wants to work on the hot new thing.  Nobody wants to maintain the existing code base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I remember when the Google Plus floor,  I was at Google and it was the big secret floor.  Nobody could get up there.  It was a big deal.  And then after they released,  I got to go up to the floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoa.  Did you get to eat in the special cafe, Larry's Cafe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Months later it was gone.  Oh.  Whoops.  But now, speaking of Larry's Cafe,  Googler's coming back to work?  Box lunches.  Oh!  Shall we have a little violin symphony for the Googlers  having to eat box lunches?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh man, I've been looking forward to my pod tie  and my frothy blender.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but two to salad sandwich for you  and a chocolate chip cookie and chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At least, but they give it to you still, right?  You don't have to buy it.  Right.  No gym.  And you know what?  Travesty.  No sleep pods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You and I are out of luck.  For our bad night's sleep.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's such a good night's sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little afternoon nap and fix us right up.  But uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  Six feet of distance between chairs.  So here's the question.  How long before you ever see a buffet back?  That's the problem with Google.  They were a place like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because restaurants are gonna keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You get served.  And same thing on cruise ships.  Vegas, you get served now.  I mean, they might have a buffet,  but you don't go to the buffet and ladle up your plate.  Whole foods, the salad bar is gone.  Yeah, if anything they'll serve you,  but ideally it'll all be packaged.  Well, we're in the height of the Corona.  Although as John C. Dvorak says,  the fake Corona virus.  I guess all those 106,000 dead people are just faking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I take it back, you're not in Iowa.  Not next to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He called it a chimera.  Big fancy word meaning fake.  Yeah, I don't know, I guess until this is over.  I feel like it's over, don't you?  It's like the sun is out, it's warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at the numbers in Florida and Texas.  It is far from over.  It is bad.  I can go to Disney World, I can go to University of Arizona.  The hospitals are jammed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's the thing is,  how are the medical professionals handling it?  Are they being overrun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In Arizona they are.  It depends on where it is.  New York, we went through hell and we'll be okay.  I just see on the TV, New Jersey governor  just lifts stay at home orders.  Oh, sorry, I gotta leave now.  Now that I can.  Cuffs off of me.  But Arizona, a lot of stories.  A lot of the epidemiologists in my COVID Twitter list  are going on about the numbers are very bad there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I know in the Carolinas  they're starting to open things back up  and it seems like people are going about a normal life,  if you will, just with a mask for the most part.  And I figured that would be pretty much  what's gonna happen elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually just read a story that said  if we all wore masks,  that's the solution, by the way.  That probably not having a buffet.  It's not solution, I would say, it mitigates it.  Yeah.  This is a...  Slow the down a little.  This was just published in Science Daily.  No, that's not it.  I got the wrong link.  It was just published in ACS Nano,  the American Chemical Society.  The widespread use of face masks  keeps the coronavirus reproduction number below one  and prevents further waves when combined with lockdowns.  Even homemade masks with limited effectiveness  can dramatically reduce transmission rates  if worn by enough people.  Unless it's a chimera, in which case,  nothing can stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing can stop something that doesn't exist.  Ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back to Google.  No more stuff.  Oh yeah, no more buffets and no more sleep pods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google drones being friendly bombs from the sky.  Little bombs of education.  Okay, okay.  I dig it.  Bringing books to school children, drones.  You go off about how, oh, robots are scary and creepy  and awful and awful things are gonna happen.  No, they're bringing learning to children.  I hope they're not heavy books.  Drones, Mr. Jones.  I hope they're not soft books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the wrong connotation, sir.  Don't say bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, here you go.  This is a test.  This is Google's sister company, Wing.  They're gonna, this is a test to deliver library books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kids are gonna think that they're McDonald's Happy Meals.  They're gonna get very disappointed  when they see books inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, here comes the Wing.  Oh, Lord.  Okay.  And there goes, how big is this drone?  It must be massive. Yeah, what's the aircraft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it a Matrice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're the king of droning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't look like a Matrice.  I can't tell what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's fairly hefty.  It ought to be really loud too, right?  Let's turn on the sound so we can all hear how loud it is.  Do you have my, do you have my sound?  Look how many waves.  It's got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,  nine, 10, 11, it's got 12 props.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I wonder how efficient that is with battery  as well as radio.  I hear you loud and clear, sir.  No, no, no, I mean from the drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, the sound of the drone.  The sound of the drone.  Oh, well, that's all right.  We'd probably get taken down if we played the sound  of the drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is, now it has two more propellers in front.  Oh yeah, so it's got 14 propellers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it autonomous or is there somebody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Must be curious.  It must be curious because it also has a flashing light  on it as you know, as if it were.  Oh, look, here's your book wall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now what if you're not standing out on the front porch?  Does it just wait for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You stay out there for a day  just because you know the excitement.  Here comes the drone.  Oh, wait a minute.  Kid, you're supposed to look up at the sky  and say thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They left off the part where they have to unhook it.  He just took it.  Oh, maybe it, oh now it's making sound.  It stands for the fifth generation.  Why is it making sound now?  I guess there was no sound on that Google thing.  Apparently Wing, which I had never heard of,  reached a high of 1,000 deliveries a week this spring.  I don't know if it's books or what.  No, household goods and meals.  It delivers meals from Walgreens.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can it do Taco Bell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, local restaurants if you're in a Southwest,  a small part of Southwest Virginia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Want Karsten to do a coast to coast Taco Bell run for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a, it's Christian's Burg, Virginia.  And you know where that is, Christian's Burg?  No, I've never heard of that.  No, it's a small town in Southwest Virginia.  They also are delivering household goods and meals  from Walgreens and local restaurants,  packages up to three pounds.  Oh no, this is, sorry, that's the Amazon,  no, Wing delivered, wait a minute.  Wing received federal approval last year  to deliver by drone in Virginia,  beating Amazon's primary to the public testing milestone.  The company also delivers packages  which can weigh up to three pounds in Helsinki  and two Australian cities.  Okay. Three pounds worth of books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember when Amazon got the approval,  but I've yet to see anything that they've done  with the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Jeff, do you take this as a positive,  wonderful sign that the world is changing?  Yes, I do.  If you live in Christian Burg, Virginia,  Helsinki, it's not exactly like everywhere  and it will never be everywhere  because the last thing you want is thousands of drones

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  flying around up there.  There are certain places in this country these days  where I wouldn't mind dropping a few book bombs,  hoping they'd read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, oh Jeff.  What books would you drop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I know what I'd drop in your mind.  Humankind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Humankind, yeah.  Humankind, no, really, seriously,  if you were gonna try to educate the people of the world,  but just let's not make it global,  just the people of the US  and you got three pounds to do it,  what would you deliver?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a question, I don't know.  Of course you could also just zap some Kindle books to them,  but that's another point.  It's a lot easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a lot easier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be something with Dr. Purnell, if it were me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice sci-fi.  Oh yeah, Lucifer's Hammer,  all about the end of the world. Lucifer's Hammer.  Such a great book.  Lucifer's Hammer, an asteroid,  destroys much of the Earth's population,  not the Earth itself, the population survives,  but the problem they find is  nobody knows how to fix anything.  Nope.  We just gotta start all over again  because we, and this is a little cause for concern.  We live in a world with amazing magical technology,  but would you know how to make an 8088  if something happened?  Right, I wouldn't.  Who makes these things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sir, I still-  I wouldn't.  Go ahead.  I still complain about the fact that  there are people out here right now  that couldn't necessarily go and change the oil in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not supposed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you ever hear my story?  Did I tell the story on the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Well, I mean, things like, or even change a tire.  I've had to stop on the side of the road  because someone didn't know how to change their tire.  I just, really, you don't know how to change your tire?  Okay, I'll help you do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can do that, but you wanna hear my oil changing story?  What's that?  So I was working in Chicago as a young man  and I didn't have a garage or anything.  It was parked on the street  and it was November, it was getting cold in Chicago.  But this guy in the city that's convinced me  that I had to know how to change oil.  It was not hard to change the oil, Jeff.  You had this and this and this to change the oil.  So I get under the car,  I loosen the whatever the thing you loosen is  so all the oil falls out in the pan, right?  Okay, step one, okay, put that back on.  And then I take the filter off.  I take the filter off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I try to take the filter off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh boy.  And I mangled the filter completely.  Oh dear.  Oh boy.  And as a result, I couldn't put oil in.  I couldn't run the car.  I had to have the car towed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last time I ever tried that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You don't need to be changing oil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I don't need to change oil.  I am an adult.  In the past as a young man changed my own oil,  but it was a Volkswagen.  I have no idea what it would take to change the oil  in a modern vehicle.  Certainly they don't even tune them up anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How high does your mechanical confidence go, Amp?  Would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could do a car.  I could do a car.  I can.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, can you change spark plugs, Amp?  I can change spark plugs.  Oh, I did all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to tune up my Voxie.  You know, I had a timing.  You have the volt meter and the timing change  and I'd change the spark plugs,  tune it up, change the oil.  But that was a simple vehicle in those days.  Right, it was so much easier back then.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Back when you could pop the hood on a car  and you could look down and see the actual ground  down below.  Nowadays you can't even see if the ground is up  under your car when you pop the hood  because there's so much stuff going on in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Essentially I just try to sell the car  before I need to change the oil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You sell your car every 3,000 miles, huh?  Yeah, pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's about what I do, yeah.  Credit to CR1 in the chat room for that one.  Um, Duck Duck Go,  CEO, was called to talk to authorities  and Gabriel Weinberger said he's spoken  with state regulators, all 50 states by the way.  All 50 states now in the US Justice Department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they all smell cash.  They want it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Justice Department officials  and state attorneys general asked Gabriel  about requiring Google to give consumers alternatives  to its search engine on Android devices  and in the Chrome browser.  We've been, Weinberg said,  we've been talking to all of them about search  and all of them have asked us detailed search questions.  So that's where the inquiry is going at the moment.  Bloomberg's reported that the Justice Department  and Texas are examining Google's dominance  of the digital advertising market.  Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton  and the Department of Justice have begun drafting a lawsuit  which could be filed in the coming months.  Could kick off one of the biggest antitrust cases  in the US since Microsoft in 1998.  Actually, I was,  when was the last antitrust case in the US?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it was,  well, no, I think AT&T.  I think he went to the Pacific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  AT&T was 82 in the 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, AT&T and CNN and stuff.  They went after them recently for political ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but okay,  because in the,  I actually was looking at this earlier today.  In the Wikipedia article  on the history of United States antitrust law,  the 21st century paragraph is really short.  And really pretty much stops with Microsoft.  Now, maybe that's a flaw of Wikipedia,  but I don't think we've been really active  in pursuing antitrust in the last couple of decades.  Just been threatening it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just been threatening it every other month or so.  Yeah, there've been investigations.  And you know, I wonder how much of this ties into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the concerns about bias in certain ways.  In social media.  I just wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's, you know.  How much it ties into politics and moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We continue to engage with ongoing investigations  led by the Department of Justice  and Texas Attorney General says Google,  we don't have any updates or comments on speculation.  The FTC previously, you may remember,  investigated Google, but dropped the probe in 2013.  Saying there's nothing here.  Although, you remember, was it the Journal?  The Wall Street Journal had communications  that revealed that staffers had recommended  an antitrust lawsuit, but the FTC commissioners  declined to go for it.  Right. Wow.  I don't know.  So the last example we have of this is Microsoft in 1998.  It took them more than 10 years to litigate that.  The upshot of it was nothing.  Nevermind.  And in hindsight, it was dopey.  It just took too long to get anything done.  And it was dopey.  They were mad at Microsoft for including a browser  in the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, that's what you take over the world.  Shocking.  Yeah.  2020, Leo, in 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got rid of my Microsoft.  They're taking over the world.  Yeah, they're evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, look what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look what happened.  What happened is we got more frivolous about other things  for litigation, just stupid stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's a happy story.  Jeff, you mentioned, of course,  that we wouldn't have seen the George Floyd video  without Facebook and the 17-year-old woman  who posted that on Facebook.  It turns out that a lot of protests are using Google Docs  because it's a good anonymous way  to post information about upcoming protests,  share lists of books on racism,  a template for letters to family members  and members of Congress. Ways to be allies.  There's really good ones like that.  Yeah, a list of funds, other resources,  shared Google Docs anyone can view  and anyone can edit anonymously  have, according to the MIT Technology Review,  become a valuable tool for grassroots organizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's cool.  Now, there's another story in the rundown that says,  uh-oh, police could come after that data,  but they could post any platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, be careful.  If you think you're anonymous on the internet,  you probably aren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's actually not the police.  It's, so there was the, what was it called?  The nasty man list?  No, it wasn't nasty.  Oh, yeah, the media.  The B2, bad media man list.  Yeah.  Jeez, what was it called?  That was completely anonymous.  And so there, there was a different issue  was that it wasn't, didn't end up being truly anonymous  and there was the reliable liability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is that true?  So people who put their something in there  weren't anonymously, they thought they were anonymous,  but they weren't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, the S-E man list, S dot dot dot dot dot.  Yeah, and the woman who started it got in,  got harassed and there's other stuff there as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we know she started it,  but people adding to it, I thought were anonymous,  but maybe not.  Anyway, so good thing to keep in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which one came first?  Was it YouTube or Facebook?  I can't remember.  YouTube.  YouTube.  Okay, so I would say just to argue with you, Mr. Jarvis,  if Facebook didn't exist,  YouTube would have still been available  for people to take that footage and share it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Social media, social media in either case.  Yeah, he's not saying it's just Facebook,  but it was Facebook in this case, but you're right.  It could have been Twitter,  it could have been YouTube.  Could have been Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, nope, nope, we were on Facebook 2004, YouTube 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Facebook wasn't open to the public until later.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's right, right, right.  It was only for the campus.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis's message to Mark Zuckerberg posted  on Facebook.  I think it's likely that Mark is more likely  to be able to read that anyway.  Actually, someone from Facebook came to me  because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really?  Well, tell us about it.  What did you, what was the?  It wasn't a big deal.  Zuckerberg had a meeting with the staff  and then he put up a thing on Facebook saying,  this is why I've chosen not to do anything  about Trump's posts, this is what we're gonna do instead,  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I came back and just said,  I just don't agree, and I think that you've,  oops, it's trajectory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have the link here.  I gotta remember what I said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the problem I think is that Zuckerberg  has been putting this in two realms  that aren't the right ones.  One is we don't fact check the world.  I agree with that.  Two is we believe in freedom of expression.  I believe in that, I agree with that.  But what I said was your employees are coming after you  saying you have to take a stand.  And I've been saying that in a couple posts.  And I said you have the tool, all the tools you need,  which Facebook, which Twitter has shown, right?  You can add information, you can add a warning,  which says we don't approve of this,  but if you wanna see it, here it is.  You cannot promote it, and you can kill it.  I'm not saying he should kill it.  I'm saying Twitter should leave it up,  but I think he's got to make a stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say he should model good behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the main thing, right?  So the good behavior, this is Facebook,  which is about conversation.  And if a friend of yours comes along  and says something awful or racist or inciting or whatever,  then you should call them on it.  Because otherwise, then that's where the new norm is.  So it's up to all of us to call people on bad stuff.  And it's also then up to Facebook, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kinda like that, because it's not saying  Facebook has to be an arbiter of truth,  or Facebook has to decide, you know.  That's an untenable position.  No company should be put in that position.  No government should.  In fact, that's why the founders said,  let's have the First Amendment.  Let's not put the government in that position.  But I agree with you.  They have some responsibility.  As you point out, the algorithm does, in effect,  give them some editorial control of what you see  and what you don't see.  So they have some responsibility.  This is a kind of a nice middle ground.  Model good behavior.  And it doesn't have to be good behavior we can all agree on.  It doesn't have to be, this is wrong.  This post is untruthful.  It's merely what you would say to a neighbor  if they said something appalling.  You would say, hold on, wait a minute, that's not right.  But can he do it without the weight of,  it has to look like a neighbor said it as opposed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is the conversation I had with somebody  who just, somebody I met once,  but I hadn't talked to in a couple years,  just came in and said,  I wanna understand what you're saying.  So it was a really neat discussion we had over the weekend.  And nothing, I'm sure, will come of it,  but it was a nice conversation.  And so what this person was asking me was,  is it Mark speaking or is it Facebook speaking?  He said, Mark gave a speech at Georgetown  and said kind of all this.  And I said, no, it's gotta be Facebook.  It's gotta appear, it's not Mark's speech.  It's gotta appear with that item to say,  this person, this powerful person is inciting violence  and we wanna say we don't stand with that.  I like that.  Don't.  And that's the same thing you should with your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every individual should do that, right?  Yes, yes.  You're complicit to racism if you don't say something  when somebody says something racist,  then you're complicit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think he's asking for a whole lot here, personally.  I'm not, I think that's the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And not only more than that, I'll get behind you.  I'll say that's the right thing to do.  And it's just simply saying,  look, we don't agree with that.  That's not right.  That's racist.  Or that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And just like you said, Mr. Laporte,  if this was something that happened in person,  you were say out at the park or what have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be wrong not to.  Right.  Yeah.  So it's wrong for Facebook not to.  I think that that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is a very reasonable stance.  And it also does not require them to do it.  They don't have to disapprove of everything  on the platform.  This has impact.  It has virality.  It's from power.  There's a whole bunch of tests they can put it to,  to say, is this worth us talking about?  Yeah.  Now, if it's just something they don't like,  they can, there are full rights to kill it,  to bury it, to not promote it, all that.  But they know this is gonna be seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's what I don't like about it.  Because it's, if you do it as Facebook,  it's somewhat an anonymous,  faceless group of editorial people.  I would like to see a name on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you could have a chief ethicist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could have an ethicist of Facebook.  Doesn't have to be Marx.  It could be that committee that they,  it doesn't have to be Marx.  But somebody, it should be somebody.  Somebody you can respond to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's the other argument I've had with them.  I've said to them,  in conversations I've had about regulation and other things,  after I did my Twitter COVID list,  bit.ly slash COVID Twitter list,  Facebook is trying to go with institutions,  newspapers, WHO.  I said, you're Facebook.  You need human beings.  You need researchers and doctors and geneticists.  And human beings, we can start to understand,  listen to, respect, and believe in their authority.  You should be amplifying the expertise of individuals.  So I agree with you, Leo.  I think that it should be some kind of human voice  that says, it's here, but you just ought to know  that we think this is not the right way to behave.  I like that.  Yeah, I don't have a problem.  You know who should do it?  I'm serious about what I'm gonna say.  Cheryl.  The voice that I would channel for that is Ant.  Because Ant is always a very reasonable person.  You can't get mad at him.  I try to be.  I try to be.  You are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't get mad at Ant.  In fact, I would just go, oh, you're right.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, I mean, Ant, because Ant's called me out  once or twice, but extremely respectfully, gently, right?  That's what you want to model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, somebody in the chat room is saying,  it's not gonna help that you can't change people  by calling them names.  This is not necessarily with the intent  of changing the poster's post.  This is just to merely call it out,  which you would expect in civilized society would happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If this was on a screen, if this wasn't on a phone  or on a computer, what would the reaction be?  That's how I would look at it.  If this was out here in your neighborhood,  right out there in the streets, just like you said,  in this report, talking to the neighbor,  what would the reaction be?  How would you go about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you might, as a Facebook user,  be reading it and disagree and say,  no, no, I think that's appropriate.  Maybe even add a comment saying,  I think it's appropriate.  Or I don't get why that's racist  or I don't get why that's violent or whatever.  That's the conversation.  That's actually good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what you want.  Right, you want to have that.  It's not about two sides.  It's about the company having its own soul.  Facebook is controlled by Mark Zuckerberg,  so it is his decision to what he stands for  and what the company stands for become co-equal.  But his employees are telling him,  you better stand for something here.  And if I'm called a friend of Facebook  and Google and Twitter, fine.  Then it's your friends telling you,  you ought to stand for something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess that's really what Jack Dorsey did.  Yes.  And you look at, if you're at Facebook,  it's tempting to say, oh, it's just too big.  We can't be put in the position of judging every post  and having, but we're not asking that.  We're not saying that.  We're saying stand for something  and put that into the conversation.  Because you already are.  You're doing it imperceptibly.  You're doing it anonymously.  So maybe because you've already taken that responsibility,  you have more responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have influence whether they want to believe it or not.  So why not use it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know what?  This is something we should be aware of.  We may not agree with what they choose to say.  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right?  Yeah, he might come along and say, no, I'm sorry.  It's not as, I'm going to say out loud,  this is not an excitement and I support it.  He can do that.  And that's okay.  I don't think he would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's taken aside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's okay.  Yeah, it is.  That starts the conversation.  And really that's the problem we have right now  is we've got polar opposites  and no conversation at all happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why I keep arguing that Facebook  lacks a North Star.  Yes.  The oversight board is supporting,  is going to adjudicate a statute book  without a constitution.  And Twitter doesn't fully have it yet either,  but like England, it's having an unwritten constitution.  It starts to write it down by its actions.  Yeah.  Facebook has statutes.  No breasts.  We'll be happy to tell you no breasts,  but incitement of violence?  Well, if your president is okay, right?  So that's, they're getting their knickers and knots there.  Whereas if they said, we stand for respectful conversation.  We stand for not inciting things  and making them worse in society.  We stand for dialogue that is respectful,  informed and productive.  And we're going to call it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And when we see it.  And when we see somebody going against it,  we're going to say that's not about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Had they done that in the Philippines with Duterte?  Had they done that in Myanmar?  Would it have made a difference?  Maybe not, but you would feel a lot better  about Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  They could stand up a lot better.  And so when I wrote a post about this,  a week ago, which we think we talked about last week,  I said, should I have spoken up this way  in the Philippines and Myanmar?  Yes, I should have.  It's very much like Martin Neumann.  First they came for the Philippines  and I didn't do anything.  And then they came for the Myanmar they did with.  Now they come for us here in the US.  Well, okay, now I'm doing something.  So guilty, guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, good.  Jeff, I think you finally, after three years  of chewing on this, we've come up with a solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey's not going to believe it.  She's not going to believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacey, Stacey, we came up with something.  What do you think?  She's going to say, your guys are full of it.  What do you think?  We came up with something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can see your face now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  No, I think this is, what I like about it is  it's kind of ethically right without putting Facebook  in the big chair saying, this is true, this is not true.  This goes, this doesn't go.  I don't think that's the right thing to do either.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And again, you're not talking about the world even.  You're talking about the use of Facebook.  Yeah.  What kind of world do we want here?  We want a world here where people are not going to be  yelling at each other, where people are going to be  trying to be constructive, where they're trying to be  respectful, where they're not going to incite hatred.  That's what our world is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sundar Pichai was one of the many speakers.  Did you see the 2020 commencement address  to your class of 2020?  This is so touching to me.  They did a commencement celebration for all the poor  high school kids and I guess college kids graduating  without getting to walk, without getting to do anything.  They had everybody from President Obama, Michelle Obama.  I love this.  Here's Lizzo playing the flute with the,  was it the LA Flurmonic?  Don't play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watch out, Carson is yelling right now  that you're playing a YouTube video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I played two notes.  You gotta see, really awesome, really awesome.  And then what I like, this is just beautiful.  What I like is that they broke out all of the different,  there's a playlist so you can see the highlights.  If you don't want to watch the whole thing,  you can see Katy Perry.  It's worth, boy, everybody had something to say.  I thought it was quite beautiful.  And it's everybody from Lady Gaga to Mariah Carey,  to, wait, I gotta watch that.  Schitt's Creek featuring Mariah Carey.  That's gonna be interesting.  Alicia Keys, I think Lizzo with the,  it was a New York Flurmonic, that's hysterical.  Phineas remixed U2's Beautiful Day.  This is all the stuff, you know,  if I were a high school senior, I'd want to hear it.  God, this graduation goes on forever.  Well, yeah, that's why it's good  they broke it out into a playlist.  Look at this, it's just everybody.  Everybody, there's John Green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My sons was long.  My daughter, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Sundar Pichai was one of the people, the CEO.  Is he now, do we have to say CEO of Alphabet and Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought just Alphabet was enough  because Alphabet encompasses Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His title on the blog is the Keyword Blog CEO  of Google and Alphabet.  Oh, okay.  Interesting.  He said, I never imagined I'd be given a commencement speech  with no live audience from my backyard.  I imagine that every day, Sundar.  Do you dress up or not?  No, he's wearing like a baseball jacket,  which is pretty funny.  It's probably a Google baseball jacket.  So he says, let me skip right to the end of the speech  and tell you what happens.  You will prevail.  This is not really the end of the speech,  so don't get too excited.  The reason I know you'll prevail is because  so many others have done it before you.  The class of 1920 graduated into the end of the pan,  another deadly pandemic.  The class of 1970 graduated in the midst  of the Vietnam War.  My class, I was class of 73.  Same thing.  Class of 2001 graduated just months before 9-11.  So be hopeful.  It's very conventional for every generation  to underestimate the potential of the following one  because they don't realize the progress of one generation  becomes the foundational premise for the next.  And it takes a new set of people to come along  and realize all the possibilities.  You'd probably get along great with him,  Jeff Jarvis, you optimist, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The great thing about the speech that I loved  is that he said that his father spent a year's salary  to buy the airplane ticket for him to go to Stanford.  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was his first time ever on a plane.  He says, but when I eventually landed in California,  things weren't as I imagined.  America was expensive.  A phone call back home was more than $2 a minute.  A backpack cost the same as my dad's monthly salary  in India.  And for all the talk about warm California beaches,  the water was freezing cold.  It's true.  There he is, Sundar, as a graduate student at Stanford.  A bright spot for me during this time was computing.  For the first time in my life,  I could use a computer whenever I wanted to.  It completely blew my mind.  So yeah, this is a good speech.  I have to say, I thought this was, all the speeches were good.  See, see.  But you know, I'll be honest.  If you're speaking to a graduating class of 2020,  you gotta be hopeful,  because you can't tell them the truth.  They would be depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say, which he is, what is the truth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Honestly, I mean, I feel my kids graduated  from college last year.  They are, this is the worst possible time.  I know this is not the pandemic of 2020.  This is not those of us graduating in the Vietnam era  faced with the draft.  This is far worse.  Now, if you're a black man graduating, it's not.  It's just another century of oppression and violence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say this.  We were talking pre-show,  how I attended a local peaceful protest in March  over the weekend.  And a detail that I left out was that was put together  by a student here at Sonoma State.  No one else.  This was all a student.  And it was beautifully done.  And I can remember speaking there.  And I mentioned to my family, I said, you know what?  I know I've given the kids of today a hard time  with how they don't know how to change a tire  or change their own oil like Mr. Jarvis, but-  Hey, rub it in.  Rub it in.  But seeing that a teenager or a young person  could put together a beautiful rally  in a beautiful peaceful protest like that,  that gave me hope, you know,  that maybe these kids are trying to gear up  and make things better on this planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the time we're finished with the show,  we're gonna make Leo just feel all huggy and-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually, of all the bad things that have happened  in this bad timeline that we somehow got into,  the protests have given me such hope.  Because it has been a bad 400 years.  Yes, yes.  And I have to say, you know,  I remember waking up in 1968 to my clock radio.  Bobby had just been shot and then hearing that MLK was shot.  And I just felt like, oh my God,  it's the worst, this is the worst ever.  And there've been, and you know,  and Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner,  and just, it just keeps happening.  And then when we saw the video of George Floyd,  it just keeps happening.  But this reaction has been quantitatively  and qualitatively different than anything I can remember.  Even the marches, and my dad marched,  the march on Washington in 1968  when Martin Luther King gave that great speech.  He was there, he got on the buses  and went there from Rhode Island.  And I remember marching for racial equality  and marching against the war in Vietnam as a young man.  This is so different and seems to be  almost a universal feeling of,  this time we gotta do, we can't let this keep happening.  So for the first time ever,  I almost don't wanna feel hope  because my hopes have been dashed so many times.  But for the first time ever,  I feel like maybe there's just a little bit of movement.  Yeah, there's a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're ageless.  But I have no idea how old you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in my 40s, I'll say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, because I'm the old man, even older than Leo.  Not much.  No, not much.  And I wrote a piece for an Irish newspaper or Sunday  that this was all the last stand of the old white man.  And I say that as one.  And I remember the 60s, when I grew up in 68,  I'm reliving that now.  And I feel like we haven't learned anything since.  So that's my kind of, my holistic perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It feels very much like 1968, I agree.  I can remember, you can remember it too,  watching the Chicago Democratic Convention.  And it looked so much, the same police with riot gear,  the same batons, wailing on protesters,  it looked so similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have political strife, you have racial strife,  you have police violence, you have rocket shots.  So my question to you, Anne, is,  that's my memory of kind of the early days of the fight.  What sticks in your mind from your youth,  given your generation, we're younger than we are.  Is there an event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was one event that I did not attend  back in 95 or 96, and it was that Million Man March.  Oh yeah.  I did not attend because quite frankly,  I wasn't interested.  And I remember some of my teammates were wanting to go  and they did go.  But before that, I have memories of KKK parades  in South Carolina.  Oh, geez.  I remember seeing stuff like that pretty regularly.  But with all of that going on,  I can remember looking at the resilience  of my mother and my father  and some of my other family members that said,  you know what, get your crap together,  get to work and be a better person.  End of story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  I loved, Cornell Wilde was on the CNN last night.  He actually made Anderson Cooper cry.  And it ties to at the end of John Oliver's  This Week Tonight, he played a riveting clip  from a black woman saying, you never saw a black KKK.  You broke the social contract.  But we didn't riot.  Well, we didn't turn on you.  We just kept on.  And it was so moving.  Anderson Cooper was bawling, as was I,  because of the beautiful spirit and love  coming from the black community in the face of such hate.  It's so inspiring.  And I just hope, by the way, good news, this just happened.  Amazon has now agreed to ban the use  of its face recognition technology for a year.  Hallelujah.  This, of course, following IBM saying,  we're not gonna do it anymore  because, of course, all of this face recognition technology  is very much biased against people of color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So now that they're gonna ban it,  let's hope that they're saying, you know what,  we're gonna bring in some more teammates  that can help with this, that can help make it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But more importantly to me, this is Amazon  which fought this tooth and nail,  finally realizing, you know what, the tide is turning.  We can't-  Finding a North Star.  Yeah, we can't keep doing this.  Maybe I'm a cynic, maybe it's because it's bad for business.  Oh no, we better do this.  Maybe because they did find they're a little bit conscious.  I don't, conscious, I don't know.  But that's why I feel like there's hope.  For the first time in my lifetime, there may be some hope.  Actually, that's not true,  because I had hope in the early 70s,  late 60s, early 70s, that maybe we could change things.  There was that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then our generation screwed it up.  Our generation didn't do the things  that we promised we were gonna do.  Our generation got in control.  Our generation of old white men got in control  and didn't do anything.  That's what depresses me about this,  is that it feels, the fact that it feels so much like 68  means that there should have been a step change.  Not this time.  So we hope and pray and need to commit to  making a step change.  There was a fascinating, so the editor of Bon Appetit  had to resign because he was in brown face  in a photo that was found on social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He and his wife years ago pretended to be Puerto Rican.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the staff of Bon Appetit just put up a letter  to the public that I think is very good  and confesses the sins of the magazine  and has concrete things that they say  that they're going to do.  One thing that we see in journalism all the time  is an editor or a professor says,  oh, that story's not big enough.  It's just a trend.  It's just you and your people.  That's the kind of stuff that went on.  And they used low-level people underpaid at Bon Appetit  to be in video so they could look better.  And they didn't pay them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They went through all of this.  They didn't pay them.  They didn't pay the black people.  They only paid the white people.  It's like so appalling.  So appalling.  Oh my God.  So the staff.  And I just wanna say right now,  we're gonna start paying you because.  I appreciate it.  It's wrong.  No, I love Epicurious, which is part of their family.  And I had no idea.  And I am so glad.  This is a long overdue apology  and where we go from here.  So this is really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think what I tweeted was that  it's not just Bon Appetit.  It's journalism.  It's journalism schools.  It's my journalism school.  We have work to do.  It's us.  It's us.  And this had concrete things to do.  Then the president of Conde Nast came with his response  was just more PR blather.  The model should have been to go down everything  that that staff said and said, yes, we're gonna do it.  And here's why we're gonna do it.  And it should have been that instead it was just,  oh, we're gonna have a lot of,  we're gonna have better discussions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Platitudes on platitudes.  Wesley Faulkner was on Twitter on Sunday.  And I was talking about Tim Cook's beautiful  letter to the public that's on apple.com about racism.  And he said, well, that was okay,  but I really preferred Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's letter  because Satya said, it's us.  We take responsibility.  Here's what we are going to do.  And that really, you need to say that.  You need to say, okay, we blew it.  And here's what we're gonna do.  Here's how we're gonna make it better.  And I think, I hope this isn't just PR  from a bunch of companies.  Tom, what do you do with that?  Well, sometimes, you know, sometimes a desire  to preserve the bottom line  pushes you in the right direction.  And you know how it is if you don't feel like smiling,  but you smile, sometimes you kind of start  to feel better anyway.  Maybe it'll be, maybe that's the upshot of it,  but I'm just thrilled to see Amazon saying,  okay, we're gonna step back on recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is good though.  But again, I have no problem with the idea  and technology of facial recognition  because that could help things  with from an efficiency standpoint,  depending on what your business model is.  But when it comes time to train these systems,  you need to have people that are just not sitting in a box,  people that are a little more well-rounded  and can see it from all different perspectives,  not just some white guy from San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of white guys from San Francisco,  Jack Dorsey's made Juneteenth a permanent company holiday.  Juneteenth, which is on June 14th.  Symbolic, but good symbolism.  It's a big symbol, you know.  June 14th is the anniversary of,  not of the, I always thought  it was the Emancipation Proclamation, it's not.  It's the end of the Civil War and the final actual freeing.  It was the reading of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was slave release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The release of the slaves, yeah.  So that's coming up in four days and it will be celebrated,  I'm sorry, June 19th, I said the 14th.  It's coming up in nine days.  Yes, the 19th.  Sorry, I apologize.  Yeah, Juneteenth.  So they're gonna make that a company holiday in the US.  I think that's great.  Maybe take some time for education as well as barbecuing.  Yep.  All right, let's take a break  because there's more to talk about.  But what I'd like to do, there's a lot more to talk about.  What I'd like to do at this point,  we got a change log coming up, we will get to that,  is give both you and Jeff a chance, Ant,  to pick a story so that we get,  make sure we get everything that you wanted  to talk about, Ant.  So why don't we think about what you wanna talk about,  both of you, and I.  Well, we gotta think, Ant, we gotta think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't have to think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just go, mm, wait for me to get around a point.  Throw a dart, I don't care how you come up with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll do line 91, whatever's on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do pay, Ant, I'm sorry,  if anybody believes that we didn't.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I do get paid.  I am the happy, happy, happy employee of Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's actually people in the chat room  who are saying, he doesn't get paid?  He doesn't know.  Oh, jeez.  I am a happy employee.  Got to be careful what you say in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Save us from the literal minded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, people might believe it.  Who would've believed Bonaparte  was not paying black people for their videos,  but was paying the white people for the videos?  I mean, who would've believed that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  True, true, true, true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand, I look like an old, biased old white man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I say white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please don't do that.  I know, that's not good.  That's not good.  I'm thrilled to see the US Navy and the Marines  take down the Confederate battle flag everywhere.  NASCAR.  NASCAR, that's a shock.  Every time I see, what was that?  The Daisy Dukes, the Dukes of Hazzard,  every time with the battle flag on that car, I think,  mm, that's a big part of NASCAR.  I'm so shocked, but that's what I mean.  I feel like the times might be changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me say this about NASCAR.  I used to watch NASCAR a lot because of where I'm from.  And my grandfather was a mechanic  for pretty much all of my life.  So he talked about cars, and when the races would come on,  him and his community of friends or whatever,  they would watch the races, but they didn't care who won.  They cared about what car won.  Was it a Chevrolet?  Was it a Ford?  That kind of thing.  So I understood that.  Now you fast forward 20 years,  and there's still a little bit of that in NASCAR.  Fast forward another 10 years, not so much of that.  NASCAR has changed a lot where the drivers  are not necessarily from Rockingham, North Carolina,  or Greenville, South Carolina.  A lot of them are coming from Sonoma, California,  and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more like F1 or other kinds of racing.  It's more about the star drivers and the teams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not as regional as it used to be.  A lot of those tracks closed down  because it just wasn't selling.  It comes from the roots of NASCAR,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is some good old boy brought his car  with the Confederate battle flag on the hood  and said, let's race.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Moonshining on the beaches of Daytona.  That's all it was.  For them to have the flags removed,  that doesn't surprise me.  It doesn't surprise me because it's not the same NASCAR.  Had they tried that maybe 15 years ago,  it would have been a mess.  It would have been a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it is, at least it was until recently,  I think probably still is the fastest growing sport  in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not doing as well as they used to.  They're trying.  Oh, okay, that's interesting.  They're trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  While we're on sports,  I mean, tip of the hat to the Reverend Al Sharpton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never taught sports on Twitter.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I never taught sports  because I don't know jack about sports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I gotta ask, are you going through withdrawal?  This must be very,  this is the hardest part of quarantine, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, for me, it's okay because when football  is in off season, I watch a lot of sports reruns.  So I watch old football games.  So I always get my fix.  I'm always in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you're not gonna feel so good come fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope I'm feeling good come fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a gridded teeth.  I better be.  I better be.  I try like a...  So Al Sharpton from the pulpit in the funeral  saying it is time to make up to Colin Kaepernick.  It's not enough to make a YouTube video saying,  oh, sorry.  Absolutely.  He was right.  This man created the symbol of a movement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was right.  I have thoughts on that.  And people are gonna disagree with me on it.  Yes, the NFL should go to them and say,  look, yeah, we screwed up.  We were totally, totally, totally wrong.  And there are some people that are gonna say  they should have this big old campaign announcement,  yada, yada, yada.  I think that's something that should be done in private  with maybe two witnesses, if you will,  the same way they went about it with the court case  and the settlement and things like that.  Because I don't personally,  I don't think it should be is showman like on television  to where it looks like it was just a PR stunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Using him the other way.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so I say do it,  but do it to where there's maybe two witnesses,  no cameras, that way you know it's sincere  or at least for me, it gives you a better sense  of it being sincere and not being in the public eye  of all of the flashing lights and cameras  and things like that.  Because they totally did screw this up  and they were totally wrong on this.  Because what he did,  he was just doing a peaceful protest.  People are gonna think that he was disrespecting the flag.  It had nothing to do with the flag.  It was all about the police brutality.  And the idea came from a military veteran to Neil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Colin asked, what would be a respectful way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, so he wanted to do it.  And out of respect for the military  and respect for the community,  but he was blackballed and openly blackballed.  Because there are a ton of quarterbacks in the NFL  that don't ever get to play.  Because they're either a backup  or they're just a role player on the practice squad.  He could very easily be on the practice squad  somewhere at the very least,  but he actually could start somewhere too.  There's a lot of bad quarterback play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He took us to the Super Bowl.  I still have my number seven 49ers jersey.  I should start wearing that with pride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Since you're the only real man in jock here.  Oh, you're almost as bad as I am.  I'm gonna stop playing this guy.  I'm completely.  How long has it been since he's played  and is there any chance that he still can have  physical mojo to be able to,  if he started, if we're back in the fall,  can he possibly be in shape to play?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He could play.  They had a camp for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had an audition camp for him not so long ago.  Nobody hired him at that time.  I think still probably because it was political.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It was still political then,  but he's clearly enough in shape to make camp.  But a lot of those guys are, they work out so often  because it's just, as I was telling my family members,  when it comes to playing sports,  you get a certain discipline and it just doesn't leave.  You just wake up for me.  I can't help but to do pushups  when a commercial comes on on TV.  It's just there.  So these people, they're just, they're in shape.  So you don't have to worry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Richard Sherman says Kaepernick could still play  at the highest level and deserves it.  I wouldn't doubt it at all.  And start it.  He's only 32.  He's not, I mean, you know,  he played for six seasons for the Niners.  You know, he was, I think the last game he played  was in that Superbowl.  I can't remember if he got to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he played one more after that,  but lost his starting job, if I remember right.  Your wife would know more than me.  She's a natural 49ers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She was, you know, it's ironic.  I remember going to a pre-season game in that 2016 season  and Kaepernick, you know, was okay,  a little late in the game.  So he wasn't playing against the first stringers,  but he took the ball and ran 70 yards for a touchdown.  And I said, wow, I like this guy.  I like this guy.  I was really thrilled when he got to start  and he really played very well in the last few games,  but she was never a fan.  She said, no, he doesn't do his progressions fast enough.  He's not as alert on the field as he needs to be.  She's tough though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And at that time, I have to agree with you  from that standpoint, because playing that position,  you can't just tuck it and run every single time  because you want to have some longevity  and be able to play next week.  So limit those hits, go through your progressions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  She doesn't like the new guy either.  So who also took us to the Superbowl.  This is tough.  She's tough.  She's really tough.  He has somewhat of the same problem.  So no, Kaepernick was a free agent that season  and no one signed him because of politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he, I mean, there was no question.  Here's a guy came on halfway through a season,  took a team to the Superbowl and he doesn't get signed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, he's owed back pay by the NFL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they settled.  No one knows how much for, but I imagine the NFL gave him,  I hope the NFL gave him some significant amount of money,  but that's not really the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they settled for a decent amount.  Mark Gergoss is his lawyer  and I believe they talked about it on his podcast.  Oh really?  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cool.  You're not supposed to, of course.  Right.  It's one of those deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I thank you, Amp for that sports remedial lesson for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sport ball fascinating to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need a bumper for a sports segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a bumper.  Can you get it for us, John?  Do you have the football bumper?  Oh, is it Jeff or John?  I can't tell with a mask.  Mr. Brockman.  Mr. Brockman.  Mr. Brockman is in the house  and we used to have a nice little football bumper.  Kevin would know how to do it.  Oh, he's mean.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's so mean.  Is that mean?  Jeff, turn off his camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ever tell them a story about getting a vasectomy?  Yeah.  There you go.  Yes.  I guess I won't.  I'm lying on the table.  You're awake when you get a vasectomy.  I'm lying on the table.  Do I want to hear this?  Ah!  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the doctor's starting to sweat a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He can't, he can't quite, he can't even,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he can't even, he can't even, he can't even,  he can't even, he can't even, he can't even,  he can't quite, he got half of it done,  but not the other half, he can't quite.  And my wife at the time said, it's okay,  we'll hire, we'll go get a urologist  and he can finish the job.  And the doctor jumped, man, he fixed it.  That's right, that's right.  That was a good trick.  That was a good trick.  Motivation.  He played three seasons after the Super Bowl.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Your wife insults the doctor  as he's got a knife on you down there.  Yeah.  I don't, yeah, I don't,  I think something else was happening.  Come to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Come to think of it, what was she thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She was thinking money talk and walks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She humbled him, she humbled him.  Let me get that right,  because I thought that, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought he played the following year,  but ended up losing his starting job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he must have played  because he wasn't taking a knee  after the Super Bowl appearance, right?  Right.  So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He started taking a knee in 2016.  And at that point,  he became a free agent after the season,  but went unsigned.  So his Super Bowl was 2012.  So yeah, he played, I'm sorry, I apologize.  Yeah, because Alex Smith got a concussion  and Kaepernick took over.  Yeah, I remember that.  And he took the Niners in the 2012 season.  See, that was in,  that's why it's confusing,  the 2012 season, Super Bowl was in 2013.  And Kaepernick played in 2013  and he played for three more years.  But he was a free agent and then no one hired him.  Because in 2016, he started taking a knee.  Anyway, enough history, enough about my vasectomy.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't we have a sponsor you wanted to thank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't want to be here now after that.  Are you kidding?  They're saying, I'm trying to give them a little buffer.  Is it hot where you are now, Ann?  Is it, yeah.  Just a little.  How'd you like to get a copy of Doom on your Chromebook?  Look at that.  Doom or Doom 2.  Google.com slash Chromebooks slash perks.  Here's some Chromebook perks.  You can get Doom and Doom 2.  It's only a $5 value.  Don't get too excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even still though, when you think about it,  that's some nice horsepower  of being able to push graphics like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the Chromebook can play it even is impressive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty daggone cool.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also Fallout Shelter, the Elder Scrolls Legends,  Stardew Valley, Calm Premium for 30 days,  Lineage 2.  There's a lot of perks in here.  Wow. That's nice.  There's something for you, Ann.  VSCO, you got a year's membership at VSCO.  Oh, I remember that.  Remember them, VSCO?  Remember those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, lots of filters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm hoping for a new Pixelbook come the fall.  There was speculation.  Some of the things they're seeing go by with the code names  and the timing.  It's been three years this fall.  Oh man.  Can you believe that?  Mr. Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's gonna do it for you this year though?  What's it gonna take?  You're still waiting and holding out  and there are plenty of code.  I'm hoping for a Pixelbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My keyboard's getting a little wonky right now.  Okay.  I don't know if I'll make it,  but I'm hoping for a full Pixelbook.  So you're wanting a Google branded hardware.  I want that.  I love my Pixelbook.  I think they're doing a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm just checking Kevin Toefels about Chromebooks.com  to see if there's any rumors we ought to know about.  There's a deep place to go.  Yeah.  I don't see anything.  Boy, it does seem like it's time, isn't it?  I have my Pixelbook right here.  I really, it's a very nice device.  Do your boys use Chromebooks in school?  Yes, sir.  They do.  Yes, sir.  Yeah.  I think it's a great school computer, honestly.  So did Michael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it works totally fine.  And then when they get home,  they can just log into any session on any computer.  Right.  Based on the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, I put the Chromebook box story  in the chat on the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, good.  All right, we'll talk about that when we come back.  First, a word from the folks who pay for this lovely studio,  the LastPass Studios here in beautiful,  in beautiful Petaluma, California, LastPass.  Everybody knows LastPass is a password manager,  but really it's so much more.  We use LastPass,  we've used LastPass personally for more than 10 years.  So does pretty much everybody I know,  including our own security guru, Steve Gibson.  Now, Steve, he's a tough audience.  He had to actually interview the guy who wrote it,  Joe Segrist, get a look at the code and everything.  But that's when Steve said, two thumbs up,  I give it my certification.  The Gibson seal of approval, he's doing everything right.  That was some years ago,  we did a whole episode on how LastPass works.  We started using LastPass for business,  the enterprise version a few years ago,  when one of our engineers put all the passwords  on a public webpage, because he couldn't remember them.  I thought, I gotta help you.  We're gonna get LastPass.  It's gone a lot farther.  In fact, I'm so glad we use LastPass enterprise,  because as we send employees home,  suddenly they're working from home,  they're logging in from their home computers  onto our bank accounts, our websites, our databases,  our production system, everything.  They've got the keys to the kingdom.  I'm really glad it's protected by LastPass.  LastPass has done a lot in enterprise  to make it more than just a password manager.  Of course, it's a great password manager.  And if you're in the IT department,  you'll be glad to know it ensures oversight of shadow IT.  You've got enforceable policies  across all password protected sites.  So for instance, we require a two factor  on their master password.  We have minimum password requirements, things like that.  But they've added more.  They've got single sign on now,  more than 1200 single sign on apps.  That makes it really easy for employees to use something  without having to remember a password.  I haven't even used a password.  You just say yes on the phone.  Yeah, that's me, I'm trying to log in.  And boom, they're in.  And of course, again, IT has centralized control.  Always knows exactly who's accessing what from where.  That's really important.  They've also added multi-factor authentication.  Of course, they have two factor.  And I've always used two factor with LastPass.  You can use an authenticator.  But now they've got biometric.  You can use fingerprint or face.  I really, I love unlocking my LastPass with face ID.  It makes it very easy.  They even go beyond that.  They now use contextual factors,  things like IP address or geolocation.  Again, it's all about authentication.  It's all about making sure the person  who's using your business resources is the right person.  You gotta be thinking as you're sending employees home,  as you're dealing with the crisis,  you gotta be thinking about additional layers  of defense beyond the password.  And of course, LastPass does everything right.  That's what Steve verified.  I mean, they never send,  they don't even store the master password.  They don't know it, which is good.  Because if LastPass can't access your data,  no one else can, right?  Data's only decrypted on your device locally.  And it's encrypted before it syncs to LastPass.  So it's sent encrypted, it's encrypted,  it stays in place encrypted,  and only you have access to it.  That's really, really important.  And by the way, every device,  Android, iOS, Mac, Windows, Linux, every browser,  I use LastPass everywhere I am.  It's the first program I install  when I'm setting up a new system.  A 256-bit AES encryption, that's the best you can get.  LastPass protects, but,  and this is really important for business,  it also provides a seamless workflow for your employees.  It's convenient and secure,  and that's a tough thing to do.  LastPass can help make remote work simple and secure.  Go to lastpass.com slash twit.  Find out how they can help your business  stay productive and secure,  no matter what happens.  Lastpass.com slash twit.  Thank you, LastPass.  They're pretty much keeping us alive right now.  So, I agree.  Thank you, LastPass.  Thank you, LastPass.  Thank you, LastPass.  All right, now I don't know if you remember,  but way back when, I said pick a story, any story.  Mine is number 98.  Number 98.  Number 98.  Number 98.  Number 98.  Amazon sues, oh yeah, we talked about this  on Windows Weekly, Brian Hall,  because he took a job after leaving Amazon  because of the Facebook page,  leaving Amazon because of the face recognition software,  which I think is really interesting.  He left and he took a job doing kind of the same thing,  marketing at Google, cloud marketing at Google,  and Amazon says,  you have an uncompete.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here's the top Amazon result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I triggered something.  I was gonna say, did you fire up your phone?  Somebody's talking to me.  He was apparently at Microsoft.  In fact, the reason we talk about it on Windows Weekly,  very well respected at Microsoft,  did a lot of good and interesting things.  He went to work 18 months ago  as vice president of product marketing,  quit along with others because he wasn't happy  with Amazon's treatment of its workers.  It wasn't about face recognition,  it was treatment of workers.  Amazon, and then got a job at Google, Amazon suing,  saying, you signed an 18 month non-compete.  Now that's not enforceable in California.  Don't tell aunt that.  That's not. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, see, there was that caveat,  but then there was also the caveat in that piece  that mentions he spoke with another one  of the members of leadership at Amazon  that made it seem like it was okay  that he went ahead and took the job at Google.  And when I read that, I'm thinking,  have you lost your mind?  You get that crap in writing, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently AWS vice president of worldwide management,  Ariel Kelman told him, oh yeah, that non-compete,  that's not enforceable.  Well, Amazon's gonna try and force it.  She also said she'd never seen Amazon attempt  to enforce the clause against a marketing employee.  So Hall thought, okay, I guess I can do it.  So I guess non-competes certainly legal in Washington state,  but as I was always told, maybe just as mistakenly  that non-competes are not enforceable in California.  We don't actually make our host sign contracts anymore.  We used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see, what gets me is there are people  that are against these non-competes,  and then there's people like me.  I have no problem with the non-compete,  at least with the spirit of it.  It's cause you're an honorable person.  Well, I mean, this is competition.  Business is business, and business usually means competition  with the other people within the same line of work  that you're in.  And you don't wanna necessarily have your best players,  if you will, leave your team,  that go to your competing team and end up whooping your butt.  So you have to figure out a way to try to at least  level the playing field and keep them from doing that.  And I think that makes perfect sense.  I don't know if the actual term should be two years  or 18 months.  I don't know how they come up with those terms,  but it makes sense for them to say,  hey, you can't go work for our competitor,  direct competitor for X amount of days  or X amount of months or something like that.  It just makes sense because of all of the security knowledge  that you may have or other company secrets  that you may have that could be of a disadvantage  if it comes from one of your competitors.  I'ma hold you to this, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We don't, I mean, I think the thinking  and the reason why California doesn't allow it  is cause it keeps you from shopping yourself  and getting the best job possible.  So if I have a non-compete with you,  I could say you can't work anywhere else for 18 months.  That means if somebody came to you with a better offer,  you couldn't take it.  Okay, that makes sense.  Yeah, that's why it's considered illegal.  But you're an honorable person.  The reason we don't do contracts,  and we used to make our employees sign contracts,  but we realized what are we gonna do, sue you?  We had one employee, literally one of our hosts  sign a contract with us and the next day quit.  He signed like a three year contract and then quit.  And Lisa and I went, well, what's good is the contract.  Right.  Cause I'm not gonna sue, that would be terrible.  Yeah, and what's my goal in suing,  getting him to come back to work?  Oh, that's a good way to make a friend.  So we just, you know, we don't.  But we used to say things like, you know,  and I think we've told you this verbally,  we'd appreciate it if you'd let us know  before you do a show for somebody else  or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that makes perfect sense to me.  And I think that's just more like common sense,  but maybe you just think it's honor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He wasn't unhappy, he just got a better job.  I guess he got a better job.  I didn't think it was better.  Anyway, anyway, as a talent, I've always had awful,  I have a contract with Premier, awful contracts, you know,  but I don't know how, I can understand why this person,  this Vice President, who by the way is no longer in Amazon,  told him, you can quit, nobody's gonna sue you.  Because that's kind of what you'd expect.  Why would they, why would they want to?  Let's see here, let's move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do Jeff, what was your story?  So I have a quick story.  Yeah, 114 since we're playing that game.  I like it.  This is really short, it's only a tweet.  It's a tweet, that's all it is, is a tweet.  Tweet from Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sharing an article can spark conversation.  So you may want to read it before you tweet it.  Yeah, we know that a great percentage of articles  of retweets and of Facebook reshares are just shared  because of the headline or the picture,  not because people read it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so Twitter is gonna do what I think Facebook does  behind the scenes, was they see whether or not  you've actually clicked off and read the link  before you share it.  Oh, does Facebook do that, really?  Facebook uses that as a signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't share that?  No, they can share it, but they're not gonna see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, see, they'll factor that in as a way to say  whether you're just doing the headline  or whether you've actually read it.  They said that out loud.  So Twitter doesn't really promote that much,  but it's trying to urge you to do that.  Now, there's plenty of times when I will have read  an article earlier in the day,  and then somebody writes about it and they link to it  and they say something about it, and I say, yeah.  And I agree, I read that article,  and Twitter didn't know I read it.  So it's not foolproof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Gab's response, gab.com's response to Twitter,  we're not gonna do this  because we don't treat our people like children.  Oh, geez.  Gab, of course, the home of neo-Nazis everywhere.  Oh, boy.  That is a problem because I think a lot of times people,  headlines often don't accurately reflect the contents  of the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not at all.  It's so annoying, so annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they really should do a better job of that,  but usually, Jeff, it's a different person often, right?  Writing the headline.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what about the people,  like I see where Megha Maroney on this tweet says,  you know what, none of her, or New York Times  or Washington Post, her subscriptions,  they're not tied to her Twitter account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So how would you know if I read it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point.  How would they know?  Right.  Oh, that's interesting.  So the presumption is you're on Twitter  and you see something and you wanna retweet it,  and since you didn't click it before you tried to retweet it,  then you didn't read it.  Therefore, you didn't read it.  Which isn't necessarily the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, because there's a lot of times,  I have read same stories somewhere else.  Let's say, for example,  Canon's new R6 and R5 cameras are expected to be released  in July of 2020.  I saw that on four different websites.  Right.  But I'm gonna retweet it from one possible.  Right, that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could this be a backhanded slap again at the president,  because he keeps retweeting white supremacists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I get in trouble with your boosters.  He doesn't read anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there is actually a defense for,  like, I didn't read it.  I didn't know what that was all about.  So his most recent one saying that the poor 75-year-old  Catholic protester who was slammed,  the body slammed to the ground by the Buffalo police,  was secretly an Antifa agitator  who was scanning their police radio.  And that he fell more than he was pushed.  He fell harder than he was pushed.  That retweet.  That's interesting.  But that wasn't something he read.  It was something he saw on OANN.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't know because I've been on social media hiatus,  so I could tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you missed that one.  It was good.  He retweeted a story from the, what is it,  Official American Network.  What does OANN stand for?  I don't even know what it stands for, yeah.  That was actually a Russian guy.  The piece was a guy with a Russian accent saying,  this guy was clearly, look, you can see the fun.  He's scanning.  It turns out this guy is a correspondent for Sputnik,  which is the Russian propaganda service.  He even did it.  Oh my gosh.  So clearly, I mean, I don't know what's going on.  Maybe that's what I'm wondering.  Maybe Twitter's saying, hey, Donald, watch the story first.  But no, they're not saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're not saying that  because they do have the power to directly at him.  They're not gonna say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, Donnie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should mention real quick that actually,  nine to five Google, no, somebody else,  debunked the new Pixelbook story.  So I'm disappointed and sad again.  Krobanbach said, no, sorry, no evidence of Brockman.  So nevermind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Sancho and Baldwin.  Sorry, Mr. President.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't mean they're not gonna do it, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it doesn't mean they're not gonna do it,  but just, you know, just Krobanbach said,  we look for any evidence we can.  We'd love to have it,  but we can't say that there's really any evidence yet  that there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twitter is working, working to bring back verification.  Where did it go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They cut it out a while ago and they did it specially.  I worked with them, I was not paid,  but at the request, I helped them get a bunch  of COVID scientists verified.  So they still do the check,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but they don't have that process where anyone can apply.  Yes, they don't.  Oh yeah, they have evidence on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's been a while.  I've been trying and they're like,  nope, we're not doing it anymore.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you go to school and you get your PhD in virology  and you work on COVID,  then maybe I can do something for you.  Maybe I can help.  I completely think-  Give me about 15 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let's talk 15 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, 15.  I think that that check in a case like that,  that's really important to say this person really does have-  That's why they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was very happy.  And the scientists were amazingly grateful for getting it.  It was phenomenal to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it turns out they paused this in 2017  after the Charlottesville Tiki Torch Rally  when Heather Heyer was run down by a white supremacist.  The company gave a blue check to a white supremacist  who tweeted disparaging remarks about Heather Heyer  and gotten so much trouble for it  that they decided maybe we better not do this anymore.  Verification was meant to,  this was the tweet at the time,  meant to authenticate identity and voice.  People unfortunately interpret it as an endorsement  or an indicator of importance.  We recognize we have created this confusion.  We need to resolve it.  So we've paused verifications.  That was three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I know it's been a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad I have my blue check.  By the way, Jack Dorsey is giving $3 million  to Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights camp.  So, nice.  Heard that.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not surprised either.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Jack's been...  Jack's a decent man.  Yeah.  He is.  Yeah.  He tries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was gonna say, he tries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, I'm way down here.  Nobody succeeds all the time, but he tries.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm way down here at 119.  Whatever happened to 84 and 37?  Let's see.  What did you do to run down?  It's all the way, I'm way at the bottom now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For those of you who can't figure out what's going on,  it's just the spreadsheet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the line numbers of these two.  Every story has a line number.  Which we've never used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ant was the first person to ever use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It'd actually be a great start.  It was a major innovation.  Every line number has a story.  Zoom.  Oh, I loved Steve Gibson yesterday.  He had done a whole security now  on the white paper Zoom released  by the prestigious cryptographers they had hired  about how Zoom was gonna do end-to-end encryption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As in the Keybase people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Keybase and Alex Samos and a bunch of other people.  Okay.  But then Zoom's CEO said,  well, free users aren't gonna get end-to-end encryption.  There we go.  Because we want the police to be able  to see what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or you gotta pay for it, period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and actually there is a legitimate point to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alex Samos said it's not as simple as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Alex Samos has lost all credibility with me.  Oh, come on.  Oh, he has.  Listen to Steve's exegesis of the statement  that Samos, the tweets Samos put out  and the statement that Zoom put out.  I hadn't read it.  As he's reading it, I'm saying,  Steve, those are mutually incompatible statements.  They're saying it's clear this is window dressing in BS  that because the things that Zoom said they're gonna do,  it doesn't make any sense.  It doesn't make any sense.  And Samos' very lukewarm response on Twitter,  if you read between the lines, said,  hey, all we did is write the white paper.  It's up to Zoom to implement it.  He's not taking responsibility for the implementation.  Ah.  He isn't, read it carefully.  He's not.  It's like, well, all I can speak about is what we told him.  He's also not an employee, he's a consultant.  He's a consultant.  Consultant.  So it's very confusing.  Yuan told investors that encryption, he said, quote,  this is a quote, free users for sure.  We don't wanna give them that  because we also wanna work together with FBI,  with local law enforcement  in case some people use Zoom for a bad purpose.  Okay, fine.  Actually, I kinda understand that  because if you're using it for free,  they can't authenticate you.  They'd have no way of knowing who you are.  So, okay, maybe I understand that.  But the problem is that what they're trying to do  with encryption and then encryption even for paid users,  it's pretty clear from their statement  that Zoom does have the keys.  Zoom, that it's end-to-end encrypted,  but Zoom can unlock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so they can still see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can still give it to, so in my opinion,  this statement was to a complete attempt to,  I didn't catch that.  What is it magicians do?  Misdirect the press.  So that the press would go crazy about,  free users should get it too,  instead of really noticing what Zoom's doing,  which is we can give anything to law enforcement  because we have the keys, period.  Which means it's not, once again,  it's not end-to-end encrypted.  It's not end-to-end encrypted.  And so once again, they're misrepresenting  what they're doing as they always have.  And this is as Zoom has always acted.  So to me, I was giving them a lot of credit  because of the people they brought in,  but I think that was window dressing, honestly.  Zoom does not proactively monitor meeting content.  And we do not share information with law enforcement,  except in circumstances like child sex abuse.  Now this is the incompatible statements.  We do not have back doors where participants  can enter meetings without being visible to others.  Oh no, okay, that's not incompatible.  None of this will change.  Zoom's end-to-end encryption plan balances the privacy  of its users with the safety of vulnerable groups,  including children and potential victims of hate crimes.  We plan to provide end-to-end encryption to users  for whom we can verify identity,  thereby limiting harm to these vulnerable groups.  But wait, they just said they would share information  with law enforcement in circumstances like child sex abuse.  So which is it?  Is it end-to-end encrypted, or do they have the key?  They're very clearly saying, we have the key.  And if we think it's merited, we'll share it.  Well, guess what makes it merited?  A warrant, period.  Because if you have the key,  law enforcement can say, let's see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but they're arguing that it's being used  by child porn people, and they tend to use quick accounts.  And there's, I mean, I-  No, no, but they're saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we'll provide end-to-end encryption,  but then they're also saying,  we will not share information with law enforcement  except in circumstances like child sex abuse.  If they could share the information,  it's not end-to-end encryption.  They are mutually incompatible statements in one paragraph.  Right, true.  So Steve was kind of like, okay.  Good catch.  Yeah. Good catch.  Thank you, Steve.  That's why we love him.  So, but again, honestly, most of the time you're using,  by the way, and Zoom also said in that statement,  and nobody else does end-to-end encryption either.  And it's true this for most conferences,  like the conferences we use Zoom for,  sales calls and staff meetings,  who cares if it's encrypted.  But on the other hand, if you're a physician  or a psychiatrist using Zoom  for confidential calls with your clients,  maybe you should use something that is end-to-end encrypted,  not Zoom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would hope so anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it's very clear.  So I agree with you about Alex's tweets,  but I think if you read clearly, he's basically saying,  look, we gave them the way to do it,  but we're not taking any responsibility  for if they do it.  ACLU suing Los Angeles  over their controversial scooter tracking system.  Is there more to say about that?  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's just the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  No.  I need more scooters here.  I need more scooters here.  I need more scooters here.  I mean, this is what's sad is that Uber  and other companies are just taking them  and putting them in the scrap heap.  They're not reselling them or anything.  They're just trashing them.  Which is a waste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And bicycles.  You can't get a bike right now.  Right.  Yeah, you can't get one.  They're just crushing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't want to be responsible  because those bikes, I got to tell you,  having ridden rental bikes and rental scooters,  they're in pretty bad shape.  They don't want to be responsible for any injuries incurred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  More CYA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, would you like to do a changelog?  Does that feel good right now?  Because we got to wrap this up.  Before we go, how about a Google changelog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got one for Mr. Ant Pruitt.  Google Camera 7.4, which is the app not out yet,  but it will be out soon.  Rolling out with 1080p 4K resolution quick toggles.  And, oh, darn it.  It looked like XTA developers was saying 8X zoom,  but now Android police is saying  that it is or isn't available.  I don't know.  8X zoom for videos on the Pixel 4 and 4 XL.  I would hope not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds awful.  I hate these high zoom measurements.  Yeah, because it's not optical, right?  No, it's ridiculous.  Two to two and a half tops.  Is that acceptable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that's the ant limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's so pixelated and grainy,  the quality is just, ugh, it's not usable.  Stop at about two, two and a half at the most,  if it were me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had my phone on the cheat charger.  Let's see.  And system update, restart now.  Android R, here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you went with the beta, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what kind of video resolution I'll have,  but anyway, it's unclear what you're gonna get,  but keep your eye out for Google camera version 7.4.  It will apparently be rolling out soon,  maybe today on the Play Store.  8X for videos, yeah, that seems like too much.  Visit video resolution quick toggles, that I'd like,  because it's kind of deep in the settings  to change the video resolution, so it'd be nice to have that.  Because most of the time I just want to do 1080p,  but every once in a while I'd like to do 4K, right?  Be nice to be able to quickly switch.  Little party going on over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds like somebody's happy back there, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's just looking at her purple Jeep Wrangler  and smiling.  Google search wants to make Control F a thing of the past.  Man, I use that all the freaking time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I got scared when I saw this,  I was gonna have a fit, a Jeff fit,  but they're not gonna eliminate it,  they're just gonna say we're gonna not,  you're not gonna want to use it anymore.  You won't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What you searched for.  We'll show up, we'll be highlighted  and see how it's boldened.  See the headline writers.  It's boldened, yeah, headline writers.  It's still gonna have Control F  so you can search within a page,  but more likely you'll just note  that the term you searched for will be bold in the snippet  if they're still allowed to do snippets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was gonna say are there snippets still out there though?  What's the snippet status?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, by God, yes.  Forget the changelog,  we should just have a weekly snippet status, snippet status.  Say it three times fast.  No, but snippets.  YouTube makes video chapters official.  Oh, I'm so mad about this  because it means now that everybody's gonna be asking us  to do it.  Ant, would you, I don't want to  because it's too much work.  Makes our editors have to.  It's a lot of work.  Would you take advantage of this Ant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Negative.  It's nice for users because they can jump

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to the part of the thing that they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the videos that I particularly create  are 15 minutes or less.  So you don't need.  In my opinion, I'm like, there's no need for that.  You come there for a particular lesson  and I'm giving you that lesson in a condensed format  of 15 minutes or less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know who is using it, I think,  is Alex Lindsay in his office hours.  So, you know that he has these early morning calls  he does with creators.  You've been in there.  Yes, sir.  In fact, I'm gonna be on June 18th.  He's gonna have me on as a guest.  But you see how when you go to the notes here,  he's got the show notes, but next to it is a time  and you can click it and jump right  to that part of the call, which I think is wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's cool for something that's, you know,  an hour long.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The problem is somebody's gotta do it.  Yeah.  It ain't gonna be me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm pretty sure Mr. Lindsay isn't doing it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, he's not.  He even said there's a guy that does it for him.  It's a volunteer.  So if you add chapters to your video,  actually the way you do it is you do it  via the description.  You start a list of timestamps with zero colon zero zero  followed by a chapter title.  You do one on each line.  So you'd have to know where the timestamps are,  and that's what, as you can see, if you look here,  that's what Alex has done or his helper has done.  So as he was writing out the notes,  he just wrote out the times.  And what Google does automatically  is make that a direct link into the video,  which is, I think, really cool.  Nice feature for those who have more time than I do.  Available on desktop, Android, and iOS right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on, you have time.  You just have to make less sourdough.  I had to give you a hard time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm throwing away the sourdough now, making brisket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you make brisket, I mean, sourdough biscuits  with your brisket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh, brisket.  Yeah.  Actually, that's another thing I want to do, Ant.  Maybe I need a tutorial on that for you.  I want to make soft southern biscuits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's one thing I can't do.  You need the flour.  My biscuits are, I've never been able to get biscuits right.  Are they clinkers?  Oh, they're either bricks or they're like blocks of clay.  They're so brittle.  I can never get that science down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say you have to get that special flour  that you can't even buy it on Amazon from here.  You have to go to Greenville, South Carolina to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what they say.  Chop the wheat down.  Separate the wheat from the chaff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's special soft wheat.  Get a stone, water mill.  Stone ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube has published an in-depth guide to monetization.  It's not as easy as people may assume it is.  No, understand more clearly the types of content advertisers  may not wish to appear against.  Creators apparently often confused by why you can't put ads on some stuff.  We get this occasionally from advertisers who say,  we got one from an advertiser who said,  if you're going to talk about COVID-19, we don't want an ad on that show.  To which I said, screw you.  You're not telling me what to do in my show.  It's not like we're doing,  here's a special treatment for COVID-19 or something.  We're not selling silver underwear.  So I understand that they wouldn't want to be on a scammy thing.  Anyway, Google is talking about also hate content,  but prank content and other things that you just won't be able to monetize.  And so it's good.  They should tell people, frankly, what not to do.  Don't you think, Jeff?  Yeah.  On the other hand, as an editorial person,  I don't want to be told by an advertiser what not to do.  And I don't feel like that's...  Although it's their right to say I don't want my ads on that content.  So it's tricky.  It's tricky.  I'm glad Google's doing it transparently.  I love it that Google Maps and Apple Maps have both adapted to changes in DC street names.  Black Lives Matter Plaza is...  Quickly.  Quickly.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  It's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You saw they added on to that mural in yellow.  Defund police.  So I joked on Twitter today that Twitter was the new street and the street is the new Twitter.  You can just paint your big tweet on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, look at this.  This is so cool.  It's pretty amazing.  The satellite image shows it.  Google has not updated it.  We checked this yesterday on MacBreak Weekly.  The top is Google Maps.  The bottom is Apple Maps.  Apple Maps, I think they made an effort to get later satellite imagery  because that was only painted recently.  Google did rename the street on the map.  You can see it says Black Lives Matter Plaza, but they haven't yet updated it.  Isn't that great?  I think that's right.  It's so amazing.  I also, the mayor of DC says, you know, we're not going to take off the defund police.  That's free speech.  Free speech.  What a concept.  What a concept.  Imagine that.  Imagine that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I want a regulator to decide what's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I ever said that, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you didn't.  I'm mocking others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Others.  Google Search and Maps will soon display business hours for us old folks, Jeff.  It's always six in the morning.  Why is it always freaking six in the morning?  What do they get up to the bathroom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's when you and I are up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All the old folks are up early.  So you can now add to your Google, if you're a business, and you should add this, pick  up a delivery information, accessibility information, there's a whole bunch of stuff.  So you can now set store hours for seniors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Having a lot of stuff like that really does help you out in the search too, right?  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would bet.  Because I'm going to search, you know, where can I get a special senior discount?  At Applebee's.  Google, and I haven't had a chance to try this yet, has now added noise cancellation  to Meet.  We're going to have our editorial meeting tomorrow.  I mean, right after the show, actually.  Tomorrow?  No, no, sorry, Ant.  Didn't mean to say that.  Right after the show.  So I'm going to make some tapping noises in the background.  I'm going to start vacuuming.  I'm going to get the dog to bark and we'll see if we can hear it.  Because supposedly...  Just like any other meetings.  Just like any other meeting.  Supposedly, poor Google Meet.  They are in third place.  Zoom, obviously in first place, just 30 times increase in usage between December and April.  Phenomenal.  30 times.  Has had 100 million daily meeting participants in the month of April.  But that's nothing compared to the 300 million Zoom has.  And Microsoft has claims 200 million on Teams.  So 3, 2, 1.  And that is the Google changelog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Were you shocked that James Bennett resigned?  In the end, no.  Jeff?  No, he was kind of...  Opinion editor at the New York Times who claimed, it's kind of hard to believe, I never read  that Tom Cotton editorial before I published it.  How could that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think he didn't read it?  It could be.  Dow, who's under him and charged with bop-head, has left his job and is going somewhere in  the newsroom now.  So, you know, he's throwing people under the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dow said to Bennett, I read it, you don't have to read it.  Just put it in the paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good.  With a really inflammatory headline over the inflammatory text.  Yeah, good idea.  Good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alexis Ohanian, quit from Reddit, says you could fill my board seat with a black candidate.  It says, OK, deal.  He also pledges a million dollars to Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights camp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I didn't know...  When did this happen?  I didn't know about that.  A couple of days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A couple of days ago he quit, but I think they just replaced him today.  Oh, did they replace him?  Yeah, they replaced him with the founder of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Michael Siebel.  Thank you.  He's CEO of Y Combinator and Justin TV founder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He also was the founder of Justin TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I probably know the guy.  That's awesome.  Good for you.  Perfect.  Perfect person to put in that seat.  And Alexis is busy.  He doesn't need that.  No, Alexis is...  He's doing fine.  Doing fine.  Doing fine.  But I think that's really...  I mean, I think that's more than lip service.  That's saying...  It is.  We need better representation on the board of Reddit.  And I think that's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As many folks in my community have said over the last few years, we just want a seat at  the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  You want to be in the room where it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's pretty damn awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yay.  Yay.  And I'm so pleased that Netflix won in its copyright battle against the United States  military because they copyrighted the term Space Force First.  Air Force says, you can't call that show Space Force.  Actually, they're not worried about that.  It's the t-shirts.  They don't want them to sell t-shirts.  But the...  Have you watched the show?  Yeah, I watched the whole thing.  I actually liked it.  Everybody got the worst reviews ever.  I want former TV guide critic Jeff Jarvis to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't queued, but I haven't watched it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  People were hoping it would be another Veep, that it would be biting satire because the  An unnamed president has created a branch of the Air Force called Space Force and he  says, we're going to have boots on the moon by 2026.  And Steve Carell is the four star general put in charge.  And it could have been like Veep where it's biting satire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which I still watch to this day on my Plexer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Veep is the most amazing show ever.  John Malkovich plays the chief scientist in there.  He's fabulous in it.  He's got the scientist voice too.  He's perfect.  As one reviewer said, he's perfectly louche.  But they didn't go for the biting comedy.  They didn't go for the satire.  They went for the just kind of like, oh, it's nice.  You feel Steve Carell turns out to be a really nice guy with lots of principles and it just  doesn't have the edge to it.  I enjoyed it.  I laughed out loud a few times.  I'll watch it.  I look forward to watching it.  My favorite part, or one of my favorite parts, at least appropriate to this audience is the  social media expert who's played by Ben Schwartz.  It's very funny.  Oh man, really?  Schwartz is in this too?  Yeah.  And his name, I can't even say on the show because it's an Italian name, but they make  it sound really, every time they say his name, it sounds obscene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not John Raphael.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's very funny, I have to say.  And he is the worst social media guy ever.  He is like exactly what you'd expect.  It's hysterical.  I thought it was funny.  It wasn't what it could have been, which is a biting political satire.  How many VEEPs are there in the world after all?  Let us do our picks.  You have a thing.  You have several things, Mr. Ant Pruitt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just two, just two.  I have one in particular for the Twitch audience.  Ben recommended this to me a year or so ago and I still use this service and it's called  WenderStat.  I can't remember her name.  I'm sorry, I don't remember your name at this moment, but you recommended it to me on Twitter.  And man, this thing really does save my bacon from time to time.  It allows me to go in and see what's chewing up all of my disk space.  And it usually ends up being some temp folder that I don't need anymore.  It does a great job of allowing you to go in and just pick out exactly where the problem  is.  It just puts it in this big old colorful chart.  So it makes it easy to find and not having to let Microsoft try to find it for you.  It's so much faster.  And for people like you Linux nerds, there is a Linux version available called CaterStat.  And I believe there's also an OS X version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Disk Inventory X, which I've used.  I've recommended all three for years.  It's often the case, Windows is the worst at this, where you have just, you can't figure  out where the hell my drive go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it just disappeared.  I used it yesterday and saved 20 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, those big blogs.  20 gigs?  Yeah, I know, it's amazing.  We used to think a two gig hard drive was huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh gosh, man.  Yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's free.  Oh, another reason, Jeff, you should watch Space Force.  I forgot.  Jin Yang's on it.  Oh, right.  We love him.  He is really good in it.  He's hysterical in it with that same dry humor that he had.  Have you watched his stand up?  Have you watched his stand ups?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's got a stand up special on Netflix too.  I haven't watched it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because he's very, very deadpan hysterical, just as good as he was in Silicon Valley.  And they actually give him a much meteor roll.  So nice.  Good for him.  So WindorStat.net.  I agree.  And it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's free, free, free, free.  And do you want to do the Curtis Jackson too?  Yep.  My other one is a book called Hustle Harder Hustle Smarter by Curtis Jackson.  AKA.  Also known as 50 Cent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  50 cents as we white folks call him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just got this book on Audible last week or so.  And I haven't started it yet, but I wanted to recommend it anyway because I know a bit  of his story.  And between him and Ice Cube, when you think about where they came from in the very beginning  as far as their humble living and the things that they dealt with in the day to day lifestyle  with the violence and stuff like that, then getting into the music industry and just grassroots  and blowing up and just getting all of this fame and fortune and then being able to pivot  even more from the music industry to get into Hollywood, if you will.  Ice Cube has done an amazing job with writing his own movies and things of that nature.  50 cents the same way.  He's done a lot outside of the music industry and continues to just keep growing and just  as he says, hustling harder and smarter.  And he deserves the credit.  Granted, he is one of the best trolls out there on the internet.  He's been trolling people.  If people want to learn how to troll, follow 50 Cent because he does a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I admire him because you see so many guys make it big in the music industry, make millions  of dollars and then not handle it.  So I do admire that.  And Fitty narrates it, if you get the audiobook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I said I had to go ahead and get that because I know his story and just selling  music out of the trunk of a car and stuff like that and look at him now.  You know, this is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's nice.  That's awesome.  Mr. JJ Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see here.  I already gave up one of them.  I think the other one that I would do is national TV advertising fell by 26 percent in April  year over year.  Now we expect that's somewhat temporary, but some of that money that flies away, it doesn't  need to be on TV.  He's going to learn to be on TV and then going to come back.  So newspaper advertising is way down.  Magazine advertising is way down.  TV advertising is down.  Podcast advertising is way down.  Podcast advertising is way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I keep thinking, though, that it's just a matter of time before and I still believe  this will happen.  We take a chunk of that general media buy because we work so much better than the general  media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  They just got to learn the ways they've got to learn while they've been wasting their  money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Someday that day will come.  Our advertisers know it.  But you know, you need other advertisers.  We need General Motors, General Mills, all the generals we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just saw two new advertisers come by in the email.  So that's good news.  That's good.  Oh, gee, I haven't seen that.  One one new advertiser, one giving away nice things at the front desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, there is.  There is a call tomorrow with one new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Is there?  OK, I'll be setting up my Traeger grill right at that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you might want to check email, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't read my email.  I don't want I don't read no email.  I don't read no stinking email.  I don't I didn't do any pick or anything.  I was lazy.  That's fine.  It's late.  It's late.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is so damn wonderful to have you.  We got to get him back on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just.  Yeah, the reason I felt like I felt like I put in a bad situation because to sit in  between Jeff and Stacey as they shoot at each other, I said it's the best seat in the house.  It's a good seat.  But if you but any time you want to do what's really happening is Stacey and I are fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Leo is trying to goad us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go, go.  I love watching it.  I'm goading you.  That's definitely one of my favorites of the week.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should probably mention I meant I hate to do this again because I picked it already  But it's such a good deal and there's only a few days left.  If you like games, itch.io is an indie game site.  Itchio.  And they have an amazing bundle.  And really it's as much a story as anything else.  The bundle keeps getting bigger.  Independent creators keep giving their game, putting in games in it.  There are now in this bundle one thousand five hundred nine independent games for five  dollars.  And many of them cost more than five dollars by themselves.  They've got 1198 creators putting in for this.  It's a reminds me of Humble Bundle.  It's like a Humble Bundle.  But it's the biggest bundle I've ever seen.  And it's raised more money than I've ever seen.  It's like a million dollars.  Yes.  They call it the bundle for racial justice and equality.  And this is again, this is the kind of thing that gives me hope.  Proceeds will be split 50-50 with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the  Community Bail Fund, which divvies out its money to community bail funds all over the  country.  So they were shooting for five million dollars as five days as we record five days left.  They have already they have 398,000 sales.  The average sale is not five dollars, but ten dollars, because when you buy you can  give more.  The top contribution somebody threw in five grand.  Wow.  They have raised four point three million dollars for racial justice and equality.  And so there really are a number of stories here.  A, wow, 1500 games for five bucks.  B, wow, four point three million dollars.  C, all of this for racial justice and equality.  And it gives me hope that we maybe this isn't 1968 all over again.  We're finally going to do something.

And what's interesting and games get a bad rap, but invariably when gamers on Twitch  or the bundles try to raise money for great causes, they raise millions, millions.
