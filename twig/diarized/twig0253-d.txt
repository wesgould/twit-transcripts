Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello. Good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now with layered hair.  You look like an Indian princess now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, thank you. I got to get ready for I.O. It's close.  I can't look like a work-at-homer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no. Got to get some pants.  I got to look like somebody who goes outside.  Yeah. Also, Jeff Jarvis. He is here, too.  He's a professor of journalism, City University of New York,  the author of What Would Google Do in Private Parts, and a blogger at BuzzMachine.com.  And I'm still pink.  Each week. Yeah, well, you're home.  Gina's glamorous. I'm pink.  You're pink.  Jeff and I are the gray hairs. We have to have a young, attractive woman.  Oh, he's green now.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ooh, getting Avatar like there. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yow.  Somebody just sent me a link for an Android beer dispenser.  I don't know how useful that will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Android smart home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Running. It looks like a Galaxy Note maybe in there.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  I actually believe that's rather old.  I think that's a Moto Zoom in there.  Oh, it is a Zoom.  I actually think I've seen that for a long time.  It says Motorola. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've exhumed the Zoom.  Well, that's the only good use for a Motorola Zoom.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Exhumed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dispensing beer.  Jeff, I loved your Entertainment Weekly proposal.  I'm sorry. I know this is totally off topic,  but Jeff published his original proposal for Entertainment Weekly,  and I absolutely loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Neil Dash tweeted it and said how timely it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a woman named Anne Helen Peterson who published on The All,  this unbelievably long, I can't imagine animals would care,  but a lot of people do,  a piece on the tortured, synergy-ridden life of Entertainment Weekly.  And I dread reading things like that,  like I'm going to get smashed again, but I didn't.  It was very well thought through, really well researched.  Turns out it was a...  I was going to say it was going to be a chapter of her dissertation,  so she actually probably had footnotes and things.  She wrote a dissertation on Entertainment Weekly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the history of Entertainment Weekly.  Well, on gossip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, on gossip.  She wrote a PhD in gossip.  Oh, what a great subject.  And so she had a chapter evidently on EW, and she published it.  Whether it was part of the dissertation or not, I don't know,  but I read it with fascination,  and it inspired me to put up, to scan and put up my original proposal for EW,  and at the end of the scan is the rejection that it received.  A magazine proposal,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Ultimate Entertainment Guide, Jeff Jarvis, January 31, 1984.  I'm proposing an entertainment guide,  a magazine that would come to the aid of the consumer in a very confusing time.  As Anil Dash pointed out,  this was about the same time Michael Jackson's hair caught on fire  in the Pepsi commercial.  Today there's... that's one of the confusion sources.  Today there's simply too much to choose from.  Movies, network TV, cable TV, satellite TV.  His new thing is called video cassettes.  Video cassettes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cassette tapes and VCRs. They were so cute.  It's 1984, remember.  Music on radio, on records, on cassettes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now, he says, on compact discs.  Compact discs.  Wow.  I remember that's about when I bought my first CD, actually.  At least I didn't have laser discs in there.  And let's not forget books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was trying to imagine you sitting at a typewriter, Jeff.  I was like, wow, he typed this on a typewriter or someone typed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  That was typed probably on my Osborne 1 and my gigantic $2,300 neck printer.  Yeah, but it is a typeface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like...  It was an impact printer.  It was an impact hole printer.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The magazine would review and give you stories about all this entertainment,  concentrating on the programs rather than the people.  Ah, see, now it says, as opposed to the magazine I work for now,  did you work for people?  I work for people.  I have it up here, Chad.  I don't know what you're looking at.  It would also devote some, but far fewer pages to hardware educating,  advising readers and so on, what to look for in a VCR.  VCR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How to...  Should have added, and how to get rid of the damn flashing 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Flashing 12.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's new in TV sets?  Sets, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That ages me.  It'd be easy and cheap to start up, not too expensive, prone to solid growth.  Why the time is right.  This is very cool.  You know, I wish I had some of the early treatments I did for things like the site.  I would love to have those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you go down to the last two pages of that PDF, are the rejection received?  By who is BMG?  Henry Grunwald, the then editor-in-chief of Time Bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, thanks for sending me the driver's memorandum about the entertainment magazine.  I'm afraid I'm not high on this.  On the surface, it makes a lot of sense, but the rationale falls apart when you really look at it.  The market for entertainment is so broad, I think it is difficult.  He was wrong, by the way, but okay.  I think it's difficult, if not impossible, to create a single magazine or guide for it.  For instance, the people who watch television are not necessarily the people who read books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the killer sentence.  That was the killer sentence.  People who watch TV don't read books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if one were to stick strictly to home entertainment, i.e. the tube, there would be lots of problems.  We only know too well how difficult it is to provide cable listings.  Cassette reviews? Hardly needed weekly. Perhaps not even monthly.  I suspect people are satisfied with the handouts they get in video shops.  And the occasional reviews in other publications.  Still, there could be something for the cassette market, but it might be more like a catalog than a magazine.  Who is this nitwit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was actually the brilliant, frightening Austrian editor-in-chief of Time.  You could do that in a German accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Movie reviews? Plenty of those everywhere.  Besides, this is a very minor issue. I doubt there really is a broad market for Jarvis' vision of opinionated and provocative reviews.  I suspect the majority of moviegoers don't pay any attention to reviews.  Oh man, did he get that wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  This is pre-rotten tomatoes.  Wow, potatoes is like the first thing I look at.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's not an 80 or a better on rotten tomatoes, I'm going to go see it.  News and gossip, there's plenty of that. No one needs news and gossip.  Equipment? Well, that's quite a different matter.  And unless you are an absolute electronic nut, you don't need to keep up with this regularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, forget your company, fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who needs? There will never be more. You will buy one VCR and TV in your whole life.  We'll need 20 shows about all of this.  Yeah. Of course, I could be wrong, but with so many other things going on, I would not.  And did that kill it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That killed it for the rest of his regime.  And then a new editor took charge and he wanted to make his mark by starting a magazine.  And a guy on the business side thought he had had this idea on his own.  And then someone said, no, Jarvis wrote this memo two years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have it here somewhere. It's in my files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so it started six years after I proposed it.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this what people did in 1984? They like typed out letters and then 18 months later they replied to one another?  They replied to one another by typing out of a letter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were too young to remember this, Gina, but yes.  I was nine years old in 84.  And then a human being would come, would get the letter, would bring it to a facility where we were routed by a carrier pigeon.  And then another human being would pick it up and deliver it to your door, ringing the doorbell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Insano.  Insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should have brought this home. I have it at the office.  So we made a bunch of covers.  There's one prototype cover on my blog I put up of the Wonder Years.  It's a wonder of solider.  That's a great cover.  And we had to make other materials, some fake inside spreads and other things.  That was made so we could make junk mail.  And in a junk mail, we sent this out. This is now illegal to do. It's called dry testing.  In the junk mail, we would send out and say, we have this new magazine called Entertainment Weekly.  Would you like to buy it? Here's the deal. First four issues free.  And then we'd see how many people would come and send in the cards to order the magazine.  Before you even had a magazine.  Yeah. And then we would tell them, oops, we don't have a magazine. Here's people instead, which is all illegal now.  It's like minimal viable product, but with paper. It's awesome.  So somewhere I've got, there's a picture of like a coffee table with issues of fake Entertainment Weekly spread out.  And the guy with the bowl of popcorn and a remote control and some videotapes all on the junk mail.  So we had to make that. I made one cover with Roseanne Barr and Murphy Brown.  Yeah. And I said the cover billing was kiss cause cause be goodbye.  Wow. So you were trying to be provocative. Yeah, exactly.  You know, the sassy woman kind of thing. Right.  Right. And so cause be hated me because I have faxed hate mail from Cosby.  And I actually adore Bill Cosby and love the show. But toward the end of the show, it got to be pretty.  I dared to say so. So he had it out to me. So he got a copy of the junk mail and had somebody.  This is before Photoshop had somebody remake it. So it said kiss Jarvis goodbye.  Wow. Wow. Wow. Sensitive much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he really didn't like you. Wow.  No, this is fun.  Bill Cosby. I read Entertainment Weekly. I loved Entertainment Weekly.  Actually, but it was a little bit too. It probably was too smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this long, long, long piece by Alan Helen Peterson argued that the first critics were there to to be too snarky.  I don't know that was the case, but we definitely got in trouble.  This is the time when Time Inc. was going to merge at first with Paramount and then with Warner to become Time Warner.  And so the way I suffered the synergy beast was that we were being too mean to Hollywood, which was their new industry.  And they weren't so stupid as to say you're being mean to Warner Brothers, but they did. Right.  One of the top editors. My conceit that I brought to the magazine was to have grades for review for reviews.  That's what we did at People. I did at People.  And so I did that at EW. And one of the top top top editors of Time Inc.  sat down and calculated the grade point average of our of our grades every week to say that we're being too mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the or maybe they're making too much junk. Yeah.  Everything that my point. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the movie critic at the time, Owen Gleiberman, gave a bad review to Pretty Woman.  And this sent them into a fit of epiplexy because clearly he was wrong because the box office said people like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're wrong. You're wrong. That's why we have Rotten Tomatoes. Yep.  Exactly. Now you can separate the critics from the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So thank you for that little little little jump down the plane. I love it. Yeah.  Really fun. Cool. I've got a box of files like that downstairs. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Start one by every week. Release another. Yeah. I should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Original documents. Yeah. There was another another one. One more. One more.  So so the first design of the magazine was cluttered and was a mess.  And I had to defend it at the time. But the truth was it was a mess.  We did a very fast redesign within 15 weeks.  But I remember that one of the top editors of Time Inc. at the time said, you're using this this postmodern font.  It was it was Caslon, which was like the third font ever created.  And there's this huge sculpture in the lobby of Time Inc.'s building of Caslon that was there.  Medieval typographer. A little like geek moment. Postmodern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You postmodern. How funny.  Well, is Entertainment Weekly still published? It is. You can still get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, it is. It almost died once.  But, you know, it lives on right now. So God bless it.  And it's nice to have the baby there. I mean, if I if I propose that magazine today, it wouldn't be a magazine at all.  Right. It'd be a platform for people. Right. Right. Tomatoes.  It'll be it'll be TMZ or something. Yeah.  Well, no. That. Geez, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  EW.com. For a while, I was really into the iPad app.  The EW must list is basically just like top 10.  Yeah. Top 10 books you should read. Top 10 shows. Top 10 movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I liked about EW. You could see what you should read. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that. One of my favorite features, Joan Feeney, who was my my number two throughout the launch, was just a brilliant, brilliant editor.  She had a feature called the Book Browser where it was just the first paragraph of eight new books out each week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that. Now you can get Kindle, you can get the first chapter and you're going. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So first issues, the magazine also had part. Sorry, I'll stop now.  It had a you got me going. You can't even go out.  It had a tear out hard card where she was perforated bookmark size so you could mark the shows that you wanted to watch and you could cut them out and paste them onto your videotapes because no one ever labeled their videotapes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was a head on technology, guys. Boy, I was I was right there at the cutting edge.  The perforated edge of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not cutting, actually more like abrading the abrading.  So as you were saying, Leo, Google, Google about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm sorry for the detour there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the pre Kim Kardashian era of celebrity. It's changed a lot.  It really has changed a lot. Well, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep you going here. So so I was actually there at the cusp of when it changed.  I remember Pat Ryan, my beloved mentor, editor People magazine, who died recently.  She screamed down the hall one day when the cover sales results came in and she said TV's dead Jarvis.  And it's because used to be at People magazine.  You know, Dallas is a top 10 show. Put a Dallas cover on its cells.  Boom, done. But then fragmentation came in.  And so we weren't all trapped for the same three shows.  Gina, you may think it was cute to watch Gilligan's Island.  Network TV was dead. It was hell.  And so suddenly that's when people and companies shifted to bodily fluids journalism.  To death and scandals and affairs and disease and all that, because it was the way the cell covers.  That was where the opportunity for EW really came in, was to get back to the products, not the personalities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, now I'll shut up. TV's dead Jarvis. TV's dead. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google owns a satellite now, a half billion dollar purchase.  Multiple satellites, I think.  Multiple satellites, half a billion for Skybox Imaging, which is a micro satellite startup.  Skybox, do they own their own satellites?  I think they put up little satellites. They're little baby satellites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and they have incredible, they are live HD from satellite.  Wow, that's got to be very expensive to launch.  The second link has a video.  Yeah, here's the video from Skybox Imaging.  Not wildly compelling, but what it does is it shows that if you see like a plume coming out of a factory,  you see the plume coming out and you can measure that plume to measure the output.  All kinds of further data that come with richer imagery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think a lot of people look at Google Earth and Google satellite imaging on the Google Maps and think it's live.  I mean, we don't, but I think a lot of people do. I told the story before where we were watching.  Yeah, we were watching the chase, the manhunt for the Boston bomber.  And Jennifer said, well, why can't they just check the Google satellite to see if he's in that boat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, wow. I mean, how far are we from that really?  Well, apparently not so far.  Yeah, not so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Germans are going to go nutsy on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the plume. Here's the plume. You can see the plume coming out of the in real time.  It looks like it's black and white.  Seems like this would be for a spy. This would be a boon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm imagining the spies have long had this.  This is commercial ability now.  Surely the spies have had this. We just don't know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now it'll be easier if you're a small time spy. You just use Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like it's some of Google's whole business is consumerization of spy gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's interesting, isn't it? It's interesting.  That's an interesting Google Glass. Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Coming soon to you, the shoe phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They must. I would love to know more about Skybox, like how much they've spent to get these up there, how many they have.  They're not the only one even apparently doing this.  There are competitors. How crowded is it up there?  Yeah. Planet Labs makes satellites that are smaller than Skyboxes so it could send more up.  But the imagery isn't as good. Earthcast spelled with URTH.  A Vancouver competitor offers high resolution video imagery, but has no satellites of its own.  It uses the Russian end of the International Space Station.  Wow. What an interesting. So these are high def real time videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does this have any relation to there's there's mention of the cloud.  Is this also a communications purchase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it seems like this is this is about creating data from images.  So raw imagery created by satellite cameras can be hard to decode and process for non experts.  So Skybox hopes to sell information, not imagery.  So it seems like Skybox is going to do is really going to tell you, you know,  how many people are online at the Shake Shack or how full the Walmart parking lot is or like how many shipping containers.  Or in that port, you know, kind of live.  It sounds like that's what they're trying to do, which is just those examples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, if you if you counted the Walmart parking lot before Christmas, what do you know about the economy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you count the hugely valuable stuff, she's Wall Street alone would pay billions for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus, you have the ability to recognize what a shipping container looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And being able to measure the you know, the diameter of a plume and figure out what the emissions are.  I mean, I think that's what Skybox is offering, not just that, not just live imagery, imagery,  which is kind of has obvious plug in some maps and Earth.  Right. But like figuring out what that represents.  I mean, me and my friends watch the Shack cam constantly to see when the line is short to run to lunch.  Really? Oh, wow. Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Shake Shack has come a long way from the Cambridge coffee pot cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The first can you get it? What do you get to Shake Shack, Gina?  What's your order?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still kind of a noob to New York, like back in New York.  So I get kind of like the standard Shack burger fries.  A friend of mine did some calorie counts and figured out that the fries are more calories than the hot dogs.  They'll get like a hamburger and the hot dog.  I'm still sort of in the sort of the very standard order.  Like it's like the number one. It's not even that they don't have a lot of a lot of variety with the burgers.  So there's quite a line in Shake Shack right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to warn you, I'm just checking the Shack cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There always is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is quite a line.  There always is.  Look at that. It goes all the way around.  It's lemmings, man. It's lemmings.  Well, I've never heard of it. I've never been there.  What am I missing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just a burger. It's a good burger, but it's just a burger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good burger. It is just a burger. It's true.  But so now if Skybot could tell me how long it is from the time that I arrive at Shake Shack until I have a burger in my mouth, that's useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there just one in Madison Square Park or are there other Shake Shacks?  No, no, no. There's one near me now.  They're all over. The one in Brooklyn has a much shorter line.  They apparently also have a custard calendar so you can plan your custards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, good custard. When you come to New York, Leo, we'll do Shack. Unless Jeff sounds somewhat against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm not against it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Biscuits and jam? Custard?  So custard is a frozen ice cream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember that much from my time back East.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got it. It does. It's a little bit of a cult thing here.  People are down with the shack. It's a hipster thing.  It's a hipster thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's no different from California and the Focaccia. Not that great in and out burger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like in and out burger, but there's never a line like this for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's better than in and out though. I think it's much more dramatically better than in and out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good. I don't take that away from you.  Anyway, I don't need a diaper.  Is it an altar to worship upon? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think it's so funny that this is exactly what this skybox is doing, is to give you an idea of how the line is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, right, that sounds like that's what they're promising. And that's right up Google's alley, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, the other thing Google is saying is that they want to use this as internet access as part of their billion dollar plan to wire the world.  I don't know how they would do that. I guess these things already have communications.  Maybe they could reverse engineer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know, imagine you Google something that you want to go pick up at your local Target and Google knows the Target parking lot is packed, which it always is here in Brooklyn, especially, and says, hey, why don't we shopping express that to you instead?  I mean, that's a very simple example. But I mean, from a consumer standpoint, that's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, if Jeff Bezos is going to launch drones, somebody's going to have to do the real time navigation.  Maybe this is a this is Jeff's going to have his. How many of these little things are we going to have in the sky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing between. Yeah, that's the thing.  I mean, it's a hilarious war between Bezos and Zuckerberg and Page.  Now, Page, Bren, the effort to put little things in the sky above us is going to it's just it's just going to dry.  I tried to taunt the editor of the most light newspaper in Germany.  Is that me? Dinging with this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why am I? I'm sorry. I'm trying to turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure it's you. I'm pretty. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's I'm trying to figure out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chad's saying it's me. I assume that it was you.  But then you assume because well, oh, Chad, it's most likely a textual.  Well, it's because I was looking at my sources and I couldn't figure out what you can't tell from the me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Definitely me. It's off. It is off. Carry on. Sorry.  My bad. My bad. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only thing I could tell was I'm coming through a microphone.  And so I thought it was your mic, Leo. You assumed it was I who I was doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is there air traffic control for satellites?  It seems like there ought to be at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are. Well, you know, you saw the story last week of the satellite that NASA handed over to a bunch of hackers to take over and do new things.  You remember that story? No. Wow. It went by this.  It went kind of around the sun and and it came back into it and do I think in a synchronous orbit of Earth and they allowed these hackers to take it over themselves.  Hackers is not the word, not the right word, but that's how the story is.  Right. Yeah. Because, yeah, it was going to like we're going to always quite right.  Right. So technologists volunteer technologists.  Yes. So anyway, part of the point made about it was if it's out of control, it's like a giant Cuisinart in the sky and could start cutting up other satellites.  And Senator Bullock ends up flying between satellites and horrible things happen.  We're going to I'm surprised we don't see that story all the time.  There's there's a lot of crap up there. Yeah. No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Space junk that goes really fast.  I'm shrieking.  Apparently, I've lost some geek points for not knowing about the hacker satellite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, oh, well, those key points come over to me because there are there is no loss.  There are no lost points on Earth.  It's zero sum points you lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just you just gained my.  So if you search for jerk face, Google.  Sir, keep Britain's picture pops up, which I think is kind of interesting.  This is all thanks to violet blue writing on ZD net.  Thanks for nothing.  Jerk face.  It's a ridiculous column.  I will say. Well, let's talk about it because, you know, on the one hand, it does feel a little bit.  Well, I knew you would defend it.  So here's where it starts with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It starts with him confessing that he shouldn't have been involved personally in Google Plus because he's not social.  He doesn't understand social.  He said at a conference last week that Google Plus was a mistake for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says I'm kind of a weirdo.  It was probably a mistake for me to be working on anything tangentially related to social to begin with, which I think is hilarious, but also very candid and open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Me too. And he's saying I'm anti social.  He's just saying, you know, I'm not a bad influence on it.  I think that's fine.  She goes off ranting, just using that as an excuse to rant about how she can't stand Google and Google Plus.  OK, but that wasn't that wasn't the launching pad for that.  That's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She says Google Plus broke our trust.  Now, she was a victim of the Nim Wars last year or the year before, even though she swears violet blue is her real name.  Which it may be. I don't know. I don't know her.  Apparently many people around here do.  But she does bring up this interesting case of somebody who was undergoing a gender reassignment who got outed to her work.  Because I'm not sure what the details were, but she had a pseudonym and a real name and the pseudonym got mixed with a real name in the Google Plus grand mixing of things.  And people started to find out about stuff she didn't want them to know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At the time of Google Plus, there was a lot of stuff about the names.  I haven't heard a peep about that until this for well more than a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, people got mad about YouTube being forced to use a real name on YouTube.  But I got over that too.  They seem to. In fact, it's improved YouTube comments.  So bingo.  But I think there are reasons for anonymity.  But I guess you wouldn't want to use Google Plus then.  And you know, the real problem is that it's pretty obvious that this benefits Google to have you use a real name because then they can aggregate all the signals from your real name together to make a better picture of you.  And really, that's the accusation at the end.  She says with Google Plus, it became clear we were all little more than webs of flesh spun over packages of saleable data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So don't use it.  So don't use it.  It's hard not to.  There was a response to another column.  Just don't use it.  Then don't sit in their self-driving cars.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think she feels betrayed.  She felt like Google was a company that we wanted to trust.  We thought we could trust.  And now we find out we can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where I still...  Yes, I'm defending them once again.  But I forget who it was who wrote the response to her.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also on ZDNet, another ZDNet columnist who responded.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who just said, listen, like you didn't know this, Apple makes things.  Microsoft makes software.  Google makes advertising.  Grow up.  And this is what their business model is.  There's absolutely no surprise to this.  This is the deal.  You get these great free things.  But yeah, they're going to use your identity.  And that's the way it works.  I'm kind of sympathetic, though.  I like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I want to like Google and trust them.  So I'm a little sympathetic.  I mean, maybe it's a mistake, but we do it all the time.  Apple, people...  You know, Apple's a company.  But people feel this strong affinity for it.  Google, I think the same thing, where they feel like,  well, maybe we can trust them.  So what you're saying, Jeff, is grow up.  You shouldn't have trusted them in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm quoting that guy who said it.  But I'm agreeing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  Google is as Google does, was his response.  It's Jason Perlo.  And he says, well, I empathize with Violet over her experiences  and how the social network has been managed.  I wish to point out that Google co-founder Sergey Brin  admitting to recode, which is made up of the richest  and most powerful people in the technology industry,  that it is a personal involvement, Google Plus was probably a mistake,  is not at all uncharacteristic of the way Google has been conducting itself  since, well, forever.  I don't want to defend Google, he says, or writes.  I'm paraphrasing.  I work for one of its competitors.  I don't agree with many of the things they do.  I do encourage people to look for alternatives to Google.  But in this situation, the only thing I can offer Violet is,  paraphrasing the immortal worlds of Forrest Gump, Google is as Google does.  If you're going to use Google services, it's part of the deal.  I've been saying something like that all along.  You can't be surprised that Facebook aggregates your information.  You're getting a free service.  And the payment you give them for your free services,  your personal information and your attention.  And it's the same with Google, right?  But I do think we're going to start to see, and we're already seeing this,  this very interesting polarization between the Apple, Microsoft side  and the Google, Facebook side,  where Apple and Microsoft are going to step forward, true or not,  and say, well, we protect your information.  We protect your privacy.  Use us and you will be safe.  And Google and Facebook say, we're giving you great free stuff.  And as a result of the things we know, we can give you predictive stuff like Google Now,  which Apple can't do.  And you'll have the choice.  It would be great if everybody had a choice and could choose privacy or openness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not privacy you're choosing.  That's the misnomer that I go nuts upon.  You know, you subscribe to a newspaper and they know your address,  so they get it to you.  And they used you to target certain ads to you.  And ever thus, media is as media is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's where the real betrayal could happen.  I mean, Google's never made any bones about it, nor has Facebook.  So in that sense, you really shouldn't be, you shouldn't protest too much.  If Google says we're going to use your personal information, that's what they do.  That's the deal. It's always been the deal.  But Apple and Microsoft saying, no, don't be scrugelled.  We'll take care of you.  And if they then betray, that's a big betrayal.  Then that is more significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Google, if Google betrays, it's a big betrayal.  I don't think Google has betrayed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what Violet says betrayal is, is, is associating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google screwed up on the names for a while, but then they fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, she doesn't like the names, but she's ultimately the problem is that Google sees us as a,  what is it, a fleshy web around assailable data.  Well, yeah. Right?  That is what else they're going to see us as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's welcome to the media business model.  The problem I have is that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a little simple. It's a little bit reductionist, though,  because you could say the same thing about any advertising-supported media like Twitter.  You could say Twitter's business model is to deliver attention to advertisers.  But that's reductionist, because yes, that's not untrue.  It is our business model to deliver eyeballs to advertisers.  That's how we make money.  But that is not what motivates us, what moves us, what gets us excited about what we do,  what gets us up and out of bed every morning.  It's the way we can pay for what we really love to do,  which is to give you information about technology.  So it's reductionist, not untrue, but reductionist to say,  well, Google's just treating you as a packet of assailable data.  That's just their business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is indeed an exchange of value.  And the exchange of value isn't just that I get free stuff.  The exchange of value is also that I get higher relevance.  I get better stuff because they know who I am.  Now let's turn violet blue positively apoplectic purple.  If you go to the third from the bottom within the Google section,  Google imagines people as applications.  This was a-  From information week.  It was a patent found from 2012,  but it's actually kind of mind-bendingly fascinating  because what it says is that technology,  I'll be eager to hear what Gina thinks about this.  It says the technology is built around the notion of an application.  If you instead turn that around, and to that we add people.  Oh, I'm in mail now. I'll email Leo.  Oh, I'm in chat now. I'll chat with Gina.  But it's about- It's organized around the application.  If instead you organize around the people.  So here's my Leo world.  Hmm, I could send Leo a video.  I could email him. I could chat with him.  I could do this. I could do that.  If you re-or if you flip the organization,  the taxonomy of technology and connections  and organize it around people instead of applications,  what does that world look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To understand what this means,  this is a patent application that came from the Chrome team in 2012.  It was published last week.  You have to understand a little bit of the history  of computer operating systems and science.  And I know Gina will remember this.  For a while we were talking about a document-centric way of computing.  So computing, the way it evolved,  and it evolved haphazardly, was around applications.  But a lot of people said,  well really an application is just a way of processing data.  What if we had a document-centric way of looking at computing?  And Microsoft tried this. Apple tried this.  And it was kind of a flop,  where everything would start with a document.  I think this is just another way of recontextualizing  what's going on here to make it more efficient.  And say, well really it's not applications, it's not data.  What it really is is people.  That makes sense, Gina, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean it does make sense.  If you look at particularly our smartphones,  which are communication devices,  it's really weird that you go to an application to do a thing.  It's like saying, I'm going to go into a room and talk on a phone.  It makes sense that a communication device would be people-centric.  I want to communicate with a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to communicate with Mom.  Here are my ways of doing it. Phone, email, messaging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which Hangout starts to do very badly.  When I start to see the thinking behind Hangout.  But that's the thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the thinking behind Google+.  Google Plus is about people.  That's what profiles are about.  This kind of unified thing where it's built to your contacts in Gmail.  Now if I go to a person's profile,  I see their website and all the different ways to get to them or whatever.  And Facebook.  This is what Facebook I think attempts to do.  I think Facebook actually does this pretty well.  Yes, the news feed is a core component of the Facebook experience.  Facebook is about people I think in a way that no other app is.  Even kind of including Twitter.  I think Twitter is still about tweets.  I think that it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This article is totally stupid.  Whether the guy is just kind of clueless or doesn't really understand what we're thinking.  The developers are thinking at this level.  He's saying, oh, it's like people as corporations.  People are applications.  It's just another organizational schema.  It's not.  It's noun-centric computing.  The guy probably doesn't come from a background of technology or a developer background.  And is really maybe willfully maybe just...  He's been writing about business and technology since 1996.  He ought to know better because this is just a willful misunderstanding I guess.  The patent application says,  Contacts may call upon applications for handling email, chat, voice, calling, text, video, file sharing, and social network posting.  In other words, make that center around the person, not around the application.  For example, they say, this is in the patent filing,  a user may select a file from his or her documents, drag the file to an icon representing the contact, the person,  and then the user may drop the file onto the icon which may cause the file to automatically be shared to the contact represented by the icon.  That's, I think, just like document-centric model going back 10 years.  It's people-centered.  We're thinking about how we use computers.  And frankly, this makes a lot of sense.  But even if it doesn't, it's not some nefarious plot to turn...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is my point back to Violet Blue.  This is exactly my point.  Is that for media, for technology, I want a people-centered world rather than application-centered world.  Yes, makes sense.  That makes perfect sense.  But when Google says something like this, people are going to twist this around and say, oh, my God, they're stealing your soul.  They're violating you.  No, they're just trying to organize services around you as a person.  And we need to do more of that.  But every time we try to do that, every time it's perhaps badly expressed by the technology or media company,  and then it cues the techno-panic people,  then we're going to end up worse off because we're not people-centered.  I say media has to become a lot more people-centered.  We have to know a lot more about people to give them greater relevance.  Technology companies should know you better so they can serve you better.  But it's going to trigger these techno-panics every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think the thing about people-centric technology is that people vary wildly in who they are and what their past is like and what they're comfortable with.  And I think that Violet's article comes from a place of...  I mean, I think that she represents a group of people like folks who have gender transition surgery done.  I mean, that's a small number of people relative to the whole population.  But those are folks who are less comfortable with the possibility that a software bug is going to out them to the world.  And we've had this conversation before.  Buzz.  Well, right.  Buzz accidentally releases the victim of domestic abuse's location to her abuser.  These are situations that this isn't everybody.  And, Jeff, we've talked about this before.  We shouldn't assume that everybody has something to hide that could change their life.  But lots of people are really different.  And I think it's really hard when you design software.  And I know this firsthand.  You design for the majority, right?  Especially in Google's world, the majority is very privileged, smart, intellectual folks who are very well off  and have a certain kind of life and a certain kind of country and whatever and a certain kind of culture.  And I think it's a tough problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, Virginia, what I'm saying is it's not just about being public, right?  Part of the structure of being people-centric, for example, should be...  And this is what I said to Google when I went out there to talk to the privacy group.  Part of it should be doing a far, far, far better job of giving each individual control over how they manage,  what they have and what they get out of it and what the deal is.  So being people-centric doesn't mean it's publicly so.  It means that there's the opportunity for transactions.  And the user has the key role in those transactions.  And in some cases, that also means, by the way, a company may say to you,  unless you tell me who you are, I ain't going to let you in, right?  If you don't use cookies, the New York Times doesn't let you use the site.  That's a business right of theirs.  If I don't pay the Wall Street Journal, they don't let me in.  There are business rules that we can come up with on both sides of the transaction.  A transaction requires two sides.  But it also means that the user can say, and this goes to Doc Searle's efforts in what he calls vendor relationship management,  the user should be able to manage the vendor and say, here's the condition that I put on you knowing me.  I want better maps as a result, but I don't want you to ever sell that.  And if you want my business, you have to give me the option to pay for it instead of giving me ads or whatever.  User-centric doesn't mean user exposed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And I completely agree with you.  I mean, giving people the control to say, this is what I'm comfortable giving you in order to do business with you.  And the vendor saying, this is the bare minimum that you have to give me.  Having that sort of transparency and control is really important.  I mean, it also really complicates the user experience.  And it's like a constant battle to make things really easy.  Most app makers just want to onboard people really quickly.  We were sort of having this conversation last night on all about Android.  We were talking about Android, the Android permissions model, and how when you install an app, you can have this long list of permissions.  And you're just like, I accept. Fine. I just want the app. Just let me do the thing.  And I think that explaining those things, it's a big challenge.  It's a challenge around education and it's a challenge around settings and control and understanding on both sides and empathy on both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good.  Sorry, I was just dealing with a troll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we've been trolled a lot lately. I hate trolls.  Google is in talks.  So Apple bought Beats for three billion dollars.  I know I'm never going to let this go.  For which about half a billion was the streaming music service Beats and about two and a half billion were the headphones, which according to some are actually a money losing business.  Google's in talks to buy another streaming music company, which arguably I think has an interesting I listen to songs all the time for a mere fifteen million dollars.  And what's interesting is Beats has a quarter million users.  Songza, which has been around for six years, has five and a half million users.  Now, songs that has no business model at all.  In fact, they don't know how they've survived all this time.  It's absolutely free.  It's kind of like Pandora.  If they take the money, it's probably because they can't figure out how to monetize.  There's no ads on it.  There's no cost to it.  The way songs that work is it's curated.  So you say there's a concierge service and you could say I want music for Wednesday afternoon.  And they say, OK, you want cool jazz.  They give you choices that cooking music.  Yeah, you could say cooking music and then they'll give you more choice.  And then it narrows down.  It's actually a great service.  I love songs.  You've never heard of it either of you.  No, I've heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just haven't tried it.  I use it in the kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's are you looking at songs right now?  Because that's the kind of thing they say.  So here's songs.  It's a song.  They do have ads on the website.  So it's Wednesday afternoon, paid music for brand new music, boosting your energy, working in an office, working no lyrics, going to Bonnaroo, which is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we wrote this up on Lifehacker a long time ago.  I remember this now.  I love this service.  There's somebody's music apps.  Yeah, no, this was a really cool take.  I listen all the time.  So here I went.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I drilled down on no lyrics to classical, essential classical, classical for studying, essential waltzes.  And it just plays.  I use it on my sonos all the time.  It's kind of like Pandora, but it's mood based instead of artist based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can do a decade like you can go.  I want 1990s party music and then look at all the choices.  90s dance hits, 90s school dance.  You want your 90s school dance?  All right, let's go to the prom with Gina Trapani.  Let's hear what she was listening to.  It was a girl.  I know everything.  I got a satellite watching.  Can you identify this song?  Oh, I mean, of course, I have no idea what it is.  I have no idea what it is either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know the name and the artist.  You don't need to.  That's the point.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The prom comes rushing back to you.  This is about making Google's I'm feeling lucky on all access better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that is that?  Yeah, I mean, the story comes from the New York Post.  I don't know how accurate it is.  I was going to say the Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is this rag doing in our rundown?  What's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right next to the story about the strippers arrested for drugging, blackmailing, rich

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  clients, Adam Levine apologizing to exes before he got married and the Kardashian  producers refused to pay in Hamptons.  The big three stories and this Google is around the source.  One source close to conversations says Google is offering 15 million dollars.  Second source said the figure on the table is much higher.  Page would have to beat out several suitors.  But I can absolutely see Google buying this because it's becoming clear that the key on  music services, at least if you believe in music, is that it's a very important part of  music.  At least if you believe beats, Jimmy Iovine and Spotify and audio is recommendations is  curation of some kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also think it's almost cynically.  It's almost they spent three billion.  Go find the cheapest music service you can buy.  Yes, just to embarrass.  Go to Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, that was the Spice Girls.  OK, just so you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes, the Spice Girls.  Of course.  Yeah, I mean, doesn't it doesn't Google keep 50 million likes like stuffed in the bathrooms  at the black?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The quarters under the sofa cushions add up to more than that.  I actually like it mostly because it would, in fact, embarrass Apple quite a bit.  I'm just I don't know why.  And this is an email about that.  I've been I've been ragging them about the beats purchases.  First, I thought, oh, this couldn't even be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the funniest thing when you finally had to say, oh, I guess it was true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes no sense, but it's true.  Google is preserving street art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We love it.  Cool. You know, I every time I see a Banksy go by, I think it's going to end up getting ruined.  That was sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, didn't the Banksy project was Banksy was in Brooklyn, Brooklyn, New York.  Where was he? I forgot. Or San Francisco.  He was somewhere. He did a whole thing.  And they're all gone.  And same thing with Christo Christo puts up these big installations.  And then you can't you can't leave a curtain across the Grand Canyon up for very long.  So you have to take it down or giant umbrellas in Central Park.  So you take them down. But they should be preserved.  Here's photographs of eyes affixed to dwellings in Rio.  You can kind of see them. That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  There's a wonderful, wonderful movie I would recommend that's that's related to this, which is Alec Guinness's The Horse's Mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Love the horse's mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  About a guy who a crazy guy who just who just sees a space and must paint it.  Yes. And it is a magnificent, magnificent movie.  And so this reminded me of that of Google preserving Gully Jimson's art.  Shepherd Ferry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gully Jimson. You know, that was a great novel.  Was it Joyce Carol Oates? Who wrote A Horse the Horse's Mouth?  It's a great novel.  She's not that old. No, it was 1944.  You're right. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Joyce Carey. Joyce Carey. See, that's how your brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See how my brain works? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a Joyce somebody who just with a C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, best great novel and even a better, I think, movie.  If everybody should just go home right now, stop watching TV and go watch every Alec Guinness movie ever made.  This is the greatest ever. Just be happy.  But The Horse's Mouth is the one EGR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All about creativity and passion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, this seems to me, by the way, the new style for websites.  I'm seeing a lot of these.  So you go there.  It's video full screen and there's that down arrow, right?  You see this everywhere now.  It's the Snowfall Avalanche.  Oh, is it Snowfall that created this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's why. No, I didn't create it.  That's where Snowfall got it from.  But I think that that's in my world.  That's what popularized it.  And now Medium does similar things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Medium has got that big image because we're looking at a web redesign.  And this is actually kind of what we're looking at.  Shouldn't you, when you go to twit.tv, see a big video?  No, you should actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know my argument, Leo, I've said this to you before.  What?  I think you should see the live video of what's on the network right now.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  That should be there.  And then the down arrow and you scroll down, you can see other shows, other people, other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it should just go right there.  What's on now?  What's on now?  Yeah, good.  Yeah.  But you know, the truth is the website, the web's dead.  So who cares?  I mean, it really is.  Don't you think?  The web is dead.  I was, Vox, the new site started out of Vox Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  They created, really interesting, they created their entire structure.  They created their content.  They did all that.  And now they're building the homepage.  Right.  Because they're admitting their homepages are dead, but we're going to have one anyway.  But it would be after Vox.  You totally have to have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it always has to be at twit.tv.  But ultimately, it seems to me most of it's the apps that matter, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The readership of newspaper home, the New York Times report on innovation panicked because  their homepage usage was going down.  But the New York Times still remains south of 50%.  News sites I know of in America five years ago tended to have only 20% of their audience  would ever see the homepage in a day.  Now it's going down to about 10%.  Right.  So all this effort we put into all of our ego, we put into packaging of saying, everybody's  coming to our homepage.  That's what says us.  Nobody sees it.  It kills me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It kills me.  I mean, we literally have spent millions on web pages at twit.  And that doesn't matter anymore.  Well, maybe not millions.  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands.  By the way, this Vox page sucks, but it doesn't matter, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they haven't started resigning it yet.  This is ugly.  Yeah.  But they didn't care.  It looks like they didn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People are clicking through through Facebook.  Right.  Facebook is their homepage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, what really matters is what you see when you go see an article, isn't it?  Exactly.  That's what matters.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most read right there at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Melissa Bell, who was the, I think, managing editor there, she also said that she purposely  avoided taxonomy in this navigation to see where it went, to see what emerged.  Yeah.  Really smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I read that article.  I liked her line about how breadcrumb trails, you know, would create meetings and meetings  and meetings and meetings and the website would just never go out.  Never get anywhere.  And people don't use it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really interesting.  Smart.  But it's a little depressing for somebody who's trying to keep up because it changes  every five minutes and it's only accelerating.  I can't keep up anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do people find Twitch shows, Leo?  I feel like your big challenge is, you know, you don't have, you don't easily have something  that's shareable on Facebook or Twitter because audio doesn't go viral like that article.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's an interesting challenge because, you know, podcasting, traditionally you'd  go to iTunes.  Nobody does this.  Right.  Go to iTunes, you'd search for content and you'd subscribe to it and then you'd download  it on your iPod.  It even sounds laughable now.  So that's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that the audience can mark a couple things.  One, the audience should be able to mark the good spots and then that good spot should  be shareable directly.  You could say, you know, start at time code, in our case, four hours, 23 minutes and 14  seconds and, you know, share the next 20 seconds.  And to make that a highly shareable artifact, I think would be a key to.  Maybe.  I'm not trying to make Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That will be for the next five minutes anyway.  Yeah, well, that's true.  You know, I think, okay, here's what here's my thinking on this because it's been a while  I spent like wake up in the middle of night every night thinking about this.  I'm sure it's very it's incredible challenge.  Yeah.  And I know why we succeed and have survived so far is people like the people and they  enjoy the content and then they tell other people and they actually actively our audience  actively proselytizes.  It's the only way.  And a lot of people what we want to provide is a lot of entry points so that you could  say, well, you can go to live that's what that TV or go to Twitter TV or you could download  the shows.  But I think ultimately the best thing for us is going to be to have an app on every  platform that says twit and the proselytize it because the process is going to be, oh,  have you heard about Twitter?  No.  Oh, it's really great place to get tech news and some information and boy, they got Jeff  and Gina.  They're great.  You love them.  You should watch Twig.  Then the next step would be to get the app.  Put that on there.  And then now discovery is great because the app has all the shows, lots of information.  We can do featuring and we can help you discover once you get the app.  So the key and I think that the proselytization process would naturally lead to the app.  So that's why we what we've decided is we've really got to focus on apps.  But you still have to have all these other entry points.  You still have to be on iTunes.  You still have to have a website.  You still.  But I think the app is really the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My dream interface to Twitter is Google Now saying to me, you search for True Crypt.  Here's a new episode of Security Now where Steve and Leo talked about it at this time.  Good.  Or I tap on it and I can start the conversation right where you guys are talking about.  How do we do that?  Yeah, well, that's the thing, right?  Without text or without a transcription.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have transcriptions and it still doesn't do it.  I mean, Steve, every show, security now show has been transcribed.  Every one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Right. Right.  So that doesn't help.  Yep.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree that the player should have a and YouTube does this, but it's too hard.  People don't do it.  But you could if you're watching YouTube video, you can give somebody a link to that point.  But nobody's going to do that.  We've looked at ways to do that in our player on our website where share this moment button where you press share this moment and then it will tweet it.  I don't think that I think that would help.  We also put out Twitter bits, which are short clips, highlight clips of each show and hope that people share those.  But they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the thing is, I don't want to make Twitter into something short.  The point is the TV online isn't just six second clips.  I make this point.  You know, I was speaking to the European Broadcasters Union and bring up Twitter at that moment.  Say it's either six seconds or it's an hour and a half talking about Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we don't we're doing we do content that's designed not for somebody who wants a quick hit.  We're do content design for think people want to think about discovery.  Who care about it?  So to challenge the genealogy discovery.  But you don't want to have somebody discover a short clip and think that's what they're going to get because it isn't.  It's much more challenging that.  So what we I still believe and I think this is this is this is the eternal verity.  The technology is constantly changing, but the eternal verity is word of mouth proselytization by fans.  A fan telling somebody else, you've got to try this is really the only thing that works for detergent.  Well, maybe not for detergent, but for Shake Shack.  It ain't an ad that makes Shake Shack success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If for Shake Shack or for it's all these lemmings pushing each other there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be the line.  It could be the people going by Madison Park seeing the line and saying, oh, it must be something going on there.  What's going on there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  And when we come back, we'll do the changelog because Web 42 48 in our chat room is demanding it.  He says, please, can we have some news?  Our show brought to you today by nine nine designs.  Ninety nine designs is the place to go if you want to get a design.  And I think so many people think they can do it themselves.  And I want to tell you, you can't.  If you're a chef, cook, but have your menu, have your website, have your Facebook page, have your Twitter account designed by somebody who designs as well as you cook.  Simple concept.  You are going to get a design you love guaranteed.  Three hundred seven thousand six hundred eighty nine designers are sitting and waiting for you to go to ninety nine designs.  The way they've set it up, which is so clever, is you create a design contest.  You say I need a logo or I need a landing page or I need, I don't know, a car wrap, T-shirts.  We get all of our twit clothing, T-shirts and hoodies designed at ninety nine designs.  We've had such great results.  In fact, when we've put up contests, we get usually so many good designs that will say the last time we picked five of them said we're buying all of them.  So what you do is you create the contest, a design brief on ninety nine designs.  You share the info about your brand with the community of designers.  They decide, yeah, I'd like to try this one.  Once you launch the logo contest, you're going to wait a few days and you're going to see those ideas roll in and then you're going to pay and a logo is two hundred ninety nine bucks.  You can pay more.  But in fact, what they also do is they'll offer a identity package.  So you get the logo.  You can also get a T-shirt.  You get a website.  You get it all designed around one thing.  There's all sorts of ways to do this.  Ninety nine designs is so great.  The first interaction between your brand and a prospective client is your logo.  Get it done right.  You should see our T-shirts, our hoodies.  We've got such great results.  Here's what you do.

They'll bold highlight and feature your design project in their marketplace.  You'll get nearly twice as many designs.  Ninety nine designs.  Dot com slash twig.  Thank you.  I do have water.  I'm drinking it.  But thank you.  I had walnuts in my lunch and now I'm having them in my throat.  Ninety nine designs dot com slash twig.  Ladies and gentlemen, play the trombone.  It's time for the changelog.  The Google changelog.  Gina Trapani tells us what's new at the goog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google has released its official app for Google I.O., which is two Wednesdays from now, two Wednesdays from now.  I'm going to be sitting next to you guys at that table on the studio.  I'm very, very excited.  But this app isn't just for people who are actually attending I.O.  This is this is this is useful actually for anyone who's interested in the I.O.  content.  It's a free Android app.  It lets you browse the conference agenda and add sessions to your schedule and you get reminder notifications as they start.  You can watch live streams through the app for the just not just the keynote, but for sessions and you can watch videos of previously recorded sessions.  Of course, Leo is going to be doing live coverage of the keynote there in the studio.  So you should probably watch in the Twitch stream.  But just in case you want to see what the Google's official session schedule is, you check out the app.  It is up in the Play Store now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not fine.  I'm not finding it.  You know, I'm not finding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at that.  You know, the Play Store has this weird thing where the search doesn't catch up that there are new releases.  It takes a little bit for the search to catch up.  Yeah.  If you there's a nine to five Google article that links directly to the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There it is.  Page number eight in the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, they'll fix that.  They've actually they've actually open sourced this app.  I'm not sure if they have done this done that this year or if this is an iteration on the open source version of the app.  Some good news for Chrome OS users.  This one.  This is for you, Jeff.  Two really good updates.  First, the Google Plus Photos app for Chrome OS now automatically uploads photos from your SD card to a private Google Plus folder, even when the app is closed.  So this is similar to how the instant upload works in the Android and iOS apps for Google Plus.  So if you got a Chromebook, pop a SD card, download photos into into your Chromebook.  Your photos get automatically backed up.  I've been able to do that for a couple months on the Pixel.  Oh, cool.  Very cool.  This appears to be the Google Plus photo app for Chrome OS.  I think it's a Chrome app.  But so it was happening in the background even when the app was closed that day.  That actually interests me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there is no such thing as being closed on a Chromebook.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Oh, cool.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe this is a new news.  So they extended it.  Yes.  It works really well.  The only issue is Jarvis complained here with two accounts.  I now have to have to sign in so I can have the photos go to my Google Plus, which is different from my apps account.  Right.  I've got to figure out how to just be done with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a merge the two.  So and it's a private folder by default.  Right.  So like the way instant upload works.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  That's true.  But I'm going to go to my grave.  I'm going to have two gravestones.  One is my apps of gravestone.  One is my Gmail gravestone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the rest of the world tries to separate their identities.  Jarvis really wants to combine them.  Yes.  Let's see what we can do.  Folks also for Chromebook users, the there's a new ad.  There's a new Google Play movies and TV extension that lets you download video purchases or rentals for offline playback.  Very, very, very cool.  So you can you can watch your videos, your movie and TV from from Google Play on the plane without without Wi Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I load up on my Nexus 7 like crazy.  Now I can also be on here.  And by the way, Orphan Black folks.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a good it's a BBC America show.  Yeah, it's interesting.  In the second season.  That's interesting.  One one actress, one woman plays like kind of an infinite number of characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're clones like like Dollhouse basically or sort of a star.  I've seen I've seen the ads for the subway.  I'll take it.  It's good.  It's really good.  To Google Now updates, Google Now will now wake you up before your bus or train stop.  If you use Google now while you're using public transportation, the app could offer the option to set an alarm to wake you when you would arrive at a safe when you arrive at a safe location like home or work.  So this is an alarm will estimate where and when you should exit your train bus or other form of public transportation.  Google will suggest an alarm and users can tap the clock icon once to set it.  So Google now becoming ever more telepathic.  Google now also adds a call button to call me reminder cards.  So if you say to Google now, remind me to call Home Depot, for example, this is the the the example on Android police.  The reminder will pop up and not only will it say, hey, you know, remind me again in an hour.  If Google recognizes that you said Home Depot and recognizes that this is a store they could show you they can get a phone number for you.  There will be a button that you can tap one tap call the nearest nearest Home Depot.  This doesn't work if you say something that Google doesn't recognize, but does work for for things that it does.  I'm not sure if it actually works for your contacts.  The only example Android police used was a was Home Depot was a was a store.  Google Travel Search now has I'm feeling lucky and I'm feeling lucky inspiration feature.  So if you go to Google dot com slash flights, you can you can enter a region of the world that you'd like to visit as your destination.  And and flights will show you the most popular destinations for that region.  You can see photos of top attractions and how the price fluctuates by seasonality.  And if you're feeling adventurous, you can try the I'm feeling lucky button and Google flights.  A travel search will suggest destinations you might like to visit.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's it telling you go, Leo? Yeah, where's the so how do I do that?  I go to now. Do I ask? Do I have to search for something or ask for something or if you go to Google dot com slash flights?  So OK, so I'll do that on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or no, I'm looking for here on this page and I don't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's it's in the web. Yeah. Destinations for you learn more.  Yeah, where's the I'm feeling for you learn more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So these are places. Well, these are all places it's proposing.  Tokyo, London, these destinations suggested based on information from your Google account, including your recent activity and Web history.  It wants me to go to Edmonton.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you click on the map, the expand map button. Yeah, there's an I'm feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there it is. OK, let's click it. Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It says I should go to Seattle. No, it says I should go to Miami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Frankfort, Seattle. Maybe because I just did Windows Weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, maybe Miami's three hundred seventy seven dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not bad. You know what? It's also showing how cheap it is to go to Seattle right now.  It's like this is the best time of the year to go to Seattle. I just keep hitting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of kind of fun to do that. Oh, you get other stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see. Where else? Las Vegas. Also, a good time to go to Vegas. Copenhagen.  Let's go to London.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just got London too. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also shows you a price time chart. Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm hovering over. So you could see, for instance, I'm going to Hawaii.  This is a good time to go to Hawaii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Manhattan, Kansas. No, Google. What? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's telling you to go to Manhattan, Kansas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It knows that I have Kansas relatives, maybe. Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm just I'm just. Oh, Beijing. Let's go.  Sixteen hundred forty seven dollars. Now, is that round trip or one way?  That'd be a bummer if it's. Oh, no, it's round trip.  Good deal. This is pretty cool. This is really kind of fun.  Yeah, I want to go to Tokyo. I want that. So if I click it, do I get that flight show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's only so many. I just cycled back.  So it's giving me like eight eight places and then it's like so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So 1467 round trip, but I have to leave on Thursday and return on Monday.  That's a little tough. Wow. That's on.  Oh, honey, Google told me to go there. It's a one stop.  San Francisco, New York, Kansas, too. What's that?  Wait a minute. OK, now we know there's something going on.  What is the airport for Manhattan, Kansas?  Is it confused about Manhattan? It feels that way, right?  Yeah. MHK, MHK, Manhattan, is there a nonstop or do you have to go through Edmonton?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One stop through. I love the image that they chose.  Here's the lumberjack. That's Paul Bunyan, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do not mock him. Look for babe the blue ox right next.  Huh? It is a one stop. Where do we stop?  Well, you can choose Dallas, Fort Worth.  So we have to go to Dallas and then we go from Dallas to Manhattan, Kansas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it should give you more information. Like, why would you go to Manhattan, Kansas?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. To see babe the blue ox. Why else?  Because it's a good deal right now.  You got Manhattan, too. That's so strange.  So Chad got it. Well, I searched for it. Oh, you searched for it.  Anyway, that's kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you definitely are both in New York, so it must be just a good deal right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fun with data.  That's because we should see the flyover, Gina.  We should stop thinking that it's just two coasts like your life is.  This is telling us to go and meet the people.  Flyover states. It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. Last bit of the change law. Google public alerts now include tweets to help answer important questions.  So if you go to google.org slash public alerts, you will see tweets from disaster struck locations.  So this is when bad stuff happens.  Basically, Google kind of sucked it up a little bit after their back and forth with Twitter a couple of years ago  and decided that this product is better with tweets.  These are extracted from Twitter's public API, and they're used to supplement updates.  And these are tweets from organizations like the National Weather Service.  And the idea is to have the public tweets help answer the questions like,  are schools closing? Are neighbors evacuating? What are people seeing on the front lines of the storm?  And of course, Google public alerts disseminates emergency messages through services such as Google Maps and Google Now,  as well as on the public alerts website, which I forgot about and had to remind myself is google.org slash public alerts.  It's one of these things you don't look at right until the storm is coming.  And but this tweet this tweet's feature is English only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So a lot of fire weather warnings in our neck of the woods. This is cool.  You can you could say what locations, what kinds, what language and sort by relevance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, if you click on one of these warnings on the left side, there should be theoretically there will be tweets someplace on that page about the topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huh? Huh? Maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just tweets. I mean, I might not just be coming from NOAA and other sources.  Yeah, this is from the National Weather Service. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The tweets are supplements to Google's regular announcements and other sort of aggregation from other sources like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The original text for this alert has been automatically reformatted to correct capitalization.  See what happens with these? Well, if you look at them, these are they come in all caps. They're very ugly.  Oh, wow. And so Google is parsing it to make it sentence and make it look like prose.  That actually is great. I've always hated these weather alerts. They're like they're shouting at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, no, it's just it's much more readable. Yeah, put it in Helvetica instead of courier points. Yeah, that's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are no longer shouting. Windy and very dry through Friday.  Low pressure over the Pacific Northwest. Weather for the heart of hearing.  Garrett Morris. All right. Morris. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a change log.  Chad Hurley and who's the other guy?  Right. Jen. Jen. Jeff Chen have split.  The founders of YouTube are going their own separate ways.  Chad is spun out mix bit. That was the thing they were doing together.  And Jeff Chen is going I'm sorry, Steve Chen is going to Google Ventures.  I remember Amber MacArthur discovering YouTube.  It was before it was a Google thing. We interviewed them. We said, what are you going to do when you get sued by every company in the world?  And they they were very bullish. And then we called Jeff Chen the day that Google offered him three points something billion.  One point six billion. One point six. Is that all it was? That's all. And they got ripped.  So you called him and congratulated him? Yeah. The new billionaire was cute. He was very sweet guy. I really like Jeff.  He's now working for Google at Google Ventures. Steve Chen. Steve. Jeff Chen. I don't know. My good friend Jeff. Yes.  It was a long time ago. I'm an old man. So that's cool.  I guess. I remember they bought didn't they buy what they buy delicious and they bought delicious and they sold it again.  And they sold it back. And then mixed it wasn't going so well. And one point six five billion.  That was right. Billion. Yeah. Gosh, that seems like it seemed like a lot of the time.  And now it's nothing compared to WhatsApp. It seems to be the same. Everybody said Google was nuts. Yeah, they made their money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Million dollars a day and bandwidth fees. Oh, my God. Twice as much for beats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I loved John Oliver's discussion of net neutrality and how he compared the FCC to having a dingo watch your baby.  But apparently he made a mistake because he called for trolls to overwhelm the FCC.  And they did very shortly after his rant on Sunday.  The FCC's website was brought down by a database denial of service attack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then then there's another report that says the FCC says it wasn't hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The commenting system is just old. I just put that link up. Well, it's old and easy to fake easy to mess up by by overwhelming it.  Oh, interesting. Yeah, it's 17 years old. That commenting system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was there even an Internet 17 years ago? I know. Well, it's the same Mark Andreessen just had a string.  Of course, it's all he does now is string tweets. But he was reminding us that what's what's that new tech series?  Not the one from like in the 70s and catch fire. Right.  So he reminds us that the VA's system was created when that show was taking place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody asserted that the FCC system was hacked, by the way.  So I don't know. That article is not actually denying anything that anybody asserted.  It was a denial of service attack, which just means a lot of people put comments in the system.  And of course, 17 years old, it couldn't handle it. So I don't know what I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, a pure denial of service attack would be just to ping it for the sake of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they did. That's what they did. And they did a particular thing.  The FCC said we received a surge in the volume of visits to our electronic comment filing system.  A byproduct of the high volume was what is known as a dead record lock.  What happens is you post a comment and you immediately search for it and it locks up.  And that's not a hack. It's a denial of service.  And I don't know if that second article denying that it was a hack is actually meaningful because nobody asserted it was a hack.  The Verge is I guess the FCC said, no, we weren't hacked. But it was a denial of service attack.  Seventeen year old system.  Seventeen years old. And I think I think according to an article on Motherboard Insiders,  a sustained effort from attackers brought the site down. But it is not a hack.  It's just this is the motherboard article, which I think is an accurate article.  It was written yesterday and it describes the database denial of service.  Nobody's denying that. So be careful if you ask trolls to troll, they may.  Trolls be trolls. Trolls be trolls.  Actually, I'm sure John Oliver loves it.  Loves it that that happens. Oh, God. Yeah.  Probably not the best way to influence the FCC, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but he was also just saying people go leave comments there. The troll part was a joke.  Right. But it was a sincere effort to say, yeah, go tell them what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the problem is because of the D.O., the distributed database denial of service, nobody could leave a comment.  Yeah. So it kind of had the wrong impact.  My favorite movie theater in the world. Yours to Chad, the Alamo Drafthouse in beautiful Austin, Texas.  Jerks. I love them even more now. They're jerks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're banning Google Glass. They're Luddite jerks.  You know, it's funny because I was reading this article, I kind of had the first impression that Jeff did is they're just being jerks.  They're just they're just trying to jump on the glass bandwagon.  But looking at a little bit closer, it seems I mean, they banned cell phones, too.  I mean, they just don't want you can wear your glasses in the theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can continue to wear it while the lights are up, while you're ordering your tacos and your beer.  You can while you're in. But as soon as the lights dim, you have to take off your glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not what if they're your glasses, jerks.  Oh, they're my glasses.  Well, maybe turn them off. It seemed like them to be my glasses.  I don't want them turned on. They serve tacos while you watch movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. It's the best place in the world.  In fact, that's more disruptive than the phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to hear crunchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, they're soft tacos. They're soft tacos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, all right. And they're very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so when you sit down in the theater, the loudest thing is a romaine lettuce from the Caesar salad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your movie theater seat is in front of like a desk.  There's a long table. Yeah.  Well, it's narrow, but it's a table in front of you.  And the waitress comes up to you and you take a say there's a menu and say what you want.  She delivers your food. The movie stars. It's great. It's the greatest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, those places around us that do that, they come throughout the movie.  I hate it. I won't go because they come throughout the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's also the whole experience when you when you sit down, you don't get any ads for any other movies.  They show you they program it. Yeah, they would love it.  They show you bits and pieces from like we want to go see the Star Wars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not if I'm hearing open mouth chewing next to me and the waitress coming back.  Can I have another popcorn? I don't want to hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't you never you never speak your order. You always write it down.  That's right. You have a little piece of paper, but they come walking in the theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your your seat. Yeah, your seat is on a level that's overlooking them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I'm going to watch other people. It's going to irritate. No, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love to irritate me. I'm not going to tell you. Try it.  I loved it. I thought it was great. And they program stuff.  I'm going there with my glass and then I'll get shot. Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Austin, Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You remember you remember how they how they shamed the cell phone user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, this is they have there's a segment before that.  We'll take your ass out if you make any noise in our theater.  Here it is. Look, if you talk or text during a movie, we will kick you off out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sometimes that pisses off an actual talker.  This is a voicemail. Somebody left that you guys actually enjoy treating your

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  customers like a piece of because that's how I felt when I went to the Alamo  Draft House. OK, you know what?  I didn't know that was supposed to text in your little theater.  It was in that place for me to find my seat.  All right. I was using my phone as a flash.  Excuse me for using my phone in USA, United States of America.  Where are you free to text in a theater?  I was not aware that I couldn't text in your theater.  All right. I've texted in all the other theaters in Austin and no one ever gave  about what you do in my sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to do this live.  It was loud. It wasn't bothering anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You guys obviously were being and I'm sure that's what you do.  You know, to rip people off, you take my money and then you throw me out.  You know, I will never be coming back to your Alamo Draft House or whatever.  I'd rather go to a regular theater where people are actually polite.  And you know, I'm going to tell everyone, but you are pretty sure you guys  would be on purpose.  So thanks for making me feel like a customer.  Thanks for taking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have a whole new perspective on this now that I have a one year old.  I mean, I have to get a babysitter to go to the theater.  And if the babysitter needs to get in touch with me, like my phone, that's a good point.  I'm going to take that text and maybe I'll get out.  You're a surgeon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you are a surgeon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You shouldn't go to the movies if you're on call.  Oh, stay home and wait for the beeper to go off.  By the way, an admirable attempt by Chad in real time to bleep that.  It was.  It was.  Really good.  Nicely done, Chad.  I apologize for the belt.  There's a few that came through.  I read down some notes.  Honeywell is going to do a nest.  Only it's not called the nest.  It's called the Lyric.  It actually looks kind of, I wouldn't mind having it.  It's kind of beautiful.  It's got like, shows you the weather.  And it's pretty much a complete rip off of the nest.  You could program it from your phone.  We've designed Lyric to be mobile first and DIY, says Honeywell.  So I wonder really, I mean, it's a voice activated.  Oh, wait a minute.  Honeywell also has a voice activated thermostat.  They also have that.  And it is so crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it?  Do you have that?  I have a VYB and I had to try.  Installing the nest was a dream.  You take off your old one.  It's very easy and they make it really simple.  You plug it in.  You snap it back in.  This thing, it doesn't work if it's not plugged into the wall.  They gave us an extra little adapter so that it could stay alive off of the wall.  It was just a big pain in the butt.  And the interface wasn't a capacitive touch screen.  It was a resistive and it was just a piece of junk.  I really dislike it.  Well, they're expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the nest is expensive.  This is as expensive, I think $279.  It will be available at Lowe's.  And somehow they got Steve Wozniak to...  Is that Steve Wozniak or some other Wozniak they're quoting in here?  Bruce Wozniak?  Is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway.  I thought I'd mention it.  I don't know.  What happened with TweetDeck?  Were they hacked?  What happened there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What happened was, I had it.  If you open up TweetDeck, it was showing you this message and it was retweeting this horrible,  stupid little tweet with a dorky image on it.  So it turns out, and they said we fixed it.  On your account or no?  Anybody who used TweetDeck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it would tweet out on your account something on your behalf?  Yes, on my account.  It retweeted my account.  That's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was a cross-site scripting vulnerability.  So JavaScript got executed inside.  This is in the Chrome app.  So JavaScript got executed inside the Chrome app.  That shouldn't have been, but what it did was basically retweet this thing, is my understanding of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it turns out it was some Australian kid, or Austrian, I forget.  I was getting confused, who wanted to get a heart.  And he realized that if he started the tweet with a heart, it opened up that vulnerability.  And he says he didn't.  He notified Twitter immediately.  But meanwhile, other hackers evidently found it.  You see, Hackword found it and executed on it.  And so you couldn't do any...  And they were saying, oh, just sign out and it'll be okay.  It's fixed.  But you couldn't sign out because you think it was taken over.  So then I killed the app, brought the app back, and then deauthorized it.  And it was a wasted half an hour complaint on Twitter.  That's life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this was only in the Chrome version of...  Yes.  Okay.  So if you're using the apps, no.  Well, they're not.  It's the Chrome app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're not supporting the desktop app anymore, as far as I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to Tweet Tech, you can download it.  I just did because I wanted to see.  They're still saying...  I think it's the desktop app as a second class citizen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that they basically said, we're going to be active development.  Because I grumbled and switched over the Chrome app just because.  And then I really liked it, actually.  So is it safe now?  You know, I haven't tried to get into it since this happened.  Jeff, have you gotten back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm using it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I was late to this, and then I tried to log in, and I couldn't at all.  It just said, hey, I assume that they just disabled login once they were aware of the vulnerability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They took it down for a while.  I'm trying to find the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody's beef says in the chat room, I don't know if this is true,  I was running Tweet Tech for Windows, and it happened to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, maybe...  I stand corrected.  Oh, yeah, I'm back into the Chrome app. No problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  David Weiner, not to be confused with Dave Weiner, said his Tweet was fixed.  One, log out of Tweet, back.  Two, never log Black in.  Three, take a deep breath.  Four, look out the window.  Five, find a partner.  Six, procreate.  Seven, die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love Dave Weiner.  My wife walked past my desk when I had Tweet Tech sort of expanded,  and I've got, you know, whatever, 10 columns.  This is what you do?  Like, it just makes it such an overwhelming sort of like...  And you have a problem with that?  The columns scrolling down at different speeds.  It's a pretty active app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like to stay in touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how you do Twitter. I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now that I have a three monitor setup at home,  I'm going to have Tweet Tech fill a whole monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tweet Tech is pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It took me a long time to get used to the column,  because the problem is I'd scroll down a column,  and then the columns would move.  That pissed me off.  The other thing is, well, it's supposed to.  If you just scroll up a little bit on Tweet Tech,  it'll stop the movement, but it doesn't do that.  So I'm reading a column, and suddenly, whoop!  Oh, I hate that.  Another 20 tweets, and I really hate that.  Yeah, no, I don't like that.  And that should be so easy to just stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have clicked on the wrong link because the tweet bumped down.  Yes, it rolled.  And it took me to click.  Yeah.  Yeah, the activity column, particularly online,  moves really, really fast.  It's like everything that your friends favorite.  It's everything that's happening.  And it's kind of always kind of flying by.  I still love Tweet Tech, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm waiting for the least K moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet the wind says, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're flying. You're talking to the whole world.  You're complaining about this?  You know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would bet that the Windows and Mac versions are wrappers  around essentially a web interface,  and that's probably why they're cross-siting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, for a while, they were Adobe Air.  Oh, that was terrible. I remember that.  Yeah, I'm not sure what they are.  And I think that they went native, and then I think they just said,  you know, we're going to be working on the Chrome app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was the product that your friend Bill Gross was poised to buy  along with Echo Phone.  He was going to buy up all the Twitter clients  and create a Twitter competitor.  And Twitter swooped in and offered them an obscene amount of money and said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not even a Twitter competitor.  What he was going to create was a Twitter ad network,  just a serving mechanism, Twitter.  But they swooped in.  Twitter didn't let it happen.  Yeah, they swooped in all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did they pay for it? Do you remember?  I don't remember.  More than Bill was offering, like more than it was probably worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't think it was just a question of that.  I think it was also that if you...  We won't be nice to you.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you want to continue in life,  you must exceed to our demands.  Anything else?  Let me see before we get to our tip and number and tool of the week.  Obama did a Tumblr Q&A.  The new AMA is a Tumblr Q&A.  David Karp gave me a fist bump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at David, chilling with the president.  He's what, 12? How old is David?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, I know. He's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He actually looks younger in this than he is.  Can I get this full screen?  No, Yahoo apparently doesn't do full screen.  This is the Yahoo news story.  David Karp is the founder.  Look at him.  This is so small. Why is it so small?  Let me make it a little bit bigger. Here we go.  He looks like a...  He's like, I'm in the model UN  and I would like to interview the president.  Is he not wearing a tie for the president?  Not wearing a tie.  He wore a tie.  Give him a break. He put on a jacket.  He might have combed his hair, maybe.  Looks like he might have shaved yesterday.  You know, just another day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just another day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think truthfully, at this point,  Obama doesn't have a whole lot of respect  built up in the piggy bank.  In the tech community.  Yeah, but anybody.  I think the NSA has kind of soured that thing.  I feel like, I don't even...  Is he president still?  Is he still...  I'm waiting for Hillary, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm waiting for Hillary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is every other Democratic candidate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So on the list, will you get in trouble  and get pulled down if you play any of Celine Dion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We won't get in trouble with the copyright police,  but I think our audience might disappear.  Where is this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right next to it now.  Stuck in Vegas airport, Canadian man lip-syncing,  he's alone all night in the Vegas airport,  and he makes a video.  A lip-sync video, because he's got nothing else to do.  It's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, let's watch.  He put it on Vimeo.  Let's pick out a few seconds.  I don't think I'm getting in trouble  for playing Vimeo Eclipse.  I think that's...  Oh, okay.  No, I'm just joking.  What do you do when you're stuck  at the Las Vegas airport overnight?  Shoot a music video on your iPhone.  Apple should pay this guy a visit.  You should probably skip in halfway.  Yeah, skip in halfway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It takes a while to get started.  It's a five-minute long song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's an Eric Carman tune called All By Myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he used the moving sidewalks to do pan shots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How is he doing the Zoom?  I don't know how he's doing the Zoom.  Digital.  Digital.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Digital.  Digital.  Digital.  Digital.  Digital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does look alone there.  He's using the Delta counter.  It is four in the morning.  There is no one there.  Oh, my God.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of great.  I'll give it to this guy.  Richard Gingras on Google Plus pointed me to it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and he said this guy is now his hero.  What do you think the thought process was?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He got bought out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He got bumped off voluntarily off two flights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a 6 AM flight.  No time point going to the hotel.  He said, how am I going to get in trouble?  So he does this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now, do you think he had playback?  Like, did he?  He had to.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, God.  He had to.  He had to.  He had to.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  He's the weapon.  Oh, my God.  Women.  Women.  In front of the women's room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  That was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was worth it.  That was kind of great.  Yeah.  I like that one.  Here's the other one.  It might be two.  Go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  Go ahead.  I'll change it.  Go ahead.  what's going to be on the newsroom?  Is that a confirmed thing?  Was I not supposed to bring that up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you read the tweet where it said private?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Confidential?  Yeah, that part.  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I agree.  I said, OK.  But it did say confidential in the tweet, so I don't know if I'm supposed to mention

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it.  I'm doing it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I got to tell you, when I saw the end, and I don't think this is a spoiler, but when  I saw the end of Silicon Valley, and not only did Kara Swisher get a massive cameo, so did  Mike Arrington.  Yeah.  I'm a little hurt.  So apparently the same and we all we got, by the way, on Silicon Valley was a tab.  We got a favicon.  We got a favicon.  But the same people apparently who do that, which is the onset playback that they do the  computers, they apparently I can't say any more than this.  They apparently are going to try, not guaranteed, to get us into the newsroom.  Not me or nothing like that, but you'll see.  And they have me in the show.  But I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm excited.  I'm excited for you.  I now love the newsroom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You now love the newsroom.  I was once I was once on Murphy Brown mentioned on Murphy Brown, the network vice president,  because I had smashed an episode.  So the network vice president said on Murphy Brown, Jeff Jarvis, he's a bottomless pit  of hate.  Wow.  A proud moment in my career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is because that means that enough people know who Jeff Jarvis is or was.  Well, I think you're still alive.  Have you passed?  That could explain the pink texture.  It could.  I know that's really good that people, you know, you it means you're popular.  You know, culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it was also just their way to just do not like Murphy Brown.  I love I loved it.  But then like Cosby, it got bad after a while.  I said so.  All shows do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They go on too long, including this one.  So that's why we're going to wrap it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry, sorry.  Lots of detours today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I do want to just mention I just want to wrench real quickly because we're coming  out to the Bay Area twice in the next month that I'm not going to the Bay Bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why?  Oh, you want to show that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the Sacramento Bee did a major investigation piece.  Yeah.  Of everything that's wrong with that bridge.  The new one or the old one?  The new one.  The new one.  They built it.  It's gorgeous.  It's a gorgeous structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new Bay Bridge is, by the way, the Sacramento Bee vary with it.  Their design.  Look at that.  That is the modern design.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The next 10 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But this looks just like medium.  Yeah.  Wow.  I can't believe the Caltrans choice of an inexperienced company left structural.  That was a very expensive bridge.  I think it cost billions to many billions to build.  Key findings.  It cost as much as WhatsApp to build this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to say I'm not nuts to dislike bridges.  That's all I want to say.  Actually, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It only cost six and a half billion to bridge it.  It cost a half of WhatsApp.  A half of WhatsApp.  Zuck can fix it.  Can you believe that a iPhone app cost more than twice an actual bridge?  Admittedly, we didn't have the best builders.  Huh.  So, well, no, you don't have to go over the Bay Bridge to get here.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, how are we going to get to Petaluma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Golden Gate Bridge, which was built 60 years ago, 60 plus years ago, is actually structurally quite sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you so your fears that the bridge will fall?  San Francisco, folks.  Or is your fear that you will go over the edge?  Either one.  Either one.  It's a cliff effect thing.  It all counts.  It'll start shaking the car, start vibrating.  Gina's driving that part, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're going to be here when?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When are you going to be here?  For I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I.O. is, yeah, we're going to come up after the keynote.  We're going to come up after the keynote that Wednesday.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's in two weeks.  Is there anybody else coming up with us?  Maybe.  Don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll gather up whoever we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just get them all, drive them up.  We'll get a big car.  We'll get a stretch limo, if you want.  That's how Andy and Ako and Renee Richie came up after WWDC.  We thought there were going to be a lot of them.  It was just the two of them in a stretch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can rent a car, too.  We're going to send you with a gigantic butterfly net and see how many people you can have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gather them up and we'll get one of them stretch hummers.  You can just load it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like get Kevin Marks, Skoll.  Kevin Purdy, Kevin Marks, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just get everybody up there.  Actually, we're trying to figure out who's going to do our live coverage.  I'm going to be here anchoring the live coverage as we watch the keynote.  And everybody we think of is going to be in the keynote.  Yeah.  So we're going to have to get somebody who's like, I don't know, not famous or something.  Are you worried about flying, Jeff?  I mean, you're actually in the air three miles high and that doesn't bother you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, if I think about it too much, it would.  OK, don't think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is time, ladies and gentlemen, for Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a little bit of a geeky one, but I kind of liked it.  There's a new Chrome apps and extensions developer tool that you can install and you can kind of watch what your apps and extensions in Chrome in Chrome do.  How many times history basically of their behavior when they access your browser cookies, when they search through your open tabs or modify a site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of needs not not just I'm not saying, you know, this is a this isn't necessarily a paranoia thing.  This is just kind of like interested in technology.  How do these things work type of thing?  So this is a this is a free actually it's a Chrome extension itself.  The Chrome. What's it called?  It's got a long name. It's the Chrome apps and extensions developer tool.  And it's by Google and it's free to install in Chrome if you you want to see the stuff that you installed in effect.  Adam Pash, my former co editor at Lifehacker, just released a really cool bike sharing Chrome extension.  And I installed that.  And then I got to install this developer tool and got to kind of see, you know, oh, oh, look, he's going to city bike and grabbing, you know, the how many bikes are at the open open docs nearby.  So this developer tool kind of lets you lets you see that and get a view into what your extensions and apps are actually doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's it's it says I just saw it said it's been added to the Chrome app launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. So now where is that?  It goes into your dock.  Are you on a Mac there?  No, you're not on a Mac.  I am on a Mac. Yeah.  Yeah. It's in your dock now, which I didn't like that.  Like, look at your dock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I find my dock here.  Where's my dock?  There's my dock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  Oh, there it is.  That's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird.  That's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I went directly to options remove because I'm can you can you just drag it out of here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you can.  Yeah, you can.  Yeah. But then I can't close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I have it permanently installed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like apps in my in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did it used to be in the menu bar?  I thought it used to be in the menu bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can put it.  It's actually on your bookmarks bar and you can show or hide it.  That's where it should be.  Yeah. Yeah, that seems reasonable.  I didn't love that Chrome was sort of showing up on my desktop.  So I removed that.  But apparently I did it the wrong way because are you still is that menu still there?  The launch is still open.  No, it's gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gone.  Good.  Hangouts is doing that too.  Now when you click Hangouts, it opens a new it's like an app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like an app.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if I really approve of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Chrome was becoming feels like it's taking over.  It's really wants to be a desktop app.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Taking everything over.  All right.  The Chrome apps and extension developer tool.  If you can say it, you can use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you can say it, you can download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis has some numbers for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Henry Blodgett says that a source of his says that Uber's revenue,  there's a lot of talk this week about it.  Uber's latest investment.  Is it really worth 17 billion?  Is it really worth 20 billion?  Well, their gross revenue, gross of which to get 20% is supposedly running at $10 billion.  Wow.  So his head source.  But the number I wanted to go to was a number of the heart here, zero.  That's where according to Business Insider, an analyst says Radio Shack stock will be very soon.  Oh, they're going through trouble.  They had really bad results.  You know, where am I going to go to buy my resistors and capacitors and RCA plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. Online and that's the problem.  Oh.  But what about the battery club?  I know.  I know.  You know, the last time I was in a Radio Shack, there were four, there were no customers,  four or five clerks, but they were all on the phone.  So nobody helped me.  I know.  It's really a bad experience.  Oh, God.  So I just helped myself and walked out the door.  Yeah.  I slapped a 20 on the counter just so they'd be happy.  Wow.  That would be sad.  I think Radio Shack is kind of the last bastion of electronic stores in many cities of the country.  We talk to them.  We try to talk them into an ad campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh.  Actually, yeah.  You would have been perfect.  Yes.  Because it is the place where you can get geeky stuff still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  We could have saved them.  Maybe it's not too late, Radio Shack.  Call me.  It may not be too late.  Save your stock price from going into zero.  I have an app.  Somebody told me about this right before the show.  You're going to love this, Gina.  You know how you could have the new SwiftKey just came out.  Really neat.  It's free.  Everybody should get SwiftKey.  There's new features.  I guess they're going to in-app purchases.  So they have all these themes.  I love SwiftKey.  It's my keyboard of choice on Android.  But sometimes there's times when you need to communicate in a different fashion.  That's what the Hodor keyboard is for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hodor.  All it says is Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was just telling my coworkers about the time I was standing in line at Comic-Con,  waiting to get into the Game of Thrones session, and the guy who plays Hodor comes out and  shaking hands with the fans.  And everyone is chanting Hodor.  And he's saying Hodor back.  That's amazing.  And I love this keyboard.  You're going to love the reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  4.9 out of 5 stars.  And the cast and said, Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.  Now, if, by the way, you ever baffled as to what we're talking about, I'm sorry.  But that's just look at all the reviews.  They all, Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.  Hodor.  You should have this in the App Arena next week.  Go to the Game of Thrones weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  I'm regretting not having put this in the App Arena.  This was so totally lit.  You would have won.  I like that it's long press for maximum Hodor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at the reviews, Chad.  I've got the reviews up on my screen.  Look at the reviews.  They're so good.  Hodor.  Hodor.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hodor.  Hodor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hodor.  You couldn't write a bad review if you wanted to with the new Hodor keyboard.  The sad thing is it's 99 cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite thing is that if your password is Hodor, it's the fastest way to get your  password in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All my passwords are Hodor.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of this, yes, wonderful edition of This Week  in Google.  I think by now you're getting the idea that you never know what's going to happen next.  Neither do we.  Neither do we.  That's right.  Even though we rehearse as much as possible, it just, you never know.  That's Jeff Jarvis.  He is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York, founder of Entertainment  Weekly.  He's also the author of Public Parts, a fine book, and the Gutenberg, the geek book, and  Amazon Kindle single.  Amazon hasn't delayed deliveries of your Kindle single, has it?  I doubt it.  Yeah, you're in good standing with them.  I would buy three readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  No.  It's also on...  I bought it.  Audible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Audible.  Yes, Jeff reads it.  Nice.  Gina Trapani, she writes Think Up.  That's where you're going to see these amazing insights about your social media, who follows  you.  Actually, I really like my Think Up because I learn a lot.  My number one tweet, my retweets, outnumbered replies by 48, favorites by 14, my biggest  admirers, my status updates from last week got the best responses between 10 a.m. and  11 a.m.  So that's what I should tweet from now on, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You give good Think Up, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love my Think Up.  It's getting better all the time.  You're getting great.  On this day in 2011, my most popular tweet, I had 13 tweets last week, that's seven fewer,  so I got to get going.  How many tweets do you have every week, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see what my latest is.  Your data isn't fantastic.  We've actually found a few good bugs thanks to your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like two tweets a day.  How often do you tweet, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  About 18 a week.  I had 18 a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I was a little bit of a slacker, but maybe not.  Jeff probably tweets like 50 or 60 times a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I've got a great one.  Gina's own application made her a humble brag.  Go to JeffJarvis.thinkup.com and go to the third box down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I can read your Think Up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, JeffJarvis.thinkup.com.

Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought I could only read mine.  Sure, sure, sure.  So the third box down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Someone with twice as many followers than Jeff retweeted this tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That someone happens to be Gina Trapani.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, if I retweet that tweet, maybe I can even improve it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure that you could, Leo.  Let me retweet that tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See what I can do for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Think Up has the Twitter problem where it's a little hard to explain what it does.  And we launched a new homepage this week.  Oh, how is that going?  I think it does it just at thinkup.com, which I hope does a better job.
