Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Gina!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody said she was in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looked like it, but then she was gone.  Maybe she misses us.  She goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I hope she's not taking a look at the show when she's not on it.  That would be sad.  You won't catch me in the rundown, even though in the weeks I'm here.  But we do have a very fitting replacement from Google itself, one of its earliest employees  and one of the most forthright and greatest guys ever from Google.  Matt Cutts, he's in charge of Google spam fighting.  He also does those great Google Webmaster videos.  Hi, Matt.  Nice to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good to see you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like your Hello Kitty.  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  I want to get a dinosaur.  Are you in your home or conference room?  I'm at home right now.  So you must have small children or else you have a weird fetish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, you want to have a little bit of variety to break up the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, I'm not going to press you on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They now have $80 dinosaur heads.  So I was thinking about replacing Hello Kitty with a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they've been doing ads for those giant wall stickers.  Yeah.  Yeah, you can get, you know, football players, giant dinosaurs, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be funny.  Do you have one of those intercoms, Matt, behind you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do. Yeah, I've never used it.  Do you actually use it?  No, it's horrible.  No one ever uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff, are you inhaling helium?  Oh, well, I almost did.  I'm back from the dentist.  But you sound like you sound like this.  I do?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do.  Yes, would you lower your voice, please?  Oh, no.  I think it's a artifact of whatever.  Are you using Skype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I volunteered to.  Should I switch or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Try, let's switch to this guy.  Matt, is there any way to bring hangouts?  Is there a button in Hangouts that gives you a high pitched voice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be a pretty...  Okay, I'm going to file that as a...  Helium voice.  Helium voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should also have Darth Vader voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm all numbed up.  I have two crowns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, that's enough of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Public parts.  That's worse than Jaws.  Shark week on this week in Google.  So gosh, there's so many things to talk about.  I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will you call me back on Skype?  Yeah, I'll do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to call him back.  Okay.  Yeah, because he really does sound like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not, despite all appearances, his normal voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how are things going, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going pretty well.  You know, I actually took...  I tried the 30-day challenge of no work November.  What?  You can't do that?  Yeah, I took a vacation for the month of November,  and it turns out I suck at not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  I couldn't do it.  I still read email, but I didn't.  I could do a week, maybe two.  But then I start going crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you need something.  I still surf all the tech news, so it's like,  well, I might as well get paid to do that.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So 30 days of no work usually means 30 days of no paycheck,  but you probably, knowing you and what a workaholic you are,  you probably accumulated a lot of vacation time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was actually bumping up against the cap at Google.  And so I said, you know what, relatives are coming,  Thanksgiving's coming, let's just take a little bit of time off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, do you have a good team that you can say,  or do you have to get everything done before you leave?  How does that work for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really fantastic.  Things ran like clockwork while I was gone.  You know, everybody's like, oh, Matt's away.  Everybody starts spamming.  But you know, it's not the case.  They catch all the spam regardless.  And I do have a joke with my team that every time I go on vacation,  Google stock price goes up.  And it held true.  So it went up.  Yeah.  Wow.  I'm like, maybe I should just, you know, take a longer vacation.  Everybody's like, no, no, it's fine, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty much any time the sun comes up, Google stock goes up.  So that's a safe bet on that one.  It's been a pretty strong, pretty high flyer.  Now at $1,058.18 a share.  Wow.  That is pretty impressive.  Kind of crazy.  $1,060 today.  Yeah.  Did it hit $1,060?  $1,060, yeah.  $1,060 was the high, 52-week high.  So you're bumping up against the 52-week high.  Not that I follow stocks in any way or know anything about it.  But you're actually challenging Bitcoin at this point.  Let's put it that way.  Yeah, I know.  I'm going to track soon.  It's not clear what's worth more.  It looks like right now Bitcoin is worth more than a share of Google.  It's at $1,193.50.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many Bitcoins are there in the universe and how many shares of Google are there in the universe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ah, that's a good question.  I know the total number of Bitcoin I think is capped at $21 million.  But that's kind of irrelevant because Bitcoins are infinitely sliceable, unlike a Google stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  OK, Google.  How many Bitcoins are there?  Are you using the Chrome version of that?  Yes, of course I am.  Of course you are.  You're going to give me an answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me try it.  Oh, I'm not using Chrome.  I'm using Safari.  I don't get to do it.  And my Moto X is in the other room.  Hey, good deal if you wanted a Moto X.  The unsubsidized price of a Moto G, which is pretty similar to a Moto X, just a little bit slower,  is now I think $179.  That's a good price, boy.  Just shows you.  Just shows you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was.  Well, the Moto X was also unsubsidized on sale, but they had a major problem on the day of sale.  What was that?  They offered it.  It was a Cyber Monday offer.  People were supposed to come in and get any of their offers.  And it just, it was like, my joke on Twitter was that this is what they get for having the White House build the business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a $150 discount, but nobody could get it.  So they're rerunning the promotion, by the way, if you wanted it.  You'll have two more chances to get an unlocked, unsubsidized Moto X for $350, very much like the Nexus 5.  Noon Eastern today.  So it started at 9 o'clock this morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they've already sold out for today.  So if you want a Moto X, and that's what my primary phone is, a Moto X.  I love the Moto X.  Monday at 9 a.m. Pacific noon, I think.  Monday.  Yep. That's the next chance to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How long did it take to sell out, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I checked just before the show and it was already sold out.  So it only took at most a few hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Did they say how many? What is the number that they have?  They increased the number, whatever it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. They said they like doubled the number or something.  And, you know, I've read a lot of stories that say the Moto X sales are disappointing.  But then there was another good story that said, no, that was like the last three weeks of the quarter  and that was on like one carrier where they had Moto Maker.  And so now it's a lot more available.  So it seems like a lot of people are getting them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought I love it. And I try them all.  I had all the phones, all the hot phones.  I like the Nexus 5 a lot, but I stick with the Moto X.  It's got Kit Kat now.  And I just because of the additional little features.  I know Jeff sent his back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think I consider the Nexus 5 I'm pleased with at an equal price.  Maybe the features might have pushed me to the Moto X.  I know it's not negative on the Moto X.  I just I just wanted to hold out for the next five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the Nexus 5 has a bigger screen, arguably a better screen because it's much higher resolution.  And there's no question it has a much better camera.  The Moto X camera is still disappoints, unfortunately.  However, all in all, just because of the size and the features, I try as I might.  And you know me, I change phones a lot.  This phone is sticky on my hand. I can't get rid of it.  So I'm pretty happy with it.  It's certainly I think I thought at the time and I still think this is a phone that's going to be a sleeper.  I also think that we're due for an upgrade.  I would not be surprised to see a 1080p Moto X in the next few months.  I just feel like that's that we've got to be getting close to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually broke my Moto X on Halloween.  My costume didn't have any pockets right on the bathroom floor.  Wait, wait, wait. What were you?  I was the dread pirate Robert.  I was I was the Silk Road version.  So you were loaded with Bitcoin.  Yeah, I was going to trade bitcoins and I had Iocaine powder in one pocket.  And so I dropped my Moto X.  And I actually bought a new one at full price, the developer version, because I was like, yeah, the Moto X is and I am on Verizon.  The Nexus 5 is not on Verizon.  So that's one tricky part. But it's a really good.  Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You even grew you even grew a mustache for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did. Yes.  Look at that.  A little bit of the pencil mustache.  I was my wife had tights or taggings or I don't know what you call them, but they didn't have pockets.  And so I tried to put the phone in the in the gloves and then they just fell right out.  Looks good. Looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the and the Iocaine in the pocket. Very handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I had a sword left over from being an ego Montoya a few years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My name is an ego Montoya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not so very different, frankly, from the an ego Montoya costume.  No, it's a pretty similar costume.  Yeah, some black stuff.  The lines are different. That's about it.  That's about it.  So I was now I just want to toot my own horn here because when Andy Rubin left the Android group and they and they said, well, he's going to go to a moonshot.  I immediately said, I bet he's going to robotics.  Remember that, Jeff?  Yep, you did. You did, boss.  Because I knew that he had job experience in the field.  But more importantly, he had a love of robotics that if you apparently you see at his house where robots did everything from answer the door to make the coffee.  Well, now, according to John Markoff of the New York Times, Google and Andy Rubin are working on robots.  They've acquired kind of seven companies quietly, seven companies to do robots, including, by the way,  robot drones that can deliver stuff.  So take that, Jeff.  Jeff Bezos.  I think this is really cool.  Now, apparently, the focus will be on robots to do manufacture, not consumer robots.  B2B.  Yeah, but, you know, that's a little disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What interests me about the stories is the idea of Google getting into warehousing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon style warehousing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that was fascinating as an angle here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would Google keep in those warehouses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hard drives, who knows?  Lots of glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it would become a facilitator of commerce.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's not going to change their business model so much that they're going to become an Amazon competitor, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but in the long run, what is advertising but selling stuff?  And the closer you get to the transaction, the more you know.  Right.  I find it odd because it's such a specialized business.  It's so expensive, which it's weird you have Amazon and Google meeting in the middle, right?  Because Google just announced new discounts and a lot more for its cloud service.  It's going into more heavy competition with Amazon Web Services.  And so, who knows?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then I guess if you're going to sell autonomous vehicles, you need somewhere to keep them.  All those carborating cars or something.  Wait, this is the point where we say that while Matt Cutts works for Google, he's not representing Google at this point.  And anything he says cannot be used against him in a court of law.  Right.  Do you run into Andy on the campus once in a while?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I saw him in downtown Los Altos one day.  Oh.  There was some story that was claiming that he had a secret office in downtown Los Altos or something.  And you could sort of look up the stairway and see some humanoid robot figure.  And so I actually did walk down and I was like, you could kind of peer up into the window and see something.  It's a pretty neat little Easter egg.  But it seems like a pretty intriguing idea.  Larry and Sergey and all those guys have always been interested in energy and transportation and hard science stuff.  Landing on the moon and things like robots, you can definitely see where that would appeal to them.  As far as warehousing, one thing that I've been really impressed with lately is Google Shopping Express.  And so that's working with retailers and trying to find ways to let the retailers get the existing products that they've already got in stock to people.  I've been surprised at how many people, when they give it a try, it's really in the Bay Area right now, they kind of get hooked on it pretty quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I've had conversations with eBay about this stuff, eBay, PayPal, and for local advertising and such.  And the challenge to a great extent is to get local merchants to put their inventory on in a form that is readable so that you can sell it.  And so, you know, Google, I would think, could be a master at helping companies create databases of their stuff.  What do you have in stock? What is available for sale right now?  Then, you know, delivery or sale is kind of a short hop.  But knowing what you have to sell is a data challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you're in the Northern California, which is the only place Google Shopping Express works, a bunch of merchants involved with this, mostly, I mean, they're all brick and mortar,  although most of them, as you'd expect with almost anybody these days, do sell online as well.  So what is Google? Is this like a Groupon kind of thing for Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more like, so for example, this weekend I was putting up my Christmas lights.  And so I was using some Scotch masking tape and I finished out the roll.  And there's an app or a web page where you basically say, OK, I want, you know, Scotch masking tape.  And there's a local Walgreens nearby and they're like, OK, it's a dollar ninety nine and it's either, you know, free delivery or it depends on when you joined and what sort of a member you are.  But you can basically say, yes, I want this masking tape delivered to me, you know, three hours later or six p.m. tonight.  And it saves me the errand, you know, so any time you would be ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. So did you have masking tape delivered to your house?  How imperial can you get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bring me the masking tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I know I went ahead and ordered three of them so that it wouldn't be just like, hey, here's a piece of gum.  You know, but it's surprisingly convenient.  And once you start using it, you're like, wow, this is, you know, instead of the 20 minutes to run to the store, I can go and tackle something else.  You're kind of like, hey, this is really nice.  And it's or like you want to get big 24 packs of water delivered instead of hoping it yourself and hurting your back.  Someone will just drop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Someone will just drop that can't be cost effective, though.  I mean, really. So here's a sriracha normally two fifty a buck ninety nine.  I'm going to add that to my cart. It's from Nob Hill.  Is there a big gold delivery fee? Let's just see if I can get a little sriracha delivered deliveries free nominally for ninety nine.  There's also a ten dollar first order credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to go out of manufacture, Leo, because it's causing stink in the neighborhood where it's made.  So order some more. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you get a free trial membership.  You need a Google Wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But you've got that, Leo, if Petaluma is in the delivery area.  It's not, alas.  Oh, sadly. OK. But it's pretty interesting to sign up because during this sort of trial area or trial period, it's pretty fascinating how quickly you get used to it if you don't have to worry as much about the delivery fees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Now, there will be a delivery fee eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So they work. They're working with retailers. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, that's it. Exactly. And who does the delivery? Does Google or does Wal-Mart or whoever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google does the delivery. Google does. They work with existing retailers, you know, to go through the back or even pull something off of the shelf and then just bring it right to your door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I had this I had this fantasy. I saw a picture of one of these guys doing it.  And I thought, you know, he calls home and says, Mom, Dad, I'm working for Google.  Yay, son, you finally made good. What are you doing?  I'm delivering masking tape to some imperial guy who wants it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not exactly the internship you were hoping for.  I just don't understand why Google's getting in this business.  This is historically a very tough business.  Amazon has never has made no money ever because they invest everything they make back into building.  What is it? More than 90 distribution centers.  Truly. But here's a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon competes with local retailers. Watch out. Jeff Bezos, Washington Post.  eBay serves local retailers and trying to get them on more.  Google does. There's going to be a big push. eBay does. eBay.  So Google comes into this and Google's going the eBay side of that and saying, well, we're also going to I think so far they're saying we're going to serve the retailers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But wait, wait, wait. So what is Google's end of the business here?  They have to run a fleet of trucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's useful data. And you think about the routing algorithms, you know, in order to deliver packages effectively.  That's kind of like when you say I want to go from one address to another address and you want to do that efficiently.  Yeah.  Except it's multiple points, multiple deliveries, you know, quickly becomes an actual computer science problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you don't. Well, maybe you do. You tell me. Does Google do stuff just because it's an interesting problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, a lot of engineers get really interested in stuff.  But I don't think Larry and Sergey would pursue it if they didn't see an end goal that they thought was worthwhile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't turn it into a business just because it's well.  And I, you know, I watched the 60 Minutes interview with Jeff Bezos and I thought it was fascinating.  And one of the things they pointed out is that the bins in the fulfillment centers are contained, but apparently random items.  The algorithm is to to pack it.  So they fit as many things as they can into those bins.  And it's purely based on the size and dimensions of the item.  And then they trust their automated systems to get the item, the proper item from the it's basically how I do my wine seller.  I actually spent some time thinking about this.  What would be the best way to map out a wine seller so that you would know exactly where the wine you want was?  So I created a fleet of robots. It's an interesting problem.  It seems like a strange business for Google to get into because they're not selling the product.  They're not stocking the product. They're they're in the delivery.  OK, they're a fulfillment center.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The next step is self-driving vehicles.  Or drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't believe that do you?  Google is also doing drones according to the L.A. Times.  Amazon, of course, and I think Jeff Bezos just was playing Charlie Rose in 60 minutes when he showed the Amazon drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, my God, said Charlie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he was so impressed without, of course, thinking of the issue of, for instance, these unprotected eight rotor blades flying through the air at eye level at your house.  But apparently, UPS and Google, according to unnamed sources, are testing and evaluating different ways they could out drones to delivery vehicles.  UPS has not confirmed the report, but says it's an interesting technology and will continue to evaluate it.  Reports from as far back as February by nine to five, Google say Google has been testing many drone delivery systems that it would like to use with Google Shopping Express.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, fast forward 10 or 15 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope not. I don't want to live in a world where there's there's competing copters flying around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe it's not drones. Maybe it is self-driving cars and Andy Rubin's robots.  You know, who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does. You know, I mean, drones save you money over trucks.  You know, despite all the, you know, complications of this.  But again, I just it seems like there are other businesses that would be quicker and easier to enter than this very challenging kind of hybrid brick and mortar business.  But so did you think that the that Andy's working on stuff like the shopping?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really don't know. But, you know, it does seem like he's been interested in robots for a long time.  You know, even some of the earliest stories about he mentioned how well his house is wired up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I was it was it seemed to me that if you're going to if Andy Rubin is going to leave and by the way, the name of the Android is Android.  And I'm sure Andy had something to do with that. If the name of if the energy is going to leave Android to do a moonshot, seems like the first thing I'd put him at that do, you know, philosophically, Leo, I think I think Matt did touch on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that the time that Matt saved not going to the Walgreens to get the masking tape is freed up his time.  And that's what we constantly hear from from Larry and Sergey is is freeing up the human capital of time and attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I understand, you know, if you're Amazon and you're trying to compete against a brick and mortar, the only thing a brick and mortar offers that you don't is the ability to go get it and have it today.  Right. And so it makes perfect sense for Amazon to be exploring whatever means it can for same day delivery. That just seems like Amazon's challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon's challenge is how many data warehouse, I mean, how many how many physical warehouses can they build in close proximity to how much population versus if Google and or eBay contain the inventory that already exists in the field and then can turn around and say, I have an order for masking tape.  Mr. Cuts doesn't care where it comes from. Who wants this order? Who's going to give me the best price for this? We'll come pick it up. We'll take it to Mr. Cuts and we'll take our cut of Mr. Cuts order along the way.  But it starts a marketplace of physical sales. And if you can enable that, it's powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you pay to have pizza delivered to you. Yeah.  Something sufficiently interesting or useful to you compared to pizza or saves you the time of making dinner or saves you pizza you have to have delivered to you because if you shipped it by truck, it would take too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But actually, there is a food service at Petaluma Petaluma food taxi that supports many of the restaurants in town and I use it at least weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We showed the video from Pizza Hut beating Amazon to the punch, delivering a pizza by drone. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, it just seems like this is a business Google's not in. It's kind of like the health care website because the challenge is if you don't control the products is in coordinating all these disparate databases, having them somehow interface with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm saying, Leo, if it's a data problem, I understand. It's like OpenTable has become the point of sale reservation service for every restaurant.  They intended to do it as a consumer service. They found that their real business was was handling the back end for every restaurant.  And then the front end consumer business became an add on gravy. Right. Yeah.  And I would argue at some point that if Google as a data service says to every retailer use, I mean, they don't have this yet, but I would I would say that they and eBay were going to be in a fight to say we become your inventory management system.  And if we have your inventory, look what they can do with that. And then they don't need warehouses. They don't need inventory risks. They don't need all of that. They'll just say we'll sell whoever has the damn masking tape.  As long as we can interface with their systems and that we can, you know, we are their system. No, no, no. I'm saying we are there. We provide the system. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I want to emphasize like Amazon, they have their own warehouses and Google Shopping Express explicitly says let's work with retail. Right. But what I've been impressed about is number one, if they say they have a product, they don't come back later and say, oh, turns out we don't have that product. Someone took it off the shelf. That's been pretty good.  And just the fact that you can actually schedule a delivery window. I mean, I don't know about you, but I often spend a lot of my weekend doing errands. And if I can knock those out and, you know, pay us very small fee or maybe even no fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I agree. Then that that time is worth, you know, something. That's why is Harry Lyman. Our chat room says a lot of science fiction featured pneumatic tubes. Yeah. Because it would just your sriracha sauce. Oh, I love those things on newspapers.  I just love we came back drunk from the bar the things we would put in it. Oh, God. I really wanted to get a new man. I actually research a new system for here. Oh, would have been great. Oh, beautiful. I really wanted that. I still do when they arrive. It's that whoop. Right. It's great. And what? So what you see in that what I just said is what really is happening at Google because I have fantasies about things I would like to do, but of course don't have the resources to do it. What I want to do is I want to see how I'm going to be able to make the system.  And said, now what do you want to do? Pneumatic tubes to every home in the United States is not so far fetched with a little fiber attached to it. Yeah, a little fiber tube. You know, it might be as more sensible for both Jeff Bezos and Larry Page to start working on.  And what do they call them in Star Trek where they they make the food for you? Oh, the synthesizer. Yes, I'm sort of synthesizing food, food, 3D, food printers, 3D food printers. Well, Sergey kind of is right. His hamburger. Of course. That's right. Of course. Replicators. That's it. Yep. I want to rep. Just put a replicator in every home. You don't need to deliver anything. How hard could that be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we also have a story in here that Google is going to grow plants on the moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We just let you think this is pie in the sky. Well, it is in the sky or or or Brussels sprouts in the sky. It is it is with the help of NASA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or NASA with the help of Google and really more to the case. It's part of the SpaceX project. They're going to put up a pod up there that's going to plant some seeds and see how they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once the lander arrives on the moon, water will be added to basil turnip and a rabbit.  Dopsis, a small flowering plant seeds kept in the habitat, then monitored for five to 10 days and compared to controls back on the earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  NASA will also monitor the actual habitat itself. Wow. Currently, it ought to be in a way. You know, I think it's I think it qualifies as evil to spread turnips in the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Currently, the chamber can support 10 basil seeds, 10 turnip seeds, but 100 Arabidopsis seeds. It also holds a little bit of water.  So it's a small project, a pilot project. Yeah. Just a little tiny matter of putting something on the moon.  I think Jeff, contrary to what you've just asserted, the turnip is a perfect food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It may not be palatable. It's only slightly better than what I consider a product of radioactivity, which is the Brussels sprout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the Brussels sprout. Oh, you would. To each his own. Oh, God, they're awful.  Wait a minute. I should I think I could do a Google search on the nutritional value of a turnip.  It might be just a pure starch, but it just seems to me that a turnip might also be a perfect protein. You never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, Google, what is the nutritional value of a turnip? 34 calories per medium turnip. See, it's low-cal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No very little fat, cholesterol or sodium. Nice potassium load. 8 grams of carbohydrates. No vitamin A.  No vitamin A. A little vitamin C. A lot of vitamin C. It's a high in vitamin C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll make soylent turnips where they make it taste better. Soylent turnips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I figured turnip is like the basic root that you could pump into a replicator turnip puree and anything could be made of it.  From steak to hot wheels.  It's like the ultimate raw material is a turnip.  Oh, now let's do a wolfram alpha comparing a turnip to a Brussels sprout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Google that you can do versus and it'll show you both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, turnips are much lower calorie, much lower fat.  What's the quotient of evil?  What's the quotient of evil?  A little more sodium, a little less potassium, lower carb, high in fiber, not as much as a turnip. I mean a Brussels sprout is.  I don't know if we've learned anything here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or how about versus a French fry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. A turnip versus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about a turnip fry? I bet if we grew up in an alternate universe, you would have turnip fries.  It's a root vegetable. You slice it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. Allrecipes.com. Crispy turnip fries recipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That got a weird result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rutabaga versus French fries.  It obviously says turnip.  That's a turnip. Is that a rutabaga?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Maybe a bug report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could choose between boiled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Roasted turnips with parmesan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's quite good actually. Because of the parmesan, the turnip is just a substrate.  It's really a parmesan holder.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Alright Andy Rubin, get to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Make something with turnips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So a rutabaga is a type of turnip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. And to be honest, I frankly don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, Gina, come back. Look how far we're going off. Gina, you must be here.  What did you think of the Jeff Bezos drone reveal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that pure theater? Was he serious about it?  Is Amazon really going to ever deliver stuff with drones or Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I almost envisioned that he was making a joke on Charlie and it felt bad and couldn't say, I'm joshing you here fella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just kidding Charlie.  No, I think, I don't know. I think Jeff was sincere.  I think he thought in his mind, it will be apparent to anyone that this is purely blue sky research.  And that we are not anywhere close to actually getting these off the ground.  But they did. I mean they have a video that shows it working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And imagine taking stuff to a remote village. Imagine using drones to take things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's been used according to the MIT technology review. It has been used in Haiti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it is in fact, drone delivery is a reality. It's not imaginary. It's got its problems.  There's some issues involved.  They talked to a professor of aeronautics at MIT. Technically it's totally feasible of course.  The question is will the FAA allow it? And they should, says John Hansman, professor of aeronautics.  And if the business case makes sense, he thinks it would cost a lot. You'd have to pay a lot for that.  But Matternet, which is a Singularity University funded project, and Aria Logistics, which is building an autonomous logistics infrastructure,  is working on this kind of thing. But instead of putting them on the front sidewalk, they would put them on predetermined pads.  Which seems like that would solve the haircut problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They can go like 30 miles at a pop and just go pad to pad to pad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Matternet tested drones as a way to deliver supplies to refugee camps in Haiti.  They found it cost only 20 to 70 cents to deliver a 2 kilogram package 10 kilometers.  Which is 5 times less expensive. One fifth the cost of a truck.  So this is not completely pie in the sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't imagine things like organ transplant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Get that liver out here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After you have the turnips and you need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here is a point. I just think we like the idea of these of these quadcopters, these autonomous drones.  Here's a drone delivering to a refugee camp in Port-au-Prince.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, stand back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was talking to Tim Pool, wonderful, this wonderful guy who he's the guy who live streamed Occupy Wall Street for 21 hours.  Oh yeah.  And he said that he would never use a titanium whirly drone because it could kill somebody.  But if you use the smaller drones with a little plastic.  Yeah, a little rubber drone.  What he really wants, and he's right, is you want to blimp on top of that.  Oh.  So it doesn't just drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, a balloon drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so it's a tiny dirgeable.  Or make him out of Nerf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody was ever hurt by a Nerf drone.  Turnip drones, we've got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of the parrot quadcopter has that sort of foam to protect it.  And then Chris Anderson and 3D Robotics, they're really big into drones.  And there's been some interesting stuff with drones where you can buy them as a service.  And they'll basically take a picture of your farm or your vineyard or whatever with very high resolution.  And then you can do that as an overlay on a Google map or something like that.  And you can just basically define this is the path or this is the outline of what I want you to take a picture of.  And so it's one of these things where we're all laughing about drones right up until they kind of materialize and turn out to be pretty realistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We will live in the future any minute now.  Matt Cutts is here from Google.  Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.  We're talking about Google.  Gina Trapani has the month off, I'm sad to say, as she relocates to Brooklyn.  I'm very happy because she's going to be happier in Williamsburg or wherever she's going.  Happier in the Brooklyn.  Actually, I don't know where in Brooklyn.  I'm not sure either.  Our show today brought to you by Atlassian.  Oh, I should, oh, I guess there's no, I was going to do a little contest.  What is used by over 20,000 companies, including 70% of the Fortune 500, 70% of the Fortune 100 and NASA?  What can be used to follow code development from through delivery in one system using Git?  What can be used with REST APIs to track your project, to track your code, to keep track of what you're doing?  It's Atlassian's Jira, project management software.  Jira is one of the world's most powerful and customizable issue and project management systems,  capturing and organizing your workflow so you can prioritize and take action on what's important  while staying up to date with the activity going on around you.  As you know, these projects are hard to manage, but a tool like Jira can make such a difference.  You can easily capture, organize and prioritize your team's issues, tasks,  features, bugs. It works with Git, as I mentioned. You're not giving up your source code repository.  It's just a simple intuitive interface for collaborating with other team members in real time.  And of course, seamlessly integrating your planning documents, your backlog, your issues,  and your code repository wherever it might be all in one platform.  Set up any business process you can manage so your team works the way you want.  I'm fascinated by this stuff. The same way we're using technology to solve these problems  and things like logistics and package delivery, technology makes such a big difference  when you're working together on a big project. Use email, chat to stay in the loop.  You can even use Twitter mentions or RSS, monitor streams of activity or self-updating reports and dashboards.  You're always in the know. And of course, as your project grows, you can grow infinitely in any direction  with hundreds of JIRA add-ons including test management, time tracking, project management, many, many, many more.  If you've got code, JIRA ties everything together from initial planning document to the files and change sets  in your code repository right through to this deployment.  JIRA, flexible enough for a five-person startup, powerful enough for 100,000-person enterprise.  That's why so many use JIRA.  And we want you to try it by going, you can get it free for 30 days, going to Atlassian.com slash twig,  A-T-L-A-S-S-I-A-N dot com slash twig for more information on JIRA.  Monthly plans start at $10 a month for up to 10 users, so it's very affordable but free for the first 30 days.  Atlassian.com slash twig, try JIRA today. Comes from Go JIRA, the Japanese company.  Comes from Go JIRA, the Japanese name for Godzilla. Go JIRA. Go JIRA.  Speaking of the cloud, Google, as you mentioned, you kind of touched on this, Jeff Jarvis,  is slashing prices on its compute cloud, going again against Amazon. This is another thing Amazon does.  Google's got the compute engine, a year and a half old. Now, I guess that was a preview.  So it's now generally, I didn't realize this because I know so many people use it, it is now generally available,  including an SLA that guarantees 99.95% uptime.  16 core instances, faster persistent disks. This is so cool that you can have a 16 core compute cloud.  Just think of all the things. Now, compute engine is a commercial product, right?  I mean, do you have any information on this, Matt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, just the standard sort of, I know for a long time people have wanted to be able to use Google infrastructure  to do their sort of tasks, whether it's storage or computing or whatever.  And now we're sort of filling that out. You can sort of see that picture of where,  whether it's data storage or querying over that storage or doing large scale computation,  whatever it is, we want to be able to support that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This makes sense to me. I mean, you've had App Engine since 2008.  This just makes sense. This is, I mean, Google's got the, they've solved the infrastructure problem.  Snapchat uses compute engine, Evite, Wix.  So it just, this seems like a business that makes sense for Google being compared to shopping.  I mean, because they've got the, you've got the infrastructure.  Is it like CompuServe was, which H&R Block had a bunch of computers they weren't using.  They said, well, we'll rent these out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah. I mean, if you think about it, we have a lot more computers than almost anyone else.  And so we use those computers a lot, but we also know an awful lot about utilization,  how to get the most out of the CPU and the RAM.  You want to have enough so that you can have some spikes, but you don't want to waste that CPU and that RAM.  And so there's a lot of wiggle room there where you can bring in, you know, people who want to do computing jobs.  And it's, you know, relatively minor compared to Google's overall fleet of computers.  And so we can fold that in and have it run and be available in a very highly persistent way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But will it be sentient like Stephen Rulphrum's compute cluster? That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we need to make sure all our code names are cute and cuddly, not like Skynet or the TeraRain or the Borg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to be careful. You got to be careful.  No, I think this really is very powerful, empowering technology that makes it possible.  Well, for like these two guys at Stanford to create Snapchat, they didn't have to have, they didn't have to.  You know, I remember when Kevin Rose set up Dig and what a big deal it was to find a colo and to get the servers and to provision the servers.  You had to do almost all the heavy lifting yourself and you had to raise money because it was very expensive.  And so it kept people from just trying ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The unreliability of Blogger at the beginning.  It nearly died. People weren't ready to scream forever.  And poor guy is just trying to throw in some more chewing gum into his servers.  Yeah, it was a big, it's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now you can be Snapchat. You can just be a couple of frat brothers in Stanford and you go, hey, we don't have to do any of that.  Just use a compute engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a feature server war that's going to go on too.  Two weeks ago, we didn't talk about it on the show, but Amazon, AWS announced new high reliability, fast delivery of things like games and high data applications.  So that you could put more on the cloud, less on the on the end, share things in new ways.  I think we're going to find more services adding on to the cloud world that will enable tons untold numbers of companies to use those that functionality to build new things.  Yeah, you know, Eric Schmidt talks about how the limits of the early technology companies were based on the regulatory nature of what you could get over T1.  That's right.  So when you open things up and you create this new functionality as true platforms, what innovators can do will be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Huge. And we're already seeing it. I mean, that's, that's why, you know, what is Snapchat's worth $3 billion in just a couple of years or Instagram's worth a billion dollars, a couple of engineers and Instagram's worth a billion dollars.  Instagram uses S3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember talking to Brett Taylor way back when he was a product manager before, you know, Facebook.  And, you know, he would sort of, I think he had a pool of friends that he they got together and had a shared server.  And, you know, you think back to 2007, so hard to do, you know, you're doing all that stuff by hand.  You shouldn't have to deal with that sort of minutia if you're just trying to set up a service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's the difference between pumping your own water and bringing it to the kitchen and turning on the faucet.  It's just it's a huge difference in the capabilities. And that's exciting.  I'm thrilled to hear that there's competition because that keeps prices down and so forth.  And it's not just Google and Amazon. There's Rackspace. There's a lot of companies doing this now.  I guess I should bring this up since we have the the king himself.  Smartphone crawling errors in the Webmaster Tools.  Right. What is that?  We just did a blog post earlier today about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you go back and you look at Black Friday and Cyber Monday's stats, you'll see a lot of people saying, you know,  mobile was an unexpectedly large amount of traffic.  Yeah.  It was like 187 percent growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's huge.  Year over year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Over and over again at search conferences, I say mobile is coming faster than you expect.  Get ready for it. And yet people really haven't.  And so you look at these stats and they're like, oh, IBM says, you know, this much more came from mobile.  And if you try to buy things on a mobile phone, it's really frustrating.  So we're trying to help webmasters and site owners and publishers figure out how to get ready for a mobile world.  And one of the most common things that we're trying to do is to get people ready for mobile.  And one of the common mistakes that people make is things work fine on the desktop.  But whenever you go to a smartphone, you get redirected to an error page or you always go to the same page.  And so we're basically just surfacing whenever we crawl as a regular desktop user, as Googlebot, versus as a mobile phone,  what sort of strange behaviors do we see that you might want to fix?  But it is like, you know, if you have an unusually large number of errors, then you want to think about,  okay, what am I doing wrong? I need to go and fix things so that it works fine for smartphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How common it is. I get the faulty redirect a lot on mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really common. Like, so far, mobile is still the unloved stepchild.  And it's like, this is the stepchild who's like the overachiever genius and yet no one is really paying attention to it.  And so with time, you know, things will get allocated correctly and appropriately.  But right now people don't realize how much mobile matters.  And so, for example, there's a request autocomplete and there's a new service from Google to let you buy with Google Wallet.  Like something like 1% of transactions that are mobile end up succeeding because people are like, oh, I'm not going to type in my form, you know, while I'm on a mobile phone.  And so there's a lot of stuff coming down the pipe that like request autocomplete that turns it into like two clicks to fill out a form.  And if your website enables that, it just lowers the friction for buying things on the tablet or on a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the plug to use Google services. But also you probably should fix these errors in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Or, you know, responsive design. Just, you know, employ a tablet or a phone and make sure that your website doesn't look completely sucky.  Like that's level one. Just do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah. And I still, I mean, I'm still guilty of this. I have a mobile site on my blog, my personal blog, as well as a desktop site.  And that's that's so 2006. I mean, you really should have a single design, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can still work, you know, but but if you don't think about mobile at all, then it's probably going to come back to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So this is one thing I've been wondering about is a lot of people still include tablets and mobile and I don't I tablets to me are the new laptops.  How does Google look at in terms of traffic? How do you categorize what mobile means?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that is really tricky because is it by resolution or is it by screen size and different people, whether it's Google Analytics or Webmaster Tools might have slightly different opinions about that.  That's something that we'll still have to figure out exactly because, you know, it even goes down to Android versus Chrome.  You know, for a long time, it was like, well, Chrome is the thing that has a keyboard, you know, but but but you know, that distinction doesn't make as much sense as the devices start to converge.  So but but even if you if you handle smartphones, normally tablets will still work. OK, so it's worth doing some thinking about.  But, you know, it depends on how much resources you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I was busy uploading the verification file to my Leoville so I could check for for crawling errors in your Webmaster Tools.  That's great. That's a nice feature, I have to say.  And I mean, I do use it on on the Twitter site, but I think this is it's a is this a new verification system?  It seems a lot easier than it used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, it turns out one of the main ways that people failed to register with Webmaster Tools is, you know, they didn't know how to upload a file to their site or they didn't know how to change their DNS.  And so we're just we're trying to make it easier and easier, even working with some, you know, web hosts so that like if you use GoDaddy, it could be like automatically.  It's just there. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Well, I shouldn't probably be doing this right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not one click yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll save this for another another time when I'm not doing a show.  It's great to have you. Matt Cutts is here from the goog as well as, of course, Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York.  Jeff's latest book is Public Parts, as you mentioned.  We didn't want to see his teeth, but there you go.  Public is public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, get back. Get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff is also two crowns, two crowns, two crowns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was that painful to the wall of three thousand bucks?  Whoa. I probably cracked one and then six days later, the one next to it.  Yeah, it's it's. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They when they go, they start to go go once.  Oh, thanks a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's. Oh, that delivers a lot.  Jeff and I are the same same age and we're both falling apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basically, we're just we're falling.  Don't ever don't ever get old. Matt, just stay young.  Stay forever young.  What is your 30 day challenges this month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, have you got one?  I'm getting a little older and so I kind of threw my back out a couple of months ago.  So my 30 day challenge is to do stretches like cat and camel and, you know, try to limber up a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you found the premise of this 30 day challenge for those who don't know is that if you do something, anything for 30 days, it becomes a habit and then you can continue to do it.  I know I'm fiddling with my mic because it's wobbly.  So that's my 30 day challenge to stop fiddling with myself.  A master of your microphones, master of my domain.  So what have you found in that regard?  I mean, you've done a lot of 30 day challenges now.  Have they all become part of your life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it lets me take it out for a test drive.  Like it turns out I don't really want to be vegan, but I really appreciate knowing what it's like to be vegan.  It's a long time to be vegan.  Yeah.  So but I find that the exercise ones tend to stick.  I've started to actually run more and walk more and bike more and started taking a swimming class recently.  So that stuff surprisingly sticks, which is a good habit to add to your life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm sorry, you said you're doing you're going to do stretches.  Yeah, I think that's good.  I don't stretch enough.  No one stretches enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and it's, you know, therapeutic for your back like cat and camel to try to, you know, we call it cat cow.  Yeah, exactly.  Yes.  So you're not slouching forward all day long, that kind of stuff.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Matt, was there a challenge that you hated more than any other and couldn't wait till it was over and said, I'm never doing that again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No sugar.  Yeah, that's a tough one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But do you mean when you say no sugar, you mean no sugar added or just no sugar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, like artificial sugar like grapes were OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so you can have sweet stuff, but you can't put a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that was pretty hard.  And I talked my wife into it.  So she was very grumpy by the end of the month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is the what are the what is the effect of your challenges on your family?  Oh, dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So far, it's actually been OK.  My wife has joined me for, you know, she's she's sort of been Shanghai into doing a couple like the vegan one because it's you know, if I'm vegan, you have to do it.  Yeah.  But a couple of them like not watching TV for 30 days, she's like, yeah, you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a couple of just a bit of hangout news.  But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's do some hangout news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's that.  And then I just put this I added to the bottom of the Google section there.  Toyota just introduced a collaborative tool for making cars and stuff using hangouts.  So it's an interesting commercial use of hangouts from Google.  Victor Kondotor just announced this afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so let's start with the first one.  We'll do both.  So the hangout-a-thon has to do with giving Tuesday.  So hangouts on on giving Tuesday organizations like UNICEF Charity Water, Save the Children,  the Malala Fund, the Trevor Project, and others will be involved asking donors to help starting.  Well, I guess it's over.  This was this was yesterday.  Oh, we missed it.  It was Wednesday.  Yes.  Oh, dang, nabbit.  Well, it's not too late to give some money.  Do you think there'll be more of these?  This is kind of a neat idea.  I don't know how much they raised, but what a great idea.  And thank you, Google, for doing it.  Yep.  So I didn't see it.  So they rotate through the different groups or how do they do it?  I think I didn't see it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they had different celebrities come in and each.  Yeah, Jennifer Garner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yeah, kind of fun.  I wish they got in Jerry Lewis.  The nice thing about these, of course, you can always you can always watch after the fact because it's on YouTube.  Yeah, it's not you know what?  This is the modern.  This is the modern Jerry Lewis.  If Jerry were here.  Oh, there's the wonderful Sarah Hill.  You don't hurt Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She is wonderful.  She was a news anchor in some southern city.  She now works for a veterans organization.  But she was the most amazing person using Hangouts on the air and Google Class.  And she's just great.  Well, that's neat.  And look at all that.  And talking about their stories and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is really neat.  And we are really moved not just by the story, but so I hope they raise the money.  Yeah, I don't know why you look so pink, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got to work on you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is really neat.  She seems.  Yeah.  So tall.  Nice job, Google.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so that's the that's the and I presume there'll be more of these.  That was.  Now, what?  Tell me about the story that you were talking about, Jeff.  Well, I saw something that Google just added cars to the Knowledge Graph.  And then I saw kind of why they did that, because they Toyota has introduced the collaborator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go to the last piece there, there's there's cars in the Knowledge Graph.  OK, which makes sense.  And it's going to be a way to help sell cars.  But now Vic just announced this.  And it's going to be a way to sell cars.  And I think that's a great idea.  It makes sense.  And it's going to be a way to help sell cars.  But now Vic just announced this commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Buying a car is a big decision.  Now, with Toyota Collaborator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So let's get started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is some like salesman.  I think so.  So this reminds me of the Amazon Mayday feature on the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Except that you're not trying to fix the Kindle.  You're actually trying to sell a car.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and he's got like tools.  They let you pick a color.  I think there are a couple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think he's a salesman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, oh, he's they're doing it together.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just move your head and it looks around.  That's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK, so they're in the picker.  Well, I want to do that.  How can I do that?  Oh, now you can.  Now you can do the Mayday with a guy at your local Toyota dealer.  Yeah.  Huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to do that.  I hope that it eliminates car dealers.  It won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just gives them a camera in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can hang up on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can hang up on them, which is nice.  That's really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just call back when I get someone more friendly.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Goodbye.  So apparently they demoed this at Google I.O.  I must have missed that demo.  They did?  Yeah.  Toyota collaborator.  Oh, I thought it was new.  Well, never mind.  Well, it is.  I mean, I guess it's rolling out.  Oh, I see.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they've been using this platform of Hangouts and Helpouts and all this.  I love Helpouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's such a...  How's that going, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's going pretty well.  And once you get that base there, you can build on top of it, have good APIs, and then,  like you saw those overlays, you could add all sorts of functionality on top of the videos,  whether it's test driving a car or it's like point to where you hurt on the guy who the muscles on the man or something like that.  So I think there's a lot of potential there.  We'll see how that works.  But having open source video codecs and all those sorts of things are good for the web long term as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So toyota.com slash collaborator.  Too bad I'm not in the market for a Toyota, but you can hang out with somebody, which would be a spouse or a friend.  And this, I think, is a lot of times the case when you're buying a car, at least for me.  I don't know anything about cars, so I would want somebody to help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, my wife says I'm a rotten negotiator, so she insists on running out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as you can see, I launched it and immediately launches Hangouts.  So Chad, do you want to help me buy a car?  Yeah.  Okay.  Let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Chad's doing such good work, you should buy him a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, this is good.  Chad, you need a car, right?  Let's decide which car I should...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bought Robin a new Mercedes.  I think, Leo, it's a nice thing for you to do for your staff for Christmas.  Everybody gets a new car, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've been trying to figure out what to get our staff, and I think that's quite brilliant.  Make sure it's twit blue.  Be the first thing.  So it's asking for... here it is now.  Now I'm in the Hangout, Chad.  Are you getting an invitation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm signing in right now, and it'll say... I'm in three Hangouts.  Oh, no, no, just two.  You're very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is cool.  So do we have... apparently we have to buy a Corolla, Chad, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, is that the only car we can customize?  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think so.  Well, wait a minute, let's see.  We can... well, no, you can choose a trim.  The good news is it's only $16,000.  Only?  Well, I'm not going to buy you a $40,000 car.  Okay, so we can rotate it.  There you are, you're both in.  So there you go.  Chad's... okay.  Let's customize it here.  And this is using Hangout.  So what they've done is they've attached... how hard is this...  What are they doing here?  Do you know?  I mean, is this a plug-in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think they've got the basic API, and if you think about...  Oh, look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's looking at my eyes when I look left and right.  This is so crazy.  Oh, this is neat.  No, Burke, you can't have a new car.  Burke's coming over.  Wow, that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, okay, let's not go crazy.  I mean, it's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was doing my Charlie Rose imitation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh.  Now, how do I see the car that you have?  What do you see?  See, over on my end...  Well, right now I see you, but that's because I...  Well, that's no fun.  I viewed you, and if I go in here, it looks like I have a different car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you don't have the same view.  How can I share this with you?  Do I have to...  View.  View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Current model.  Oh, maybe I'm...  Maybe...  Well, I mean, we're both in the same...  Oh, did you just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you see the same thing I do?  It seems like I would.  Yeah.  Maybe I drag you into the car?  That's a little...  No, that's too intuitive.  Huh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Might still be some UI work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is using stuff that's already part of...  Maybe...  Oh, are you in Chrome, Chad?  I'm in Safari.  No, no, you gotta...  No, there's your problem right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  It's just Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, my friend.  It's Sound Nation.  You are...  Create music with your friends in Google Hangouts.  Completely different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We could load up the...  Let's make some music, friend.  We could roll up what I use for D&D games.  We didn't even know about this.  This is cool.  Yeah, no, these are...  So Google has a built-in sort of plug-in system for Hangouts.  That's what's going on.  Right.  And so what I do normally is there's an app called Roll20, and so I could play D&D games...  Oh, you're such a geek.  ...with my friends.  And so in the Hangout, we can roll dice, we can see a big board, we can do different things,  and we could even rotate our characters and stuff.  Oh, cool.  And so this is using that platform of where you can click and drag and do stuff.  We can do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like GarageBand.  You and I can make music together.  It's got samples.  Yeah.  And I can...  That's pretty amazing.  And then we're...  I just...  I think this is incredible.  I didn't realize this.  I'm not really up on what's going on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It changes Hangouts from just a multiple video call to a place where you can actually collaborate  with people.  So here's Roll20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we'd need to be playing a D&D game sometimes.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so you'd sign in...  Well met.  Well met.  Well met, friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good sir.  Take me to the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Choose a campaign to launch.  I'm going to create a new campaign.  There you go.  I don't even know what the hell I'm doing here.  Oh, look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so once you've created a campaign, you can upload images and it'll give you a little  tutorial there.  So this is online gaming.  Yeah, over there in that...  Now there's two chats, which is a little bit confusing, but over in that other chat, you  could write a slash roll D20 and it would roll and keep a log of what...  So does it play Dungeon Master?  Yeah, it's...  Can it have an automated Dungeon Master?  No, I mean you still need a DM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to draw some stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you still need a DM, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here is my island.  There are no income taxes here.  No government regulation.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Google Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's called Google Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Larry is king.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Now, let's roll a dice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ear be dragons.  Yeah.  And so your GM would use this tool to create maps and you can see the grid.  So now you know that such and such item only goes 20 meters and so you can fire that long.  Enter the dungeon.  Right.  But click over there on this.  One of the tools is a dice roller.  Yeah, well, no, I rolled the dice.  Oh, did you?  Okay, good.  You get all sorts of stuff over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's roll 20.  Then there's Toyota collaborator.  So there's only really right now three things I can do.  I can make music, I can play Dungeons and Dragons, or I can buy a Corolla.  Right.  That's what they sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean there's actually a lot.  This is a full plug-in system that people...  Yeah, but we need other people to...  Right.  You could read books to your children with open things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's nice because then I don't have to see the brats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do a remote desktop, help out service where you can call in.  Well, I feel like I'm out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did not realize they were doing all this cool stuff.  I had no idea either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  One of my favorite things is Google effects.  Yeah, I can go in there.  You can add...  So if I'm looking at myself, I can add a hat to it or devil horns.  Yeah, we've seen that.  That's really...  And that was kind of like the basic thing from way back.  Right, I remember that.  So this is more of that plug-in architecture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where do you find this?  This is a Hangouts.  I mean, once you've joined a Hangout...  Look at me, Chad.  Oh, wait.  I got a...  Very good.  Very good, Leo.  It's...  You have my hair.  Thanks.  You obviously approve.  I am looking like Chad and a dog.  Over here on the side, this is where you find them.  So once you're in the Hangout, you can click this little dot, dot, dot.  And you just add...  Yeah, and you can add more apps.  It gives you a whole lot.  Oh, there's a whole lot more.  Yeah, oh yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, see, the story before bedtime is fun.  You get a whole bunch of like open source stories.  Wow.  What does YouTube do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that to record?  Is that to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, just you can view YouTube videos together.  Oh, well, that's neat.  Right.  And it syncs up.  See, look, now...  See, Matt is on Hangouts at the moment.  Pirate Matt.  Right.  Yar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hipster pirate Matt.  Yar, yar, me me tea.  Wow, that's cool.  I like this.  This is a nice feature.  I'd never seen that before.  Just show...  I got to pay more...  I should watch that This Week in Google show.  I hear they cover this stuff pretty well.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you say the word pirate?  Oh, what are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I'm playing with the background.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Keep it that way.  It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a little weird.  But once you have this in an open standard, then you can use WebRTC or anything else to  sort of...  Doesn't have to be Hangouts, in other words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt, you've lost a lot of credibility with me right now for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now we have Google spam fighter Matt Cutts.  So, I don't know if pirate is one of the words you can say in the Google keyboard on Android,  but there are a lot of words you can't say.  Wired Magazine discovered...  There's a 185,000 word dictionary.  Now, this is not banned words.  These aren't words that you...  It's not that you can't use these words.  It's that it will never offer these words as a suggestion for autocomplete.  From preggers to Pizzle, Android's bizarre list of banned words.  Google hasn't said where they get their list.  But as you're swiping...  And this is only for the Google keyboard in Android.  As you're swiping, you can't, for instance, accidentally...  And this is the main point.  You can type in lovemaking.  But if you do this...  Lovemaking, something close to it, it will never suggest lovemaking.  And I don't think this is unreasonable, frankly.  But is prevented, geek...  I don't know why it would prevent you from coming up with geek, except that maybe it's  an insult to some people.  Gonadotropia and Illumination are banned.  Thud.  For some reason, LSAT is banned.  Pizzle, Braless, Panty, Tampax, Lactation, Uterus, and Preggers are all banned.  Condom is banned.  In other words, those will never show up unless you turn off...  I don't actually...  Can you turn it off?  But those will not show up as autocomplete suggestions or correction suggestions.  If you turn off safe typing, I don't know if that's the way to disable this.  Nobody knows where this dictionary comes from.  Google declined, according to the Wired article, to comment on how it compiles a list of offensive words  and how often the list is updated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe somebody will take a fresh look at that after this article.  I suspect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every time we see something like this, that's what happens.  Google goes, oh, we didn't know that.  Let's fix that.  It's easy to do.  Easy to do.  I think, though, it makes some sense.  This is the damn-you-autocorrect problem.  You don't want the autocorrect to fill in words that some people might find offensive.  It doesn't mean you can't type those words in.  You just don't want them to suddenly appear by accident.  What else should we do here?  I'm just looking through our stories.  Demand media has fallen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And guess who helped trip them?  Probably you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guy over there.  Well, that cuts.  Demand media always bugged me, and I think it's bugged you too, Jeff Jarvis.  Anybody who likes the idea of real handmade journalism,  the idea of demand media was that if you look at all the search terms that are popular  and create articles based on those search terms, you can do quite well with kind of...  Not that they're not generated by humans, but they're kind of synthetic articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not an evil strategy off the bat, because about.com made its business around that.  They're saying people are asking questions, let's have answers for those questions.  So that part was okay.  Demand media turned that into the first of the major content farms  where indentured servants of writers doing things for $2 or $10 would turn out these articles  over and over and over again with nothing new, no quality.  And so I think, Matt, it was you who talked about how as a result,  Google had to look for more signals of what? Authority originality?  What were those signals that you had to add in to try to decrease the content farms from rising up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there were a lot of them. We had to do a lot of research.  But the litmus test was always what is the value add for users?  If something is the sort of site that somebody really wants to tell people about,  or bookmark, or those kinds of things, then that tends to be a really high quality site.  Whereas if you land on it once and you're like, oh, this is awful, what am I doing here?  Then that's clearly not the sort of site that we want to return to the search engine.  And so the challenge is trying to find the signals that are able to ascertain the quality of a site  and the added value to a site for users.  And I feel like we've done a pretty good job with Banda.  We always keep iterating. We typically have updates every month or so.  But yeah, that was an interesting article to read because I don't think these days,  if you say I'm going to just create a lot of very low price content on the web,  people would automatically be like, okay, that sounds like a great business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Well, I mean, and this is Demand Media with a capital D in them.  This is a business called Demand Media doing something we label demand media.  Their biggest website, eHow, actually has some good stuff on it.  I've used eHow to find out how to do stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they bought eHow. No, I mean, Demand Media is not completely terrible.  But this is why Matt's job is tough because it's not obvious. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And there's definitely some content that you do when you return and some that you don't.  And typically on a per domain basis, you can say, oh, your times, you know, probably higher quality content,  whereas some other domain might not be.  But you can find high quality content on a domain that might not have the best stuff otherwise and vice versa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the idea would be that you would create link baiting articles that would then have ads on those pages  and that because these articles are generated based on popular search terms, they'd be very successful.  There'd be a lot of money to be made.  But you kind of with your spam fighting and attempting to find better signals  and better, more authoritative articles kind of, I think, hurt the company, went public in 2011.  Market cap went to as much as two billion dollars, making it more valuable, at least for the time being, than the New York Times.  Demand Media is now about a quarter of that value.  And the co-founder is no longer CEO. As of October, they're looking for a replacement.  In fact, it looks like the only thing left of their business is their domain registration business, which was where it all started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  They had a whole bunch of domains, typo domains and that kind of stuff.  They throw some content on there and get ads on that, right, Matt?  That's where this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Enum was always sort of a source of strength for Demand Media.  The interesting thing is that there was another domain registrar or registry which had mentioned that, well,  people don't necessarily like seeing what we call parked domains showing up in search results.  So if you just type in...  I hate that.  Yeah, and so we actually deployed an algorithm that tries to not show parked domains with all those ads in search results.  And so we saw at least one company say, as a result, domain parking is...  It started to grow more slowly or even decline a little bit because that algorithm did have an impact on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So as an example, and this is a variety article, they created 3D-Blu-ray-players.com.  And of course, the idea would be that if I did a Google search for 3D Blu-ray players,  well, what would be more canonical than a site called 3DBlu-ray-players.com?  But of course, you go there and it's just a parked page with a lot of ads on it.  And I remember there was a period where I would get a lot of those in Google searches and it's gone.  And it's not because the pages are gone. It's because you fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right. We worked really hard to try to make sure that just if you just come up with a clever name,  something something dot net, that doesn't automatically mean you should rank for that particular search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is in the variety article.  Early on, demand used ENOM. That was their registrar service, E-N-O-M.  Used ENOM's 1 million generic domain names to serve up relevant ads to people searching for specific topics.  These domain parking pages were immensely profitable, generating north of $100,000 a day,  according to a former demand exec who requested anonymity.  That's $35 to $40 million a year without doing any work, the exec said.  But as Variety pointed out, the tactic was fundamentally a bait and switch.  You thought you'd get some information instead you just got some ads.  And we've all seen that. I mean, I don't think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt, I've been arguing for some time that as search becomes more and more and more personalized,  that SEO, especially as a dark art, starts to decline in importance because you can't demonstrate an ROI.  You can't say, well, we raised you four spots for everybody's search results because you don't know.  Would you agree with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's two parts to that. I'd say there's the kind of SEO that is just making your site a better site,  better architecture, cleaner URLs, not duplicate content, that sort of stuff.  And that's always a good idea. That's just like making sure your resume doesn't have any typos on it.  That's just clever stuff.  And then there's the kind of SEO that is sort of cheating, trying to get a lot of bad backlinks or scamming.  And that's more like lying on your resume when you sometimes get caught and there's repercussions.  And it definitely helps to personalize because instead of just trying to rank number one for plumbers,  now anywhere you search for plumbers, there's local results and there's results that are not just the same  across the entire country or the entire world.  But it's also the case that we've done a very diligent job of trying to crack down on the black hat type of spam.  So we had an algorithm called Pinkwin that launched that really kind of had a pretty big impact.  We had a more recent launch just a few months ago.  And if you go and you patrol the black hat SEO forums where the guys talk about the techniques that work,  now it's more people trying to sell other people scams rather than just trading tips.  A lot of the life has gone out of those forums.  And even the smaller networks that they're trying to promote, oh, buy my Anglo rank or whatever,  we're in the process of tackling a lot of those link networks as well.  So the good part is if you want to do a real site, you don't have to worry as much about these bad guys  jumping ahead of you. The playing ground is a lot more level now.  So that happened with Panda, right?  Panda was for content farms and low quality, and Pinkwin was for spam, actual cheating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now you've got Hummingbird.  We do, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hummingbird is a rewrite of the core search algorithm just to do a better job of matching the user's query with documents,  especially for natural language queries.  The queries get longer, they have more words in them, and sometimes those words matter and sometimes they don't.  And so Hummingbird affects 90% of all searches, but usually just to a small degree because we're saying,  okay, this particular document isn't really about what the user searched for because maybe they said,  okay, Google, now how do I put a rutabaga up into space?  And what really matters is rutabaga in space and not how do I or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So these can be, it's not that Panda was replaced by rutabaga, whatever the new one is.  Penguin, no.  Penguin, they are in parallel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they all complement each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. What is the current one, the latest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've been working on a lot of different stuff.  We've actually now been trying to work on how to promote good guys.  So if you're an authority in a space, if you search for podcasts,  you want to return something like Twit TV.  So we're trying to figure out who are the authorities in the individual little topic areas,  and then how do we make sure that those sites show up for medical or shopping or travel or anyone of thousands of other things.  And that's done algorithmically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not by humans.  No, definitely not.  And we don't like humans.  We don't need humans.  We can do it with a Python script.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Humans are great, but if you can find a way to tackle it with a computer program, that's also really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, your secret sauce is the signals you use to find out who has authority.  That's traditionally, historically very difficult.  Yeah.  As somebody once said, I might have authority when it comes to my kids.  I might have an authority, but it doesn't have authority with you.  Right.  So authority is a very, is it kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's even harder is, what strikes me is authority by domain.  Right.  And understanding the domain.  Right.  So defining domains, defining what is medicine and what is sports.  But you can do that all algorithmically?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, actually.  So PageRank is sort of this global importance of like, the inert times is important, and so if they link to you, you must also be important.  But you can start to drill down into individual topic areas and say, okay, if Jeff Jarvis links to me, he's an expert in journalism.  And so therefore, I might be a little bit more relevant in the journalistic.  Ah, that makes sense.  Trying to measure those kinds of topics because, you know, you really want to listen to the experts in each area, if you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's really fascinating what you do.  What was your training to do this, Matt?  I was a computer graphics guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  None, in other words.  Yeah, none.  And did you learn on the job or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I learned because I wrote SafeSearch.  And SafeSearch was this porn filter and I saw all these bad, horrible things happening.  And so I sort of like pulled up the rock and saw all the dark things crawling underneath.  And so as a result, I kind of ended up working in that area.  It wasn't like I was trying to learn all the different 19 different ways to say sex or anything like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you think at this point you you really understand the secret sauce and PageRank and all of that or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, Google does a good job of breaking things down into different areas.  So Amit Singhal is the head of all of search ranking and he's really got everything in his mind.  And he's got a whole core of lieutenants who understand individual parts like synonyms and spelling.  And our team's job is really the quality of individual sites and whether people are spamming or cheating.  So that part of it is really my core.  And that's what I hopefully know back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it seems that to make that work, things like authority and all that stuff, you have to understand all of those.  How all those signals apply, where they come from, what to do with them, how to weight them.  So it seems like to be effective at what you do, you have to really do have to fundamentally understand what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It really helps.  And one of the secrets that we do is people don't have individual offices as much at Google.  So I'm in the same office with Amit Singhal and a lot of the web ranking leads and the web spam leads are often in the same office.  So when somebody is talking about, oh, we don't return Banana Republic for this search, you know,  somebody else can be in the same room and perk up their ears and sort of figure out what's going on.  So co-locating all the leads has been very helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Matt, you've heard me joke often.  What I'm about to say is very serious.  I would think that you'd be the meanest, nastiest, most cynical, horrible person at Google and you're the nicest person I know there.  But the serious question from that, that's a very sincere compliment and very true.  Your question from that is in your job, have you gotten a better sense of psychology, either that of the world's or of your own?  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because if you want to stop spam, the most straightforward way to do it is to deny people money because they care about the money and that should be their end goal.  But if you really want to stop spam and it's it's a little bit mean, but what you want to do is you want to break their spirit.  You want to make them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, break their spirit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  So there are there are parts of Google's algorithms specifically designed to frustrate spammers and make them frustrated.  And some of the stuff we do gives people a hint that their site is going to drop.  And then a week or two later, their site actually does drop.  So they get a little bit more frustrated.  And so hopefully and we've actually seen this happen.  People step away from the dark side and they're like, you know what?  That was so much pain and anguish and frustration.  Let's just stay on the high road from now on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they don't know it was Matt Cutts that did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's it's the team.  I can't I can't.  I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see you petting a white cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We shall frustrate you.  Then we shall crush you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they shall bring me masking tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one of some of the stuff that I like the best is when people say, you know what?  This SEO stuff is too unpredictable.  I'm just going to write some apps.  Yeah, there you go.  I'm going to go off and do something productive for society.  And that's great.  All that energy is channeled.  Yeah, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You say stitching content is bad quality content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was just a webmaster video that we made that, you know, it's kind of funny.  We get these requests that come in from all over the world and somebody says, can I do guest blog posting?  You know, and on one end of the spectrum, you know, if Jeff Jarvis wants to do a guest blog, that's different website.  Yeah, you should do it.  But typically what we see is, you know, people who are really like the write an article one time and then email a thousand people and say, hey, how can we how can we get some free links from you?  Right.  And so we you know, you have to answer those kinds of questions, bearing in mind both ends of those spectrum.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So those emails, I mark them as spam.  Is that the right thing to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that definitely is the right thing to do.  If you want to forward them on to me, Jeff, because we want to get those.  Yeah, we love to get those spam reports.  There was a there was a fun Gawker story that just came out last night that was about.  Do you want to get that?  No, no, no, I got it.  Hello, Mr. Cutts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a spammer and I have a message for you.  They're doing a denial of services.  Your phone will not work again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's no, but it is sort of interesting.  There was a guy who sort of pulled back the veil of secrecy on buying and selling links, which is not only against Google's guidelines, but against FTC guidelines as well.  And then two years later, somebody reached out and said, hey, can I buy some links from you?  So this guy led him on for a while and he was like, can you send me some examples of the work that you've done in the past?  And then he, you know, bundles it all up and writes an article.  But a lot of SEOs will actually lead people on and say, well, send me examples of your portfolio.  And then they'll just forward that on as a spam report to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. So, so Matt, while we're quizzing you, we turn into triangulation all of a sudden.  You and native advertising, the whole there was a big FTC event today about advertising.  I'm going to do some survey.  I want to do some work on trying to find out how confused readers really are.  Tony Hale of Chartbeat has been telling me that the click through on this stuff isn't that good.  But of course, it's taking it over the world.  Listicles for all.  How do you deal with, with and for those in the audience that native advertising is when you're trying to make what is basically an advertiser's content, like content so that they are friendlier with that.  How do you view native advertising?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's really tricky because my scope of expertise is the search engines.  And so if you're not spamming the search engines, I or Google specifically, I might not like it.  I might think that you're a horrible person, but we wouldn't take action on you on within Google necessarily.  And so with native advertising, our litmus test is, you know, do you have links that are not adequately disclosed users?  Readers can't realize that they're paid for.  And more importantly, search engines, you know, they affect search engines.  So if if you're paid links don't affect search engines, then you're not violating Google's quality guidelines.  But I think you need to, in my opinion, my personal opinion, you need to have clear and conspicuous, you know, disclosure, because if someone doesn't realize that it's an ad, then you know, you're down a really bad slippery slope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff, you're not asking him the important questions.  What the hell is the barge all about?  This is what we want to know.  This is what we want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your guess is as good as mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't know? They haven't told you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, we've we've read a little bit internally, but I'll stick with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got an invitation to the Google Christmas party that actually had a link to the to the barge article.  So should I go to that? This is the San Francisco Christmas party.  Should I go to that party and expect to be taken over to the barge and floated away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they'll have little tiny barges that they hand out to people or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I've never been invited to the New York Christmas party.  Not that I think about it.  Hey, that's not nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Geez.  It's the hacks.  It's the this is the one I was invited to the hacks and flax holiday party.  The air is brisk.  The days are short and Google's getting ready to help Santa deliver presents with a very large floating nautical sled.  This isn't the invitation.  So I don't know.  I should probably go.  But it's a party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Christmas parties are usually good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's at the glass base camp on Spear Street.  So I'm thinking there's no way to get me from Spear Street to the waterfront in any prompt amount of time.  If they said the party would be on the barge, I'd be there in a second.  In a heartbeat.  We don't we don't know what the barge is.  But the San Francisco Chronicle on Monday ran a story from their investigative reporters.  So material Ross that says, according to the budget report from the builder, it's one of the first of three floating wonders.  The company plans to launch at a total cost of thirty five million dollars.  Turner Construction Company says the idea is to construct the vessels at Treasure Island, then dock them in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York.  It's the projects called Hangar Three.  Each barge is to be stacked with 80 shipping containers and flanked by rows of sales.  It's a floating retail store.  You might you guys at Google must laugh when you see these stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's fun to see how people try to reverse engineer what's going on.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy who had a floating car and happened to just be located near Google and he's like, I am not affiliated.  This is not this is not my floating car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not my floating car.  All right.  I think anything else you guys want to talk about before we move on to our picks and number of the week here?  You got it, boss.  Google Glass used by surgeons.  Comedian wears glass to the mall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Last time I didn't watch it, but the but the stick was that he wanted to convince people that when he was talking to his class that he was actually talking to them and confusing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like talking over their shoulder, but he thinks he's talking to them.  Ed Bassmaster, not his real name, I'm thinking.  I would doubt it.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't know.  All right.  Let's let's take a break and we'll come back and we will have your Leo's tool, Jeff's number and Matt's thing coming up in just a minute.  Our show today.  Oh, I didn't bring my iPad out here to show you Hulu Plus.  I am using Hulu everywhere now.  Hulu Plus is fabulous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of the holidays, they'll report you have one giant Christmas tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You saw the pictures on Google Plus.  Twelve and a half footer.  Wow.  Well, I've always wanted a giant Christmas tree.  And I never really had enough room.  In fact, for years, my kids remember this.  I would buy trees that were too big for the house and have to cut off the top.  Sometimes a lot of the top.  So this year...  I have it on my screen, Chad.  This year, there it is.  It's a big...  You know, the strange thing is there's Lisa in front of the tree.  That actually doesn't make it look as big as it really is.  It's 12 and a half feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see that Uber is delivering Christmas trees?  What?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For like $135, you press a couple buttons and they will deliver the tree to you.  Oh, that is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's kind of funny.  I have this vision now of Matt never leaving home.  His next 30 days.  I got it. His next 30 day challenge is not to leave home.  I want the tree drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, why don't we get the tree drone?  Just drop it on the house.  We...  There was a little bit of an issue because two guys came to deliver the tree.  And only one guy left.  And I'm thinking that there is a guy somewhere stuck in the tree.  I don't know.  I guess I'll just keep listening for cries of help.  Some things, some traditions, you know.  My tool is something that's been out for iPhone for a while.  And you know, we were talking before the show about how much I love the Moto X.  But the thing that's almost a deal breaker is the camera is not great on the Moto X.  And I've used VSCO Cam on iPhone.  It is now out for...  From Visual Supply Company, VSCO.  It's now out and free for Android.  And it's quite a nice camera.  Now, it's not going to overcome any hardware defects.  But I think the features on it are just fabulous.  You get free presets, but you can buy more presets.  I think right now you can buy...  Let me just take a picture and show you.  You can buy presets, the entire set, I think, for six bucks.  And the things you could do with these...  Now, admittedly, Google offers Snapseed for free.  One negative on the presets is they don't have names.  They just have numbers.  So you kind of have to learn what the presets do.  But they're quite, quite sophisticated.  And you can also say how strong you want any preset to be,  which I really like the ability to have a slider that determines how strong that preset is.  You also have a variety of useful tools, including color temperature,  contrast, brightness, rotation, cropping.  All the things you'd expect.  And the other reason I kind of like it...  And this is kind of not really a good reason to like something,  but the pictures get saved into a local gallery.  And then if you want to upload it to...  I don't like it the fact...  I mean, I love the Google Plus auto-upload,  but what I'd like to sometimes do is have it in a local gallery,  work with it a little bit, and then save it.  And you can do that and have it uploaded to Google Plus.  So this could be a negative or a positive, it adds another step.  But I think this is...  I seem to be getting really nice pictures with this.  You also get a lot of information, including the f-stop, the ISO,  and the location of the photo, which I think is pretty cool as well,  and a nice display.  This is free to try.  And then if you want to get additional filters, it comes with quite a few,  $599 VSCO cam, it's for Android.  And while it didn't turn my Moto X camera into the best camera ever,  it does seem to improve the quality a little bit.  I'm kind of a fan, I recommend it.  And I've used it on the iPhone, it's really quite nice on the iPhone.  So also the great UI, I think.  If you don't like your camera, try it.  Jeff Jarvis has, right here, four numbers of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I always get prepared for theft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was no number theft.  If you want to deliver all four, please do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was. No, no, no, I'll just do one, I think, which is that Google,  when in 2003, the entire year was awarded four patents.  When the iPhone came out, it had a total of 38 patents.  Now it is being awarded patents at a rate of 10 every day the patent office is open.  The war is on.  Wow.  Matt Cutts, do you have any patents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do have a few patents, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, wow. In spam fighting?  Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's neat.  Looking at the age of domains and time as a factor in ranking, that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to go around and sue us afterwards?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That actually brings me to my thing, in fact.  That's a great segue, which is a cool website called TrollingEffects.org.  This is not just your standard, hey, please call your congressperson,  but if you click on the take action button, it's actually kind of neat.  It uses Twilio. There's an API.  You call just one phone number.  You don't have to even know who your congressperson is.  Let me step back for a second.  The Innovation Act is an act that tries to make it harder for patent trolls  to sue companies that are actually trying to do business.  Little tiny startups all the way up to Google.  I've certainly had to take time out of my day to deal with frivolous lawsuits  from patent trolls and that sort of thing.  If you dislike patent trolls, I timed it.  It only takes two minutes.  What you do is you call this phone number and it asks you, what is your zip code?  You just type in your zip code and it will automatically connect you  to your congressperson's office.  In my case, I called, I entered my zip code, and it took me to Anna Eshoo.  There's a person right there and she says, how can I help?  I said, I just want to say that I support the Innovation Act.  It would be great if we could take down patent trolls and make it harder for them  to take money off of hardworking real companies.  That's it.  Two minutes and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is.  You just dial this phone number, it will ask you for your zip code,  you enter your zip code and boom, you're done in a minute and a half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good use of the Twilio API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HR 3309, the Innovation Act of 2013.  They're going to vote on it this week.  It is one of several anti-patent troll initiatives,  some from the executive, some from congress, and I think we really need to do this.  It is a huge cost in innovation and it affects some of your favorite people.  Thank you.  I didn't say that.  Please do what you can to fight patent trolls.  Among other things, the Innovation Act makes it easier to fight against trolls in court  to defend yourself.  It also has a feature that requires trolls to make their cases public with specifics,  which at least exposes them to the light of day.  When you see what some of these people claim, it's kind of stunning.  It gives you some protection against a particularly evil kind of patent trolling  where they go to end users.  There was a company that claimed to have a patent for photocopying  and they were actually going to people who have photocopiers  and saying you owe us money because you use a photocopier.  This would prohibit that.  I think this is a good one.  Please, TrollingEffects.org.  I presume they're going to do other stuff.  They've got a good system here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a great platform.  It's EFF and Engen and Berkeley Law and a bunch of great forums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Public knowledge, yeah. This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you feel strongly about patent trolls, and you probably should,  it's literally two minutes to give them a call.  You don't even have to do any work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a tough one.  It's a tough one, but I hope we can prevail.  It was not a xerography.  It was scanning documents.  If you had a scanner, they would go after small businesses who used...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd sit them down and say,  oh, if you're so smart about scanners, can you fix mine?  Yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty amazing.  Matt Cutts, always a pleasure.  Thank you so much for joining us from the horse's mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a ton of fun. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Always a pleasure.  Great to have you here, Matt.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good luck with stretching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wonderful thing. Yeah, I'm stretching right now.  Anything else you want to plug?  Of course, the Webmaster videos you do are fabulous,  and everybody who has a website should watch them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the only other thing I'd say,  is if you do a search for Webmaster videos,  we have a channel on YouTube,  and we're just about to hit 15 million views.  That's pretty nice.  Any questions you have, if you enjoyed the panda or the penguin  or the hummingbird discussion,  we talk about all kinds of things, from mobile phones  to how to make your site faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have 1,038,148 views, according to YouTube,  the Google Webmasters channel.  Why are you giving my Google Wallet card to me?  Did I leave it lying around?  Never mind.  This is Chad's Google Wallet card.  Thank you, Chad. You're welcome.  I really appreciate that.  It was very nice of you. Is this my holiday gift?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, for you giving me the car.  I'll use it for the car.

We'll see you next time on Twig. Bye-bye.
