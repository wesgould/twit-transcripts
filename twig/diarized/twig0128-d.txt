Why? Because this is the show with the highest IQ on the network, so it should be able to do whatever it wants.  That's what I'm saying.  Part of the reason the IQ is so high is we've got the two smartest people anywhere, starting with Gina Trapani, who's back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So glad to be back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's so smart. Her site is called SmarterWhere.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Happy New Year, Twig.  I'm so happy to be back.  It's been two weeks of not seeing Leo. That's too long for me.  So I'm really happy to be back.  I know. I missed you too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff and I did our best. Jeff Jarvis is also here.  He's actually at Arizona State University today.  Are you giving a speech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a symposium here about entrepreneurial journalism.  So I'm doing that. I'm doing a book signing tonight if anyone's around 530 ASU Cronkite School of Journalism.  At the bookstore there or where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's in the School of Journalism.  Right in the school there.  Cool. Go see Jeff if you're in – is it Phoenix?  Phoenix.  Cool. I'd be there if I could.  Jeff is also a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  And he blogs at BuzzMachine.com and his latest book is called Public Parts about the virtues of living in public.  So Gina missed last week where we solved all of Google's problems.  Turns out we didn't. So I could just see Gina yelling at the –

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had gotten back to San Diego and was unpacking and listening to the year-end episode.  And there was one other time I had missed a show and then listened to it after.  And I had the experience of being a listener.  And yeah, I was talking loud. I was yelling. I was like, they're being too easy on them.  Which is often what we get accused of by listeners.  Now you know why.  I have an experience like, well, what about – I mean, hey.  And so I wrote probably – I was probably the hardest on Google I think I've ever been.  I wrote my very demanding hard line to-do list for them in 2012 on my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish you'd been here last week because I would have loved –  It's a great list.  It's a very good list. And I can't disagree with any bit of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So a lot of things are just obvious, right?  I mean, obviously Google has to release a really great tablet this year, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think though that that – now I have to – okay, this is what I would have said if you'd said that last week.  Okay.  I understand why you say that, but I think it's a shame that Google, in order to teach its partners how to do something right,  has to release a phone or a tablet to lead the way.  Microsoft does not do that.  Microsoft never has had to make a reference Windows computer or a reference Windows phone.  Right.  Why does Google have to do that? What's the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I just think it's a different thing.  I think that these are relatively new devices that have – it's a new kind of form factor.  It's a factor.  It's the most personal of personal computers that have ever been made.  And I think that Jobs was onto something when he said the whole widget,  get the hardware and the software people to work together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Google's not a hardware company.  In fact, I don't even have any faith that Google could do a better job than let's say HTC or Samsung or Motorola.  Could they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, now that they have Motorola, I think that they could – I think that maybe they could.  So Chrome, there's that search appliance.  I mean, they've done some hardware.  Well, always with partners. Always with partners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Always with partners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But now that they have Motorola, they actually are a hardware company, if you think of it that way,  as much as they've kind of kept Motorola separate.  Listen, this tablet has to be perfect.  I got the Samsung Galaxy Tab, the 10.1 at Google I.O. this past year.  And an over-the-air update came down and it bricked it.  The thing was bricked for weeks and weeks.  And then I had to connect it to the computer and I was typing all these obscure commands and downloading these weird –  I basically had to root it in order to bring it back to life, which is insane.  That's insane. That should not happen.  This tablet has to be absolutely stutter-free, perfect, flawless ice cream sandwich, amazing, incredible.  And also they have to partner with other software developers.  They have to get the New York Times app. They have to get a good Twitter client.  This tablet has to be the tablet that you want if you're a Google lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's exactly why Android tablets are not making it. Google is not Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they never will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's true.  I think, Gina, you're right that Google needs a great tablet.  But I think Leo's right that Google is probably not the one to build the great tablet on Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think they have the skills.  Although I love this line, don't use chase scenes and explosions  or even robots in the advertising.  I think you're absolutely right. Motorola just really – the whole droid thing.  I don't understand who they're aiming at.  No, it's terrible.  A phone that scares you. Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have to make it the Google tablet because this is the thing.  This is the reason why you want an Android tablet over an iPad.  If you are deeply embedded in the Googleverse, like the Google product verse,  that means that you use Gmail, Docs, Calendar, and Maps a lot.  And those are kind of the most mainstream apps.  Then Android is what you want because those core apps, they're just – they're superior on Android than they are on iPad.  I agree.  So if they can make this incredible tablet with ice cream sandwich apps  and all those core apps on Android are ice cream sandwiched,  and what that means is that they will unfold onto a tablet screen very well with fragments and different panels.  You know, really true tablet apps because that's what ice cream sandwich kind of does.  It lets you kind of fold in menus and fold in fragments to display on many different sizes of screens.  So they have those core apps done.  If you are deeply embedded in the Googleverse, they need to make this incredible killer tablet,  and then they have to market it just like that.  If you love Google, this is the tablet that you want.  And, you know, honestly, because they're playing catch-up at this point,  they have to price it significantly lower than the iPad.  It has to be a very simple choice, you know, not like 10 different levels  of tablets, maybe two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it ironic that the best-selling Android tablet out right now has no Google apps on it at all?  I'm talking about the Kindle Fire.  Nothing. There's no Google Association at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it isn't. And it's not even Honeycomb, right? It's Gingerbread.  We don't know. They think it's Gingerbread. We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't matter because it's not anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. It's not anything. It's not Android.  So this is the thing. They have to nail this this year.  And I mean, you all are going to CES next week, right?  So hopefully we're going to see this.  I want them to hire, and actually this segues into a later story in a rundown.  I was going to say when I wrote this post that they should hire the same firm  that did the Chrome ads to do their tablet ads, but maybe they should.  We'll talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did some good ads, and then they...  And then, you know, a few problems.  Well, what about my assertion last week that what they really need is to find a good UI guy?  I know that these people are in short supply.  Yeah.  But they need a good... they need a Johnny Ivan hardware, and they need...  I would have thought Andy Rubin was the guy, but I don't know if he is.  They need somebody who's brilliant in UI design.  Well, we can debate this another time, but you and I disagree over Ice Cream Sandwich.  I think Ice Cream Sandwich is a UI disaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I think that I've fallen victim to the like...  This happens with me with Android a lot. It's like I see so much potential in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're a developer. You do see it...  You have a completely different perspective as a developer.  You see it behind the scenes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I see what the decisions were. I know why they folded those menus into that ellipsis button.  So it's like, okay, this is future-proof, and it's going to look...  That's not an excuse, and that's not a good reason to say that UI is good.  But going back to what you said earlier, they just don't...  They don't grow Johnny Ives on trees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a dearth of these people, I agree.  Yeah. And also, Jobs chose...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, Jobs, you know, one of the most amazing things that he did was choose great people.  Like Jobs looked at Woz and knew that he was the engineer he wanted, and he found Johnny Ive.  This isn't just a matter of just like a higher good product high.  And this is like a cultural DNA thing at Google.  And a lot of people kind of skewered me and said, Google is an engineering company.  They're made up of engineers, and they build stuff for engineers,  and asking them to design for humans is unfair.  I completely disagree.  Asking a consumer software company to design for humans, for people, is not an unfair request.  In fact, it's absolutely...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask you this, Gina.  Yes.  What company besides Apple even approaches your standards in any segment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  On the web, I think companies like...  I mean, kind of thinking sort of web startups.  Like I'm thinking companies like GitHub or Path.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Path's a very good example of a beautifully designed...  But it's a much smaller thing.  Would you put Facebook in that group?  Because, look, you need to look at a company that's on the scale of a Google.  Because you can make a perfect path, but that's a little app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is a little app.  Yes, I would put Facebook.  Facebook figured out what people want and how to give it to them, and that's why they do it.  Clearly, they're at 800 million users.  Yeah, I mean, Facebook has a very, very compelling thing that I never quite got my brain around.  So maybe I'm not even a good...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't like their UI either.  Although I do like...  I think Sam Lesson did a great job with Timeline.  I like Sam a lot, and I think he did a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sam...  Okay, there's an example of someone you hire, Sam Lesson, of course.  They lost him, but they could have acquired Sam and his company, and that would have been a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, they did.  They got it. They bought Dropio.  No, I mean Google could have.  Well, Google could have, yeah.  But Google's...  Don't you think Google's DNA is to look for engineering talent?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  And developer relations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm at this conference today, and someone, the one we like from Google was talking, and one of the journalism people just said,  you know, they're just engineers. They're just different.  They're not human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I like engineers. I love engineers.  I do too. I do too.  But they're not the best UI designers.  Look at an engineer's house.  Look at...  These are guys who wash their hair with soap. They are not aesthetic.  Well, they are aesthetic, but they're aesthetic in a different way.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder how much of that is culturally enforced and maybe enforced and educated.  I mean, I don't know. Maybe I'm being too optimistic.  I think there can be good engineers who are also really good product people.  In fact, there are. We know there are.  Yeah, but there were...  We know there are.  Yeah.  And there are great engineers.  Later, we'll talk about that other story.  You know, Matt Cutts, for example, I mean, he's a great engineer, right?  But he should be head of communications at Google.  I agree.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He did a great thing this week, which we're going to talk about.  He did an amazing thing this week.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's possible.  I mean, Zuckerberg, engineer through and through.  Great sense of product.  Yeah.  He wouldn't have built Facebook if he didn't have a great sense of product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good point.  Yeah.  Google TV, stop talking about Google TV and start shipping.  You don't like the new Google TV as much as I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, so Google TV came out last year.  You hated it. You reboxed it.  You said this was annoying. I couldn't set it up, but you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did set it up. I unplugged it after a while.  It was still under my TV when the update came.  I just plugged it back in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it was still under TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I loved it at first and was like, browser on my TV, best thing ever.  And then the update came out and you love it.  And I was disappointed with the update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, when we talked before the show, I share your disappointment.  I don't feel that it is lived up to, you know, those apps are very limited.  We need more apps. We both agree on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Definitely need more apps.  And you know, we're already a version of Android behind at this point.  Like this update, which was supposed to happen end of summer, was months late  and also is now already a version behind on Ice Cream Sandwich.  And we talked about the app selection.  I mean, the app selection at this point, it's like Netflix is a great app,  Plex is nerdware, but also a good app.  There's Space Invaders. That's kind of cool.  But I'm also not going to play on Google TV.  I'm going to play on the Xbox.  And there's a fireplace app.  That's that's it's pretty cool.  It's a live fireplace.  So I said, by the way, that is sounds like Gina's joking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the app everybody says, oh, you got Google TV.  You got to get what is it called? Cool.  Classy Fireplace. You got to have that.  I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I said, stop talking because, you know, Schmidt made this prediction.  That 2012, all these TVs would have Google TV embedded in them.  But the reality is that Logitech said that it was like one of the biggest  mistakes they've ever made was was launching with review.  And and it just feels like the Google TV progress has been moving along  in a snail's pace.  So if it's if it really is one of, you know, going to be a blockbuster thing  in 2012, I want to see I want to see more movement on that front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, I think you're right there, too.  That that also says that, OK, Larry, if these are your top priorities,  you've now set them, then you better do excellently at all those.  Yes. Yes. Interesting challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Raise the bar for what's ready to ship.  In other words, they put too much crap out with the with the saying,  well, we're going to it's beta and we're going to iterate.  But Gmail was beta, but very good when it first came out.  Yeah, you can go too far the other way and and wait to you've gone through

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  feature creep and waited forever and not gotten input from people.  Yeah, the new the way of thinking these days is ship early and iterate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get get something out and iterate.  That's how that's everybody thinks nowadays in terms of app design.  But I agree with you, Gina.  I think that there's examples like Google Plus Buzz is a very good example.  Yeah, and I could think you could maybe argue the wave as well,  that these things might have done better.  They both buzz and wave were stillborn, might have done better had they paused.  Had they beat them a little more fully, you know, had had they seen them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I think that release was a little bit better.  I think that release early and iterate often is also part of Google's DNA.  I'm not saying that they should stop doing that.  But I think the reality is when you get to the size that you are  and the influence that you that Google has, the scale that Google's at,  when Google releases a new product, it is a big freaking deal.  They're not a small web startup anymore.  And it has it has really wide ranging consequences.  So I just think that I would like to see Google say this isn't quite ready to ship yet.  A little a little I want to want them to take things a little further.  Honeycomb not ready to ship.  I felt like they just put it out there because they felt like they needed a tablet.  Google Plus business pages released without the ability for several people to administer.  That seems like a very basic piece of functionality for something like that.  That was long awaited. It was long awaited enough.  If they had just taken it another month or another two weeks,  however long would have taken for multiple administrators,  that would have felt a little more fully.  Maybe they didn't even think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is, I think that they I put it a different way.  I think they have to expand their dog food pen and put more dogs in it,  including people outside of Google.  And so they can release something.  So the problem is, if Scoble were in their dog food pen, he would have said,  are you kidding?  This product has to have this before you release it.  Yeah, let's try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's try it first.  Yeah, well, Scoble's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.  That's it.  If Scoble tries the products, we'll all be OK.  And you know what?  That's not insane, because he's the kind of guy who digs into a product  and discovers those things.  And they need more people like that who are outside Google.  They need you, Jean.  And also people who are not as sympathetic to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, alongside the Robert Scobles, there should be the M.G. Sagler's.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Too many fanboys.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes, that was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was interesting.  Well, you know, even their policy around real names was not fully baked.  Had they just thought about it a little bit, they would have seen the issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the problem is they're not open enough.  I mean, so I think there's a there's a question.  It's not it's not a binary thing.  It's something along a continuum where they dog food inside the company  or they release calling it a beta.  And what you're saying, I think, Gina, is the betas aren't good enough to be betas.  And the reason they're not good enough to be betas, however, is because not  enough people have seen them.  So there's a catch 22 here.  They need more people to use the products early so that when they do put it out,  even as a beta, it's better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I'm going even a little further and saying instead of depending on users  to tell you what your product should be, be a little more opinionated and  aggressive about what you think it should be from the from the beginning.  You know what I mean?  And iterate if that's the yeah, but do they become Steve Jobs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then do they become where they say we know what's best for you people?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they shouldn't go that far.  I just want them to go like one or two notches toward that direction.  You know what I mean?  Like when they launched Google Plus and it's complicated was one of the  relationship status drop downs.  It just felt like the obvious way.  You couldn't come up with like a different phrase to this, you know, so that  that kind of thing really frustrated me.  Like I want to see them do something new, totally different, not seem like  they're playing catch up, not seem like they're being timid and putting out  something that's bland and doesn't really have sharp edges just to see what  people say.  I want them to be a little more opinionated about what their products are

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Larry Page is stripping it down to the metal and is rebuilding it.  And I think that all of this is something he's considering.  I think so, too.  I think it's I think it's big company.  I just they're myopic.  They are a little stuck in their ways.  And I think Larry is really is trying is really going to try to kick them in  the butt.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, my concern about this and we don't have to stay on my on my post this  long, but my last paragraph, I was saying that the thing that concerns me is  an open source developer to someone who's kind of committed to the to the values  and the ideas around around the word open, which became so charged because  Google put that forth is like this is our goal.  This is what we're committed to openness is that I I don't think open should  mean that every feature gets included.  It shouldn't mean designed by committee or consensus.  It shouldn't mean cheap and mediocre.  And like Google is in a position to to prove that.  And I want them to do that.  I want them to show that open can win in a consumer market, not just the minds  and hearts of developers, but also consumers.  And that's that's what I want to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you.  Investors Business Daily named Larry Page CEO of the year, even though he's only  been CEO since April.  I guess Leo Apotheker really couldn't have gotten that.  So while noting that Google has increased revenues over the last two quarters by  32 percent and Page took an aggressive approach to inspiring one of the Internet's  top performers into something even better.  I agree. I'm very encouraged by by the cuts Larry made as much as they hurt.  I think that's encouraging.  Meanwhile, Yahoo has a new CEO announced today, Scott Thompson, former president  of PayPal.  Can anyone say anyone take that job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that and AOL, they must have offered him a big job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know as many people point out, the problem is not the CEO position.  They need the new board.  And I don't think there's any way to win in that job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's I can't I can't.  All right. So let's play.  Gina, you just fixed fixed Google.  I just saw that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's fix. Yeah, you can't fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Yahoo's got bigger problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You cannot fix. Yeah.  Isn't that odd?  They have such good content.  They've got the Flickr.  They've got I don't understand why you can't fix Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know Flickr is the one thing that makes you feel you know, I thought Flickr was a money

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  loser. I really was convinced that Flickr was a money loser.  Somebody who really knows says, no, no, it's very profitable.  Oh, yeah, that surprised me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even with all that bandwidth.  Yeah, that surprised me.  Yeah, that's surprising.  I mean, then again, I pay for Flickr Pro account.  So me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where they make all their money worth every penny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sure is. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Until Yahoo kills it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to come back with more, including the mind boggling Matt cuts.  My hero.  Just admit what he did was amazing.  Just blows my mind.  I want to talk a little bit about our phone system.  I know this is a little weird kind of inside baseball, but it's this we like the company so much to become a sponsor.  Sometimes that happens.  So when we moved into the new building here, the new Twit studios, I had to face something I never even thought of in the old cottage.  We didn't have a phone.  We had one line and I had I had cordless phones and that was it.  And everybody used their cell phones.  I mean, and then because we just kind of grew.  But when we got we're in a business here, we got 20 employees.  We got spread out.  We've got producers making call everybody.  We got people using the company phone to do stuff.  We've got an 800 number.  And so I realized, oh, my God, what am I going to do?  I got to get a phone system.  I did not relish the idea of getting the PBX in the basement, the service contract.  And God, I just thought this is not it.  So we need to do something more modern.  I said, well, could we do is there a VoIP solution or something out there?  I thought of putting an asterisk building our own asterisk server in the basement.  And then thank goodness, Russell Tammany, our IT guy.  So you know what I do have done lately a lot is Ring Central.  I said, I don't I don't know them. What is it?  It's basically a virtual PBX system that's just fantastic.  If you go to ringcentral.com, you can learn more about the idea is, you know, we just get the there's no configuration.  There's nothing. That's why Russell likes it.  He doesn't have to sit in the basement writing scripts for four days or have some guy from AT&T come over.  He just you get the phones. We've got these great polycom sets. You plug them in.  It's auto configured. We have music on hold.  We have all these extensions. And then there's other cool stuff like there's an Android Ring Central app and an iPhone Ring Central app.  So all my so I can have my cell phone ring when somebody calls me on Ring Central.  All my messages show up on my cell phone, including the audio so I can listen to the audio.  Is that out of focus? Oh, yeah, that's better.  I can make calls from my cell phone that appear to come from Ring Central.  So I mean from not from the office numbers. So I don't want to accidentally show my here's do not disturb.  Do you love that? I can turn on do not disturb. So won't ring.  I have that on my phone in my office to the busy signal.  They brought it just goes to voicemail. There's no busy signal, but it does goes to voicemail.  The voicemail is very sophisticated. As I said, voicemails in my email, they can show up on my cell phone.  When I make a call from my cell phone, it comes from the company number.  So when people call me back, it calls back on the company number.  Our producers love that because they do want to use their cell phone sometimes, but they don't want to have to use it all the time.  And they don't want to give out their cell phone number to everybody.  I just love this thing. Twenty five dollars per user per month.  And that includes unlimited long distance in the U.S. and Canada.  It includes faxing. I was paying almost that much for an e-fax account.  And we all have faxing faxes. Go to our inboxes faxes out.  It's just fantastic. Real phone lines everywhere.  But it is so just check it out. I want you to check it out for 30 day trial.  Just visit ring central dot com. Do I don't even have an offer code or anything.  Just go or call 800 800 4070.  800 800 4070 is the number one cloud phone system for business.  I know why now. I just it's it's so I just it's the way phones should be so easy.  You just plug it in. Ring central dot com if you want to know more.  Yeah, it's kind of a nice thing when well, you know, we try with our advertisers.  I don't do any advertisements for stuff that we don't use.  So we don't you know, people ask to advertise all the time.  We just say, you know, I can't I don't I don't know you.  I don't know the product. So it's kind of nice.  We've got the ring central system. It was like two days after Russell said we're going to be.  And then they called and said we want to advertise. So I said, OK, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's great. That's great. It's a true endorsement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. And we've had it for six months now. I think we all agree.  It's just great. It's just a really neat solution.  So this is just the weirdest story.  Chrome violates Google's paid links policy.  People noted it. And so Matt Cutts said we've investigated and we're taking action to demote the Chrome site for 60 days.  Now, it was more complicated than there was only one paid link.  Most what happened was Google, what Google wanted to do was get videos, I guess, on these.  I don't know exactly what it was. They wanted people to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's something still slimy there is that is that for Google to do paid placement for blog posts?  Well, they they shouldn't have ever done that.  They should have done that. And that's and that's this bad on its own.  It wasn't in only one case did it end up causing links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what Matt said. He meant that this is any.  By the way, talk about transparency posted on Google Plus yesterday.  Google was trying to buy video ads about Chrome.  They're trying to buy ads. And these sponsored posts were an inadvertent result of that.  So what they thought they were doing is buying ads on these websites.  But what actually happened is they kind of they got a sponsored post.  We did find one sponsored post that linked to Google dot com slash Chrome that in a way that flowed PageRank.  I don't know what that means. Flowed in a way that would influence PageRank because it would look like a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looked like a paid link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it didn't have the no follow attribute on it.  So a sponsor post is supposed to have the no follow attribute on them.  So there are two dozen of these. One of them did not have a no follow attribute.  That seems pretty minor. Yeah, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but they're pure. Matt is being pure. And that's what's great about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So for 60 days, if you search for Chrome, you won't find Google dot com slash Chrome.  That way. I mean, I got to do that. Wait a minute. This is just wild.  I mean, for a company to do that, he says, well, now here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they get you get the support, right? You get the support window support that Google dot com.  You don't get Google dot com slash Chrome, although you do get the sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess you get what you get, mostly what you want.  But if you go, I think you have to go like six pages down to find Google dot com slash Chrome.  But now, as I look at this, there's a they put an ad on here that says install Google Chrome as the ad result.  Did the link is there. Did Matt do enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Truthfully, I think they did too much.  That's crazy. They penalized themselves much more than they would have a third party  because they said that they felt that they had to hold themselves to a higher standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, OK, I mean, we have taken stricter action than we would against a typical site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but let's talk about this for a second in another way.  I think it's I think it's Matt being honorable and good.  But let's remember that that Google is always facing this way.  What would this question look like when asked by a senator to Eric Schmidt in Washington?  Right. Right. And in the area where Google now faces more pressure as a monopolist,  I think will be Chrome because it is now past Firefox.  It soon could well surpass. It has great value.  And so I think they have to be.  So, yes, it was it was theatrically masochistic on their part.  But I think it's more than just hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, so guilty, so guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was like, like a good Catholic boy.  Scarlet egg in the back of the clock.  I just felt a little like much.  Well, if you if you investigate, I want to defend them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if you investigate, they hired an ad firm, Unruly Media, and I guess Unruly Media made a mistake.  They were trying to buy ad placements and in one case it screwed up.  I do think that maybe went a little far, but it's good PR, right?  They're getting in a way they're getting a lot more press than.  And you still are a number.  You got an ad on the top of the search results.  If I'm looking for Chrome and I Google Chrome, which is kind of cuckoo.  But if I did that, I'm going to get that link.  That's the first thing, even though it's an ad, it's exactly what I want.  So what have they lost? Nothing. And they get a lot of good PR.  What if you were to be a little searching for Chrome?  Search for browser, Leo. Oh, OK, let's try that.  Talk about clueless. I'm using Safari, which still has a separate Google search window.  It just drives me nuts. So let's Google browser.  Well, number one, Google disciplines itself in Chrome browser page rank controversy.  That's the number one result. Number two result, Firefox.  Number three, Wikipedia's entry for web browser.  Then Wikipedia's entry for Chrome. Then Opera.  Then a site called the browser.  Then a definition from browser Chrome, which is not the same as Google Chrome.  It's the UI. And then another news story. And then Safari.  And then IE. And nowhere on here even is an ad for Google Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want to live in a world where opera ranks higher than Chrome and search results for browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I wonder, this must be the penalization. This is it.  Definitely. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but what it also gives them is the opportunity when somebody else messes up and they say these are the standards we're going to hold you to.  They can always say we held ourselves to higher standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have to know this is the right thing to do. It's it's it is it's weird.  And I can imagine that Matt's going to be getting some cold shoulders in the company cafeteria for a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that Google has lots of opportunities to promote Chrome.  I mean, I think the only thing about this like the Super Bowl probably.  Oh, yeah. Like the Super Bowl and like the front page of the Google search, you know, Google dot com.  You know, the thing about this story that just surprised me was Google was unaware like Google hired an advertising firm and was unaware that part of that package was getting sponsored blog posts on what looked to be these like no name blog, like blogs that, you know, from people who just sort of accept, you know, write posts for Duncan Hines.  Random brands. I don't know. How did that get through?  I imagine that's that's that's the discussions about that.  Yeah. I imagine there was some internal discussions about how do we make sure we don't hire someone who's doing something like this without us being super aware of what's exactly it, Gina, because because it cheapens the whole web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's wrong about this isn't isn't trying to screw with page rank.  The whole world does that.  What's wrong about this is trying to buy the voice of blogs by the authentic voice of the web.  It falls into the worst of demand media and all that stuff.  It's what was it?  Paper post was that horribly evil thing that changed his name.  This still does badly.  That's you're exactly right, Gina.  That's the bad part.  Whoever did that should be the one getting the cold shoulder somewhere outside of Google today.  Yeah, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think that's just part of what you get when you hire an ad firm.  I think this is probably just part of it.  Right.  Like, you know, you supervise them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got a media plan.  You tell the advertising agency what your goal is.  The agency are called unruly media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, bad boy advertising agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does unruly media say anything on its site, Leo?  I'm sorry I'm asking you to do this, but I'm trying to stay off the browser so I don't screw up my bandwidth worse.  Let me let me Google unruly media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's unruly media.  They got punished, punished to they are viral.  They're a viral company.  They they do social.  This is what they do.  They do.  I'm sure pay for post stuff.  You know, that's what they're doing.  They're going after advertisers who want to be a little different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's word of mouth advertising so called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maximize sharing.  Unruly's proprietary technology platform, Ramp, real time amplification and measurement platform,  enables us to sell guaranteed engaged time with your audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bingo.  How can you guarantee engaged time with us, the people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can expose your content to hundreds of millions unique users across our handpicked portfolio of blogs.  Oh, they're basically saying this is what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, and Google just has this like army of quality tech blogs who basically cover.  I mean, you don't need to do these Chrome ads for free.  You pay.  We're actually good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You only pay when people are actively watching and engaging with your content.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to barf.  Unruly can amplify the effects of bought media by seeding videos to influential journalists, bloggers and Twitter.  And and spreading content across channels and fan bases on social.  Have we ever heard from these guys?  Have they ever contacted us?  If they ever come in the door, throw them out on their ass.  Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and stumble upon helping your attention generate peer recommendation and any word of mouth.  Unfortunately, this is what's wrong right now with the Internet is that influential journalists are allowing themselves to have videos seeded.  Terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's the same Steve Waldman, who is a brilliant journalist who did a report recently for the FCC about the future of journalism.  He just did a piece online.  You can find it if you Google it about TV stations, Miley and FCC.  Horrible.  By regulation, by taking video press releases, putting them on the air and not identifying the source happens all the time.  Exactly. And that's and there's and there's regulation about that because TV is regulated.  Well, we we the blogosphere are not and never should be regulated.  But there's some call the FTC believes that we should be for these purposes if we're not forthcoming.  And then when you have companies going along and trying to pay to do that and you have Google paying such a company to do that, that's the big mistake.  That's where they should be in the woodshed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So clearly, if Google hired this company, which they did, they they knew what they were doing.  Yeah, they had the bad. They knew what they were doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The company who used to just a year ago never ran a commercial.  Right. I was, you know, strange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, what are they going to now their Super Bowl commercial in 2010 was a reap was something an old was old.  And I don't remember what they did last year.  Was it another one that they that we'd seen before?  I think it was it was the romance one.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was the one with the French love story that was that was that was, I think, to 2010 Super Bowl.  Yeah. So so and that was the first time they ever bought a TV commercial like Big Air Time.  Right. So it was more than a year ago.  Yeah. And I don't remember what they did.  But they didn't make a new ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just used an old ad. So I'm hoping they'll make a new ad.  I think they'll have to make a new ad this year for a Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think they'll advertise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so those those were for search. Right.  Yeah. And they have that Google Plus ad now that we've seen, which is not a good ad.  The one about he gets in her creep.  He's in her creepers circle. She's in his true love circle.  And then he's terrible ad.  It makes Google Plus look incredibly complicated to use.  Which Super Bowl is this? Is this XLI chat room?  Chat room, Excel.  I don't remember off the top of my head.  I'm just looking to see if there's a Google ad in this in Excel.  There's a GoDaddy ad. Maybe GoDaddy will do an ad on how they love so.  I mean, we know. Oh, no, we hate so. Love it.  Hate it. It's Excel VI. Oh, so this is really old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Excel. Don't even get me started on GoDaddy, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't get me started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't even I'm just proud to say we've hated them since 2009.  Me too. I just didn't like the sexy ads.  I thought this is just cheesy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, right. It was like misogyny.  Shooting elephants. So take your pick. Take your pick. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Though that was interesting.  I forget her name.  So the young woman who started the camp, the petition against Bank of America is also the one who started the major petition against GoDaddy.  She's like 22 years old and she started this out of nowhere.  Good for her. And she's not been featured.  And so I'll be careful. I'll edit myself rarely for the purposes of your rating, Leo.  But if you want to start an S storm against something, you know, the question I asked in my blog was, is there a point at which GoDaddy and I'm not sure this point exists.  Right. But just just theoretically, is there a point at which they reach enough tenants that they get forgiven and they get business back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, it's already happened.  You know, there was this big dump GoDaddy movement.  It was a blip compared to they get they have like I saw the numbers, the number of new subscribers every day on GoDaddy.  It well outweighs any number of people who dropped.  But would that happen anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, they don't have to do anything.  They don't do anything.  You know, but just theoretically, that if you go after a company at some point, is there a goal?  Is there a behavior that you expect?  And if they reach it, that you say, OK, you're forgiven now.  I think the argument about GoDaddy is, well, no, there's too much to forgive.  Dead Elephants, some misogynist, big breasted ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what that was actually of all of the things that was the thing that bugged me the most about them was this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Also, there's just a ton of crappy upsells and yeah, it just feels that way all the way around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I do like the fact that you sorry, but right after right after the GoDaddy thing with SOPA, then we had the Verizon two dollars to pay your bill fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, which that was great.  Within 24 hours, that got killed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's the cloud.  That's that's the customer cloud.  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We finally were getting some cloud here.  Yeah, it's about time.  By the way, just I'm going to pat myself on the.  I've turned down GoDaddy advertising since day one and they they offer a significant amount of money.  I did.  I couldn't do GoDaddy ads.  Are you kidding me?  I'm not.  But but we were glad when hover.com and Elliott Noss from from two cows came to us and hover.com.  And that's a good company.  I was glad to support them.  Yeah, I love to see the scrappy kind of upstarts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of people are going to point out the twit.TV is still registered at GoDaddy.  And that's because they locked my domain when I tried to transfer it.  And it would show me.  Now, I think they've turned that thing off.  So I have just been lazy.  I got to go over there and transfer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the locking domains, the blocking domains, making it difficult for people to leave is like yet another.  And just to be clear, like we are not like sex.  Sex is good.  Sex sells.  We like to look at pretty people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think people know that I like sex an awful lot, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not what I'm doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm no prude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just try to keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love you.  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was on this show, you know.  Yeah.  But it was so fast.  I thought I mean, I knew it happened.  And Eileen switched right away from it.  And I thought, I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't know what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It happened so fast that I thought, oh, I'm not going to ask her to edit it because it's not nobody's going to see it.  And by the way, this was in October or something.  This was early October.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, the timing was.  Yeah, it's a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, I don't want to go on about it.  But yeah, I would edit it out if I thought anybody would see it.  But I just thought, oh, it's so quick.  Big deal.  Nobody will see it.  But you see, what I forget is that you guys are viewers.  They're so they're eagle eyed.  And of course, you could freeze it.  I mean, it's easy.  You just stop it and say, oh, what was that?  Whoa.  So Google got fined.  Changed the subject.  This is just, gosh, I would, you know, I feel bad for Google on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel bad for Google and I feel bad for the principles of the net again.  This is terrible.  It's a free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is completely misunderstanding how Google works and how the other networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and how and how the notion of of our combined activity stream leading to data works  that you try to control what you're trying to control in the end is our behavior.  Because that's where that search comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the case or that or does this French court just not understand what Google?  So here's what happened.  You know, when you start typing in a search result, Google suggests what you might mean.  And there are lots of fun.  We can we can have some fun with it right here if I just type my name in.  I'm sure it'll I'll do it to myself.  Leo Laporte is an idiot, a jerk, a douche and awesome.  Now, I now so what happened is that a French company you type that company's name in and you get is a crook.  And they sued.  And won one.  Now, I can't sue.  This is this happens because it's it's purely algorithmic, right?  It's just because yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is the kind of control that European regulators are very in courts of various sizes and sites want to put on Google.  But thus the net because while Google is doing is reflecting our behavior and they're saying that we wish people wouldn't behave this way.  And so we're going to make you hide that from the world.  Yeah, it's not Google's job.  No, there's search.  That's what search is.  Well, and if Google comes along and says, you know what?  OK, you're right.  We we believe now that we don't like pick pick it.  You know, we're saying we agree with Rick Santorum and we don't like gay people.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they start for Rick Santorum.  Oh, my God.  Don't Google him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's for example, even saying about about about gays lately.  That's what I'm saying is we get this to come up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's called a Google bomb.  That's different than the search results.  That's when a group concerted the first Google bomb was Bush.  Wasn't Bush was was where you would Google the word failure.  And George Bush would show up.  That was the first Google bomb.  I remember.  But the idea is a lot of cooperating websites tie some one thing to another thing through  links.  Google algorithmically.  And I'm telling you, you cannot expect them to change that.  Otherwise, it breaks the search algorithm.  Came up with this connection.  You type in failure, get George Bush.  The smart thing to do, which is what the George Bush campaign did, is start buying other  links so that you have a response.  So somebody somebody who didn't like Rick Santorum, Dan Savage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right. Dan Savage started it.  It gets better.  Yeah.  Good to see you, Dan.  Which is interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dan said, what could we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What can we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I believe it at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And please don't, folks, if you're at all sensitive, do not look up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, what's interesting about this, I had this experience this week.  I was looking for a hotel in D.C.  So I'm going to be traveling there next week.  And I typed in the name of a hotel into the Google search box.  And the first suggestion was bed bugs.  Wow.  And I didn't even highlight to see what I just moved on.  Like the decision was made for me instantly.  No, thank you.  Not staying there.  Right.  And, you know, Dana Boyd wrote an interesting piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which, by the way, doesn't mean that there were any doesn't mean that there were bed bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it doesn't even mean that there's a lot written on the Web about them having bed bugs.  All it means is that people searched for this hotel plus bed bugs to see if they had any.  Right.  I mean, you know, I don't even know.  This is the thing.  Like this is reflecting not only it's not just there are lots of Web pages out there that say, you know, this hotel has bed bugs.  It means that people were searching for.  So Dana wrote a great piece about, you know, a fictitious high school student with an Indian name who people, you know, people decide, you know, wanted to know whether or not he was a terrorist.  Right. And kept searching this person as a terrorist person as a terrorist.  Now, there's nothing written on the Web about the person being a terrorist.  Now, this person's going into college and the first auto complete suggestions for this person's this fictitious person's name.  But I thought this is a good example was Al Qaeda terrorist.  Right. You know, so, you know, this is, you know, so this is guilt by algorithmic association.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it says now that's a good example of something that doesn't seem very fair.  And the bed bug example is another good example.  Maybe this isn't maybe Google suggest has some flaw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but but but you know, it's no different.  You know, but but if let's say if there were ridiculous sites written about that kid being a terrorist and they're all just as wrong and people actually wrote the stuff and people clicked on it, that's going to suggest doesn't come from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It comes from people searching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I'm saying doesn't come from links.  But the same thing could happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's different.  Well, because people are proactively writing articles saying George Bush is a failure.  George Bush is a failure.  That's different from the fact that somebody's saying, well, do they have bed bugs at this hotel?  That is in no way asserting that they do have bed bugs in that hotel.  It's just saying this is a common search, but it implies it makes this connection.  That's what that's what Dana is saying here.  It makes this connection.  That's a spurious connection.  And and and people now are there's a couple of possibilities.  People will get educated and say, oh, that's just a suggestion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, but I don't think we work that way.  You know that, Gina, and you still didn't go to that hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know how this works.  And when I saw bed bugs, I was like, whoa, then on, like I wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's nothing the hotel can do about that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina, I would be curious that if you search for that hotel and went ahead with the search  to find out how much is written about bed bugs in that hotel, whether there's something behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's and you know, and I and I am several people ask me, well, did you go to the bed bug registry?  Apparently there's a bed bug registry for tells about whether or not there have actually been,  which I probably should have done.  I was in a rush. I need a hotel.  And, you know, it was my first misrule reaction.  And I'm educated about how this all works was, whoa, you know, moved on.  So I will look into that to see if this poor hotel actually.  But are you saying that the court is right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, actually, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, obviously, Google can't.  This is algorithmic. So Google's off the hook.  So there's no way that you find them.  But I am suggesting that maybe Google wants to rethink this because it does have an unintended consequence  that is potentially harmful to this kid, this imaginary kid that Dana's writing about to this hotel.  She calls it guilt through algorithmic association.  So it's I don't blame Google.  But I wonder if maybe they should not surface this.  She says, interestingly, guilt through algorithmic association is not constrained to Google.  This is an issue for any and all systems that learn from people and convey collective intelligence back to users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, but the problem then is us.  We've met the enemy and he is us.  And so what we're trying to do is figure out as a society in so many areas what our new norms and expectations are.  And and so, you know, can you legislate that?  Can you throw it through courts?  Can you regulate that?  Or do we have to learn or do we have to create better technology that that starts to learn where this stuff happens?  But but it's about the changing of our norms, really.  And it's something new that's come up that we're trying to grapple with and figure out.  But the problem at the nut is us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So I am making the distinction between Google bombing, which is actual search results that connect to phrases.  And this algorithmic thing that doesn't have anything to do with content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it is the new Google bombing.  Right. I mean, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can't. How do you manipulate it?  You can't manipulate. You keep searching for you have to do a lot of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of people have to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can organize that in Twitter now.  Here's here's my fantasy.  What I want to do is organize everyone in New Hampshire to and North Carolina to lie to whatever pollster there is, but who they're voting for.  So we grab away from the horse race journalists.  Well, the data to make believe that they know what's happening and you could you could organize that pretty easily now through social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would like to ask a favor of all my friends if they would start searching for Leo Laporte is a handsome, handsome fellow.  Because I just don't think idiot jerk douche and awesome describe me.  Well, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, the is is that becoming because people are saying Leo Laporte idiot in a search or is it because there's idiot in documents about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, it is because well, it looks like I'm getting search results that say that connect me to idiot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm not sure. But I'm not sure, Leo.  I'm wrong here, Gina.  I'm not sure that that in that case comes that data came purely from search requests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. No, no, I think it's it must be more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's a combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you just search Leo Laporte, then you get podcast KGO, which was one of my radio stations used to be until they went.  And that's another story to the dark side, Twitter and Web site.  So that makes those are those are searches, right?  Those are common searches, Leo Laporte podcast, Leo Laporte, KGO, Leo Laporte, Twitter, Leo Laporte website.  It's the is that is puzzling.  What happens there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you say I'm not so sure that comes just from search and that's purely algorithmic in that sense.  What is that?  That's that's bombing to.  You know, God knows is idiot returning his iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And idiot returning his iPad is a twit is a what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huh? Right. So people did not search for this is content.  No, this is content. Yeah, you're right.  This is content. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why do people hate us, Jeff?  I see. Gina, it'll probably say, let me know.  I won't do that.  Gina is sweet.  Just pretend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I don't I don't write about my my wife, but I talk about her.  You know what? Marriage and wife.  Nothing. I get nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is no suggestion for Gina Smith.  Oh, I said Smith.  That's not your name.  That's not your name.  You know what?  This is it. Gina.  No, Gina Smith is a woman I worked with for many years.  My former radio host.  There we go.  I'm a co-part.  Gina Smith. Gina.  She's put her panty is married.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And now that's it.  I don't write about it that much.  I suppose there isn't a result there for when.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's just married flicker.  Photo sharing is number one.  Number two is from friend feed than Google Plus.  Huh?  So how come you avoided the douche idiot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because she is neither and we are too nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this proves it.  Jeff, you're absolutely your contention is absolutely right that it is content based because Gina is a sweetheart and we're just it's a combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's definitely a combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Enough of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now I'm feeling all subconscious about Google.  Although every show, every few shows, we have to Google ourselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we do.  Who knows what's going to happen?  Clearly, the sixty five thousand dollar fine is just clueless.  Unfortunately, there's a lot of these clueless courts, not just in France, all over Spain just passed SOPA.  Basically, it should be very interesting to see.  This will be a good test tube to see what happens in Spain.  This will happen in March.  Spanish government will have the right to just cut websites off.  Watch carefully.  See what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And don't forget that you have basically the predecessor to occupy Wall Street in the Indignados of Spain.  So you have an organized, piratey movement in Spain and the government may want to kind of shut them off.  I bet they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in this news, Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait.  Maybe not.  I'm sorry, I guess I asked that.  Search for Generalissimo Francisco Franco.  What does it say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says that he's a douche.  That's an interesting question.  Wait a minute.  It says he's dead.  Generalissimo Francisco Franco is still dead.  Still dead.  Still seriously dead.  This is you know, it's cool about that.  It shows that Google even has some history because this is all predates Google.  Yeah.  Has some history.  There's history in the in there.  That's nice.  There's a YouTube video about that?  Yeah, because it's from Saturday Night Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Saturday Night Live.  Right, okay, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So these are all SNL going back 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina is too young to have any idea.  She's wondering what the hell was on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This happened before she was born.  This is how old we are, Jeff.  We were just rolling with it.  We were adults.  We were watching this.  She was not even born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the old gods are going off again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are they talking about again?  Guy Lombardo?  I'm a sponge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to learn from you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you'll be old too someday, Gina.  Don't you forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe those search results are a little bit based on age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like they know I'm an old man?  Leo LaForte is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  We've been around long enough to be hated.  We have more track records.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got more enemies.  We have more juice opportunities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My life goal, get more enemies.  No, no.  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody loves Gina Trippani.  Yeah, opposite of love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It ain't indifference.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're just different sizes, the same coin.  Yep.  Google buys 217 patents from IBM.  The Verge.  I love The Verge.  They're going to be at CES too.  And I'm looking forward to getting Neelai and their company on the show.  Joshua Topolski.  Big Blue is selling 217 patents, including mobile phone patents, patents on data caching,  blade servers, and server load balancing.  Maybe it's just Google says if we can get them, we should.  Stock up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stock up on patents.  It's patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patents buy patents.  You know, but it's still a pity that that's where capital goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google has billions of dollars that it comes in.  Google has billions of dollars that it could like Apple and other companies that could  be investing in things.  They're going to create jobs and create new technologies.  And instead, they're buying frigging old patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  Hey, Tom Merritt, did you see this?  Russ Pitts just took a job with The Verge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're doing prep.  He knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's our old producer.  Crazy guy.  He wrote the most, the best, the funniest, I quit letter ever at Tech TV.  If I could find it, I would read it out loud in a dramatic voice.  It's very funny.  Android 4.0.  That is ice cream sandwich, which we were talking about.  Apparently, Android is saying that Google is saying that the Android holo theme is required.  What is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It just means that any Android device that's 4.0 or higher has to ship with their with Google's  default holo theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What they're saying is no more fragmentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Yes.  This is partially they're saying.  How do they enforce this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because that's not true in the open source, right?  No, this isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So this is for the phones that get the Google name on them and have the Android market.  So if the Google Android market is on the phone and the Google name is on it, so not  Kindles, but phones that have the Google endorsement, this is now one of the requirements that  Google is enforcing.  And I'm happy to see this.  Finally.  This is one of the things that I want to see them do is use these rules about you get to  use our name when this or the basically they're saying that every 4.0 Android device from  here on in has to ship with the holo theme, which is awesome for developers because it  means that you know that your app will look the same on every device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ship with it or does it have to use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has to ship with it.  So it doesn't have to use it.  But when you build your app, the developer building your app, you can specify I'm using  the holo theme and you know that any 4.0 device and higher will you got it will look the same  across any device no matter even if the manufacturer has created a new skin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is an issue.  Of course, HTC, Samsung, Motorola, everybody skins LG skins, you know, they've got Samsung's  TouchWiz, which is okay, but it's a little kind of candy coated HTC, which really sense,  which really is a big shift.  I think it's nice, but some people hate it.  Motorola, of course, horrible, horrible.  No, I don't know anybody who likes what Motorola does to go to Android.  So all of these guys will they can continue to be able to do that.  But the holo theme will be there.  So like your app, when to do dot text runs, you can specify turn off the TouchWiz and be just holo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Use the holo and it'll be the unmodified version of the holo theme.  So manufacturers can't change a theme, which is which is fantastic.  So it just makes it easier for developers to sit to have one design target to trust that it's going to look the same across every device.  And that's from 4.0 on.  And and they made it a little easier even for earlier devices.  I think I don't early devices don't have the theme, but they've they've created these new theme families.  Android handles themes really nice as a developer.  You say I'm going to use this theme and then here are my customization.  That's like having like a base CSS style.  She it's not CSS.  It's XML.  But same same difference, just a rule list of rules.  And then you can make your customization.  So this is a nice step forward for developers designing good looking apps and you'll know that it looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I love holo.  I think you know, I've said nasty things about ice cream sandwich.  Mostly it's about the movable buttons, but I do think holo is gorgeous.  I think the theme is nice and the typography is really nice.  So I'm excited about this.  Love that new droid font.  Isn't it ironic that Motorola's customization is called blur?  Like they thought that was a good name for anything having to do with user interface.  Oh, let's call it blur.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we'll make it really hard to figure out whether or not you're tapping the right thing.  Blur?  Kind of illegible.  Who thought that was a good idea?  It goes so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I'm using the new Motorola ugly font with blur enabled.  This is the iffy release.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Crashy 1.0.  Ice cream sandwich is now on 0.6 percent of Android devices.  So if you do a little math, according to Brian Bishop writing for The Verge, that's 707,000 nexuses.  Because that's the only device with it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the Nexus S. Right.  So the Nexus S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nexus S is upgraded.  Right.  Right.  Boy, it was we didn't talk about this because it happened Christmas.  Oh, I guess we did, Jeff.  Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.  3.75 million Android activations.  Last week, when you combine Apple and Android app sales, 1.2 billion apps sold last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These numbers just go over my head now.  I have no scale to figure out what they mean.  It's huge.  You know, I understand something like viewers of a TV show or circulation of a newspaper or magazine.  I don't get.  And, you know, remembering, too, that a lot of the majority of apps that are downloaded are never used.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it was Christmas, right?  So in Hanukkah, so a lot of people had new phones and they downloaded a lot of apps.  I'm not surprised.  But the first billion plus week also Google Plus traffic leapt 55 percent in December.  Forty nine million visits, according to Experian Hitwise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's I'm fighting about Google Plus.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Google Plus post rank very high in search results.  So this is measuring visits.  People are Googling and they're finding I mean, each Google Plus post is its own Web page.  And in fact, I added a story to the to the rundown.  Someone complaining that, you know, I wrote a post on my blog and then someone posted on a Google Plus and their post ranked higher than my post.  So we both put that in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, that's frustrating.  Read, write web.  I think he went a little bit overboard.  It's on the list as John Mitchell there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said the Google Plus is going to ruin the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because he argues that it's social SEO now and rather than his post coming up first, two references to his post came up first.  So what social beats the original.  I agree. I think it's overblown as heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, isn't that great that people are reading your freaking post?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree. I agree.  Somewhere in there is something interesting that happens about the social discussion becomes an entity the same way as the content you're discussing.  But that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you like it?  Why don't you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I don't like that you can't link to articles in line inside a Google Plus post.  So you can have that one link that you post and you can discuss it.  I agree with that.  Really can't do a full blog.  They know that.  They know that.  They know that. Right.  So if I posted something to my blog and then several people have discussed it on Google Plus and use my headline as their first line of their post, I'm grateful for that.  That's awesome.  But, you know, Google's search results should be smart enough to know.  This is the link that's associated with this discussion happening on Google Plus.  So we should rank that higher than the Google Plus posts.  And I think that's what he was complaining about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think in a news search, like if you were looking Google News, yes, in a straight on search, it should be just whatever gets the most Google juice, whatever has the most Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, like, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If there's eight thousand comments on that Google Plus post and there's twenty on yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Then that's more significant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more significant.  Right.  And I would say I would submit that you're still driving traffic to your site, aren't you?  Absolutely. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You want people discussing your stuff.  And the fact is that sharing this is what you want to do.  You want to write good content, but then you want to get shared.  Yeah, definitely.  I just don't like that Google Plus has so many limitations that you can't link inside Google.  The way that you can.  They need to fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They definitely need to fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you can argue that links are what power the web and the fact that you can't make links and it's weird.  Multiple links is weird and limiting.  Yeah.  But anyway, go ahead, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the other thing that I want to do, I was at this conference today, Richard Gingras, who wants to be on the show, by the way.  Oh, good. I'd love to have him on.  Which would be great.  So we'll have him on.  Head of Google News, now part of Google Plus.  One thing that I want and said to him is, and I've said this before, but as a YouTube video is a playable inside of Google Plus post or a blog or anywhere, so should an article be playable.  Kind of embedded?  Inside. Embedded, yeah.  So if I want to point to a Guardian article and point to this paragraph, you know, right now what I do, of course, I cut and paste it out and put a link in.  But as Gina says, you only have one link and it's limited.  Why can't I put, just as I would a YouTube video, put the entire article with that highlight in it, with their brand and their revenue and their analytics and their links all inside that post?  Now, that's not a limitation of Google Plus.  That's a limitation of media companies thinking this way.  It's a limitation of Google Plus insofar as we need a standard for doing that.  But I, Gina, imagine you could figure out how to do that with the hand tie behind your back and two drakes down your gullet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I don't know if I want to embed a whole other web page with all their advertising in it, like in a Google Plus post.  No, no, no, not the whole page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just take an article that is designed for this purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So say, OK, here's a block quote and here's attribution to that block quote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And here's the whole article if you want to read it.  Right, right, right.  You're right. No, it's not the web page taken as a whole.  It says, here's the article.  And by the way, there's some revenue attached to it as an opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I think part of Google Plus, too, is the API.  Like there has to be a way to express that kind of structured data, you know, multiple links and pull quotes with attribution.  And Google has started Google Plus has started to do that.  Like when you get a link, you get certain bits of metadata, the title, the URL, the description and the thumbnail image.  So we're starting to get there a little bit.  It would be nice if it was like, you know, the pull, you know, the pull quote, you know, that the attribution, the author name and then have to be able to have multiple ones.  We'd have to we'd have to up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'd have to make sure we had that metadata on our sites.  Properly formatted, right?  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but if you want to just if you want to highlight one paragraph and you could do it yourself, you'd have to do it yourself.  But there's no way to express that right now.  People like you this on Google Plus all the time.  I will put just quote marks and put the text, you know, a little pull quote of the text.  Someone else said, in fact, I did that recently.  A really funny rant.  And my brother, you know, texted me.  It was like, are you angry?  Like, is everything OK?  I didn't write that.  But it does feel a little bit like I'm copying and pasting someone else's content into my Google Plus post.  And if it shows up higher in results, it feels unfair to them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, all we have to do all we have to do is tell Google that we will use Google Plus more if you'll just do these few things.  Yes, I think we would.  I think I would be much more apt to use it.  They would learn more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They would learn more about content.  They would learn more about who's authoritative and who we cite.  They need that data.  Yes.  I can't imagine that's difficult.  No, as they said to me when I pushed them on, there's somebody there, not Richard, somebody else.  And they said, well, we do have Blogger.  You know, they have all the publishing module they need.  That's true.  They should do it.  It seems like an easy.  And you could have the simple mode where you can do it just as is and you want to link to something.  But you could have the more comp the advanced mode where you can put all kinds of stuff in.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Real quickly, because we've got to run phone dog.  Noah, Noah Kravitz wrote for phone dog, created a Twitter account with 17000 followers over an eight month period.  Phone dog underscore Noah left phone dog phone dog suing him saying, wait a minute, we want that account.  That's in effect a customer list which you took with you.  Who owns a Twitter account?  Who owns the relationships?  I think phone dog Noah does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  But there is no more phone dog Noah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's just Noah.  There's just Noah.  So what if Eileen actually she uses her own Twitter.  In fact, everybody here is on their own Twitter handle.  But what if Eileen was which is what you should do, which you should do.  And then that eliminates this issue.  But what if I well, maybe not.  But what if Eileen been tweeting all this time as Twitter Eileen and then she left?  I'm not going to sue her saying, give me give me your followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what if what if she what if she changed TriCaster?  We don't own TriCaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't own that.  So that's some guy or gal.  I don't know who it is.  That's so great.  Oh, I thought it was you guys.  So no, we're not live.  We're not that organized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We barely do the live.  We don't know what the hell we're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need a social media strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We do.  There's got to be a line between company Twitter accounts, social media accounts and and and person ones.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that needs to be stated up front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree.  I agree.  I mean, it's good stuff when you're a writer and you're mostly associated for your work at a particular title and you say, hey, this is my association.  It gives you credibility.  But you know, the fact is that Twitter gives you the right to change.  You know, if it's your password that you set up an account that you established and your employer has no problem with being calling yourself phone dog Noah while you're working for them.  You have the power to change that username.  You're in control of that account.  That's what he did.  And this is something that really should be written into contracts in terms of, you know, the problem was he was the only guy working on the site at the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, he wasn't even a staffer.  He was freelance.  So, oh, they just didn't have a policy because it was brand new, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that those that those are his relationships.  They're his relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care if it was phone dog Noah.  It's his relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let him is that if people were listening to him because he wrote about phone dog and he stops writing about phone dog, that's a follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Rupert Murdoch has a Twitter account and I know you know, we're no fan of Rupert's, but I am a fan of his Twitter account because it's him.  It's boy.  Is it him?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is it him?  In fact, is, you know, one of his early tweets got him in trouble with his wife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, no, no, no, no, that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not with his wife, but he said, take account.  Oh, it wasn't he.  It wasn't him who said Brits take too many holidays and don't work hard enough.  He said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said that and killed it.  But the reports about it being his wife who made it happen came from the fake account for that wasn't a real account.  OK, wasn't a real account.  So he did delete Twitter.  Twitter verified.  Yeah, this is a verified account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he's tweeting about books that he likes.  He only apparently sees Fox movies, but he likes them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He talks about he likes the show that replaced Glenn Beck better than Glenn Beck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that was interesting.  He said he didn't.  He basically said he doesn't like Glenn Beck in this much more fun than Glenn Beck.  They got rid of Glenn Beck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so the New York Times did Brian Stilton analysis of this.  The Washington Post or Howard Kurtz, rather, was going after this.  I said, well, is that obvious?  He's going to support what show is on.  Well, that's true.  But it's interesting.  He was supposed to be a fake third page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he's very forthright in this.  Don't you think?  He likes Santorum.  He likes Santorum, but he likes Ron Paul.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Santorum would never get on O'Reilly after.  Tell me if this is a coincidence.  After Murdoch posted his endorsement of Santorum, someone else on Twitter told me that Santorum is now scheduled on O'Reilly.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, don't you think if you worked at Fox News, you'd be parsing this Twitter feed pretty damn close?  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does Rupert want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Rupert always said that he owned the New York Post and lost more than $25 million a year on it because he wanted, and as are his words, a bully pulpit.  Right.  And that's certainly Fox News too.  Right.  I think what's fascinating to me is he is discovering the bully pulpit of the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like he's gone through this and fixed the typos.  Is that possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Bob, that's why I took it over because, Leo, if you look at who he's following, it's all just Fox corporate stuff, and they got rid of the fake Larry Page account.  So somebody said, Rupert, we've got to take this in hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's sad because, yeah, it's all fixed.  There were a lot of typos.  There were a lot of weird capitalizations.  It's all been fixed.  Oh, Rupert, you were so real.  Now it's just going to be sanitized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I could fix my typos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's something that obviously Jack Dorsey helped him with because you can't edit a tweet, but Rupert can.  Oh, that's right, Leo.  Rupert can.  I'm pretty sure that these were not, that these were miss punctuated and miscapitalized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Emily Bell, ex-guardian now at Columbia, tweeted yesterday wondering, does this mean, does this conversation between Jack and Rupert mean that Rupert might invest in Twitter?  And then she asked the thought experiment here.  What do journalists think if Murdoch owned a big hunk of Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said at the Paul Allen conference that he didn't think you should invest in Twitter because it had no business model.  But that means he's been looking at it, right?  That means he's been thinking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to sit.  It's like the eye of Mordor.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The baleful eye of Mordor has turned.

Transcript:  I was brought out, they paid to bring me out to moderate a panel between Nick Denton, sorry I mentioned the name, and Mark Zuckerberg.  Oh, that must have been interesting.  It was fascinating, absolutely was fascinating with Murdoch there.  This was right before he bought the Wall Street Journal.  I wish I'd taken a picture of him reading the journal with his craggy brow beforehand.  And where I was going to point there, what the hell was it?  It wasn't talking about me.  It was some actual point.  Oh, age is horrible, people.  Don't ever get old.  Gina, don't get old.  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we've got to get going because TNT is here and we want to quickly do our number and our tool and our tip before we do that.  Just a brief mention.  Netflix, Netflix, Netflix.  Get Netflix.  Oh, God, I forgot.  I've got my mom's birthday.  I forgot.  I've got to get her.  It was yesterday.  Happy birthday, mom.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You're getting Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She said, she said, now I've been thinking because I've got her this first.  I got her the three disc subscription.  Then last year she said, I don't use the discs.  Get the streaming.  And then I just talked to her last week.  She said, well, I've been thinking I'd like one disc, so I'm going to get her the one disc.  It's a great gift.  Now, here's the deal.  You're already a Netflix subscriber.  I know that if you're not, we have a free deal.  We have a free deal.  30 days free of Netflix streaming at netflix.com slash twit.  If you are, would you tell a friend, just let them know.  Netflix.com slash twit 30 day trial.  Great stuff.  I use it all the time.  And it's a good way to kill a battery on a smartphone.  If you're trying to discharge the battery, I just put Netflix on and let the movie run.  So another good use for it.  Even that alone would be worth $8 a month.  Netflix.com slash twit.  Gina's tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  New Year's digital life cleanup tip.  My permissions dot org.  It's a really simple site.  All it does is it sends you links to all the different apps that you authorize on other websites.  So, you know, we're all pretty early adopters here.  You sign in, you connect with Facebook here.  You sign in with Twitter here.  You grant access to your Flickr photos, your Instagram photos here.  And, you know, we try out apps and then we don't use them anymore.  This site take two minutes.  Go through and just do a quick audit.  What apps have access to my profiles on these various other sites?  And which ones do I don't need anymore?  Which ones can I revoke?  And it just tightens up the security.  Look at all these. This is Twitter.  That's amazing.  I don't even know what these things are.  Yeah, I mean, if you're not using stuff and even as a developer, I have so many like test one, test seven authorization.  So just go through and it's got Instagram.  It's just links really. It's nothing fancy.  This is like glorified bookmarks.  You don't have to auth your account to this permission site to use it.  It's just just links to the console, which lets you know which apps you've authorized on your different sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This site, this guy Avi Chakram remade this site.  It took him three seconds.  It's basically links to the permissions page for each of these eight websites.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But you'll be shocked at how many things you've authorized and you don't use anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just brilliant, though.  I mean, I could have designed this.  This site took up no time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's great.  It's great.  It's mostly change your passwords, back up your data.  And this is good.  I like this stuff.  You don't need any January clean up my permissions dot org and Avi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get the you get the Philip Kaplan Award for clever, cleverest idea that took the least amount of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or by doing less.  He gets a putty.  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  We're going to make that up.  That's a good one. A putty award.  That's a good one. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  You should have a putty hackathon.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I remember putt.  Philip Kaplan, he did fdcompany.com.  And I remember him saying, you know, it's simple.  I just create sites that I don't have to that somebody else does all the content and I sit back and collect the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And he'll just he'll just, you know, hack something up and just for the fun of it, throw it out there.  And he has enough audience that people will try it and it sticks to the wall and sticks.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  MyPermissions.org.  Your number of the week, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Number of the week is one point five billion.  Wow.  A Piper Jaffrey analyst argues that based on the deal that Google did for Firefox to stay in Firefox's search, that they then use that to calculate the value of Chrome.  Wow.  And says that if Firefox is worth three hundred million dollars in annual revenue because they did a deal with Firefox with Mozilla, then since they're roughly equivalent now, that Chrome at a five times multiple would be worth would be a one point five billion dollar property, which goes back to a little bit earlier discussion about the about the sleazy ads and concern about about I think concern is just me bringing this up about antitrust arguments that you're going to see in the news.  Search to arguing that, you know, what got Microsoft in trouble?  I.E. could Chrome get Google in trouble?  So Google's going to be careful if it's a one point five billion dollar property.  So anyway, my tool of the week is Google's new elections page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just in time for 2012, it's going to be an interesting one.  Google dot com slash elections.  By the way, not just U.S.  There's an Egyptian edition as well.  That's the two.  I don't know why.  But I guess when there's elections elsewhere, they'll they'll add more pages for those places.  This is fantastic.  And Leo, do me a favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Click on the Google Plus link to the right.  This is new.  This is Google putting up a news identity for a story that you.  Oh, so this is this is where I just saw Gingras and I said, is this new?  Is this as big as I think it is?  Because I think this is them starting to create identities around topics and stories.  So presumably they're hiring an editorial company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because this is all under one moniker, Google politics.  No, I don't know that they're doing that.  I think what they're doing is adding content and discussion and graphics and data together for some topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can now follow those topics.  But somebody's doing this, right?  I mean, who's doing this?  You think it's algorithmic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think that is I think the page you showed before had to be designed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think this page is fed, I'm sure, automatically.  Oh, interesting.  And so and so what becomes interesting is that Google becomes in my region here.  You want to follow a story, right?  Think about following this instead of following a news article or Wikipedia.  Right.  Well, Wikipedia turned out, you know, kind of spontaneously be a great place to follow current events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're going to capitalize on that.  I'm creating a new circle.  They're in news.  I'm creating a new circle called stories.  And this is the first one in there.  Yep. Yep. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I wonder is, will they release this as an API so that, you know, journalists could come along and create these things too and may the best ones win?  I'd love to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it seems like it's just a page, right?  Or business.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How is it created?  Is so Jeff's assertion is it's automatic, not automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  So we have to accept an RSS feed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they, I mean, they've they haven't yet.  The API is read only and has been for quite some time because they don't they don't want people just sort of doing this auto tweeting or auto auto Facebook, you know, sending automatically sending their.  You know what?  This somebody moderate and there's this is curated.  Look at this.  There's text.  Here's your viral viral Iowa video of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then there's a video of it.  Now, this is curated.  Somebody's right.  Well, then that's an issue too.  Then that's new to Google is hiring editors.  Wow.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be big news if they're hang out live in Iowa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're doing hangouts.  Oh, I didn't I didn't look at it long enough.  I will politics and elections hung out.  So I want to go to the hangout and see who's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to go to the hangout and see who's there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to go to the hangout and see who's there.  They're doing it with Good Morning America.  They did a hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And today's search done.  This is editorial.  Wow.  This is editorial.  It doesn't have a byline, but it is.  Welcome to the Google politics and elections page, the source for news and notes from our politics and elections team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go.  So from the about page, they have editorial impartial data and digital trends.  They have editorial impartial data and digital trends surrounding the political process.  That's a newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How is that different in any way than a newspaper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I missed that story.  I looked at it for two seconds and then ran out to the hall as Richard was going for his flight and asked him, is this new?  Yeah, it's very new.  A big deal.  He said, yeah, but I didn't I didn't think well enough to ask the question.  You're right, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says we are nonpartisan and don't support endorse any political.  This is news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's channel conflict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I bet you it gets great search results.  Search for elections.  YouTube.com slash politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Same thing.  YouTube politics channel.  Well, see, this is a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is why I said they should divest YouTube.  They really should not be doing this kind of stuff because it really muddies the waters.  You call it channel conflict.  I just it's just confusing.  Yeah, we do the show every Wednesday at one p.m.  Pacific, four p.m.  Eastern.  That would be 2000 2100 UTC on Twitter TV.  Next week we're doing it at a different time because of CES.  We're going to do it on Monday at 11 a.m.  Pacific, two p.m.  Eastern time.  That's 1800 or 1900 UTC.  So tune in for the live show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gina Trapani is at SmarterWear.org and is now I guess I can't say where you're going to be next week, but she won't be with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want everyone to know that the only thing that would make me miss Twig is a meeting at the White House.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I will be at the White House next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can say that.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can say that.  That is the coolest, coolest, coolest thing.  Gina, I got to ask you.  Yes.  Wardrobe choices.  Yeah.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm breaking out my one suit that I wear to meetings in D.C.  I literally have my meeting in D.C. suit.  I may have to get another one if this keeps happening.  Wow.  I'm totally going to be dressed up.  And I'm sure my feet will hurt because I never wear those shoes.  So yeah, I'm sorry to miss Twig next week.  I'm going to be at the White House working on something that I'll be able to talk about soon.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're very thrilled for you.  That's exciting.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So follow her on SmarterWear.org.  She'll probably write about it sooner than we get her back on Twig.  We'll miss you next week, but we'll see you in a couple of weeks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And have a great time at CES.  Thank you.  Take care.  Let's see a good Google tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.  You might.  They might.  Remember, Eric Schmidt said we're doing a tablet.  He said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I play you guys out with a Google commercial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can.  We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.  TNT is coming up next.  Right after your TNT triangulation, our guest will be...  Anil Dash.  The great Anil Dash.  Oh, that'll be fun.  The proto blogger, Anil Dash.  But we leave you now with this commercial.  For what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you guys were talking about what commercial?  The French commercial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is the Muppets.  There's a Muppet commercial for Google?  And Google Hangouts.  Watch.  I don't think any normal person seeing that commercial would have a clue what that was  all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was so fun, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's great.  I love it, especially if you love Muppets, which I don't.  But if you love Muppets, you would love that.  They're puppets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Googlers love Muppets.  That's the other story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google-ers love Muppets.  And it fits that generation that's apparently decided they don't ever want to grow up.  But I got to say, a normal person seeing that ad is not going to know what the hell to do  with it.  Well, I like the Muppets.  What is it?  A music video?  Yeah.  Where do I go to do what?  To see Muppets?  Do I have to sing on this thing?  Do I have to dance?  Is it YouTube?  Is it a YouTube ad?  What is that?  I search on Google for Muppets.  There's no clue as to what that is or how to use it or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the party feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, if you want to bookend to it, last night on Jon Stewart, he had Elmo redone  as Gitmo with a black beard.  I don't understand.  I don't understand.  It's just people don't grow up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the Peter Panification of media.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you guys doing an email on technology today?

Transcript:  Yeah, he's my boss.  He's your boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should have said that.  Gina's boss will be on triangulation.  I forgot about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, nobody says anything bad about me.
