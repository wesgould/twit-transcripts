Just say Governor Christie and you'll laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we could criticize Christie and none of our listeners will come after us for being political then.  I think it's safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure there's got to be some Governor Christie fans out there.  Jeff is a professor of journalism at CUNY.  He blogs at BuzzMachine.com.  He's the author of many a fine book.  Hey, look who's here.  And I'm glad he is because I wanted to find out what's going on with Danny Sullivan.  He was the creator of, and I had forgotten about this, before Search Engine Land, Search Engine Watch.  That's how we first met.  You were doing Search Engine Watch.  I forgot you got acquired.  You got acquired, became Search Engine Land, founded MarketingLand.com and now you've decided to take a step back and become an advisor to the parent company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which means you're basically on the beach.  Yeah.  Tell us about that.  You're way too young to retire, Danny Sullivan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, I've been covering the search space, the search marketing and digital marketing space for 21 years.  Wow.  I'm exhausted.  Yeah, I'm exhausted.  There are some stories I felt like I've written the same story seven, eight times.  The names have changed, but the core principles are the same.  So you get to some degree where you feel like it's both not as challenging as you'd like and also does anybody want to hear me whine over the same things over and over again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same thing, but new people read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, and there is that.  I don't mean to take away from that.  And there is a challenge and I do enjoy a chance when I come in and explain something and talk about something.  But there's lots of great people who do that as well.  And also, I just sort of, it was sort of a daily thing.  I feel like I've been running on a daily basis in terms of this kind of coverage.  Although I wouldn't write every day.  Because it's always every day, we're running a business, we're doing this sort of thing.  And so I was just ready for a break.  Oh, more power to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, God bless you.  I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we've been building the company up over the past ten years.  We've got a great staff of people there.  And I feel like great.  Everybody's set.  Everybody's churning along.  They're going to do great.  I've managed to help build things up enough I can put myself out of a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good job.  Nice work if you can get it.  So you're going to kind of stay on in an advisory capacity at Third Door Media, but you're no longer Chief Content Officer over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. So I'm there if they've got questions, if they need me for anything.  I'm around. I still love the company.  I love everybody there.  I want them to be successful.  I still have shares in the company, so I really want it to be successful.  But I'm just there.  If they have questions for me, if they don't, then that's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think you'll take another job?  Do you take a pottery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right now I'm busy building an ATAT.  Good. In the backyard. That's always good.  For Comic Con, actually in the garage.  That's occupied a bit of my time.  Are you serious?  Oh yeah.  I put it up on Twitter. We just did our test walk today.  Oh my God.  We just have to wrap it all up.  There's a bed in the house that I will not get it done in time for next week.  How tall is it?  It's not that bad.  It's a little bit more than a foot.  It's not that bad.  It comes up to... I can't show you because I'm throwing my head and shoulders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have the methodology.  So there are going to be people in it.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watch out for those guys with the lariates who could take you down just by running around you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, we have plans for little speeders to run around.  I have great plans.  Many plans.  It's going to be amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the headline is Danny Sullivan retires from Surge Angel Land to build Star Wars cosplay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to take the summer to kind of relax.  My oldest son is going off to college in the fall.  So just spending as much time as I can with them.  I think that's awesome.  We'll see.  I really, as you might gather, love science fiction a lot.  So I might become a science fiction TV show recapper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you ever want to do a podcast, you know who to call.  Oh, actually, you probably have a lot of people saying that to you.  I have a great podcast I would love to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just want to get people who know everything about comic books to sit down with me every time there's one of those movies and say, now, what was the backstory on that?  I need the right title for it.  But it's like comic books in films for idiots was what I would probably call it.  So we'll do that.  I'd like to do some tech writing occasionally for things that I'm interested in.  If I, you know, something's not, you know, I like to explore topics.  And so, you know, I expect I'll do some writing.  Who knows?  Maybe I'll still write a search thing or whatever if Twitter rant doesn't do it enough for me.  But, you know, just kind of enjoying a little time off to kind of relax and recharge and just think about what kind of writing I want to do next.  So, yeah, we'll see.  Well, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you're always welcome to stop by because your insights are so valuable and we're going to kind of miss them on the web.  So please, you know, you know, I'm going to be happy to do that.  You were the most astute analyst of the web business and I hope we don't lose you with that.  Really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, thank you very much, Jeff, and back at you for all the great stuff that you do as well.  And I, you know, I definitely it's funny the kids keep going, stop saying you're retired.  And I hope I can keep that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm going to go back to the web.  I'm going to stay on the web.  And I'm going to just do a little bit of networking.  And then I'm going to go back to the web.  And I'm going to go back to the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm going to go back to the web.  Yeah, I guess we can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At least until we get through college, Dad.  It's more, you know, it's just, it's more a shift towards doing something else.  I definitely don't want to jump in and spend, you know, the grind of, especially on the marketing aspect, stuff or whatever.  But you know, general stuff.  If I think I've got something useful I can say.  And I plan to still be busy, certainly out on the Twitter.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter feed is great.  People should follow Daddy Sullivan because  Yeah, yes.  Including today's Net Neutrality Rally.  If you're watching our live stream, we're in black and white today.  Because today is the day we're battling to save the net from the new FCC chairman and his minions.  If you go to battle, let's see, there's a number of places to go.  What is the one we're recommending?  I can't remember.  Battle for the net.  If you go to twit.tv, you'll see a lot of people.  Battle for the net.  If you go to twit.tv, you'll see a lot of people.  Battle for the net.  Battle for the net.  Battle for the net.  Battle for the net.  Battle for the net.  If you go to twit.tv, there's a link to it.  In fact, I like our, I think I like what we did on the front page here.  Wow.  Yeah, and then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I may get in trouble for this, but I think one of the most effective arguments is on funny or die.  I may get in trouble for this, but I think one of the most effective arguments is on funny or die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it adult?  It's safe, I think it's safe.  It's safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's far.  It's far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is the web without net neutrality.  Oh, this is the web without net neutrality.  And this is what a lot of people are doing if you go to various sites.  And this is what a lot of people are doing if you go to various sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You guys did it too, right?  I saw that pop up.  Maybe, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or did I just see it everywhere else?  Might have been somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There it is.  In the middle?  Hornstars defend net neutrality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was wondering.  I'll skip that one.  It's actually, it's funny.  I'm sure it's funny.  It almost always is.  We could also show the yelling man takes on net neutrality.  Oh, that's a good one.  I'll leave that as an exercise to the viewer.  If you go to Reddit,  they have a big, Danny's clipped this one.  This is kind of cool because  it slowly,  it looks like 300 Ba.  The internet's less fun when your favorite sites load slowly, isn't it?  The internet's less fun when your favorite sites load slowly, isn't it?  Whether you're here for news AMAs  or some good old-fashioned cats in business attire.  Whether you're here for news AMAs or some good old-fashioned cats in business attire.  Whether you're here for news AMAs or some good old-fashioned cats in business attire.  The internet's at its best  when you  not internet service providers  decide what you see online.  decide what you see online.  And you know, we have a big dog in this,  because Twip probably  would have a hard time if internet service providers  could prioritize other video streams  and, you know,  by reverse discrimination hurt us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Who wants to pay Comcast  or Google, or sorry, Comcast  or AT&T more money just to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  YouTube, or  Reddit, or  and then really,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  or Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not so much worried about Twit as the next Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  YouTube would be fine though.  Google will pay the fees anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's the point.  It benefits the company.  It's got two problems. One is it benefits big  companies that have already made it, that can afford  to give, pass  a little back sheesh on internet service providers  for access to you.  And also, the other problem is that  the internet service providers become the arbiters  of what succeeds and fails.  And that's why we don't like zero rating too, when companies  like T-Mobile say, well you can  listen to these services and it won't ding you  for bandwidth.  That's another way of picking the incumbents.  We don't want the big internet service  providers to decide winners and losers on the internet.  It's too soon to limit the net.  It will always be too soon.  The net needs to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the competition,  I did an interview this morning for  the Velshi and Ruhl on MSNBC  this Saturday.  And I'll make this a point, we're going to be on the show many times.  If we had sufficient competition, I think that would  take care of it, but we do not.  So I could imagine a day  where  you have many, many service providers  that made the best and the best priced win.  And well, we don't need it.  Net neutrality. But we need it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think we'll ever get to that point  because the people who can build  an ISP type network,  you have to be so big  to do it. And you have to behave  in kind of a dickish manner in order to make  it work because the regulatory and  competitive hurdles are so high.  So I kind of feel like  we're never  going to get the competition  we need. And then when we think about  greater verticalization across  the board, I think that also  will stand against it. That's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One thing that might make a difference is  wireless.  Because of course, the infrastructure  required to do wired internet is  pretty prohibitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If we look at 5G wireless,  so I'm using 5G not as the  I'm using it as the millimeter wave  fixed wireless. So that's  what Google, Facebook,  AT&T, Verizon are all testing this.  And this is basically using  spectrum that currently  doesn't travel well through walls.  And there's a couple technical things that have happened  to make it more financially  viable and faster.  So if we did something  like that and they're testing that now,  that  economically could work. And that's  kind of what Starry is trying to do, although I have  no idea how well Starry is doing now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other  plan that I'm most in favor  of, but seems even  less likely  to succeed, is the notion  that municipalities own  the infrastructure,  just as in many places they might own  the power grid or the gas lines  or the water lines, and then  and maintain it.  And then I'll  lease it out to any company that wants to use that  infrastructure to provide internet service.  I really like that model,  and that's a model in some  countries that is the case. Government often owns  the infrastructure. But that gives to me the best  of both worlds, because the municipality  then, you know, it's like the roads.  The municipality creates a  network of  data and allows  others to ride on it, and they can  make their money back by charging a toll.  But then you have  real competition over those

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  lines. I don't think we're going to get that  under this FCC. Some of the  last FCC tries to create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could be decades, but  no, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great idea,  sort of. It becomes  it's a challenge  because of the way we  invested in broadband initially.  So I think it'd be great  if municipalities could do it, but it's going to  cost so much, and AT&T  and Verizon would sue because  they would lose their rights  to do this. Well, the advocates

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for it, which include, by the way,  Bob Frankston, one of the  critters of VisitCalc,  the advocates for this say  the cities, municipalities could take over  the existing infrastructure  using eminent domain.  And so  you could, yeah, but you're right. I mean, the real  problem, yeah, the real problem  in this country is exactly what we're seeing  and why we're fighting today,  which is that the  telecommunications companies are the single  biggest donors  to the United States Congress  via their political action  committees and lobbies. And as  a result, they get their way.  And they get their way in state  legislatures, too, which have in many cases  I think 23 states banned  municipal Wi-Fi.  So  maybe as Larry  Lessig said, the best thing to do is to get  the influence of money out of  politics first, and then we could talk about a whole  lot of other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm for it. Let's do that. Let's make that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're going to run for Senate in Texas,  right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you've got to start small. Maybe I'll run for  the school board. Okay, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's influential. That's good.  You guys want to weigh  in? Stacey and I are dominating here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well,  I think we've talked a lot about  neutrality and the sad  part is we have to talk about it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what? The fight is not over.  We'll have to keep fighting. Of course, you remember  that the FCC  claimed that they had been hit with a  distributed denial of service attack and so  had to close down comments.  I think they're up. If you  go FCC yourself,  which is the fabulous  domain created by  Stephen Colbert, yeah, it'll take you  to  what they euphemistically call  restoring internet freedom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My big concern in all  this is, you know, I  was reading through the article. I thought The Verge had  a good article on everything everybody's doing, but it was like,  we've got things now where you don't even have to go  to the site and you just push a button and  I felt like... Yes, slacktivism.  But yeah, and I,  you know, I'm concerned if,  yes, we've done all this, but  it gets dismissed as, well, it's  just, you know, it's basically all  robots. They're not going to vote anyway.  You know, it's not. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's another problem. I mean, there's a really big problem  in this country, which is that  the voice of the  voter is not necessarily  honored  because of gerrymandering,  because of the very lopsided system  we have, which  weighs rural voters  way up ahead of  urban voters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if there's a way to,  I wonder if there's a way for the  states themselves to impose some rules.  Like, one of the things about California  with, you know, our car emissions was that  we'd set our emissions to a certain  level, and then you had  manufacturers say, well, we might as well  hit the California level because we sell so many  cars there. It's just easier to do the whole  thing. And I wonder  if you had states mandate their own state  based net neutrality systems.  If, first of all, you might  get around some of the federal government lobbying.  I'm not going to work everywhere,  but at least you have 50 different fronts  rather than one that you might lose off of.  And if it might cause some of these people  to, you know, say, look,  we can try to do all this, but  we're going to not be able to do it in half  of these states, so let's just  say we don't do it.  And to say we don't do it as a benefit,  you know, that we won't  do this and actually embrace it rather than,  you know, and that will gain us customers.  I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's an interesting idea. I would say Texas  would never go because we are strictly  an AT&T company. I would point  you guys to, because we're kind of talking  about this, and it's worth it to anyone  who actually, who really cares  about this issue. The New Yorker did  a really excellent article  called America's Future is Texas  by Lawrence Wright, who's here in Austin.  And that was  a really nice  explainer, and I've been  aware of this because I've lived in Austin my whole  life, not my whole life, a long time.  And  followed a lot of this, but he explains how  Texas  serves as like a microcosm for the Republican  party's ability to gerrymander  and take control over a lot of places.  And it's really  scary, especially as someone who  lives in Texas and  is watching currently our legislature  just run roughshod over  some of the laws that Austin  has tried to pass and other cities in  Texas that are a little bluer.  So  it's worth a read if this is something that you're  interested in. I was kind of disheartened  because they didn't really talk much about solutions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think a lot of us  see the who is the state  senator who filibustered about  right to life.  Wendy Davis. Thank you, Wendy Davis. I heard  Wendy Davis speak at a journalism conference.  She's amazing. She's amazing.  And she said that in the population,  Texas is about as  purple as California. It's just that  with the gerrymandering and voter  suppression,  there's much less voting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's crazy. Austin,  we have six representatives,  not one. My  representative, Roger  Williams, apparently who is also  Lawrence Wright's, his district goes  all the way up to Waco.  And if you've been to Waco,  it's so  my little slice of the Austin  pie was divvied up.  So as a voter, I have very  little power in  even local representation  for Congress. And  I have I have a  do I have I think I actually have  a Republican local state senator. So my  congressional representative  is  taken away from me because of gerrymandering,  which is a problem. And  then nationally,  you know, I've got John Cornyn  and Ted Cruz.  So I  never thought I'd get there nationally, but maybe  I could one day. The good news is district

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  court has ruled that the Texas  gerrymandering is racially motivated and illegal.  And we've seen the true. But whether  that anything will happen  is is another

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  redoing a couple of districts.  I was really excited about that. And then I  spent some time looking into it. And  it's not as great as  I thought it would be.  But hey, every little  bit helps. It

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to Waco Democrats. Yeah, it bugs me because  in a populous state like California,  our vote counts about  a third the vote of somebody in a less  populous state like Vermont  in the presidential election.  And, you know, and  this was it's an interesting history  of this country was really created  by the founding fathers,  all men,  and many slave owners to protect  the rights of the  rural colonists  against the rights of the city colonists.  But often that meant to protect the  rights of slaveholders  against the abolitionists.  And it's  kind of a grim history that  just doesn't seem to quit.  Main reason I want we bring this up  is I don't want people to give up. And I feel  like people have given up. In  Neelay Patel's article on The Verge,  he quotes  Wired's tech reviewer, David  Pierce, saying, I don't think reviewing  Internet service providers matters  because I don't think anyone has any inkling  that an ISP can be good.  It's like reading Yelp reviews of Comcast.  The best case scenario is  you don't think about it and it only  gets worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen, nobody loves  an ISP, but, but, but, except  ours, in some fairness, in some fairness,  my Fios is a good size. As much as  I've screamed out about Verizon mobile, I gotta  be fair. My knock wood that  doesn't go out of me right now, my  Fios service is very good.  What's, what's, what's to do?  We were Time Warner

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and I guess it's now Spectrum, but  to be honest, it's been great because  they actually lowered my price and they  upped my bandwidth and I didn't even  do anything. So not only  did I not think about it, but it  all increased. So I,  I, maybe I'm a lucky

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  one. Well, but, but  that's only one metric of a good ISP.  Because Verizon and Spectrum  will throw you to the wolves the minute  a government subpoena comes in over the transom.  You know, they're,  they, or, or  let's say a letter from the  record industry.  I don't know about your rates.  Look at your bill. Has that been ratcheting  up regularly? The cable rates are rising.  Some, some  five, six, five or six times faster.  Internet rates are rising five or six times faster  than the cost of living. I don't take my cable, I take my

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  satellite and that's actually gotten  cheaper too because I'm  DirecTV and AT&T and they keep  throwing discounts because the two are  bundled together. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's also issues. So there are  issues of data caps and then  there are issues of  We'll make you unhappy yet, Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry. So there's data caps.  I haven't, I've not had any of my data  capped at the house as far as I can tell.  That's never been an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So back in 2008, Time Warner  was actually the first company to  like try to implement data caps  and they were pushed back pretty vehemently.  Although Comcast later

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  succeeded. I have a terabyte data  cap on my Comcast at home and we've  exceeded it three months in a row.  So we're going to get,  we're going to get dinged. Oh, by the way,  Danny, you have AT&T. I forgot.  They love net neutrality. In fact,  they've signed on to this  protest. Which is  fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't even read the story  because I'm like, are you seriously?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like what? Yeah. This is the company  that blocked customer access to FaceTime  unless you bought a more  expensive plan.  The good old guys  at AT&T. Tomorrow,  they wrote, AT&T will  join the day of action for preserving  and advancing an open internet.  This may seem like an anomaly  to many people.  My question why AT&T  is joining with those with differing  viewpoints on how to ensure an open and free internet.  But that's the point. How are they doing this with  straight things? I don't know.  It's consistent  with AT&T's proud history of championing  our company's rights to an open internet.  As long as we control it  and can make more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is because  we have become so successful  as a,  I mean this very facetiously, as a country  for being able  to look at something that says  one thing and say, oh, AT&T  is totally in favor of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  AT&T has always supported Eurasia.  It was never at war with East Asia.  Exactly.  What is it? Lies are truth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  War is  peace.  And we're really entering that time where  I feel bad for people  because psychologically it's got to be disturbing  to think something is true.  We're basically all being gaslighted all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the time. I mean, to  step back, we're in the space  this gets us upset.  For a lot of people, it's not  going to be upsetting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why we're trying to raise some awareness here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  T-Mobile wants to give me free data?  Nice. I'm going to get  subpoenaed. I didn't do anything wrong.  Why is that going to bother me?  You know, it's like, you can see  that it's not a thing that's going to excite  a whole lot of people.  I always find the thing that excites  the most is the idea, and  somebody did this years ago, was  that you have to pick out what you want to pay  for on your cable bill.  So who did it?  I can't remember.  But it was like a little graphic, and it was like,  okay, I want YouTube. That'll cost me  $10 a month. But I would like to have Facebook.  Oh, and I would  like to have  Facebook, but I will also be required  to subscribe to  my regional sport service fee.  That's the stuff I think  that really ticks people off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The internet will run the same way the cable companies  run TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the cable companies would  never do that. What happens is, and this  is a core problem with innovation,  you never know what's  not going to happen. And that's  kind of the threat here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. You never  know what's not going to happen. You're proving a  negative when you regulate it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're never not going to...  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's the title of this show.  More cones that make no

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sense from Stacy.  Stacy's Cones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright.  I think we've said what we need  to say. Probably anybody who's  following this issue  knows where they stand,  and I hope they will let the FCC  and their member of Congress know.  And we could just leave it  at that. And I don't

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let Ted know how you feel, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually call both Ted  and John Cornyn every  week and let them know all  kinds of things. And I even call  Roger Williams. He sent me a letter saying he doesn't care.  It was a nice letter  that said that many of my  constituents are in favor of the  following policies that I support.  So he was like, you know what?  You're not in favor.  Which he's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should have Rohrabacher  here because when I call his office, they're like,  well, we don't know his position.  We can't know. He doesn't  know. He told me once  he couldn't have a position  on anything President Trump  would say because he's just a  congressman.  Or he can't possibly know  everything that's in the bills he's voting  on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's a really wonderful  source of... He's awful.  Great quotes. Isn't he the guy who said,  well, you can always just get off the Internet if you don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or we can have town halls,  but we can only have telephonic  town halls  that are not announced  in advance.  If you happen to be at home at the  time that they didn't tell you in advance  and your phone rings and you knew that that  was going to be them, then maybe you could  participate if you were one of the random  people.  You're awful.  Just awful.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's cheer up.  Go to the FCC. Comment.  Let's see if we can bring it down again with  another distributed denial of service attack.  Oh lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Star Trek communicator. That's cool. There's no  problems on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like that.  Is that for your... You're confusing  your cosplay now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm happy. I am  unlike the two roommates that got into  a knife fight over whether Star  Trek was better last week.  Such a silly thing to do  since Star Trek is so obviously superior.  We don't know who won.  Because they didn't identify them.  This is nice. It's like I got a Bluetooth  speaker and it plays music.  Oh, that's cool.  You could take phone calls on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway. Google Photos and  Google Drive is adding its  backup and sync  tool for the McIntosh.  Why?  What?  It's sort of like  Carbonite or one of these other online backup  but it's only for  existing folders,  desktop documents,  and pictures.  Of course you pay for the storage.  I should mention that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How is this different than what they do already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did it on Windows first and I think they  now do it on the Mac. Is that what's  new?  I don't know. I want to understand more.  As opposed to what you do  right now with the Google Drive syncing.  Is that what you're talking about?  Yeah, I just put all my photos in Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's a Google Drive folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you can back up your  desktop folder, your documents folder,  and your pictures folder  onto Google Drive  automatically.  It's a sync folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish  what's annoying me about them.  I just  want to lose my mind.  It's that we don't have  like you can't use Google Drive  with multiple accounts.  Right?  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's also driving this thing.  That's why you're on this side of the  stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Niagara Falls.  In sync is a wonderful

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  solution.  So get in sync because that  will allow you to have multiple Google Drives.  The other thing is like  as our  laptop storage space continues to  condense down to like 128  gigabytes to 60 gigabytes.  You want to  support for external drives.  Just make it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much do you pay for in sync?  This is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In sync is wonderful. It really is.  I have three different Google accounts that I deal with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's kind of a unified inbox for your  Google Drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.  I have a specific need.  So I'm like, oh, would it work for...  Okay. Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll work with any of your Google Drive  accounts. And it'll also support  an external drive, which is wonderful.  So I would really like Google just to buy  them. But of  course I would like Google to just  give me the same features, although it would make me sad for  the people over at in sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is nice.  I get this. This works for Linux too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah. And they're really good. They've been very  dependable. It's saved me.  But it is those things where you're like, why  don't you have this stuff, Google?  Why? You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you just had Chromebooks, people.  Well, that's what's funny about this is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hasn't Google been saying all along, oh, it's too hard.  We can't figure it out. We don't know how to do it.  And these guys just come along and do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's because they don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't care. I want my calendars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want both of my calendars. This doesn't  seem to offer what I want. Dang it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you mean calendars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the stupidest thing, but it's actually  this is my first world problem.  I want my  main calendar is on my business  Google account. So my paid  G Suite account.  And I  can sync that over to my personal  stuff. But what happens is when  I go into my Google home and I  want to share data, it will only  share from my personal account. It  won't share from my business account.  And so my calendar is horribly  inaccurate. And I would love to actually be able to ask  you know, hey, Echo or hey,  Google home. What  what's on my calendar today and  get the right stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can't you can't have  your Google.  So one of the Google calendars can subscribe to the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't you subscribe to your business calendar and your

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  home? I did. I subscribed to my  personal calendar to my business  calendar. But because it  won't let me link my business  calendar to the Echo.  I think that's the issue. Right. So go the  other way. Make your

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  home calendar be the  master calendar. Subscribe to your business calendar  and the home calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then I have to  OK. Yes. OK.  Maybe that would work. But then do I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did this before because I'm in  the same situation I've had at work where  my business and my  I just need to swap my subscriptions then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or, hey, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what Google could do  would be like, I don't know, support  people with G  sync drive, whatever the heck they call it  now to pay money  and let us use all the  same things everybody else gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As soon as you get a G Suite account, you're  suddenly disadvantaged.  You're suddenly the last citizen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to pay us money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, you can't use Google  Fi. Sorry. Sorry.  Sorry. Have you considered getting a Gmail account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't use Google  Fi. They just they've all opened it up.  So you can use Google Fi now.  On G Suite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every time I go to  it's like Google. I'm going there right now.  I've done it. I've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  my I'm going to kill  my old Fi account and I've now  got my G  G Spot Fi account.  G Suite. See, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  still don't trust it though because I'm still waiting for them  to then go, oh, no, no, no, we change  them. Oh, oh, oh,  but this other thing won't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never get it. I never  get it. Actually, I'm glad I have a Fi account now  because Hangout still works for  text messaging, but only if you have a Fi account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that great? Saving me. I feel bad  for everybody else. I was tempted to dump  it, but I'm going off to Italy. I thought that would be handy.  Switch it on right from the plane.  It's all ready to go. And now they have this  group deal that's still good for a few days where you  can add somebody else. And  oh, an administrator has turned off  Google Fi, Project Fi  Access. I am  the administrator. So turn it on, baby.  Turn it back on. I'm like G Suite  of one. That's the other thing. It's like, can I have  a G Suite that's designed for a  single person who just doesn't  want to have a Gmail account?  Make it exactly like G Suite. Why would you? If it's just you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what do you need a G Suite for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I just want my own domain name. Oh, yeah, yeah.  Right. For your own domain name. That's my issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have the right  somebody email me saying they heard rumors that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google might just basically do that.  It'll allow you to keep your domain. That's exactly  why I'm doing it. I don't care about all the G Suite  stuff. Yeah, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  my G Suite, I'm calendar.twit.tv,  mail.twit.tv.  But yeah,  I mean, you can add extra. I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  added extra emails, but essentially  that's, yeah, you want your customer. But you only

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  pay what, five bucks a month because it's one person,  right? I think it's nine dollars a month.  That's a little much. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did the, I think it's like sixty years or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not bad. That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I probably have some old grandfathers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boy, this is a great show to listen to if you want  to understand how Google really works, kids.  Well, we're covering Google. Hey, we're covering  Google. Oh, no, it's five dollars a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This week in Google, Google Grypes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, are you  going to get the new Google Pixel? We're  learning more and more. Lots of rumors

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just had to buy a new one only  a month ago because I dropped the  last one in the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I gotta buy another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's not talk about that. Oh, dropping in the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These are renders from the Android  Police or the Popo,  the Android Popo, as I call them,  that are based on  descriptions of this  edge to edge OLED.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a Galaxy 8 that you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  squeeze. It'll be squeezable.  It's made by  LG. So the HTC,  what is it, the 11 has squeezable

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sides. Yeah, Jeff, and you  you've seen how popular that's been.  Everywhere you go, you see people  using their HTCs going, thank  goodness I can squeeze this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems to me not such a good  feature, but maybe Google's...  Squeezed to do what? Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to interact with Google Assistant is the thought.  Okay, so I squeeze my phone all the time  accidentally, and I can't tell you  how many times my camera is like, I'm like  picking up the phone and the camera's on because  I grabbed it and hit the button too hard.  And I feel that  a squeezable phone.  Sometimes I just get tense.  So you don't squeeze the pixel?  Like when you guys are talking over me or  something and I'm like...  What's going to happen then?  Google Assistant will be like,  let's take a few deep breaths. Actually,  that would be really handy. Well, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you shake the phone,  it launches the  debugger to say, hey, are you having  problems? Cause they figure...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? Yeah.  I had a Motorola and whenever I  shook the phone, the flashlight  went on. That was super handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then we just saw  a story that said  Google's watching for people who press the back  button really rapidly, a lot,  because they're stuck.  Get me out of here!  It's called panic  detection mode. This is in 7.1.  And when it sees the  frantic back button presses it,  it realizes it knows the program's crashed  and bails. That tells you  something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always  think of that for websites, if they could do that  on websites for ads, cause that always  happens to me. I'm like,  if I'm not going through an ad block  browser and I'm going through something else and I'm  like, wait, ah, crap!  And then I'm like, screw it.  So if they could actually just take me  back to my story, that would be nice. And ding  that bad website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To me, the best news about the  new Pixel is that it's going to be LG, cause  there was a rumor that HTC might be making  it, which would have been very sad. Now, we  think there'll be, you know,  two, there's two code names  with this, this is, we're talking about Time  N, which is the biggest  one. So, according  to the Android Popo,  it will be  edge to edge, bezel-less design.  The fingerprint reader will  no longer be on the  glass part, which is shrunk. It'll be  the same spot, but the top glass part  is a little bit smaller.  I don't know what else to say about it.  Google's faced with  curved, yeah.  Squeezeable frame is weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, not the curved thing. You mean  the Samsung kind of curved thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. I think we're talking edges  being curved now. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not like it goes all the way, it just,  it's a soft, the iPhone 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  has it. Curve phone,  so, 19, 2014.  Yeah. Google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  got a problem, because both Google and Samsung,  Samsung's going to do the no date, Google, the  Pixel, last year they came out right before the  Apple announcement, they'll probably do the same, which means  early September, late August. And then  everybody's got all attention, all eyes  are going to be on this new iPhone. Oh,  yeah. Because it's the 10th anniversary, and  it looks like Apple's going to do some interesting  things with it.  It's going to, you know, meets the iPhone,  so it's going to set the stage for what phones need to  look like going forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, to step back, I mean,  aside from them having issues, because  people will be interested,  what, do we even know  how well the Pixel has done? No.  Because this is the biggest launch  they've ever done for a phone.  This was like, we are in whole new territory,  and  I didn't get the impression that many people  have Pixels. I judge that  solely by the amount of cases I can purchase.  Right. But I actually feel like  your case variety, there are cases out there,  but if I can get a wallet case for a phone,  I know that it has a very, very  popular audience.  And it was hard to get one wallet case  for my Pixel.  So focus group of one.  Well, we all have Pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  I don't have a Pixel, remember. I still have a Nexus.  I try to make my phone last  for two years, because I'm not a phone person.  I got to spend money on, you know, connected ovens.  You're crazy. You're crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not missing  anything on them.  I am excited about this one.  Nice pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you think you'll get a Pixel?  Well, you're due, right? Because it's time to get a Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm due. So we're going to have  some serious phone discussions  going into the September, October timeframe,  you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do need it to be waterproof, though. I'm at that  point now where I do not want a phone that's not waterproof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Same here, man. I've done it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happens? You guys drop it in the  urinals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I go out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the water a lot.  Luckily, before any activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't...  I see people say that a lot.  Why isn't it waterproof?  So there must be a demand, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  First of all, I did...  I fell in the water the other day  and tried to get in our boat.  It's a very amusing  gift, but I fell in with my  iPhone, and I was glad that it  survived, because it was just in my pocket and I hadn't anticipated it.  But then I go out  paddle boarding, and it's nice.  You want to take pictures of stuff out there, and  you, you know,  you don't want your phone to die. Of course,  you want to make sure you have something that lets it float, too,  but still.  I just want waterproofing  in the same way that it will automatically break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about wireless charging? Is that a...  See, I like that.  I think that's part of the problem with making  a modern smartphone, is there's a large  need for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I needed the wireless charging, because  after my Samsung 7,  that's supposed to be waterproof, was waterproof.  It refused for many days to let me  charge it, because it just kept saying,  I think there's water in the USB port.  It's been like four days now.  I think the water's cleared up, right? Come on.  So, the wireless  charging got it back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what happened to one of mine that got wet?  The USB-C only works one way.  It reverts to USB's earlier land.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so your phone charging takes forever.  Does? No. No, it doesn't.  Oh, sorry. No, that's something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It only goes in halfway.  I also need the phone to do the  two lens thing like the iPhone 7 does.  That portrait mode...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a nice feature.  LG has that on their G6,  so maybe they will build it onto the Pixel X.  So here's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, Danny.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no.  I'm empty of responses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was just going to say, if you have two lenses,  isn't that the VR180 format?  That's possible.  The YouTube announced.  So, if they're far enough away,  you get 3D photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bad news, the renders only have one  visible camera lens.  Could be one hidden behind the black plastic at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel they're early on that, though.  They have time.  I think it's going to be hard, though,  if you're trying to sell the Pixel up against the iPhone,  and the iPhone will be in its second  generation of dual lenses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the iPhone is going to be  a big AR play.  They've put out this AR kit.  A lot of people seem to be doing AR kit-based  little widgets, little trial things.  But that's a good sign.  You've got a lot of developers playing with it.  Of course, that's a key to the AR,  is this depth sensing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say, if they have  depth sensing on there,  and then they're also talking about 3D sensing,  which is depth sensing for unlock  features on the new iPhone,  then we probably  could see a lot of really cool functionality  using computer vision on that thing.  I expect we will.  This is what drives me nuts.  I'm still waiting for the user interface  that isn't like, oh,  where you wave your phone around  and look through the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could argue,  that's what Pokemon Go is.  There's no reason you couldn't put that on any phone, really.  The secret sauce for Apple,  besides some fast hardware,  better cameras,  depth sensing cameras,  is this library AR kit,  which developers seem to love.  Which developers seem to like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They won with the App Store.  Why not win with lots of AR, VR content?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let the other guys do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although we're getting really fragmented,  one of the things is like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it. Danny talks,  but his mouth doesn't move. It's an amazing thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got...  I have an Oculus, I have a Vive.  I have a Galaxy Gear as well.  That's three different VR platforms.  I can buy a game that's very similar on the Gear  to a game that I could buy from an Oculus  and you have to buy them separately.  Now, okay, I know that most people aren't going to be buying all these things,  but the VR games are very expensive.  And so, if you started on a Gear,  do you want to abandon that  when you go off to this other thing?  And then if Apple comes out with their own things,  I've got to buy it for that platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is just the early days argument.  Well, yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it about humans that we just have to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  as many standards as possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just think of that X...  I can't think of the letters.  X, E, whatever, D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  X, K, C, D, X, E, C, D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody was doing something on standards yesterday.  The standards thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the beauty part of standards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's always another.  But that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll be very upset,  and I know they won't do it, but I'm still going to get upset anyway  with Apple because I know that they will not put  USB-C  in the iPhone next time.  And they should.  They should just bite the bullet and do it.  They USB-C on everything else.  They should say, I know we're going to upset you that everybody bought all your lightning stuff.  Let's face it, we need to change the thing.  They'll make people nuts.  For a year.  And then people will be like, wow.  This is amazing.  I've got one charger that charges everything.  It makes me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't know why  Microsoft's another laggard here.  Their devices still have a  proprietary charging connector.  And their new Surface laptop doesn't even have  a Type-C port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's great. I can go from a Chromebook  to my MacBook and it's the same charger.  And then I can use the same  charger to charge my Pixel up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had to go out and buy  three USB-C to lightning cables  because there's no other way to connect  to my MacBook. And I need it  for other reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny, there's also, Google sells a  USB-C  wall charger that has two USB-C's  in it, which is rare to find.  Oh, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a Google thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Google. I bought it from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do some shopping live on the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While you're doing that, let me tell people about  Rocket Mortgage. How about that? Our sponsor today  comes to us from Quicken Loans,  the best loan company  in the country.  And they get better and better because they're  reaching out to us, the geeks,  with their new Rocket Mortgage  which is designed to  be completely online.  Move the entire mortgage approval process online.  No more paperwork.  You do it all on a phone or a tablet  or a computer with a touch of a finger.  You can apply simply.  You can understand the process  fully. It's completely transparent.  That means you'll be confident you're  getting the right mortgage for you.  Based on your income, your assets, and your credit, they analyze  all the home loan options  and find the one that meets your needs  exactly.  Whether you're looking to buy your first home or tenth,  actually, for those of us who bought more than one  home, Rocket Mortgage is  a revelation. Last home we bought  three years ago, Lisa and I bought our house,  it took us months to get the mortgage.  We almost lost the house because the seller was saying  what's going on? You don't have the loan?  It's been two months.  And we're faxing stuff from our crews.  It was crazy. Rocket Mortgage  doesn't take months, doesn't take weeks, doesn't take days.  It takes minutes because  oh, computers.  You submit everything you need with a  touch of a finger because they've got trusted partners with  all the financial institutions. So bank  statements, pay stubs, they go boom. You get  to pick the term. You get to pick the rate. And then it will  crunch it all and get you the loan that's just right  for you. And you  will have the confidence because you'll see exactly  how it works. You'll understand all the details. You'll know you're  getting the right mortgage. To get started,  it's easy. Just go to rocketmortgage.com  slash twig  and do that please because then they'll know  you heard it here. Rocketmortgage  dot com slash  twig equal housing lender  license in all 50 states and NLS consumer  access dot org number  3030 Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans  go to rocketmortgage dot com slash twig  Danny Sullivan is here formally of  search engine land. He's still  a three door media but he is  looking for work as a cosplay costume  designer.  If anybody has any  suggestions. Yes. I can't. I can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  sew and  can't really build but  I don't want to let... I still have  a dream and I don't  want to feel that my lack of any  applicable skills should hold me back. You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if I were in your shoes  lots of time  on your hand. I'm literally barefoot.  A packet of money and no  shoes to wear. I would go out  and get a trawler  and I'd sail the world.  Oh wow. That's my

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  dream you know. Well I've still got  another kid at home so  take the kid with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take the kid with you. This is you're  going to learn. You're going to learn.  It's going to be hard. You got to go through college.  You could do high school at sea. You're going to get  in this thing. You're going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. I was just looking at that. No that was  a different thing. I was looking at the solar one.  Sorry you got me very excited. There's like a solar

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  catamaran. Well I would like a solar  boat. That's what I would like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what actually I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about... It's called a sailboat by the way. I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about that kind of thing many times  because you know I remember reading  what was that  book? The Kids Sailed Around the World.  Oh yeah. Robin  Yeah. I can't think of the name of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the boat. The whole family did it or just one guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He just went on his own. He sailed on his own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah Robin what's his name? Slocum I want to  say. Wind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll come back to me.  Great book. Great book.  And so I've always  you know and I sail like a tiny bit  in the harbor and  so I've thought about it. My wife's just like  we'll die.  She'll just kill us. Well that's a risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's why you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to be you know it's just  I would like you're going to go  there's a hurricane but I think I can just skirt  around it. It's no fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's no fun if there's not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  chance of death. I'm like well maybe I can get one  of those things you know. You just get into the cubicle.  You jump into the capsule and  then we're all fine. Yeah.  No. Kill us. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then you're just bobbed there for  four days and die of  thirst. That'd be great. Yeah.  It's going to be fun. We'll have a water maker.  We'll have Wi-Fi. It's going to be so much fun.  That's actually what I'm waiting for. Believe it  or not. Actually it would be nice to have solar so I don't have to  buy gas and I'm really waiting  for internet everywhere. When are we going to get Stacy?  High speed internet on every  square inch of this planet. It's not  long right? A decade?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe if I mean.  Elon wants to do it right? Yeah  Elon he has a lot of fish to fry right  now. Yes with  the smaller satellites  possibly you've got to have the  spectrum and then you've got to have a cheap  module that goes into phones  to read the satellite  transmissions. That's a big  part of  building a it's not just the internet  in the sky. You've got to have the internet  receivers on the ground or in your  device. Yeah. That's tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the middle of the ocean. In the  middle of the ocean. Danny this is the boat I think  you were talking about. This is your new boat. It's  it makes its own fuel  as it circumnavigates

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the world. Oh no but I could do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  too. It looks pretty nice.  It's a it makes it makes  hydrogen power.  With the see all the solar panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We need that sort of thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The shipping industry  oh no the shipping industry is working  on I actually put it in my  newsletter because I thought it was fascinating.  Boats that are  electric. Electric shipping boats  and they're also going to drive themselves.  The World Economic Forum had a really  I feel like Elon after he does trucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and buses he's going to have to look to boats.  Although somebody  told me maybe oh it was I think Jason  Kalakannis who kind of has some inside knowledge about Elon  said that the real  purpose of the hyperloop  was not as some think  a super fast  pneumatic tube between San Francisco  and Los Angeles.  But in fact a trans  oceanic tube  that would eliminate the need for all  these you know container ships going back  and forth. You just  put 10,000 iPhones  in a container and went in and go  and it would go  all the way across the Pacific  and end up in Oakland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the problem with that is you'd have to have  is you can't have the tube in  the water because it's it's underwater.  It's under it's like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sea it's on the ocean's floor.  And the thing is because there's no humans on it.  There's no humans on it. You can have more acceleration.  You don't have to worry.  You know I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So basically  we're building the postal system  in large Manhattan buildings  from like the 19th.  You'd go to Macy's and you'd order

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and buy something.  Newsrooms had them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was my dream  really to have a pneumatic tube system  in the old studio.  It would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was an Austin company who built a pneumatic  tube system because they were next order  Chipotle. So they did a  burrito delivery tube.  Yeah. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could do that. Won't our drone

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  things just do that for us?  Can't you just put the 10,000 things on a drone  delivery thing and just let it fly and bring it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is better because there's no congestion.  It's just a tube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's the air. There's no congestion in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  air. Oh there will be

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  congestion in the air. Send a thousand drones  up. A million drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well now that we've sent one  photon to space or whatever it was we sent to space.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watch. See watch. She puts it in there.  She's going to  send and then  the tube goes in the pneumatic  and it goes  flying through the air

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in this tube.  Drive-thrus still use this today. I feel  like... Yeah. Do you still have drive-thrus  banks in Texas?  I was thinking we have drive-thrus pharmacies.  Sure.  Where drive-thrus beer barns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have those in newsrooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the time he builds the pneumatic  system to send the iPhones and gets it  all up and working and running under the water  at the billions and billions of dollars  then it's like suddenly  going to be like oh our 3D printers can just  print your iPhone at home.  And then we'll be right  back to what we're watching now.  And you'll be going but I could  send the iPhone under the water.  It's awesome. We'll send it under the water  and they'll be people like there's still great uses  for faxes.  You'll have one bank  out there that will still demand  that you send them  your signature through pneumatic undersea  tube. That's what he's going to cause  us to have.  Okay so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pneumatic tubes are a  mass distribution.  So they're port to  port and then drones are probably  a last mile thing. So that makes  more sense. So we'll have all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of the above. I just hope we have garage  size replicators so we just make everything  in our garage. Well did you see the  teleporting story this week?  But that was one photon.  There's a long way to go from there. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But explain that to me. Was it the actual  photon? How did that happen? When two photons

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  love each other very much they become  entangled. And then no  matter how far away one  of the photons is from the other  they think and act as  if they are one  unit. And the  government is trying to advance the ability for  those photons to marry and it's  not right. I believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in my heart of hearts that we are going to  find out that this whole thing  is bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny, Danny, get a job. Get a job.  I'm just saying  Gene Roddenberry clearly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  came from the future and somehow  was stranded in the past.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you can say  quantum entanglement  and  teleportation  but how do  they know it was the same photon?  That's what I'm asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all in the article. They all know.  I don't know. It's science stuff.  I'm going to understand it. Actually  that was one of the things I'm like. I read that article  and I thought, see if only I had some  time to write an article explaining  what this article is trying to say.  Those are my two big goals.  In my life, my future. You want to know my plans?  My plans are to explain how artificial  intelligence actually understands things  and to explain how quantum  entanglement works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All you have to do is ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was published earlier than July 4th.  This was a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a big one.  This is a space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, satellite quantum.  I swear to God I read this because  I am like Danny, fascinated by this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish I knew enough to understand it.  This work establishes the first...  Yeah, June 15th in Science Magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  China's quantum satellite achieves  spooky action at a record distance.  Oh, that's spooky action.  That's different.  No.  It's the same study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spooky action is not teleportation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Teleportation isn't teleportation.  Yes, this is quantum entanglement  among the two photons, one from the satellite.  See, they didn't mention

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  two photons.  This is a journalism issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said that in the very beginning.  I said when two photons love each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you say teleportation,  my impression is  that one photon is taken and put in a...  Spooky! That's different.  That's a photon  interacting with a photon at  distance, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so the issue that...  What they did here was send it further  because we have done the entanglement experiment  before. So we've done it in the same room.  We've done it from room to room.  What they've done is much like  light and fiber optics.  Yes.  You had to have repeaters to say  to re-up your signal.  What they did is they sent this  photo, these entangled photons, or  they sent it further  without a repeater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be better to say this is communication  than teleportation.  Because that's really what it is. It's sending data  from point A to point B without being  anywhere in between, which is a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is journalism  trying to make something really  esoteric interesting to more people.  This is like when we say we've invented an invisible  cloak when we say we figured out how to  refract light beams.  Which is still pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, we have an invisible cloak?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, Google invisible cloak. You'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should wear it to Comic-Con.  God!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've done too much.  But I am wearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a cloak to Comic-Con and it's pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good news! I don't believe  them, but Google says the alo  desktop client is coming.  It's about as likely as an invisible  cloak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just what we've been waiting for.  I'm going to tell all my friends on Google  Plus about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they just would turn on  SMS integration, then they'd  be done.  Just go back

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and fix Google Voice, which was wonderful.  Or make Gmail  your universal thing.  Pick one!  Launch an app called Google Messenger  because everybody else  can have generic names.  And combine all the stuff into one thing!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  Now this one's a little upsetting,  but it is from the Wall Street Journal.  So I'm going to let Jeff explain it.  According to the Wall Street Journal,  Google has been paying  professors, did you get any of this money,  Jeff? $500,000 to $400,000  for research  supporting their business practices.  I'm going to log in to get us  past the paywall here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's Media Media.  Or they close that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh really? There's a backdoor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh there was.  They just shut it down and then everybody got upset.  It used to be called Media Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you just enter Media as the login and Media as the password?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't know that. So then all these people  have gotten upset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been paying $149 a year.  Is that all?  Yeah, it's not expensive. As long as you get the paper paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Or you pay a total of what?  You just say, okay I don't need it.  And they go, oh no no.  We still want to continue to send you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We charge you more if you don't get the paper paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they're ripping off the advertisers.  See, we have circulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they're telling the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  advertisers that they still have people  reading every single one of those ads in a print  paper. And so it's therefore worth the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The myth of mass media,  as I always tell my students, is that all readers  see all ads, so we charge all advertisers  for all readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, put a pin in that because I do want to talk about that  because there's a move afoot in the podcast  industry to do exactly that.  And it scares the crap out of me.  But I want to get back to this  paying professors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the one example I read  was that the guy didn't disclose.  That's bad. That's wrong.  But Google is  like Bell Labs of the age.  They're paying lots of people to do lots of kinds of  research. Now how much of it is aimed at their  lobbying and how much of it  is scientific research and how much has benefit  in other ways? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fact that a big  company is doing this isn't surprising.  Coca-Cola sponsors  studies to show that drinking  high fructose corn syrup  is fine. It's good  for your health. I mean, we've seen this  for years. But we thought a little  better of Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, I'm not sure that  don't forget Google does  support academic research and scientific  research. So there  may be a few examples in here. But what's the  what's the and I couldn't see the list.  I don't know what the list is because I don't subscribe  to the journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll read the quote. Google has paid professors whose  papers, for instance, declared that the collection of consumer  data was a fair exchange for its free  services that the company  didn't use its market dominance to improperly  steer users to Google's commercial  sites or its advertisers.  This is for the EU decision, obviously,  and that it hasn't unfairly  quashed competitors. Several papers argued  that Google's search engine should be allowed  to link to books and other intellectual property  that authors and publishers said should be paid for.  A group that includes News Corp,  which owns the journal.  News Corp formally complained to European regulators  about Google's handling of news.  Oh, there's the  so  we know Rupert hates Google.  Yep.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I consider the  piece. Yeah.  Oh, yeah. I'm not saying that there aren't some  papers that are illogic. I'm not saying  that professors who don't reveal the funding  are wrong, but  I come at anything from  Murdoch land about technology  with a grain of salt the size of Utah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And the only  professors I'm looking for names  they got one guy who said, no,  I wouldn't take that money.  I'm trying to find these here.  And they also, to be fair,  point out that Qualcomm,  Verizon and AT&T do the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing. And I thought Google's response  on their blog was actually very good.  They're like,  yeah, we spend money.  And guess what? We list all the people  that we do. You can find it here. Unlike  our competitors.  And  I guess the research  firm that did all this research,  but nobody knows who funds them.  So  they had a good pushback on it.  But you know, the end narrative  will still be that Google gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  paid money because nobody can read the  article. They can only read the headline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of  attacks on tech companies  a couple weeks ago, Danny, you did the best  response to what I thought was a very  irresponsible and sensationalistic,  oddly enough, ProPublica  Facebook attack on their training  for  site monitors.  Remember that?  That Google doesn't protect  young black people.  Oh, that was Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ProPublica has done two different things  that have ticked me off. One was  Facebook is allowing racist ads  or blacklisting,  which they weren't doing at all.  And they didn't do.  And then the other thing was something I was really,  really upset about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you were so right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Clearly I've calmed down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because he doesn't remember it.  It said that the censorship rules favored  hate speech from white men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yes. Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I got him mad again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's rolling again.  No, I got to find  I got your tweet.  Bring my tweet.  What did I say my alternative headline was?  Yeah, see the alternative headline?  I was like Facebook's secret sensitive rules  protect Muslim migrants, but not Irish teens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they didn't write it that way.  It was a logic exercise  of saying you have to have two categories  to go into protected.  So black  teens was an example of teens  are protected, blacks are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ProPublica has done this  twice and they've really ticked me off  with it because I have a lot of respect for  the work that they generally do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And only when she was at  this one when she was at the journal,  she did the whole Oh, my God,  what they know what they know thing against  against Google and Facebook.  A lot of that stuff was really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And she did good work with  that very valuable stuff.  People didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was also a lot of fear,  migraine and scare stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These two things that have really annoyed me have  been because they've taken  a grain of something and  twisted it to  get the maximum amount of outrage.  And I have to say that's probably  the goal. And with Facebook, it caused  them to change policies that potentially could  have been abused, but that they didn't show  any evidence were being abused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, in the article, Angwin  says, so  earlier this month, a US congressman  posted on Facebook  that we  should slaughter radicalized Muslims,  hunt them, identify them and kill them.  This is Clay Higgins from Louisiana.  Kill them all for the sake of all that is good  and righteous. Kill them all.  That was left up.  But when a Boston poet and  Black Lives Matter activist  Dee Dee Delgado  tweeted, all white people are racist.  Start from this reference point or you've already  failed. That was removed and her  account was disabled for seven days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to be clear here, I'm not going to defend the system  of Facebook. I'm not going to say that it's  faultless. It's not.  The example she used to try to show  that it was systemic rather than stupid  was sensationalistic and wrong.  That's my point. Now Facebook messes up.  Witness the Nippon photo.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They usually fix it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that the point? And their rules on where they censor  it. Like part of, from  my understanding, and I  dealt with this years ago  with Google when I was trying to understand why they  would remove things from autosuggest or they wouldn't.  They would get all tangled  up with like, well, we do it for protected groups,  but not for unprotected groups.  And then you would start to get in.  And I'm not a civil rights  and civil protection expert.  But from what I was understanding  is that you would have protections  under US law for  protected groups, meaning groups that  are being targeted or that  need it. So like, for example, you might  have laws that would protect discrimination against  women, but you wouldn't have laws  that would protect discrimination  against like a 19-year-old or something  like that. It is all  like, it is confusing and it looks like  they evolved their own rules to try  to start off this way and then they started adding more  things. And I really want them  to just have, like we used to have this thing  on our sites we called the common sense  commenting policy. And it was like  we will remove anything that  common sense tells you  you shouldn't have said or shouldn't have  done. Right? It's a common decency.  So, you know, you want to have a polite discussion  with someone? Great. You do something  and we think that people would use  their common sense to say, yeah, you went over the line there,  we'll pull it out. And  it's hard because it's really easy  for us to sit back and criticize  what they should have pulled this and then what  they shouldn't have pulled that. And  that story certainly had lots of stuff  in it where you're like, yeah, why  are you doing things inconsistently?  But what annoyed me the worst was  their headline, which is all  that a lot of people would see, gave  the impression that  what was their headline again?  That their policy  was designed to protect  white men, which it was  not any more than their policy.  It's based on this.  Their policy rules were not all  were, it makes it sound like they're designed to protect  white men, not black children.  But they also protect  black men, not white children.  Or they also protect Muslim  immigrants, but not  white teenage Irish  kids or whatever. It's like because you can  pick and choose whatever thing combination  you want. But people certainly took  away from that what I think they wanted  to take away, what ProPublica wanted to take  away, which the outrage thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was part of it, and we talked a lot about it when  it was leaked out, the Facebook rules  for its  censors. And if you take any  piece of it out, it  does seem kind of nonsensical. It's a very  difficult job. It's hard to  make rules that will make  a lot of sense, although this is the rule that  Angwin particularly quotes that  gave her rise to the headlines.  It was a quiz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that was the other thing that ticked me off.  It was like, it's a stupid  quiz when you look at it in that context.  But if you think about  it the way that you've typically taken tests  where you're trying to  you're trying to see if you catch  someone out on it or whatever,  you would immediately think most people would  then say, oh, I'll show you the white man.  Well, we're not going to protect that. And you're like, no,  we would because of these rules.  And you need to understand those rules so that you can  also protect black men. You can  also attack Asian men and Hispanic  men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's misrepresentative to just look at this out of  context because the question  really is to say, do we  do subsets of larger groups?  No, we don't do subsets, female  drivers or black children, but we would  do black people or  women. So that's what  but out of context, this doesn't  make this looks bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is bad journalism  and it was irresponsible and it continues  this war on  the tech companies. And Julie's  a very smart person and a very good journalist, but  I've had this problem with her when she was the journal and I have a problem  with her when she's at ProPublica  is that it's just attacking the tech companies for the sake  of attacking them. This is a hard one though.  I agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with you both that this is a challenging article,  but how is a normal  person to read this  and understand that it's misrepresentative?  I don't know if that's obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny's Facebook post  did an excellent job of  explaining what was wrong with this article.  Like I said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm too  I think they're doing good work  and they're highlighting important issues.  They're not the way I would have done it.  ProPublica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I probably would have done it in a way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that I would have tried to figure out to identify the issue  in a way that wasn't just  designed to stroke outrage, but having  said that, they were successful in getting  Facebook to change policy probably  faster than they would have on the earlier  thing, even though they didn't demonstrate  there was a problem, they just demonstrated there was potential  of a problem. And I  think that they will probably be as effective  with this, that Facebook will make some needed  changes. And they do need to make  changes. There's valuable stuff  in there. I just  I don't like the idea that they  did it in a way to present it as if  Facebook was somehow, and I saw many  many people tweet this, that Facebook was being  racist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, and that's the other damage that  happens, because if you read the ProPublica  article, you might have been able to get  some nuance out of it. But all the  articles that rehashed  the ProPublica article took all the nuance  out and just basically said Facebook's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  racist. Which is exactly what they knew would happen.  And again, I think ProPublica is  great. I admire the hell out of them, but  this was an attack job.  You think this is advocacy then?  Yeah, generally I'm looking for advocacy too, but  I wanted to be intellectually  honest. This was intellectually dishonest.  That's my problem with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the headline was intellectually  dishonest. I don't necessarily, I think  it was probably just to get clicks.  I mean, having...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not ProPublica, because their model isn't to  do that, Stacey. That's the problem.  So, wait,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because this has happened to me a lot.  Getting clicks  isn't, it's not just for  ad revenue, it's so people actually read  your stuff. So, I have  the worst headline writer  in the entire world. It is really  sad, but I feel like a lot  of my stories are important. So, I would  go to people and I'd say, hey, can you sex  this headline up for me? Because  I would like for people to actually  read it.  I think  ProPublica  probably subscribes to that, and  they probably went too far in this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Generally, they are the  cream of the cream of responsible  journalism. This  was intellectually  irresponsible. That's all.  So, Danny, I wanted to thank you  for expressing it. You know, the problem is,  let's be clear here, I run  or I started the News Integrity Initiative,  which got money from Facebook. So, my  ability, I know, is limited now  to say this was unfair to Facebook.  I probably would have anyway, and it was also very  hard to explain, and Danny just did a far better  job simply of explaining it. To your  point, Leo, how would you explain this?  Danny did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Call Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think it's hard. I admire  you guys because you're journalists.  And  it's one of those,  it's like being  a monk. You have to  constantly push yourself  to truth  and kind of avoid the winds  that are pushing you towards  trying to generate traffic for good  reasons. Like, I just want people to read my work.  Not necessarily for monetary  reasons. But that's  a hard thing to do. It requires some real  dedication to say, I want to  express the truth in a way that everybody  can understand it and not misrepresent it.  And the people don't feel  ripped off for having clicked.  And sometimes people fail  at this. You know?  It's probably a very, very  difficult thing to do. I know.  I know it's certainly always in the back of my  mind. Am I misrepresenting this?  I want to represent  the story as best I can.  As accurately as I can.  It's hard to do. Certainly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very interesting. I'm not a big fan of  paywalls, and I don't think that's the solution to everything.  But I talked to The Telegraph  and The Guardian in London a couple  months ago where they're each trying to convert  people into giving them money.  Telegraph for premium content.  Not a pure paywall, just some stuff as premium.  And Guardian for contributions,  otherwise known as begging.  They both entered into a content  reduction scheme.  Before, in a volume based business, you had  to have more and more and more content, more stories, more headlines,  more this, more that.  And you got people who came by once and never  came back. It wasn't the basis of a business.  So now, they're trying to  by reducing the quantity, they increase the quality.  So funny.  I learned that lesson a long time ago, and I don't even have a paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did that at GigaOM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I will say, the information  does that, right? That was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do that very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they have since launched  an aggregation newsletter.  Because you still have to have  all of it. I mean, we fought this,  we dealt with this every,  not every day, but every quarter  at GigaOM when we were like,  how many stories?  What quality should they be?  How much time? Because like,  you could spend forever  reporting out something really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're talking about this briefing thing that they do now?  Yes.  This is still, I have to say, they pick what, five articles?  It's not, well, actually,  it's more than that now, but it's not a lot.  I mean, they still kind of boil it down a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm not saying it's bad.  I'm just saying that we're still trying to figure out  the model for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we struggled with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We launched a bunch of shows and realized that  that wasn't adding to our value.  And have cut back quite a bit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then, of course, you had the other thing  that happened this week with  the  newspapers wanting to band together  against Google and Facebook.  But that's for negotiating. Let's talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Give me the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they tried  to do this a few years ago and they've come back at it.  And basically, they said,  look, we're going to lobby Congress  that we should be excluded from antitrust  rules of colluding with each other  because we need to be able  to do that in order to get all the money  that Google and Facebook have stolen away from us.  It's rightfully ours because  apparently, somehow, they were all  supposed to be entitled to all the digital  ad revenue. They don't have  any plan. They don't have any specifics  about how they would collude.  There's no idea about what it is  that they think.  I don't know. I guess if they all get together,  maybe they can then say to Facebook,  you can't send us  traffic anymore or we'll  block your links or something.  They don't know what they want to do.  They just want to get together and they somehow think.  But, you know, it's  been effective in the sense that in Europe,  they get together more often  and then Google throws  tens of millions here  or 20 million there for some innovation thing.  Aren't they

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mostly interested in  just getting a good deal?  Facebook's talking now about charging  people for content.  Aren't they interested in just getting a good deal  when their stuff is on Facebook?  But what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the good deal? That's the problem.  I don't know what they  want to negotiate for what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Axios has a good summary of this.  I linked to the Axios post in my piece.  Axios does a very good job,  by the way, of cutting things down to the essence.  So they ask for four things.  Yeah, I think I had issues with that, but go on.  All right, four things. One is  increase advertising revenue sharing.  Negotiation. So we're going to go to the government  and we're going to get the passed laws against you.  We're going to do nasty things unless you increase  the rev share to us.  Number two, create more support for new subscription models,  which they, in fact, Facebook  and Google are doing.  Number three, improve data sharing,  which I agree with.  And number four, better brand support.  Well, that's also coming down the pike.  So really what they're doing is they're trying to  create a cartel here to get tough.  Now, meanwhile, in France this week,  there were also two  new things announced. I'm forgetting the name  of them suddenly. They're basically  anti-trust.  It brought together all the publishers  to create new ad networks so that  they can get almost as big a  population as  a big audience. They're called Gravity  and Skyline, and they're two  big French ad networks.  That requires  an excuse from anti-trust.  But if you've got to create your own  competitor to Google, I'm cool with that.  But this idea that Google is evil  and bad and they should give us the money we used to have.  No, Google gives advertisers a better  deal.  And the problem is they constantly expect Google and  Facebook to change when the publishers refuse to change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Publishers are really slow  to change. Good Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know who else is slow to change?  Real estate  appraisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was waiting. I was like, tell me more about your segue  leave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is from Axis.  I just saw this as I was scrolling by trying to  find the article you were talking about, Jeff.  Apparently, real estate appraisers  are worried because  computers do a better job. Zillow is getting  so good at appraising home value  there's not much need for appraisers  which is a nice, you know, solid middle class  profession. Requires a four-year  degree, lots of experience.  Pays 40% more per hour than the  median job. But  in a newsletter, Brian Weaver  wrote, the future for appraisers specializing  in residential mortgage work is coming  to an end. No bang,  not even a whimper.  So they're looking also to change government  regulation to protect them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Agents also can't stand Zillow because  it's a case that customers are experts now.  Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so Zillow, I felt like they had  hold on.  There are some, was it a study?  But they were talking about the appraisals  on Zillow, like a good  hunk of them.  Like 30% were like way off.  So their bell curve was not a true  bell curve. So  I think,  and I can't remember the details  so I'm trying to look this  up.  To figure out like,  oh, oh that's a real  estate company. I'm not going to click on  that because that is not, that is  probably not unbiased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They might have an opinion on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe it was a lawsuit. Let's see.  Z...  Oh, it is a lawsuit.  That's what I was reading about. So it's a  lawsuit filed by  suburban Chicago home builders  against Zillow  on their appraisals.  And  that's kind of interesting.  So actually if this lawsuit goes  anywhere, maybe we'll see kind of some real  research. So  let's see.  This is a market watch story.  Zillow's estimates mislead home buyers.  Lawsuit claims yes.  I don't know how you can get the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  courts to enforce that. That's  interesting. Yeah, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but maybe they're after it because holy  cow, this is our jobs.  This is a common thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter's hired a new chief financial  officer.  Ned Seagal.  Do we care? I don't know. Does it  matter? They're slowly filling the chairs  in the C-suite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like I'm Dvorak right now.  No, don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Move on. Is that news?  No, it's not news. Who cares?  Who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's see. There was something. Let me, I'm scrolling  through here trying to figure out because there was something I was  excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Galaxy Note 8 might even  launch as early as August 23rd.  I bet you the Pixel and the Note 8 come out  late August because honestly  once they've got to distance  themselves from the iPhone launch. We were talking about this earlier.  So I wouldn't be surprised if they move that  release up.  Well, you can get the Note 7  fan edition now.  I think, is it  Korea?  It's very limited. And I don't know  when they say fan, do they mean a cooling fan  or do they mean you're a fan of the product? I'm not sure  which. But it's refurbished  Note 7s.  The Note 7 was a nice phone but I  haven't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, I hear it has a little tiny fire extinguisher on the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fan edition.  So did anybody buy  anything on Prime Day?  Oh, I did, I did, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Stacey, what did you buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bought another Amazon Echo because unlike  Leo, the Google  show, or the Google show, the Echo  show is not something  that my husband really loves having in our  house. He finds it doesn't work as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, the show is...  Oh, you already had one and tried it and he doesn't like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dude, we talked on it, Leo.  Alright, so you sent it back?  No, I've got it in my office. I'm going to move it to the  office when the Echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  comes tomorrow. You got the black  too, but it is a big discount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was $90. It was a great price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got it too. I've never had  an Echo, so I got one.  It's about time, Jeffrey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Welcome to the world, Jeff. I have all kinds of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for you. The dot was even cheaper. What was the  dot? $35?  Oh, look, Jeff's got a Google Home.  That was the best-selling product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which is no surprise  because virtually any  category you went into for Prime  would be like...  Don't you want to buy a dot?  Homeware, dot.  Bathroom supplies, dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Clothing.  I did not buy an instant pot.  It was close. I almost bought an instant pot.  I love my instant pot.  I have a Breville fast slow cooker.  It's the same thing. I don't need an instant pot.  That just shows you...  Yeah, but I could do both.  I got slow cook and it's a pressure cooker.  I can also fast cook because it can brown.  It does everything.  I don't need an instant pot, but that just shows you the  power of Prime Day.  I almost bought one. Instead, I bought a  sous vide setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I spent probably an hour going through  page after page after page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was nothing. No. Very little.  If it wasn't an Amazon appliance,  it's not a great deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your publication, and I like saying  publication, Stacey, because you've been writing  for the Wirecutter.  Every year does an analysis of  Prime Day. I'm trying to find their  analysis this year. It was pathetic.  The number of deals, 25,000.  The number of actual  savings deals, here it is, the best  deals of the day. After scanning  thousands of Prime  deals,  I think several hundred  were good out of the tens of thousands

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  offered. What was good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The best Mr. Coffee's Optimal Brew  10 Cup Cheap Coffee Maker runner up.  See why, you know, you really  got to be in the market for that. The Nvidia shield,  that would be good.  See, it's $200 normally.  I don't know what it was on Prime Day,  but I like the shield. I'd recommend that.  Google Home and Chromecast  streaming, refurbished Roku stick,  don't recommend it.  Tile Bluetooth tracker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that was half off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon.  The logo's blocking you now.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Amazon sold 60%  more.  It was the biggest sales day in its  history, up 60% over 2016.  So even if the deals sucked,  people still were like,  yeah, Prime Day, which, by the way,  y'all, also Slurpee Day at  7-Eleven.  Free Slurpees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a tough choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite tweet of the day yesterday  was bemoaned that Prime Day  has now become so commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to assume that was sarcasm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It used to be  a deeply religious holiday,  and now it's just about buying stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, that was the best one from last year. Someone said  I remember  when Prime Day was a celebration,  a transformer of Optimus Prime.  Oh, that Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  deals scanned of the  wire cutters said only 64  were a good deal.  Wow.  So in fact, some things cost more on Prime Day.  They actually  raised the price on Prime Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I did go looking for the  Putin Trump  gold phone on Prime Day, and I was  disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about that last week. Boy, was that a beaut.  Didn't we? We talked about that  last week, right? Did we? I don't think we talked about that.  We talked about it on Twitter.  This was a beautiful phone made by  a Russian  it was a Nokia 3310, so  don't laugh at it. That's a modern phone.  Well, it's not a smart phone.  It's modern. And  look at that. It has a metal symbolizing  the G20 Summit  between Vladimir Putin and our  president. There they are featured  in profile on a gold coin  with lovely gray  gold accents.  And it's only  twenty five hundred bucks.  But I bet you'll be able to get it cheaper  soon. Somehow.  Somehow, I think. Maybe not.  That could be quite a memento someday.  Okay.  Okay.  You know, anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You wouldn't show, you know,  porn stars support net neutrality.  So, you know, that's my best I had to offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was as good as it gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the world's tiniest  Google  Street View car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was cute. It's cute. It's very cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a real one.  Well, no one has a camera on it.  Oh, it does? I thought it was  just a model in a  in a Neuschwanstein  castle there.  How do you pronounce  that? Ne-shwan-stein  Neuschwanstein.  That's a crazy  Ludwig's castle in Bavaria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's obviously not real. Sorry.  I get this point. I thought it was the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  giant fingers are the giveaway there, Jeff.  But it's cute. Oh, yeah.  It's adorable. The Germans love these

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  things. The Germans are filing suits against Google  because of this. Violating the little plastic  people's privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be so  great.  Google has not asked for the permission  of these small miniature people to have  on the street test  and we have filed a lawsuit  against them. Sorry, I went on French, I guess.  I don't know. I can't do accents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And no wonder the Europeans  hate us.  Best Buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fuzzy. I don't know what the hell  happened, but as soon as I said that my broadband  was great, it just cracked out

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on me. Yeah.  Happy Net Neutrality Day there, Danny.  It's fine on my phone, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On my laptop.  Everything on my desktop has come  to a grinding halt. I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I didn't realize this, but Amazon is building  a competitor to the geek squad,  Best Buy's  repair service. Oh, yeah.  Look at the graph. This is Best Buy's stock  price. That announcement comes out  bow like a  cliff.  Best Buy lost a billion dollars in market  value. And by the way, I'm amazed Best Buy  has a billion dollars to lose  in market value.  Kevin Toll is still, actually, he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going less. I was going to say he used to go to Best  Buy all the time. Used to.  Well, even like  up to like six months ago. Did Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  talk on your show about his  announcement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We didn't talk on the show about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I won't say anything until  we get him on. Just as I didn't mention  anything about Danny Sullivan's announcement.  But Kevin apparently has moved on from Google  and we'll get him on.  Now we can get him on because he's not at Google anymore.  We can get him on. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I talked about that this morning. We'd love to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good. That'd be great.  Because we weren't allowed to talk to  him while he was. He wasn't  a staff employee. He was a consultant  there, right? He was a consultant.  But

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I told him actually, because I'm  going to go on vacation. And I was like,  Kevin, you could just be me. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin, can you leave the dress?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he could wear his

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  beetle shirt. Oh, yeah. He's a dog.  He's a serious beetle guy.  Yes. When are you going on vacation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometime in a couple of weeks. Seattle.  Oh, how fun.  I was going to do at least one show from Seattle.  Yeah, you must. If you can. One day I'm going to  be whale watching. So whoo whoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fun. So you're not going to be doing any work  no conferences or anything up there? Just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No work.  I might do office hours. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  office hours.  That's the problem when you own your own business. You can never really  take any time off.  We talked about it yesterday  on security now.  Steve Gibson was fairly upset. I am  too. W3C  the World Wide Web Consortium, which was  created and run by Tim Berners-Lee  and others. But Tim, of course, the inventor  of the World Wide Web probably has a pretty  big voice there. They've been debating  back and forth, adding extensions to  the web specification  for HTML5  extensions that would enable  copy protection.  And they have  decided to do it, although it is  currently open for comments.  So maybe if everybody  everybody said no, don't do  it. The encrypted media extensions  would let content providers encrypt and protect  audio and video content  within their plug-in free  HTML and JavaScript applications. The way you have to  do it right now, of course, if you're going to watch Netflix,  you have to download special stuff.  Otherwise you can't because they can't  protect the content.  I think that Tim Berners-Lee's feeling  was, well,  we've got to do it because otherwise  the world is  fragmented with all these web plug-ins.  But the Electronik  Foundation and many others  didn't like this idea,  in particular because  it would prevent  thanks to the DMCA,  prevent researchers  from examining how they work  looking for security issues.  Tim wasn't even willing to  allow a little  bit of that.  So, and  anyway, it's a bit of a controversy.  No compromise  was allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish Kevin Marx was here  because I sit there  and I feel like  this kind of controversy makes me,  I don't know, long for the original  days of the early web.  But the web is broken.  It has been broken since we introduced  mobile everywhere.  Flash exists because of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why Flash exists.  One of the reasons is for copy protection  and silverlight.  So they don't want that. They want to get rid of those days.  Everything's HTML5.  I can understand that point.  I just, I'm like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like the open web has died  and we should...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So many things have died, Stacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mourn it and move on and accept,  but Kevin would disagree with me.  No, he wants to save it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He would have a lot to say about this.  Steve had a lot to say about it.  We'll leave you...  To go look that up.  Exactly.  So one of the things that's going on right now,  a couple of weeks ago,  Apple's iTunes, Apple announced  that it was going to keep track of  how much of a podcast  people listen to.  Uh-oh.  And now the IAB,  the Interactive Advertising Bureau,  is contemplating rules  to encourage all podcast  players to keep track of this  information because advertisers would very  much like to know, not merely  if you downloaded it, but how much of it you listen to.  Now this is, of course, information  they can't get from magazines,  they can't get from newspapers, you know,  that's all they can find out.  And how could they get a podcast that are downloaded?  Well, and this is my problem.  iTunes can do it because you use iTunes to listen.  You would have to use software  that enabled it and the IAB is hoping that all  the manufacturers of podcast apps  will start building in  this approved system.  And I certainly hope not, and I know  our listeners don't like the idea  that people would be keeping track of their listening habits.  However,  it would be, I think it would be bad for podcasting  because  inevitably it would drive rates down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we know people don't listen.  Right.  Well, you know the number of people who listen  is somewhat lower than the number of people who download.  It could be a lot lower. We don't know.  And now I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the case of Twitter, you also have the poor  prisoner listeners, the wives  listening next to the geek husbands in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's all sorts of problems with it.  If, you know...  Or the opposite.  We have a lot of listeners who don't believe  in tracking and will seek out  ways to listen that isn't tracked.  So we'll have a disproportionate number of listeners  who aren't counted. There's all sorts of  problems with it. The real problem is  that, and I knew this would happen two years ago.  Remember, everybody was all excited about  podcast. They're back. It's a renaissance.  Mostly because big name  brands like NPR  started doing really well with their podcasts.  And then, of course, advertisers  discover podcasts. And then as soon as there's  money, then all of this  starts. And it's the corporatization  of what has been  up to now a very free-wheeling  and relaxed medium.  I hope it doesn't continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The nice thing is, and this will be  a question of business  models, is can you,  with this data that  advertisers will seek,  can you engage your audience  or get them other ways? I know  that giving user access  codes actually is fairly successful  because doesn't Blue Apron have an entire  strategy around that? Yeah, well, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the point is our advertisers, and  most podcast advertisers do what's called direct  response advertising where you go  to blueapron.com slash twig  and they count that.  But ultimately, all advertisers really  care about is, well, we bought  $10,000 of ads and we generated  $20,000 worth of new business. That was  worth it. That's really all  that matters. This other stuff  is kind of messy  because  it might lead them to  say, well, we only want to pay $5,000  for those $20,000 worth  of results. We produce good  results. Our advertisers wouldn't come back.  But this would be used to  drive prices down. Actually, I'm not  worried for us so much, but it will  hurt young new podcasts  who don't have the kind of  audience and advertising success  that we do.  We'll be  fine. I don't think it would affect us at all. We can prove  that we work. People make money off  the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. I'd like most of, like, only  I want to say 60 something percent  of my audience doesn't  use iTunes, which I find surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's part of the problem.  Ours is less than half.  It's bad for podcasts like ours  with sophisticated listeners. It's good for podcasts  like Serial, where it's mostly  iTunes because they brought in a lot  of new listeners. Apple's numbers  will be more accurate for them.  But Apple's numbers really won't reflect  your listenership or mine.  I know nobody really cares  about this, but we mentioned, put a pin in it.  But you and I. We care  because we're trying to make a living doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I got gadgets to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gotta buy some gadgets.  And the truth is, the truth is  that the advertisers have already made their own  discounts for this. Oh, yeah.  So it's not as if  this has been the case for  years and years and years.  I go back to the myth of mass media.  The myth of mass media is class.  Is that all readers see all ads, so we  charge all advertisers for all readers.  It was beautiful while it lasted, and that's why you needed  to audit the  circulation of a publication.  But TV Guide was seen  to have two readers per copy.  People had eight readers per  copy in the syndicated research.  Eight readers.  Read every copy of people, and that's what  they charged the advertisers for in the audience.  Advertisers knew that was BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I understand why advertisers  would like better numbers.  They always want more data.  Because it also discounts it for them.  That's the main thing. I fear that they'll  use that to discount it. We've got  a nice little thing going here. They're happy, we're  happy. Let's not add facts  to the issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this is the challenge  of increasing data across  all businesses. We're going to see this  everywhere. I call it  the end of the deal, but in some ways,  it's just  a matter of time. Are you ready for  information liquidity?  Is that Andrew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello? That was Andrew. He looks good in shorts.  That's a good looking man.  Andrew, come back!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shouldn't he have been crawling  on the floor to pull somebody out?  Missed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  opportunity.  He may not want to be introduced.  He's cute. That was cute.  That was a nice little camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we want to meet Andrew.  Come here, Andrew.  There's the lucky man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello? He looks every bit as  sweet and kind as you've said many times  over and over on this show.  They're saying nice things about you.  He doesn't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's nice.  She can stay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We won't fight with the dogs. This very much is like  that BBC guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was bringing  in something, the iPhone.  We found it in my daughter's backpack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, really? Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff's kids grew up  before the phone.  Facebook's going to sell  advertising inside Messenger. Are you  happy? Are you happy now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of people use that. I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a big wump of money  is going to fall to them right off the bat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to give Facebook  some credit and Instagram, their  subsidiary brand, some credit.  Those ads work.  I find myself buying a lot of stuff from Facebook and  Instagram, whereas a lot  of the ads I see on other places,  I don't even see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got an ad from Google yesterday  on Facebook offering me a special offer.  I could get Google Home for  only $99  on Prime Day.  I did only because I'm like, wow,  Google decided they need to  advertise on Facebook. Isn't that interesting?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other thing, Leo, is that we did a study  at CUNY together with  Contently where we  looked at proper labeling of advertisers  and the label that  most works, that most people  most understand is  sponsored. It's the label that Facebook  has trained us to do. So people understood  what an ad was on Facebook better  than on media sites. I'm very encouraged

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  by the fact that  people are starting to understand that it's okay  to label an ad and  it's not okay not to. My son,  my 22-year-old son, said it's skeezy.  So Snapchat ads,  all that native content, it's skeezy. I don't  like it. He knows the difference.  People know the difference. I also saw a study  that—Skeezy or skeevy?  Skeevy or skeezy. I don't know what the exact  consonant is in the middle there.  And then he  I also saw a study that said  that when you use sex in advertising,  it is  counterproductive that people  remember it but they don't remember the brand  and when they do remember  their brand, they think less highly  of it because you've played the sexy  card. And I was very encouraged  by both of those facts.  Me too. People  consumers know the difference. And I think  that's why Facebook and Instagram  works. Every tenth Instagram post,  there's an ad. You know it's an ad. It's  clearly labeled as an ad. You can scroll by  it. There's not a thousand ads.  There's one. I think that works  very well. It's very effective.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it just me?  Maybe it's just me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it is good.  If people are getting—although it's interesting because  on the one hand, you have people getting savvier  about when they're being manipulated and yet you still  have surveys that say people don't recognize what ads  are. You know.  You would see that all the time  with the search results. Like, well, I don't know that that was an ad.  I didn't recognize that was an ad. But then again,  those are a little harder to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those are the professors Google didn't pay.  Exactly.  Exactly.  So when's Microsoft paid?  All right. I think we can move on.  Unless you guys have anything I've left out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just one curiosity.  What does  Steven you think of  Kaspersky Labs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, it's ironic. John C. Dvorak used to recommend  Kaspersky all the time.  I mean, like, that was his favorite  anti-virus company.  I was never a big fan because Kaspersky  held on longer than anybody  to this idea that you could use  a virus definition file and  scan for strings and that would be enough.  They were the slowest to adopt  more advanced technologies.  And now I think it's become clear  that Kaspersky's been working  with Russian intelligence. In fact,  didn't Congress  just say that  you couldn't who can't use Kaspersky  anymore in their  in their some government purchases?  I can't remember what the story was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've met Eugene Kaspersky and Davos.  What do you think?  Nice guy. I think he knows the stuff about  strategy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. Sorry.  Kaspersky says it's a  pawn in the U.S. Russia  geopolitical game.  But the United States is  banned.  The GSA has banned  Kaspersky Labs anti-virus  software from  U.S. government systems and networks  because of the concern of espionage.  Not that the anti-virus  doesn't work, but that it might be bearing other  malware loads.  It works fine for Donald Trump Jr.  Kaspersky Lab  has no ties to any government.  And the company has never helped  any government in the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with its savior  Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. Oh Leo's great.  The company is

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  being on just a world tour

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with Leo. Okay? Real quick.  Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The communication was misinterpreted  or manipulated.  France.  They regularly cooperate with  law enforcement agents. Israel.  I'm not going to do Israel. That's too risky.  No, I'm going to stop. Come on.  You're just making everybody crazy.  Although I have been tempted. You see  that the Waze app now allows you  to add custom voices  of your own voice if you want to your navigation.  Oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. Catching up to Tom Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, finally catching up to Tom Tom.  But could you add your own voice  with Tom Tom? I know you could add celebrity voices.  No, you have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, I have it in my drawer  because it's the only way for me to preserve my kids  saying turn right, turn left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so you could record your own. That's cool.  So I guess it's in the sound settings.  I haven't done it yet. What I'm going to try to  figure out is if  you can package them up and offer  them to other people because I'd love to  have Jeff Jarvis saying, what are you doing?  Always turn left.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Kind of good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd like that.  That'd be fun.  So when you go to voice, wouldn't that be fun?  Everything you do is a left turn.  Yes.  Turn left.  Turn left.  No right turns.  When you go into voice directions,  there's a new thing that says  record new voice.  And be extra clear  for safety. Don't be screwing around.  And then  it tells you what you should record.  There's quite a bit, right?  I'm waiting for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hope that this gets saved to the cloud  or somewhere so it stays with your settings  because that's a lot of work to set all those things up.  And you only have the murder mystery.  There's going to be a CSI

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  where somebody goes in and records  go right when it's really go left.  Well, actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had on my tom tom  a GLaDOS from the  game portal, the evil  computer, and she would always  tell you the wrong direction.  And then she'd say there's cake.  But you know, I mean, it was great. I love GLaDOS.  I thought I'd do it as a surfer dude.  All set. Let's go.  We're all set. Start  driving, man. Let's get started.  We could have some fun.  This is perfect for spouse annoyance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I enabled that on my Amazon  Echo because of I think it was like  the Finding Nemo ad thing.  You could get the surfer dude  to wake you up. It's like  hey, man, it's time to  get up. And my husband was like, Andrew,  he was very patient.  He turned to me and he said, never, never  do that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also had  Dennis Hopper on my tom tom. That was  kind of trippy.  Why would anyone want to  go here?  So  anyway, that's a nice feature now in  ways. Thank you. I wish we  this is what we need everything to do, right?  We should be able to record our own Echo voices and  Google Home voices and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  everything. I would I would love to  do. I've always wanted to do voiceover work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Beautiful voice. You have a very rich,  deep voice  and you would be great for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So a company  just raised 18 million dollars.  It's called Voice. I think it's Voices.com  to do voiceover work. And I gotta say  I'm very excited about it. Do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got a good microphone.  I do. Thank you. You could you could totally  do this.  And  yeah.  I'd be cautious about these.  There have been other things like this before  where you sign  up and do voice work and it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But well, there's there's a company called  Spoken Layer. Have you heard of them?  Very interesting company. I saw at  the Beta Works  Lab Day.  And I saw them  earlier. They're really good guys.  And they enable  the spoken web.  So a third of the news content on Google Home  is their platform.  And so they do some computer  voice, but a lot of human voice.  And so magazine articles,  all kinds of these companies can go to them.  And then they have a platform that, Stacey, you could go in  and you can get paid

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for doing the voicing. So there was an app  I used. I loved. Lisa and I both used  all the time called U-Mono  that had humans reading articles.  Same idea.  It went out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spoken Layer is doing this because it's B2B  to the companies.  And it's really interesting. Nice guys. Great guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you could, it says,  get on Echo Google Home  now. I'm going to find out more about  this. I would love to do this.  Oh, you can audition. Stacey, you can  audition.  So once your audio is ready,  you could either read Zelda  Breath of the Wild DLC review, North Korea  successfully test missiles  that could reach Alaska. I'll do that Russian.  North Korea

Transcript:  Businesses. I have some pet peeves.  I have definitely some pet peeves  about people. I won't name names,  but I just sometimes go crazy  when I hear some of the announces on various  places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other company you might like in your  devices is called Earplay.  What's that?  And a creative platform for publishing  interactive audio experiences.  And families, actually Stacy  Bellagess, they're finding  families like to do it with their kids. It's like the old  radio. But you know,  you stop and then say, well should they go left  or should they go to the right? Should they pick up the light for  not picking up the knife or whatever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Choose your own adventure via voice.  How fun is that? Really?  I find those very annoying. I hate it.  I don't like them either. I never liked that.  My husband liked them.  For what that's worth.  Oh, closet.  Sorry, ignore me. I'm setting up a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's coming back. Get ready.  You know what it indicates?  It's like the sick joke  cycle. There's a guy in  Berkeley, Alan Dundas, who's an expert, a  sociologist expert on this. Sick jokes  always reflect the deep malaise  we feel in a society  about a big topic. So there were dead baby  jokes when the abortion debate  was at its peak. There were  elephant in the refrigerator jokes when we were  dealing with racial bias.  And then people get sick  because we're dealing with  a Republican controlled  Congress, I don't know. Anyway,  it breaks down after a while.  OK, I'm going to move on. Yeah.  You freaking liberals, you're making me nuts.  Do you have an ad to do? I do, but I don't really  want to put it right up against that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is when trailers didn't actually have to have  anything but stills apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you know, I've just watched that.  I'm sorry, I got a spoiler. She watched it.  She gets to the end. She goes, I can't believe it ended that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like,  the movie's called The Way We Were,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not The Way We Are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody's saying that Brian Song is the one  you're trying to remember, Danny. Is that right,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brian Song? Yeah, well, Brian Song  is a good movie, too, but no,  it was like another woman who died.  It was like a love story ripoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google has  a victory  in the French court.  Google has spared  a $1.3 billion tax bill  because they don't,  Google Ireland does not have to have a permanent  establishment in France.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's going to be handy to pay off the EU  fine for anti-tramp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get some part of the way there.  Google did not illegally dodge French  taxes by routing sales in the country out of  Ireland, according to a Paris  administrative court today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And why is Bloomberg  hyphenating search engine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God, what is going on?  Danny, we need you back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need you back.  No, Danny, this is right. Danny,  two nouns that modify a third  noun are hyphenated.  Search engine giant  is proper use of hyphenation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that way?  That is proper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So then if they say search engine  If it had said

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  cell, space, phone,  giant, would they have hyphenated the cell phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what if they said  giant search engine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you said high school  player,  that would be hyphenated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, I just learned something. I did not know that.  But high isn't a noun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  High is the noun. High is the modifier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two words to modify the third.  It is an engine that searches.  Searching engine.  That is why you never hyphenate  an LY.  Because the LY presumes that it modifies what  follows. So you do not hyphenate them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody is hyphenating search engine?  Jeff is correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can we please record that  for the best of the year?  Are those fools?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Transcript:  Our show today  brought to you by Captera.  You did it.  I did it.  I seguade.  Captera is a very  very important thing for everybody  to know about. And I'll tell you why. Because  how many times have you  said what's the best  I don't know. What's your business?  Medical office management software?  What's the best website  building software? What's the best  learning management system?  The best maintenance software? Construction software?  CRM software?  What do you do then? Do you go to Google  and search CRM? That's  designed to end in disaster.  This is such a better  idea. And I love it because it's  free. It's called Captera.  400 categories  of business applications.  Everything from  customer service to project  management.  You can narrow it down. So let's say you're  looking for, I like to do the medical practice.  Let's say you're looking for software to manage  your medical practice. There are  so many of these.  You could just go on and on and on.  So this is one way to start.  And they have links, short reviews, then links  to the website. They have  profiles. But you can also look on the right here.  I can narrow it down. Say I only  want to see four star or better reviews.  I want to see something that can handle  let's say 99, that's pretty big.  Let's say I have a small office, 2 to 9.  Do you want it web based or  installed? Do you need claims management? Yeah,  I guess so. Of course it has to be HIPAA compliant.  Do we have more than one physician? Will we build  patients? Now I'm going to filter the results.  And it's going to narrow it down to  products that actually do that. I'm going  to say let's compare this one  and this one. You see I'm building  a, you can't see it, it's under the lower third.  Can you just briefly take down the lower third?  Because I'm building this little bar down here.  See that? Yeah, there you go.  And then I press compare now.  I get a chart of the three  that I'm interested in. All the features,  how they run.  And then the best part is verified  real user reviews.  Thousands of them from people  just like you.  You can see screenshots. This is so  useful. It's absolutely  free. There's no obligation. You don't even  need to register.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you hear me now?  Can you hear me now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mr. Verizon man. I can  hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something. Anything. Struggling.  What's your favorite? Okay. You did a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No I was going to do a tip  for like if you haven't already  used a wallet case.  What's a  wallet case?  It's a case where you have your cards  and things. So you can slide your  cards inside them like this.  I'm trying to find cards that don't  have numbers on them. Oh for a cell phone.  A cell phone case that has a wallet.  Yeah. And it's like  you carry. And I've got to say  I've not had. So this is my tip.  It gets so thick. No it's not.  It's not that thick at all. It's like  that's it. That's the phone.  I haven't carried a wallet for like  almost three years now.  Maybe four. Because you've got  all my credit cards in there.  I keep my emergency cash  in the back. Or you can sometimes  slide in a little bit there. And  my one that I'm using for the iPhone  is from Silk. You can find it on Amazon. It's  actually a wire cutter recommendation.  But I found it before Wirecutter recommended  it. Because it's actually hard to  find good wallet cases.  They were kind of all the rage three or  two years ago. And then it's like  Speck stopped making them.  And Otterbox  stopped making them. I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is fairly slim. It's just got a  little pouch in the back. And I tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what it's a lot slimmer than trying to  carry around a wallet and carry around  things. And a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not designed to carry everything you put in the wall.  Just a few cards and some cash. No but what I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have found is you don't actually need  as much as I used to carry.  Right. See I have a George Costanza

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  wallet. My wallet is a  I know but you tell you it's very liberating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just have your phone. You've got a little  bit of cash and you've got  your credit cards, your driver's license, things like that.  The person you're trying to reach.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Skype lady has interrupted

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  us. What was that? Skype  lady.  That freaked me out. I've never heard that before.  You haven't? Anyway, so that's my tip.  If you've never thought about it  wallet cases are pretty cool. They make me feel  very, very free and  very good. And I've just  my main challenge is when the new phone comes  out, making sure you can find one for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course there isn't one for the Pixel XL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish that when Google comes out with the Pixel  that they would. There is one for the Pixel  XL. I can get you one. From Silk?  No, not from Silk. You have to find  another one from Amazon. It's kind of sewn together.  It's like an Etsy project.  It's from Etsy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does.  Somebody knitted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is what kills me with Pixels.  Google phones,  they're the ones I could never get wallet cases for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright, that's a good tip.  Alright, I tried.  That's excellent.  Stacy Higgin. Oh wait a minute, we've got to do a number  then we'll do Stacy Higginbotham. What's your number?  Well you stole two of my numbers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but I found another one from you.  Geez, Luis.  So Google's digital news initiative, which was  a 150 million euro fund  to suck up to publishers.  Among the projects  the register is making fun of them  for giving 800,000 dollars to the  UK Press Association  to automatically write 30,000  articles a month.  The register says they're wasting their money  and it's just trying to, it's a cynical move  to get more pages and more ads.  I think the Press Association says it's a way to get more  content at no cost or  low cost into publications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are they real articles  or are they junk? Yeah, they're real articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Reuters has been doing this for quite some time  with sports and finance articles.  So this is a way to try to get more local articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, sports, a lot of the sports, cause it's just  you know, it's mechanical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As I like to say, an article is just  a form of data visualization.  Wow. Do you say that to your students?  I say that all the time. I have t-shirts with that on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right after you say hyphenate the words  before a noun?  This could actually be cool.  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stace.  I was going to say, like, knowing what  projects are permitted, like in your neighborhood,  you could do like a Google search.  I know that I like to  troll my little  TCAD and various other  databases, looking  for things that might relate to me.  So I'm like, oh, this is kind of nice.  I would like that delivered on the internet to me  easily. Sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jimmy Wales's Wiki Tribune  also got money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, good. I know he got enough money to fund it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right? Yeah, and full disclosure  is we gave him $50,000  and Craig Newmark gave him $50,000  from the News

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Integrity Initiative. Good. And he has  his full complement of journalists.  Ten journalists, yep. And now he's  looking for people to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  contribute.  Volunteers to work  side by side with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where can we go to find out more about  that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wikitribune.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have they actually created any content yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not really. I think Jimmy didn't interview  somebody, but not yet.  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The profile. Yes.  That's a good way to start. Stacey has been working  very hard to program  her device so it would  work before her picks.  And I gave you all the time in the world.  Are you ready now? I'm ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, so I just  first I had to find the phone. I had to charge  the phone. Your husband had to bring you the phone.  Yes. So what  I'm showing you guys is the Fibaro  oh, I lost it.  This is the box. The Fibaro  HomeKit enabled motion sensor.  And everyone's like, ooh,  ISR on. I am sad  to report to you guys that there is not  actually an ISR on. This is what it looks like  when it's not. Oh, that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry. Now it just  looks like one of those scary cameras out of  the Circle movie.  Yeah, it's kind of an eyeless  camera. Why do they have eyes  in the pictures? Yeah, that's misrepresentation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They call it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  their cat's eye design.  Only you guys would want the eyes.  Everybody else

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is going to get rid of the eye.  Can you imagine this like in the corner

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of your closet like as a motion sensor?  And you're like, oh my God, it's watching me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is like scaring me. This  ad is scaring me. I feel like they're about to attack  us. What's happening? Is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  floating? Oh, no, it's tucked to the ceiling.  It's motion. There's a back.  Oh, so this is like what you get in stores. Oh, there is an eye.  Oh, it does flash an eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it flashes. Mine doesn't  look like an eye when it flashes, but maybe my  lighting is not appropriate. I'm trying to get it to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  flash. It's looking like an eye or an O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's a super fast flash, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what is it sensing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's sensing temperature.  Hold on, I'll tell you. Motion  and  oh, that's the wrong phone.  Now it's sensing an earthquake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People are being monitored, murdered in this  thing. It detects even

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the slightest vibrations, but it doesn't tell you  what the motion is.  It's not a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a camera. It's a motion sensor. So it's  going to be doing  temperature. Oh, and ambient light.  Wait a minute. What's this scary clown doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a cloud. The cloud is coming from inside the house.  Oh, no, get out now.  A cloud detector.  Just why are we needed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why is the cat attacking this stuffed animal?  Oh, I don't like this  house, mommy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The clown. The clown. Kids  go away, run away. Is this a juggalo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  detector?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a juggalo detector.  If you just put scary music over  this ad, it would just be...  No, they put happy music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They put happy music. They only find some scary music.  Or Stacey. Yeah. Go ahead.  Some more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, it's OK. So it knows when  you move the thing.  So here it is. OK.  Oh, do you see it blinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's get the music on, Karsten. This is the  music we're going to play.  Get my music  your ad.  Stay out, kids. Stay out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Oh, no. After the kids, we're all destroyed.  The eye of

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sauron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From Mordor comes the best  way to monitor your home.  It watches your children  when they sleep.  No motion detected  because they're all dead.  Wow. OK.  There you go. So, Stacey,  do you like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just thinking how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fibaro's never going to send me anything  ever again.  This is a great plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a great plug.  People are going to be very curious about it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all right. It's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, do you see it going nuts?  It's because I just moved it.  It's like, oh, someone's tampering with your motion sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would you want that instead of a camera?  I mean, my Nest IQ does all  of that, too, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, because it doesn't have a camera in it. That's the beauty of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right, because my wife threw the Nest IQ  out of the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there it is warning me that  it's detected tampering.  OK, so  I set up my motion detectors to  turn on lights when like my  a good example is in my laundry room.  My laundry room, when I open the door, it turns on the lights.  When I close the door after  no motion, it turns off the lights.  It's like a refrigerator.  Yes. Or if you've got  closets, you can put smart light bulbs  so that  then you tie them to your motion sensor  and then you have fancy closets  that light up when you open the door.  OK, and you  can also do it for home security. You can set  it like arm the system and then if motion  is detected, you know,  send an alert, sound a siren,  do something.  So this one is special.  Fibaro's made these for a long time.  They're actually one of my two  favorite sensor companies.  AonTech is the other one.  And this particular  sensor is home kit enabled.  This is their first home kit lineup.  Oh, yes.  So  I  I'm like, I'm not that keen  on home kit. Home kit is Apple's technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Apple's technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I also have the  window, the open  closed sensor,  which goes somewhere around here.  I can't make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is, it's kind of like a whole  It's a whole kit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I didn't  pair that one in case you guys wanted to see me  pair a home kit device and see how easy  it can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, I don't have to. What's the hub for the home kit?  Is it the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's your phone and or your Apple  TV or your  iPad. See, and I presume that Apple's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  new  home hub, as they call it,  is going to be HomePod.  HomePod is going to be the, really the  home hub of the future. And the Apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  TV works great, like the way it interacts  with my home kit enabled  door locks. It's magical  because  every few months they  actually will talk to each other and I can unlock  things remotely. But for most of the time, they  just don't even deal with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I saw somebody tweet that every  time he joined some Wi-Fi  that his locks  thought he was home because I guess  the Wi-Fi was centered somewhere  near his house and his whole house would unlock.  Oh, how funny.  Like the coffee shop Wi-Fi. So that's not a good thing.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway.  Anyway. Anyway, so  I'm not a huge fan of HomeKit.  No one will accuse me of that. Why not?  One, I'm not  an Apple. We're not an Apple only household.  Right. And so that's a big  thing. But I also hate how  this is a general pet peeve of mine.  Instead of things being tied to a household, they're tied  to your personal account and then you have to share  everything in iCloud. So my husband owns  the iPad that we wanted to use, whereas I  own my iPhone. And it is possible  to link the two, but it's such a pain in the butt.  So I am a big  fan of like  I guess devices,  multi-device, sorry,  support for multiple  people in a home  in a way that's really easy. And  nobody, no one's figured that out. It's not just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  HomeKit. And all those words are separated by a dash,  by the way. All of them. They were

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all descriptions.  So yes,  so that's the Fubar. I haven't  played with it beyond setting it up. So  if you guys, I can, in a couple weeks,  I could be like, this is what I like.  This is good. This is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it F-U-B-A-R-O?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's F-I-B-A-R-O.  They're not from around  here, are they? They are  European. I think they might be Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they don't know what Fubar means  in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I will say, their app,  I went on their app and I was like, is that really them?  Wait a minute. It looks a little sketchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Okay, you bought the eye,  but I'm buying the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the button is  awesome. So they don't have  a HomeKit button though. So this is their Z-Wave  stuff. And their Z-Wave stuff  is immaculate. It's awesome. I love it. So you just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  push the button and then you tell it what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the Logitech Pop, except  it's cooler looking  because it's Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's Italian. It sure is. Look at that.  Fubar-O.  It means something different  in Italian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can hide it and then  eject someone from your office. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh my god, it was like totally fail.  You'd be like, I'm gonna leave you this button.  If you're not well, just push the button.  The Wi-Fi will be down.  You'd be like, ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Help! Help!  One click turns on light, two clicks turns on  the projector, three clicks turns on the fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four clicks gets Danny.  Just click it twice  if it's an emergency.  Why is 911 a call? So this is like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dash button that does anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's tied  to a Z-Wave hub.  Right. Or whatever.  And yes, yes,  this person is talking about email addresses  for your home as a  way to manage all this drama.  And I don't want to do that. But I've already had to do it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe I need a button.  I need a button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it needs to punch Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See? If you had that button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We just need an IOT  boxing glove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? I have buttons, Leo.  I have all kinds of...  You got the buttons. I just need to get the glove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I just keep mentioning this. Somebody will just make it  for the satisfaction of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so. You could put  Stacey's screen on a motorized  bottom and she could just jam you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. She just wants a button that she hits and then  I get... And then a boxing glove  comes out and punches me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or we could do one of those...  Actually, why don't we do this, Leo? The telepresence  robots. And then I could just roll over your  foot. I have one here. We don't use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just... I spent so much money on that  thing. We used it like three times. I was like,  this is dopey.  And now it doesn't fit any of the current  iPads because it was  tied to that model.  Ladies and gentlemen, I think we should wrap this thing up  because I see Megan Maroney  and Jason Howell with their noses  pressed to the glass trying to get in so they can do  TNT. Thank you, Danny  Sullivan for coming out of retirement for this show.  Hey, Danny. Great to see you. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
