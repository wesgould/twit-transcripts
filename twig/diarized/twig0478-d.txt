It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show we cover the latest news from the Googleverse.  Jeff Jarvis is on assignment in Canada in the Great White North.  But that's okay. Stacy Higginbotham's here from stacy on iot.com.  And hi Stacy. Looks like it's freezing in Austin. That can't possibly be the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's okay. It's not really freezing. I just my office is really cold. It's like 50 degrees here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's pretty chilly if you used to 105.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it was 90 degrees on Sunday and then it was 45 on Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we're like, what? I hate those swings like that.  Also with us, her cohort partner in crime, former Giga Omer as well.  Mr. Kevin C. Toffle of aboutchromebooks.com. Hello, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello. Right now I'm all about this playground on the pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've been playing with it. So Kevin has, did you get a review unit or just get your pixel today?  This is a review unit. Okay.  Mine, the official one that I bought came today and I got black.  I didn't have the fortitude, shall we say, to get the pink one, not pink one.  And now I wish I had because this is very black. Boring. Boring.  I have with me the pixels too. So we could kind of compare on the backs.  They very similar looking, although the pixel two, which is the white one, had a metal back.  This has a plastic back, but they feel or a glass back, I guess. I don't know.  It's all glass. Yep. It feels very similar to toned kind of.  This is more rounded and I don't, I don't, you probably can't see it and it feels a little bit more solid, maybe a little thicker.  It's hard. It's really hard to tell. I guess not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it feel like it's going to fall out of your hands?  I mean, every time I have with you glass cases, I feel like I'm going to break this sucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that it doesn't feel slippery, particularly.  I have to say the screen is awesome. It really looks painted on.  And you know what? I forgot within seconds about the notch, but maybe that's because I use an iPhone 10S.  So but doesn't that screen look super solid? This is one of the Google Live wallpapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I called it last week. We found out they use Samsung.  Samsung. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which so in other words, this looks every bit as good as say a Note 9 or an S9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the display, display mate people, is that who reviews all the screens?  Yeah. Yeah. They came out with their report this week and they said it's an A+.  I don't know if it's quite as good as the ones that Samsung uses for their own phones.  But I mean, if you can tell the difference, you know, I'll give you a dollar because that's impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I turned on boosted colors, which makes it look very much like a Samsung.  But you know what? This does make sense.  It's a Samsung display because it has the same options the Samsung displays have natural.  See if you could tell the difference in the picture of flowers.  I don't think on this on the on the stream you'll be able to boost it, which is just a little more vibrant.  And then adaptive, I guess it came set up with natural.  But I'm thinking adaptive is probably a sensible choice, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adapting to the does that mean like when you lower the blinds, it's going to react?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it. Well, that's a good question.  My guess is and on Samsung phones, it means it adapts to the content.  Right. So yeah.  Mm hmm. I like boosted, to be honest with you.  But those icons do really look painted on.  I mean, and the text is very super crisp.  I said it a little bit larger text for my old eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you have the notch. Mine is notchless.  Oh, you have the little one little bitty guy. No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You turned off the notch. I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did. There's no notch.  It's I don't mind it either, but I'm trying to get, you know, trying to figure out which I like better.  So you have a double chin phone.  I have a double chin phone, but it's a little more symmetrical as a result.  Whoops. Let's do that.  There's no consumer facing way to do this, but you can do it in developer options.  Tap the bill number and then you can get an option to turn the notch off.  I've been thinking about the notch because people really hate the notch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I've been looking at this notch. And I think the reason people hate the notch Apple.  There's that you'll find an article somewhere by a designer.  I think it's on Medium about Apple's notch and the curves they use for the notch, the detail they put.  Google didn't they didn't really pay as much.  You know what? If I should get my iPhone 10 so you can see, but Google didn't quite pay as much attention.  And so this looks more like a it's certainly a bigger notch, but it also looks it.  It's hard to describe it. It looks more aggressively notchy than Apple's notch, which is not only a shout more shallow.  Here is this. This is your phone though, right? All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it looks like a tab in Chrome upside down.  How are we going to see the notch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There it is. There it is. There is. You can kind of see the notch there.  So there's a see how much shallower and wider the Apple notches than the Google notch.  And I think also the and this is really subtle, but look at how the curves are on the Apple notch.  Apple put apparently a great deal of design into those curves and look at the curves in the Google notch.  And as a result, the Google notch almost looks like it's coming in on itself at the top.  It looks like a face.  And I think that's what people more objecting to than the size of the notch.  To be honest, in any event, I think it's a tempest in the teapot.  I don't think it's going to bother anybody. We're used to notches now.  Camera has to go somewhere. It's got to know if you know.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was going to say if I tally up all the time in my life, I've now spent talking about notches.  I know I could have eaten a really nice dinner, maybe done a couple of workouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I personally am more perturbed about the lack of a headphone jack.  We just have to kind of give up on that, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, man, my husband, he's got an iPhone six. Was that the last one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, my mom won't give up her iPhone six because she doesn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's like, it's small and it has a headphone jack.  Two things I want in a phone. So I'm like, oh, buddy, I hope that lasts.  But it's out of support now. This coming year or this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you're going to. He's going to have to get a Samsung phone.  This comes with and Dieter Dieter, Bone and the Verge said these are actually the $30 type C headphones.  But he said they're actually surprisingly good quality.  And at least this time the type C works with all type C devices.  So I'll try it because, as you can see, I just got this.  I haven't had a chance, but I'll try it with the Samsung type C and other type C's.  Essential phone had a type C headphones as well that didn't work with everything.  Only worked with the Essential. So I think that's what this is.  Well, Essential has its own issues.  Yeah, this doesn't really. Right.  This doesn't solve the problem, though, because you can't charge.  Well, I guess you can if you've got wireless.  And by the way, I'm waiting for it. If it comes, we'll open it up today.  The Pixel 3 charger, which I also ordered.  But I put this on a Samsung rapid charger and I was able to charge it sideways.  So I could have the phone sideways, listen to the headphones and still charge it if you're using wireless.  These headphones are watching movies. Yeah, right.  These headphones are interesting because they have an in-ear loop, which would I presume.  An in-ear loop?  So this is going to go in the inside of the ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And stabilize it?  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me just try it.  Yeah, it does. It's nice. And it is adjustable, just like the buds, right?  So you can, I think that's actually a nice touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have such sensitive ears, I think.  I have both small ears and sensitive ears because I've got like my Jabra ones.  I can only keep those in for like two hours and then like my whole ear gets sore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It hurts. Yeah. No, I'm with you on that.  So what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I take out my headphones and I read a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, the other option is this. And these are molded to your ear.  You have to go to an audiologist and they pour stuff in your ear and you have to sit still for two minutes and then they pull it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There used to be a company that took, you took your camera phone and you actually stuck a cord next to your ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know how well that works.  These are very comfortable as a result because they, I wear these all day on some days, right?  Well, that's your job.  It is my job. And I like, you know, as a radio host for years, I always wore over the ear, soft, over the ear headphones like those AKG K240s.  And I still wear those in the studio. I love the other studio. I like them.  But these are these are better for on camera because you can't really see them.  These are the these are I think of them as the Bono headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tell you what, if you ever I'll try those out when you guys pay for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're only a thousand dollars. Exactly. From ultimate ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the funny thing is that was good. Yeah, we have more of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got a new technical director. Carson's got the day the week off.  You know what Carson's doing, by the way? He's building a haunted house for his kids school.  Oh, nice. He is awesome. Yeah.  He's a man of many talents. But I was just saying these thousand dollar headphones.  I think they're J audio is the manufacturer.  Former I see it used to be they use a headphone jack, so I can't use them with anything.  Except, except old fashioned, obsolete studio gear.  The studio gear loses headphone jacks is the day I retire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have an adapter with the Pixel 3. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It comes on. It actually comes with several.  I can't even get it out of the box. Here, I'll show you. Yeah.  Yeah, because I got stuck in there. I got it.  You're stuck in a TV. It comes with a C2C connector, which is very handy when you're copying your data over.  And if your phone is not that kind of phone, a type C phone,  it also comes with a type A to type C adapter for the same purpose.  And even though Apple no longer includes it, it's got a type C to headphone jack adapter.  Apple's decided, according to Apple, nobody uses headphones anymore that use headphone jacks.  So we're just not going to bundle those anymore. Everybody's on Bluetooth now.  This is, you know, I think this is so far I'm liking this and I've been taking pictures.  And I do have to say I feel like the portrait mode and the picture modes are pretty good.  Here, let me see if I can find some pictures.  These are low light shots, behind the scenes studio shots.  Actually, I should pull these up on Google Photos because by now they're copied over to Google Photos.  But look at that. That's a portrait of my wife. I think that's really nice.  And that's in portrait mode so I can do the slider. It actually did top shot for some reason.  They're the same. So I get to choose. Oh, well, I get it. One's in portrait.  I get it. And one's normal. I get it.  So how do I do the slider? Is that this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That should be in the edit settings down below. Well, there's your color pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. Oh, there it is. Tap to change focus. So I could focus.  That's going to do the color.  Oh, should I do the color pop and just make her face be color?  Oh, yeah. Everything else is black and white. That's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like those, remember in like the 90s, those little art pictures of kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. All those silly effects are back, baby.  I'm actually pretty excited. I think this is going to be a very nice phone, personally.  I have to add effects to make professional looking photos, but how?  I don't know. Backup. Oh, I have to turn all this stuff on.  Now it's copying to Google Photos.  So when you first get it, you...  This happened last year, I seem to remember. You plug the cable into your old Google phone.  If you have type C to type C or use the adapter, it'll copy a lot of that stuff over.  I was able to set this up literally about 15 minutes, even downloading all the apps and everything.  I'll have to log into a few things because it doesn't copy passwords over.  But a very easy setup. It looks exactly the same as my Pixel 2.  And they now do a seamless setup if your carrier supports it.  If you're a Google Fi user, it's funny. I took the SIM. I'm so used to it.  I took the SIM popper, popped the SIM slot out of my Pixel 2. There's no SIM in it.  I realized they don't do SIMs anymore. It's seamless.  So if you're on Google Fi or I presume other carriers support it, it'll do that automatically.  You just say, yeah, I'm with Google Fi. And it goes, oh, okay, fine.  You want to transfer everything, the number over? Yeah.  And so now this is my Fi phone.  What do you think, Kevin? You like the feel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do. It's a little bit big for my hands.  But it feels really well made. It is an all glass back.  And yet this bottom third or two thirds is frosted glass. It's frosted Gorilla Glass.  So it has that soft touch feel, which is amazing to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't think it's slippery. I don't feel like it's slippery at all.  No, no, I don't feel... But of course, you use cases, don't you, Stacey?  You're not going to go caseless. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I just I use cases in part because I don't trust my ability to hold on to these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think you'd probably want to get a case on this too, because it is...  It's a glass sandwich. I drop my phone like once a week.  So I always get these standardized... This is from Ringkey, R-I-N-G-K-E, but there's millions of companies.  Under $10, just rubber sleeve that gives it grip.  It protects. It doesn't protect the front, but it protects the sides and the back.  I don't know. I'm excited. Friday, Lisa and I are going to go to San Francisco and we're going to go do some photoshoot in Chinatown,  try to get some low light and different kinds of pictures so we could show them on the new screensavers and next week on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you do any more portraits, the setting for depth, changing the depth after the fact, it's not with the filters.  It's the next one over where you would edit the light color, et cetera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you for doing that research. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's... Do I click... The little slider next to the share, not that one. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That one. And then... Click it again. This one? Yeah, the slide depth.  Oh, look at that. Oh, that's pretty sweet. Okay. Change the bouquet.  Now look at it where it's challenging for all these phones is the hair. Look at that strand of hair on the right.  Let's see. Yeah, see, it's gone out of focus even though it's in the same, roughly same focal plane as your head.  Those are always the challenging things to figure out what's part of her and what's not.  And it looks like there's some trouble with her fingers as well. Let's see.  Not too bad. The knuckles have gone out of focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who wants their knuckles in focus? It's wrinkly and... I know. Let's unfocus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you see the pinky? It shouldn't really be going out of focus with the table, but it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My knuckles are my best feature. I don't know what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to discard changes. I think it's a great shot though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you need though is that ring to be in focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Color pop on the ring. Just zoom in on the ring, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's what people are going to be looking at. That's what they're looking at.  Her hair looks... her hair pieces looked really good there when you zoomed in on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, because it's all in rough focus. But see this... this is actually a perfect example.  Yeah, that strand is in focus above the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, okay. I do see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then out of focus below the table. That's exactly the problem.  And Apple's portrait mode has exactly that problem as well.  It's unfortunate because... but you know what? You have to really pixel peep to see it.  If you're looking at the picture, if you looked at this on Instagram,  unless you're looking for it, you're going to say, no, no, that looks great.  So I think that's the lighting and the color.  Now, Kevin, not every feature is turned on on this camera yet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I can't figure that out because the whole night sight thing I think is not there yet.  And I've seen some reviewers saying, look at these dark photos that we took in night sight.  They're not even doing it yet.  I don't think you did. And they're not even that good. So I'm thinking not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think not either because I'm getting motion blur with this low light.  And one thing we know is it'll go as low as a quarter of a second,  which you cannot hand hold a quarter of a second.  It'll have blur in it. And the people will be blurry.  When that night sight comes in, it's going to take, what do they say, 15 images,  and then pick and choose image stuff. And it'll be able to do that.  Some of the images will be as slow as a quarter of a second, but not all.  You're right. I don't think that's doing that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish they had actually had that in the demo room at the event saying,  here, we've got this dark area set up.  Right.  And this one device has night sight. So you get an idea.  But all we got was the comparison of the XS versus the Pixel 3 on stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think, you know, 3.9 million of these last year, that's all Google sold.  It's a minor blip in the phone universe, less than a week's worth of iPhone sales.  But I think, you know, we're Google fans.  And to me, this is the Android phone of choice, if you ask me.  It is big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're This Week in Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Come on. It's not This Week in iPhones.  All right. Enough of that. Let me take a break. We'll come back.  We've shown you the Pixel. Maybe before the show's over, we'll get the charging stand.  One of the questions I had on the charging stands is they showed some stuff, special stuff,  that it happens when it's on the charging stand.  Well, after looking in the settings, it looks like that special stuff also can be on any time it's charging.  Things like the clock and dimming and all that stuff.  Really?  Yeah. The one thing that I don't know about yet is the slideshow, right?  That's where they're duplicating the Home Hub's slideshow capability.  Have you figured that out yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The live albums. Yeah, I've got the live albums on there.  And I also tested the Nest doorbell integration.  So after the break, I can share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But do you have to have, the question is, do you have to have the Google wireless charger for that to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe so. I suspect there's an NFC bit in the charger.  I'm taking a guess because I have a Samsung wireless charger.  It charges the phone rapidly, but I don't get any of those extra features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you don't? Okay. Okay. Good. Never mind.  So there's apparently there's a Pixel Stand app that turns on all of those features.  Somebody in the chat room says the Stand app came out today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have a Stand app and I never got one. But it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, maybe they put it on there just for you.  Maybe. Maybe. I don't know.  I'll see. I'll see it.  I don't know. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's see what the Stand app does.  We'll go to the break and figure this out while you're reading it.  That's what the ads are for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, everybody, go make a sandwich.  No, it's time to talk about Cashfly.  The show is brought to you literally by the folks at Cashfly.  That's our CDN, our content distribution network.  If you're in the business of getting data to customers, whether it's a podcast, an app,  I think a lot of businesses these days, in fact, could use a CDN.  Content distribution network is designed to give you high-speed downloads for your customers.  Part of the way that works at Cashfly works is because it has multiple servers all over the world.  So when you download Twitter, you're getting it from a server near you.  That really does make a difference.  But the thing I love about Cashfly, and we've been using them since we started using CDNs.  I mean, I've used them the whole time from I think a decade now on Twitter.  Cashfly has been building trusted CDN relationships since 2002.  It's 100% availability with a bulletproof 100% SLA.  That means you're never down.  That means no more 3 a.m. phone calls.  The cash, the servers down, the CDNs down.  No, I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have never had a problem with outages at Cashfly.  Plus, the price is right.  Cashfly on average saves customers more than 20%.  And actually, I'll tell you how you can get to find out exactly how much they'll save you.  They've got the best agile techs that will answer all your questions the first time without passing you around to five different departments.  Really smart people.  And we have a great relationship with them because our Cashfly customers are really smart.  And we have a great relationship with them because our Cashfly contract is based on our usages.  We're not locked into an inflexible contract.  Our contract with Cashfly is built around our unique demand and traffic patterns.  We literally send out petabytes of data every month from the Twig servers on Cashfly.  Petabytes.  And knowing that it's not going to suddenly hit me if one show gets a lot of downloads, it's awesome.  I don't have to check my CDN bill every day to see if are we okay?  Did we exceed our limits, et cetera, et cetera.  I love Cashfly.  Join the thousands of others who trust Cashfly's reliable network.  Let Cashfly give you some sanity back.  No more 3 a.m. phone calls.  You want to find out how much Cashfly can save you?  They're giving away a complete detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends if you go right now to twit.cashfly.com.  twit.cashfly.com.  See if you might be leaving 20% or more on the table.  And you know what?  You already use Cashfly every time you download one of our shows.  So you know how good it is.  twit.cashfly.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know who could have used Cashfly yesterday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google.  YouTube.  So I'm in the chat room yesterday doing the show.  Somebody's saying I'm getting a lot of 500s.  And I said, OK, which of our sites?  What is the problem?  What's going on?  It's YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it went off right in the middle of the Beto, the Beto Ted Cruz debate.  So I was sitting there talking to my dad who is politically on the other side of the fence for me.  And we're like having this nice text based go round.  And then he's like, ah, and I was like, score for Beto.  And he's like, no, YouTube just went down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It affected users in the US, Australia, Asia and Europe.  The service was back up around 11 p.m. Eastern Time Tuesday.  I don't know if Google has explained what happened, but you would have gotten a postmortem yet.  Yeah, Network 503 error.  Southeast Asia also affected.  Team YouTube on Twitter because nobody would read their Google Plus page.  Team YouTube said thanks for your reports about YouTube, YouTube TV and YouTube Music Access issues.  I guess they're all in the same CDN.  We're working on resolving this.  We'll let you know once it's fixed.  We apologize for any inconvenience.  Wouldn't it be funny if YouTube moved to CashFly because of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does YouTube have a dashboard for services?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They ought to.  Google does.  Google has one for other services.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google is under Google.  OK, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I remember during the World Cup, remember going down YouTube TV.  That was incredibly frustrating.  I was watching the game.  And here's the Google Google Cloud status dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't have YouTube.  That's for their.  That's for their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the enterprise type stuff and cloud stuff.  Yeah.  That's just a billion people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a billion people.  It was like an important game too.  I can't remember, but I was really peeved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're all important in World Cup.  They're all important.  I'm a big football guy.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's a sporting event, it's all it's super important to someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it's a debate between Beto and what's Cruzee.  Ted Cruz.  Cruz.  What is Cruz's what is Donald Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz?  Lion Ted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lion Ted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is it allowed for Beto to use Lion Ted or is that trademark Trump properties?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think Beto really wants to be like Trump.  That's my hunch.  Lion Ted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Didn't Ted Cruz's family assassinate President Kennedy?  Am I wrong on that?  Yeah.  I've heard people say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Couldn't have been his dad because he was the Zodiac Killer.  Oh, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He had to be busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I thought Cruz was the Zodiac Killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, maybe.  No, he's Grandpa Munster on TV's Munster's show.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We shouldn't get into this.  Your dad will hate us.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we don't know yet what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't know why YouTube went down and I presume it didn't have anything to do with  the debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably not.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  So this is interesting.  And when you get your Pixel stand, you'll see what I see.  I think there is no Pixel stand app on my Pixel 3.  Instead, in fact, Leo, you probably can go see this in the settings of the phone.  There's a connected devices option where you do Bluetooth.  Yeah.  You click in there and it doesn't show up in there either.  But because I've already paired my phone to the Pixel stand, I go into previously  connected devices and I have Pixel stand showing up in there with settings.  Aha.  And in the settings, I can tell it here's what I want to do.  I can turn the screen off after dark.  I can do not disturb.  The neat thing is, and I found this out through Android Police while you're doing the ad,  you can have multiple stands and configure them differently.  One at work, one at home.  Yeah, because it's by pairing.  It is.  So there has to be some communication method.  And in fact, Android Police says they've checked it on a Pixel 2 even with the Pixel  stand app installed and it doesn't give you these options and features.  So you may be able to get the app, but I don't think it's going to do anything for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Keep your eye peeled, John, for my Google box.  I thought they'd come together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll have to turn Bluetooth off and put it in the stand and see if I still get the features  and whatnot because maybe it's Bluetooth, but I think it's NFC.  I think it would make more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if it's, oh yeah, I guess it all could be stored on the phone.  Any per stand settings could just be stored on the phone.  That makes sense.  I really, I have to say, I think this is going to be my daily driver going forward.  And I have the Note 9 and the S9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My daily driver, is that your phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that's what we YouTubers call our phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was like, what does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The daily, the phone we use every day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once every couple of weeks on our podcast, the IoT podcast, I have to tell her, this is how the kids say it.  The kids.  Do you start a show, Stacey? You got to start your show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi guys. Stacey, you got a bathroom?  That's normal. That's normal.  So Google has decided to play hardball with the EU.  Wow. I'm very curious what you all think about this.  Remember the European commissions decided that Google was competing inappropriately in the EU.  Find them. What was it?  Five billion dollars. Google's appealing that fine.  But Google said, we've been working, this is Hiroshi Lockheimer of Android Talk,  and we've been working on how to comply with the decision.  We now have informed the European commission of the changes we'll make while the appeal is pending.  First, we're updating the compatibility agreements with mobile device makers that say how Android's used.  Going forward, Android partners wishing to distribute Google Apps may also build non-compatible or forked smartphones and tablets for the European economic area.  That was one bonus contention.  Google said, if you want to put our apps on there, which customers want, you can't make an alternative Android AOSP version of your phone.  You have to either be a Google Apps device maker or not.  I think the argument for that is it's confusing to consumers.  Consumers that is buying a phone, they want to know if they're going to get the Google experience or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's not just an alternate version of a particular phone.  If you sign the arrangement and license the Google Play Store, mobile services and apps, you can't make any non-Google devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  You can't make any non-Android.  You can't make a Tizen device or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, you can do.  I think you can do Tizen.  You can't do Android.  You can't use AOSP any other way.  Right. Right. It's AOSP Android or Google Android, as I would say.  If you do Google Android, you cannot make any non-Google Android devices.  And somebody actually tried that.  It was Acer or Asus and the product was launched and quickly squashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's changed.  And that was one of the things the competition commission didn't like.  And Google says now, if you're an Android partner and you want to have a Google phone, you can also build non-compatible phones or forked smartphones.  By the way, notice that's for the European Economic Area only.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That also means theoretically Amazon could make Google devices.  Yeah. Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But here's where they're playing a little hardball.  Device manufacturers will be able to license the Google mobile application suite separately from the Google search app or the Chrome browser.  Since the pre-installation of search and Chrome together with our other apps helps us or helped us, used to help us fund the development and free distribution of Android, we're going to make you pay.  We're going to introduce a new paid licensing agreement.  Android is free and open source.  But if you want the Google Apps and you're in the EU, you're going to pay a fee now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is for the companies who are building this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. But the companies pass it along.  So it means a more expensive phone, I think.  What's unclear is what the what the fee will be.  But what is very clear is this is Google saying, all right, EU will show you will comply, but it's going to cost you.  It's going to most most importantly, it's going to cost EU consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or will it? Right.  And I only say that because the details are not here.  And I've been hearing some back chatter that companies such as a Samsung or Nokia or whoever for EU phones.  Yes, they'll pay Google to license it.  But then Google would actually give them some incentive back.  So it may just be an accounting wash.  I don't know.  I'm very curious to see the details of all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that was part of the problem was that Google was apparently paying some companies to use Google Apps.  Oh, but you know what?  This happens all the time.  And I worked in the cable industry.  I'm familiar with this with tech TV.  You know, in theory, the way cable television works is the cable, you know, the individual cable companies, you know, your Austin cable pays tech TV for the right to carry that programming.  But the way tech TV gets on Austin cable is by going to them with a sack, a bag of money saying, I mean, between you and me, we're paying you to take our channel for the first five years.  And then you could start paying us per subscriber.  What they call it is co-marketing dollars.  They say, this is money to help you advertise the fact that you have tech TV now.  Don't worry about spending it all on billboards.  Whatever you see deemed necessary is sufficient.  And so we would pay them.  And then five years later, the contract flips and they start paying us, which is why it costs.  And it's you know, I remember when I first I worked for I was the third employee of CNET back in the early 90s and maybe the fourth was the third or the fourth.  And my I was charged with at the time Halsey Miner, Shelby Bonnie wanted to start a television network, not a not a website.  And they said, but we want to know how much that's going to cost.  So I did some due diligence for them as my first task.  And I said, guys, it's going to cost you about 50 million a year.  And it's going to take you seeing CNN took 10 years to turn it around.  It's going to take you at least five years.  So you need a war chest of a quarter of a billion dollars to start a cable channel.  And that's roughly I think what Paul Allen spent the late Paul Allen, who has a tip of the hat passed away this week.  When he when he put tech TV out there, he lost hundreds of millions of dollars because it, you know, it hadn't turned yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is why the Internet is so amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I don't have to pay anybody.  We have the irony is more people can watch this show than ever could watch a tech TV show by a factor of 100.  Literally, I have to pay anybody anything.  I shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to pay cash fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we have distribution costs, but we don't have to.  I don't have to pay your.  And by the way, this is where net neutrality does impact us.  I don't have to pay Internet service provider for access to you there.  Since many Internet service providers are former cable companies like Comcast and AT&T and Verizon, they're kind of used to the model of us coming with bags of cash.  They wish we would.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who wouldn't want a bag of cash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What a tangled web we weave.  Anyway, do you think this is Google?  It really feels like a schoolboy thing like, well, if you're going to make me do that, I'm going to charge you.  Or is this legitimately?  Well, they need to recoup their expensive developing Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, let's put it this way.  We know that, you know, what is it?  What is the 80, 90 percent of their revenue comes from ads.  And if they don't have their search engine and their browser and their place to around particular phones, they can't make money from ads.  So I think it's legitimate to license.  I don't know. I don't have a problem with it.  I'm more concerned from a consumer standpoint and not cost.  If I'm a consumer in the EU and I want a phone and let's say I get the non-Googleized version of it, but then later I want to add the Play Store.  Can I do that? Can I pay Google? Can I what?  Or am I just stuck?  I suspect I'm stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chair has told me that this in psychology is called reactants.  An unpleasant motivational arousal to offers persons rules or regulations that threaten or eliminate specific behavioral freedoms.  Reactance occurs when a person feels that someone is taking away their choices or limiting the range of alternatives.  And and and that's how reverse psychology works, because if you want somebody to do something, you tell them, don't do that.  And then reactance kicks in.  Who knew Google was acting like a 10 year old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, aren't they 20?  Come on, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop the adolescence.  I mean, Google, Paul Thurotte pointed this out on Windows Weekly earlier.  They already got what they wanted with Android, which is complete dominance, and they killed any other third party operating system.  It's iOS or Android. And that's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is I mean, I will say this is what the regulators did ask for.  And now if you're like, oh, I don't want to pay Google this, then maybe you build your own stuff that competes with Google.  I don't know. Is this ideal?  And a lot of the in the new era of Internet kind of hegemony, a lot of the thinking about competition law is actually going to cause maybe some pain for consumers in terms of higher prices.  So that's another like in Europe, which has a very different kind of monopolistic viewpoint than in the US.  That's that's actually what they're after.  So I don't know. And, you know, the Europeans may be OK with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they should they should be happy because today if you go by, say, a Samsung phone, just picking on Samsung, just using them as an example, you get the Google stuff.  You get your Gmail account and app rather because you have to.  But you also have Samsung's email. You have the Google calendar.  You also have Samsung calendar. There's a lot of duplication, and that's not good for consumers.  But again. Will they have what I read?  It is good for consumers.  It's good to have you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, not loaded on your phone necessarily, not like bloatware, but the option of having two different email.  Yeah, and I'm all for choice. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have a problem with it. My point is my point is Samsung felt Samsung wants to develop its own apps, but it's also a required to put Google's apps on the internet.  That's why there's duplication. It's a bad consumer experience is my point.  So that's a good thing to get rid of that.  You know, just have one or the other or choice.  But in a sense, if you buy a Samsung phone that's not Google licensed, you're not going to have that choice.  I mean, you're not going to have the choice of Gmail anyway.  You'll have your choice of any other email app, including Samsung's.  And that's an issue because really what other good app stores are there?  Samsung has an app store. Yes, Amazon has an app store.  But there's a lot of moving parts here that I just don't know.  You know, everybody says, oh, you just sideload Google.  Yes, I can do that. And probably the people who watch the show can do that.  That's not a mainstream consumer answer, though.  No, it's also not a legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that you know, you see that all the time when you put a new ROM on there or whatever, the ROMs don't come with the Google Apps.  You have a sideload of G apps and you install it.  Is that legal?  How does Google feel about that? I've always wondered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They probably don't care, Leo, because they're getting what they want anyway.  They're getting more users and data, so they don't care.  Maybe they will care now that this goes into effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll care if Samsung now says, well, Samsung's not going to come with the Google Apps, but here's where you get them.  That is not going to be how that plays out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also, again, a lot of moving parts of Google Play Services is a big piece of all these apps and services.  And Google's not giving that away for free.  You can't download that either, right?  Yeah, it used to be able to.  And if you get away from the actual Google Play Store, I'm not saying that's the best place in the world, because it's not.  But if you get away from it, you start losing the security it offers through Google Play Protect, where they do the machine learning scanning and on device scanning.  So are you opening yourself up to more malware and whatnot?  I don't know. There's a lot of moving parts here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I certainly don't recommend.  I mean, honestly, I just tell people, get, I guess the Samsung phones are right.  I like some of the Samsung phones.  But when people I care about ask me what Android phone to get, I always say just get a Pixel, period.  No second choice, because you know you're going to get all the Google updates.  It's going to be clean.  It's not going to have.  I mean, I like the Samsung hardware.  If Samsung, we've said this before, if Samsung did their Google Experience phones again, where they just put plain Android on there, I'd buy that in a heartbeat.  But they don't. And they won't.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sigh.  You know what? This is pretty, now they're using Samsung panels.  This is pretty close. This is pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost a Samsung. That's what Google should sell it as.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's practically a Samsung without all the junk.  Let's take a break. Oh, no. Oh, oh, oh, we'll take a break in a second.  But first, and I thank Kara Swisher for pointing this to me, pointing me to this and all of us to this on Twitter.  A very long thread by Morgan Knutson.  Did you read this?  I did. Twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't know if I read all of it because I think he kept adding to it.  It's long.  Yeah, I read like a hundred something tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was like, oh, this is the argument for please people stop with the tweet storm.  Just put it on medium. Would you please?  It's a pain to read this. Did someone unroll it yet?  No, we need something like that. So let's just describe this.  Knutson is no longer at Google. Hasn't been for a long time.  In fact, he's had some successful startups.  He's he's well past the Google days, but he started the tweet storm with now that Google Plus has been shuttered.  Well, it's not shuttered yet, but in the process, I should air my dirty laundry.  Oh, that's a good start on how awful the project and exec team was.  I'm still pissed about the bait and switch.  They pulled me by telling me I'd be working on Chrome and putting me on this godforsaken piece of poop on day one.  It gets worse from there.  It's very detailed. It's it actually it's not only so deep, very detailed, but it's so credible.  That's kind of what I want to ask you guys. It feels to me so credible.  It's really changed my opinion about how well Google's organized.  And he does say there's some really great teams. He mentions he worked with Andy Hertzfeld and, you know,  it was just amazing because remember Andy worked on Google Plus.  But in general, it slams Vic Gundotra saying, you know, he was just, you know, let's see here if I can find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's like a is it a hundred and eighteen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It goes on and on and on. He's talking first about Larry Page.  Google Plus was situated. Remember, this was when Google was all in on social.  Google Plus was situated in the main building.  Nineteen hundred a floor away from Larry's office.  Larry Page, CEO. If you were one of the twelve thousand people at Google and Mountain View who didn't work on plus,  you didn't have access to those floors.  The CEO, Larry Page, didn't just have an office.  The entire floor was his. We all had access to it and were encouraged to use it sparingly.  A war room here and there. We had access to Larry's cafe to a super fancy vegan cafe called Cloud  that wouldn't be sustainable in the real world.  Why this exclusivity? What made Google Plus so special?  Why was it held so closely to Google's chest?  I'd find out later that the senior vice president of plus uses cloud to swing all of this.  His name was Vic Gundotra.  Now Vic has since left and that's really, you know, the timing of Vic's departure is really kind of coincident with the time,  with the, you know, this decline and fall of Google Plus.  Gundotra was relatively charismatic.  I remember him frequently flirting with the women on the team.  Gave me a compounded horrible impression of him.  My desk was directly next to Vic's glass walled office.  He'd walk by my desk dozens of times during the day.  He'd see my screen from his desk.  During the eight months I was there, culminating in me leading the redesign of his product.  Vic didn't say a word to me. No hello. No goodbye. No thanks for staying late. No handshake. No eye contact.  Vic's product vision was fear based.  Google built the knowledge base, knowledge graph.  Facebook swooped in and built the social graph.  If we don't own the social graph, we can't claim to have indexed all the world's data,  which, you know, that did make sense at the time.  Vic was powerful at Google.  He had buy in from the top and he wielded that stick aggressively.  He made plus as pervasive as he could.  Each product org, that's every product through Google,  had a mandate to integrate Google Plus's social features.  If your team, say on Gmail or Android, had to integrate Google's Plus features,  then your team would be awarded a one and a half to three times multiplier on top of your yearly bonus,  making it almost half of your entire salary.  Oh, it goes on and on and on.  It's kind of hard to follow because after you get to the end of one thread,  you have to then click on it and go on to the...  You read that correctly.  You read that correctly.  A ton of money to ruin the product you were building with bloated garbage no one wanted.  No one really liked this, but people drank the Kool-Aid mostly because it was green and made of paper.  This made plus the center of the Google universe and made Vic feel invincible, I presume.  Once I had to hold back laughter after he announced his brilliant idea to redesign the product from the ground up every six months.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It goes on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I recommend reading it.  Morgan, Knutson, M-O-R-G-A-N-K-N-U-T-S-O-N.  My takeaway was how disorganized Google was, how petty politics had influenced it to the point where people weren't doing their best work.  They were often assigned projects they didn't have the capability of handling.  It's not a pleasant picture at all.  What do you guys think? What do you think, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it shows that Google is like every other crappy big company out there.  They used to have a lock on this idea that they were this idealistic group.  I think some of that halo effect still lives, but we know that Google is not trying not to be evil.  We know that there's a gajillion people there.  I think if anything, this shows how a halo effect from your early culture can really help you.  The flip side of that, look at companies like Uber now and how they behave and how long is that effect, even if they're not crazy jerks in the world.  How long is that going to stick with them?  Can I tie to this the story from The New Yorker, by the way?  I don't know if you saw that.  This was in The New Yorker.  It's about Waymo.  I think it was yesterday or maybe the day before that someone pulled this up.  It's talking about an argument between Lewandowski and his colleague at Google where it describes Lewandowski pulling the software and allowing it to self-driving car software, allowing it to take forbidden routes, and then basically driving a Camry off the road.  So they do a fine for the word Camry.  And then they didn't report this.  It doesn't look like they reported it.  And it screwed up his colleagues back so badly, this particular accident, that he had to get surgery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One day in 2011, a Google executive named Isaac Taylor learned that while he was on paternity leave, Lewandowski had modified the Camry software so that he could take them, actually all the car software, so that he could take them on otherwise forbidden routes.  A Google executive recalls witnessing Taylor and Lewandowski shouting at each other.  Lewandowski told Taylor the only way to show him why his approach was necessary was to take a ride together.  Both men, still furious, jumped into a self-driving Prius and headed off.  The car went onto a freeway where it traveled past an on-ramp.  According to people with knowledge of events that day, the Prius accidentally boxed in another vehicle, a Camry.  A human driver could easily have handled the situation by slowing down and letting the Camry merge into traffic, but Google's software wasn't prepared for this scenario.  The cars continued, speeding down the freeway side by side.  The Camry's driver jerked his car onto the right shoulder, then apparently trying to avoid a guardrail, he veered to the left.  The Camry pinwheeled across the freeway and into the medium.  Lewandowski was acting as a safety driver, swerved hard to avoid colliding with the Camry, and caused Taylor to injure his spine so severely he eventually required multiple surgeries.  They didn't go back to check on the other driver to see if anyone had been hurt.  Neither they nor other Google executives made inquiries with the authorities.  The police were not informed of the self-driving algorithm that contributed to the accident.  Basically, it was a hit and run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and then he's like, oh, instead of being upset about this happening, which I think would be horrifying, he's like, yeah, that's valuable data that we now have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He sent out an email with video of the collision, subject line Prius versus Camry.  Yeah, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was proud of it.  This is not a culture that we want doing really anything.  And this is...  Wow.  I mean, yeah, so it ties into nothing that this thread had in it surprises me.  It's basically like a bunch of frat bros, like, who have the engineering capabilities to be oblivious to the rest of the world.  I don't even know.  It like fits all the terrible stereotypes that you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In response to questions about these incidents from the New Yorker, Google's self-driving unit disputed that its cars are unsafe.  Safeties are highest priority, a spokesperson wrote to the author.  The company said in the case of this collision, the report was submitted to the authorities.  And even though multiple participants later sought medical care, quote, every person involved left the scene on their own accord or Camry.  As for the Camry incident, the person described it as, oh, this is a different incident.  I'm sorry, the kit collision.  In the Camry case, the spokesperson said, well, it was, quote, an unfortunate single car accident in which another car failed to yield to traffic.  And because Google's self-driving car didn't hit the Camry, Google did not cause the incident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like insurance speak.  But the police totally would actually maybe they wouldn't cite you for no, they would still cite you.  They'd cite you for reckless driving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does raise the question, which the New Yorker also raises, that if Google's not reporting that because the self-driving car didn't hit anything,  then there may be many other accidents we don't know about that are not reported as accidents but may have been caused by behavior by the self-driving car.  A spokesperson for Google declined to discuss the company's reporting policies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wouldn't I wouldn't want to discuss that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Charles Duhigg writing in the New Yorker.  New York has been doing such great investigative reporting lately.  They've really done a great job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As bad as both of those stories are, I think you hit the nail on the head in the beginning about the engineering and the ability to do things that other companies and people aren't doing.  But I can say with certainty from experience, not everybody is like that at Google.  I hate to see them all lumped in as frat boys.  No, I think that's yeah.  And even in this even in this tweet, so I think that's true.  Yes, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a function of who's in charge in not just at Google, but there's a there is a culture in Silicon Valley that we all recognize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel most of us recognize it's kind of the move fast and break things taken to maybe the unempathetic extreme.  If we want to call it in.  So that's that's kind of what I'm trying to say.  Sure, sure.  Morgan, this is something that bedeviled Microsoft for years.  The product fiefdoms and exerting their power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he is an example in this tweet storm.  He says he had was working with Web RTC and he had figured out a way to integrate Google's create a sidebar.  That integrated with other apps into the sidebar.  So you could have your Gmail, your calendar, your plus all in one place in a sidebar on Google Plus, for instance.  He says it's January 2012.  I'm back in the office because he worked on it during Christmas.  I showed around.  People seem to like it.  Even Greg, who's a great guy, he's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  He's a great guy.  I showed around.  People seem to like it.  Even Greg, his bureaucratic direct report, reluctantly liked it.  Somebody maybe him told me I needed to talk to another guy to get buy in on my chat plans.  He was the exec that was responsible for it.  I found him and he was able to give him a quick elevator pitch on what I was going for with RTC.  The executive said, huh, there's no way we're doing that.  I was coming up.  We've just spent the last four months building a Chrome extension that does something similar.  If Plus has this, we're going to get laughed off the stage.  I was like, but shouldn't all these work together in a sort of your conversations are available wherever you are kind of way?  Nope, we're not doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this explains why we have, you know, hangouts and do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, from the outside, people looking in now kind of can say, oh, I get it.  That's what killed me.  That was terrible at Microsoft is a real problem at Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do think that when you are a company with in Google has almost 90,000 employees now, I think this is there's going to be fiefdoms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's going to be politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're going to have you're going to have politics, but it is also very difficult given how many people in different product teams and all the types of products that you're pulling in together at Google.  Yeah, it's hard to build that and make that work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sachin Adela came in and I think he kind of solved it at Microsoft by making putting response, changing the reporting structure and changing the executive to make it more horizontal and vertical.  There's ways to if you know it's a problem, you can address it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe Sundar's try.  Maybe. Yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. It's always a problem with a giant corporation.  You've got all sorts of you've got the innovators dilemma.  You've got organizational issues.  It's a hard thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's unclear what their core product.  This is this is across all tech companies, right?  You're starting to see like it is hard to say, I guess all what arrows you put your wood behind, right?  If you're making a widget or several widgets, it's very easy.  But like if you're on the AI team, are you really optimizing for AI or are you optimizing your AI for five different Google products?  And that's that's very different.  It's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's I absolutely agree.  And the only reason this is of interest is because for me anyway, Google has a very shiny reputation as being smarter than everybody else and being above these problems, which other corporations have.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the halo that I think they probably no longer deserve.  No, they never they probably never did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't I mean, I don't know.  And there is there is still and you still see it in some of the things Google puts out in the world.  You're like Google.  That is brilliant.  But you are explaining this horribly.  Right.  And come on, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also I also think that it explains it's helpful because it helps me understand exactly as you said, why the messages mess is going on, why why stuff doesn't work better together.  You know, when Jeff says, well, I can't my G Suite log in work with these things as well as my consumer log in.  It's not necessarily that such a hard problem.  It's just that those are different fiefdoms and you can't get them to work together and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's definitely not always a technical problem.  And Google's good at solving the technical problems.  But when it's something outside of that, it gets challenging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's not alone here, by the way.  Apple's lost its luster as well.  It's hard to be what we think these companies are.  Maybe we put them on a pedestal.  We shouldn't.  Almost certainly we shouldn't.  Well worth reading anyway.  It's you know, whether believe it or not, you know, whatever your take is on and it's it's a very interesting tweet storm.  And I guess I just wish people would stop putting that stuff on Twitter and put it in one place where you can read it and comment on it.  Right.  And, you know, there are lots of comments on the.  But they're but they're all over the place.  They're in each different tweet.  It's it's not practical.  I'll never understand why people do that.  Why? In fact, explain it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do people do that?  Morgan, why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably, I mean, probably it starts out as a stream of consciousness thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It starts as one or two tweets and it gets out of hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, then you just get in and then you're there.  So why would you change it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He did it over a couple of days, too.  I mean, he walked away and came back, you know.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody has put it in Thread Reader.  And thank you to P.S.  Chops in our chat room.  So I guess Thread Reader is a site that will will do this.  Put all these threads together.  However, if I were to read you the link, you would probably not find it any easier to find.  It's a thread reader app dot com slash thread slash one oh four nine five two three oh six seven five oh six nine six six five two nine dot html.  Thank me later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look how long it is.  It's a novella.  It's a novella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't believe I spent that much time reading it.  Are you glad you're over not?  Oh, yeah, no, I definitely.  I mean, I always like inside stories of any company because I'm it's yes.  It's also kind of therapeutic.  You're like, oh, my crappy work experience was no different than this other crappy work experience.  Yes, I don't.  You know, it's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should just mention Morgan went on to he left Google to go to Dropbox where he said it was a pleasant experience.  These people weren't mired in BS and politics.  They were at the top of their games.  I was so stoked to interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that happens.  I mean, smaller companies, you can usually see that like right away.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so he went to Dropbox.  He later started a shift app to buy or sell a used car, which raised one hundred forty million dollars in a series D.  He's currently working on another startup.  And so and then it ends.  He said, I sent a resignation email to Greg.  He forwarded to H.R. within seconds.  I sent an email to the company saying goodbye.  Standard practice.  I got hundreds of heartfelt replies from Google employees felt great and terrible.  The same time on my way out, Greg tried to chit chat and shake my hand.  I took everything. It took everything in me not to tell him to go F himself.  I walked past his extended hand and said, nah, man.  He said, really?  I turned around and looked him in the eye as I backed out of the door.  Yeah, really?  The end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was very well written.  I'm telling you, I read it two times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's picturing this as a stream play.  That's what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was very well written.

Transcript:  Period. Period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, to that point, DuckDuckGo is saying they've seen a 30% increase in searches over the last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, wow. You know, a year ago I was using DuckDuckGo, but I kind of stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think your story is pretty common.  DuckDuckGo is an interesting search engine.  I think it's decent, right?  You can on all browsers, you can make it your default search engine.  But I mean, most people still use Google.  Stacy, why do you no longer use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I switched a device or something that I had it as a default and then I had to switch or loaded something on that turned the default off basically.  And then I didn't put it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And sometimes every now and then I would check to see if like Google was better.  And sometimes it was. As a journalist, I really do need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem. You know, you can you can believe in privacy.  You can say I don't like Google and all that.  But ultimately, a good search engine is worth its weight in gold.  Here's the traffic, though, on DuckDuckGo over.  This is from January 2011 to January 2019.  You can see it's a steep increase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, 2018?  January 2019.  Oh, I guess we haven't gotten there yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's the blank part at the end of the.  Oh, OK. I was like, no, Leo.  There's a little blank part at the end of the graph.  See, it says 20. You know why?  I don't know. You know, just because for completeness.  We're almost there. We're almost there.  God, that's amazing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm seeing them show up a lot more in my own site stats for referrals lately.  Oh, interesting. Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, a highly technically literate audience is going to be the driver.  Yeah.  I remember when I started pitching Google to my friends way back, I had a friend.  What's wrong with Alta Vista, Stacey?  Yeah, she was like, I don't know if you remember this, but you turned me on to Google way back in.  And I was like, holy cow. I think it was like 2000.  Yeah. So she was like, I always thought you were awesome after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was like, yeah, yeah, I am.  You're right. Super awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have a Google Home Hub yet, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do not. I don't know that anybody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, yeah, I ordered one, but it hasn't come yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, people ordered it. I don't know if we're going to order it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want one.  You don't want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He doesn't want one.  Why not?  I don't because it's too small for my use.  I mean, I'm not saying it's a bad product.  It's tiny, isn't it? It's not. It's deceptive.  It's only bigger than a smartphone.  I mean, it's seven inch diagonal.  You can hold it in your hand like you could the base of it like an Amazon Echo or a dot, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's Ron Amadio covering the entire screen with what it looks like is a Note 9.  Right.  That's how big it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very small.  And a lot of the features that are on it are coming to the Lenovo Smart Display that I already have, which is a 10 inch display.  I prefer that because I like watching content on it.  So why do I want that from Google?  I just don't, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not the same technology.  So apparently Google created something called Android Things.  You guys are aware of that, I'm sure.  And that's what the Lenovo runs on the JBL, the LG.  But Google, for some reason, when they decided to do their own, decided not to use Android Things, but instead to use something Ron says a lot closer to Chromecast.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And he did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does give a really good explanation for this, which is cutting costs.  Cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is cheap at 150 bucks.  It's by far the cheapest thing out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he explains that the chip set that they used is not compatible with Android Things because it doesn't have enough memory.  And it's true.  Android Things is freaking huge for an IoT device.  And Kevin and I have talked about that for years.  So it makes sense, but it is a little weird.  And it kind of shows how stupid or bifurcated or weird that Google's IoT strategy is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can now understand this better, can't we?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're like, oh, back to that.  Google doesn't know what the right or left or any hands are doing.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't have a camera, which I thought was really interesting after the Facebook portal announcement.  By the way, Facebook, at the time they announced this portal, said, oh, don't worry.  We're not going to spy on you.  We're not going to use anything we gather from it for advertising.  And now they said, oh, no, actually we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least they did it before you actually could get a device.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although I ordered it, I don't know what I'm going to do with it.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't even accept delivery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I have to.  I don't plan.  I didn't order it for me.  I ordered it for you.  I ordered it so we can review it.  We don't want it.  No, I don't want it either.  I don't know what I'm going to do with it afterwards.  Put it in a nuclear waste dump.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say, don't burn it, but you could recycle it.  How is it built for recycling?  I wonder.  Well, that's actually a question that I've started asking a lot of companies building devices.  That's right.  Because I think everything's so throwaway now.  That's kind of a non sequitur, but throwing it out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a non sequitur.  Absolutely.  In fact, that's why I always check with iFixit.  They will talk about that all the time.  They're really big on the notion of recyclability.  They'll rate this stuff.  Most of this stuff is not sad to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me ask this then, Kevin, because you have the Lenovo.  Yes.  Do you think it's going to be better or more functional than a Home Hub?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because Lenovo's getting ... Oh, sorry.  Go ahead, Stacey.  You can answer it.  Yeah, go ahead.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, go ahead, Ms. IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Lenovo is going to get all the functionality of the Home Hub.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of it?  Because it was my sense that initially, we reviewed the Lenovo.  It lacked a lot of features that just a Google Assistant has.  Right?  No, like what?  No, but yeah.  What couldn't we do?  I forgot.  We couldn't play back stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We couldn't play Netflix, but Netflix isn't on a normal Google Assistant either.  I mean, like a Google Home?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but since there's only one family of displays ... Right.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I got the ... I'll have to go back and look at our review.  I didn't review it.  I think Jason or Megan did, but I got the feeling that it wasn't as complete as a product from  Google would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think the Home Hub is less ... Okay, I'm letting Kevin answer because I'm so sorry.  He has it.  Go, Kevin.  Well, I have the store display.  We both have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  She doesn't.  Okay.  Yeah.  In fact, I bought hers and had it shipped to her.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I paid you back.  I paid you back, man.  I know you paid me back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aw.  I paid $50 off at Costco.  She got a deal.  You guys are so cute.  We shopped together.  We both did too.  Yeah.  But the smart display, it's supposed to get the pull-down gesture that brings to the Home  Hub information center where you see all of your devices and so on.  That's not unique to the Google Home Hub.  That's coming to the other devices, they said.  It's a Chromecast receiver.  Both of them are so I can pipe anything I want that I can Chromecast to it or to the  Google Home Hub.  But I wouldn't do that on the seven-inch one.  I can do it on a 10-inch, 1080p display.  I don't really see the benefit of having other than lower cost.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, see.  Oh, no.  I was going to say, don't they have a brightness sensor that's different for this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the only thing, Kevin.  That's worth it.  Yes, you're right.  I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute.  But also the photo slideshow.  Can you do that Google Photos slideshow on a Lenovo?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do it all the time.  All day long, mine shows pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because really, that's half of what this is, is a digital picture frame, right?  Yeah, because it's always on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, will you troubleshoot with me?  Where is Google pulling that information from?  This is actually useful for anybody because I-  Well, they know everything, don't they?  My Google Home, it only pulls from two options for my slideshows, and they're crappy options.  It doesn't pull from all of my Google Photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So right off the bat, the live photos that they counted with this new Google Home Hub  where it automatically adds pictures of a person or pet, that's not even available yet.  So we don't have that on the Lenovo and Google Home Hub doesn't have it either.  But you should be able to do it in your Google Home app because that's where I did it because  I just have an album of Norm just going all day long when I want, and then I switch it  to pictures of Earth, you know, whatnot.  So it should be in the Home app, safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I have it in the Home app and it says, hey, we'll pull it from Google Photos on the  Google account that I use for most of my personal photos.  But it only shows me two options, like two album options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how many albums do you have on Google Photos?  I'm getting guess.  What?  Maybe they're set to private or something.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, maybe.  OK, anyway, this is this is what I was doing yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I have other options, so I'm guessing maybe they're set to private or

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  something. So would you recommend that people spend 50 bucks more for the Lenovo 8 inch  or 100 bucks more for the 10 inch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It depends on the use case.  If you just want a smart hub control where everything is aggregated, all your devices  and you get the Google Assistant and occasionally might watch some video or something,  no, get spent 150 bucks and get the Google Home app.  It's cheap. But if you want to maybe do duo calls, I'm not saying people do, but if  you do, I got my Facebook portal for that.  Good luck. Don't call me on that.  But, you know, if you want to watch, you know, YouTube TV or YouTube  videos or whatever it is that you want to Chromecast to it, I enjoy the experience  better on a larger display.  So for me, it was worth at Costco the extra fifty dollars to get the 10 inch Lenovo  smart display because they were selling it for one ninety nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't figure out how to unorder the Facebook portal.  If I could, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Once you're in, you're in.  You're in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's really sad because I had to reactivate my Facebook account just to order it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That you you know, you know, that that was I hate that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I blew it. I really blew it.  You blew it. Liam.  Well, somebody in the chat room pointed out, you don't have to review this.  No one else is going to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only the media people are going to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And not only that, I bought the three hundred fifty dollar 10 inch, 15 inch one.  That's really silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, honestly, even if it was the most amazing.  Camera interface, most seamless, I would still be pissed at anyone who recommended  it to people because you can't you we can no longer evaluate devices without  understanding the privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's a good point. We're not just reviewing the hardware here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think we need to in the media, get on that train and stay on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Michael and our chairman says, review it, autograph it, sell it on eBay for charity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But nobody will buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what I'm going to use it, I'm going to put it in the front door.  It'll scare people away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bad guys. Oh, no, he's got the Facebook portal.  Get out of here. Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's linking me right now to my Facebook account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to get on a Roomba and have it go around the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, scare the kids at Halloween.  That's a good idea. I could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook, of course, says, hey, good news.  We mentioned maybe as many as 90 million people were hacked.  We've done an investigation.  It's only 30 million people.  Good news. 29 million, something like that.  Good news. It's amazing that something could be some companies could be so big  that the 30 this means 30 million Facebook users  had their account hijacked with this flaw without their knowledge  and that they could say, hey, it's less than we thought.  It's not so bad. 30 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did think wasn't didn't they originally think it was 50 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  90. They well, there's 50.  And then there was another 40.  And they thought maybe it could be as many as 90.  It's only 30. Good news.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I really you know,  if this thing comes, I'm just slapping a return label on it and sending it back.  I'm sorry. I'm not going to review it.  I you're right. I was nuts to even think it was a moment of weakness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, I can make you stop delivery on a Facebook portal,  but I can't make you order a roadie, Matic.  I just don't understand you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, if well now.  Oh, that's an interesting point.  Because I bought two of these  for almost $700.  I mean, you do get $100 off when you buy two.  So that's how much is a roadie, Matic.  I can almost that's a thousand.  Yeah, that's you know, they offer me a unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could send it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't do review units because what if I get hooked on the roadie, Matic?  Then I have to send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, actually, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bought the Heston Q  Bluetooth enabled burner and pots that you recommended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did not recommend those.  In fact, I told you you shouldn't have bought them.  What? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I just thought that was kind of silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was Alex Lindsay who said I should buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. Yeah, it was like it wasn't me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm so I'm so ambivalent about it.  They've been sitting in the back of my car.  I've been driving around with them for a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unopen. You do.  Once you've bought it, you should probably at least try it.  Maybe you'll maybe you'll think differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At least this doesn't spy on my eating habits  or does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It counts how many wrote it doesn't spy on yours personally.  Oh, wait. I heard the Heston Q.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what is the roadies?  We know the roadie Maddux spies because it says how many roadies have been made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, it does know, but it doesn't individually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It says on its very front page of its website,  how many roadies have been made by roadie Maddux?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's like a million more than last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go roadies. It was 29 million and something last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Every second, another roadie is made by the roadie Maddux.  There are 30 million 244,000,  199 roadies have been made by the world's most popular food robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a small category.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't believe the Heston.  So it's tracking metrics from the pan for both diagnostic and that sort of thing.  I don't know if it's individually  capturing and keeping what you cook.  It may grab that and anonymize it, but it may not.  Like the June gives you the option of doing some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to say, Lisa's already frustrated with the June and she says,  we're swapping it, we're going to bring it to work and swap it back in our old.  Why annual toaster oven?  Because it's too hard.  It's that she all she wants to do is make toast and it takes three button presses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they did.  So they they do add the.  They say, hey, is it toast?  You're like, yes. And then it's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and then every single time it says, put your rack in the middle.  It's in the middle.  I haven't moved it since I made toast yesterday.  And every single time and then after it's done and plays this little tune,  it says, do you want to toast some more or do you want to stop now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't have to actually.  It'll stop automatically after time when you pull your toast out and let it shut.  It'll leave that up there.  And then eventually it's like, oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it feels neglected.  It's just sitting there.  It's like asking into space.  Do you want me to toast some more? I'll toast some more.  You want me to anybody? Anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So just got toasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. I know. I know.  Kevin, Kevin on the on the board, he's running the board.  He's Mr. Toaster. He's good.  No, he's good.  Hackers stole millions of Facebook users.  Highly sensitive data. We mentioned that.  And the FBI has asked it not to say who might behind be behind it.  I don't. This is Rob Price writing for Business Insider.  Facebook says the FBI has said, please don't say who is behind this hack.  What the hell? What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The government told me not to tell you.  That's awesome. We're act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're cooperating with the FBI, says Facebook.  Facebook executive Guy Rose.  So is the government.  Yeah, which is actively investigating and has asked us not to discuss  who may be behind this attack.  Well, that really raises a question.  You know, a question it raises for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is what the FBI tells people not to talk about stuff.  And you can say that.  What the heck is happening with that Bloomberg story, man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still I I'm with Bloomberg.  I'm with Berg.  OK, we had Mark Millian in from Bloomberg Business Week on Sunday on Twit.  And I gave him the fifth.  He knows is Jordan Richardson. He knows Jordan.  He worked across the desk from his very good security reporter.  He says he knows all the technical details, but this was a general audience article.  So it's not laden with the technical details, but you could ask him.  He would tell you, he says this was they were working on this  since the Obama administration has been a two year process heavily vetted  by management, by their by their editor in chief.  They really worked on it.  And I think, you know, he says it's absolutely credible.  And I think we're going to see more evidence that it's credible.  I just there's no way somebody like Bloomberg Business Week  puts this on their cover of their magazine, unless they're 100 percent certain.  Jordan Robertson, I should say.  And Michael Riley, the authors of this.  No, I still I think it's completely credible.  And again, as we said last week, the the issue isn't  from from our point of view, well, who did what when?  But that this happens all the time.  We know it happens. We do it. They do it.  It happens in the supply chain.  It happens during, you know, shipping.  And it's very hard to fix because we don't we  don't want to make stuff in the United States anymore.  Yep. OK, where are we?  And Amazon unveils this is a little we're going to throw you a little IOT bone here.  Oh, Amazon unveils three new APIs that send camera data.  From smart cameras and doorbells to echo devices.  Makes it easier for Amazon developers to tap into connected  security cameras and doorbells, it's the doorbell event source API,  the motion sensor API and the Alexa RTC session controller.  And it doesn't have to be an echo  I mean, Amazon bit of hardware, third party smart home apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is yeah, we have been waiting for this for a while,  like even Ring after they were bought by Amazon.  We're still waiting. Yes. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well, it'd be just for rings or will it be for everything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if it's an API, right?  Now, the question is, who's going to actually build for it?  So the biggest like August actually built something custom.  That's a little bit different to put their stuff in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Amazon says both Ring and August support doorbell event source and motion sensor.  So August, which is not an Amazon device, does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Arlo has supported I've been able to look at my Arlo's on my Arlo cameras  by Netgear on my echo for a while.  So they're either using it or they're going to port to using this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what does this mean for end users?  Give me a use case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If someone wants to if a company wants to implement this,  you'll be able to see your camera feeds on your Echo show or your Echo spot.  Or is there another device with a camera with a screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. So maybe I or your TV, because there are a lot of echo enabled TVs now. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So I don't know if it I assume it would work on the fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have, you know, this 100 inch high sense TV is echo enabled.  I would love it if it would just display.  Is it my front door? Who's at my side?  You know, that would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The downside is if you choose not to use it like Nest,  Nest does not make any of their camera APIs available to third parties.  You're not going to your Nest gear won't work.  So your Dropbox and stuff won't show up there.  The other thing is there's a lot of latency.  So it's not great for doorbells or security cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the time you see the picture, they've already left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's taken about five seconds.  Yeah. Where you're like, show me this.  It's a long time when you're like, oh, the doorbell just rang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So does this enable two way communication as well?  I think it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, my my stuff had two way communication on it.  So I'm guessing like I could I could shout through my camera  with two way audio on it.  Through that echo, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm thinking you'll be you'll be able to,  even if you can't see who's at the door, you could speak to your echo and say,  who's there or I'll be right there or whatnot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you still have to establish the connection and that's what takes time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Although, although, although.  And Leo, I don't know.  Do you do you have a Nest Hello doorbell, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a Ring doorbell because rings the sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry. Thank you for playing. But the Nest,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Nest that works with the Google Home Hub, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does. But it gets better.  It also works with this on the Pixel stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what's the latency on that?  Do you have you noticed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I tested it because I have an Nvidia TV Nvidia Shield TV box.  I still use an Android TV as do I.  And I have my doorbell pop up on there and takes about five seconds,  just like we were saying with the other products.  It was about we tested it yesterday morning at five thirty in the morning,  because my wife was going to walk the dog.  She hit the doorbell and it showed up here in about one second on my phone.  But it has to be in the stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have a shield.  But I don't have the doorbell,  but I do have some Nest cameras around the house.  Can you will those you can see those?  I have the outdoor Nest cameras.  Actually, it was really handy  when that woman drove over our mailbox while we were on our last vacation.  Mm hmm.  We we were in Japan and I'm looking and I said,  what happened to our mailbox?  Because we have one of those rural things and it was.  And so I scanned back through the video and I could see this woman.  And it turned out to be the newspaper delivery lady who's driving her car.  She's folding newspapers and just watching her car just kind of veer off the road,  slaughter our mailbox.  If you're back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's one of the that's one of the things people don't think about with these cameras.  I mean, it's great to see who's coming to the door and everything, but there's lots of stuff I look at.  Yeah, yeah. Like six months ago, we we we park our car on the street here.  We were in a townhouse community.  My wife went out to the car at six a.m.  and there were pieces all over a big dent in her car.  And what happened?  So I went back to the nest that's facing front.  And sure enough, the night before, people from across the street hit it.  I had all the footage.  They claimed not to have hit it.  And I'm like, there you are pulling out of your driveway, hitting my car.  So their insurance company paid for everything, including our deductible, because I had the video

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in this case.  At first, I was perturbed until I looked at my ring doorbell  and I have the video of her immediately after coming knocking on our door,  coming back three hours later, knocking on our door, coming back three hours after that.  She felt terrible.  And and I called her.  She left a message, like a 30 minute message, which I didn't hear because I was in Japan.  But when I got it, I called her back and said, don't don't worry about it.  Thank you for being so honest. It's fine.  We didn't like that mailbox anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, for crying out loud, she deliver newspapers.  She probably doesn't have a lot of money to make mailboxes, right?  Right. Well, that's true.  I want to get on her.  I wonder if I saved it as a clip.  I wonder where that would.  I could show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. Don't don't do that to her.  That's not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who needs Facebook portal for privacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've got Leo's camera there.  Yeah, don't don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come on. Don't you want to see it?  The chair is going, yes, show it, show it.  All right. I won't show it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that was a really bad moment in her life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was. And I felt really good when I called her up and said, oh, that's honey.  That's fine. Don't worry about it.  She's an older woman.  And, you know, I said, you just next time, try to stay on the road.  OK, I don't want you to get hurt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I am.  I appreciate I both appreciate and kind of sad about it, you know, like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of I know because now everything is on camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in little things like, you know, it's kind of fun to like.  You know, see like the kids getting their Halloween candy on your camera.  But it's also like  the kids can't go ring people's doorbells and run away anymore.  I guess that's not great.  But like, remember when you toilet papered people's houses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, they can't do no, no, no, don't and Dangan dash or whatever they call it.  Here's you can see this.  You can't identify her.  There's the mailbox over here on the right.  OK, and let me let me speed it up a little bit.  Here's here comes her car.  See, there it is.  She's driving. She's driving.  She's delivering the newspapers.  Now she's folding the newspapers.  It's actually kind of kind of fun to have this.  It's not so good that I posted it on Reddit or anything.  But watch out, there's a mailbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, crap.  Whoops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, anyway, it's not that it's not as exciting as I remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really exciting when, you know, you're like, aha, I got her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  No, it was puzzling.  Like, why is my mailbox lying on the ground?  It's funny because I never had cameras.  I never wanted cameras.  In fact, I was always of the opinion that that kind of paranoia  and lack of trust leads to people doing bad things to you.  Like if you trust you leave your door unlocked, everything's going to be fine.  And it's always been that way.  But, you know, we had to test these out and try them and stuff.  So I put them around and this all the different cameras and stuff.  And it's kind of cool. I have one in my office.  Our 15 year old goes around throughout the house for a while.  I've had three or four in the house and unplugged them or knocks them over,  puts them under furniture.  He doesn't want any video, no video.  So I honor his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I honor that, too.  And I thought you were going to show the video of her knocking on your door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Identifiable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, that's what I was like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a car hitting my mailbox and not even really just kind of side swiping.  I think we should blow some trumpets because it's time for you.  Ready for this, Kevin? The Google change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  Going behind the design of the new Chromecast,  people have been now reviewing the Chromecast, as you pointed out last week,  it's only 1080p, but it is 60 frames a second.  It's not a massive improvement.  Most of the people reviewing it say you don't need the new Chromecast  if you've got the old Chromecast.  If you have a 4K, you're going to get the Chromecast ultra anyway.  But here is a conversation about details about the new Chromecast.  You know what? Here's a typical exchange  between the Google interviewer and the Google employee.  So what sets Chromecast and made by Google products apart from other devices?  It's the design language.  This is the reason I wanted to join Google.  We're making tech that's approachable, human centric  and easily blends in with other things in your house.  Everything to know about the Google Assistant on our new family of hardware.  This is a post on the keyword by Manuel Bronstein.  He's the vice president of product for Google Assistant.  It's kind of an all on one page.  Listing of things you can do with assistant, like screen calls,  block spam, book reservations, new accessories, how to manage them.  Worth reading.  It's not that long, shorter than that tweet storm.  But it'll give you some some maybe some insight if you've got one of these.  Here's something Jeff would be happy Google Plus  in G Suite gets content tagging, custom streams and more engagement and metrics.  I think the Google Plus team is like that Japanese soldier  who didn't know the war was over but was living at Okinawa for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're not truly shutting Google Plus down.  They're shooting, turning the consumer version off.  So there is going to be a business or enterprise.  Yes. And Jeff has G Suite.  It'd be the one thing Jeff has that we don't sign in.  Exactly. Actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is this do they see this as an intranet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We used it at Google all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they use it internally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  So sometimes it would sometimes it'd be for product information, updates,  secret projects that aren't so secret anymore or or just communities.  They had some great communities at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you can have a private Google Plus for your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, Google does.  I don't know if we can.  Well, that's the question, right?  Yeah, it probably isn't private because I think  you can invite people from outside.  I don't know. I don't know.  Here's the completely going away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The final sentence.  Even though Google Plus for consumers, look at me, spell consumers.  It's kind of the modern spelling.  No, he is being ditched.  It's very much alive and kicking in the enterprise.  So there and you thought Google Plus was dead.  Google Cloud basically like slack.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  No one knows.  And by the way, what business is going to invest any time at all in Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Knowing that at any moment  it could follow its consumer version down the dustbin of history. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody's going to nobody's nobody knew is going to adopt it.  Yeah. Google Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Cloud adds cloud identity, cloud, IAP and secure LDAP.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Next item.  No, that's enterprise people out there.

Thank you for recommending the white album.  50th anniversary edition.  Did you order? I did immediately.  Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  November 4th.  That sounds about right.  Something like that.  Yeah, a couple weeks.  Yeah, I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what I heard today for the first time?  What? November 9th.  Sorry.  Okay. On Sirius XM.  The only reason I subscribe to Sirius XM is because they have a dedicated Beatles channel.  And as I was coming home from class just before the show,  they were doing a tour of Abbey Road Studio and they played the very first recording the Beatles ever made there,  which was their audition.  And it was the Let It Be.  No, Bonnie? My Bonnie?  What was the first one?  Oh, come on. Now I can't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is to get Capitol to sign them.  Love Me Do. Sorry.  Love Me Do. That was their first hit.  That was actually a hit, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was. That's what got George Martin to sign them.  But they played the audition tape.  Is it different?  Yes. Yes, it's different.  It's not tremendously different, but most of these, you know,  re-recordings and all aren't very different.  But it was very interesting to hear the very first Abbey Road recording of a Beatles song.  Wow.  Yeah.  Not that anybody cares, but you and me.  How can I get that? How can I get that?  Tune into SiriusXM.com slash twit.  I don't know.  I don't have Sirius.  They sell an internet only package so you can stream it.  I'm almost positive they do.  They have to. I mean, they can't just rely on satellite when the internet is kind of everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twenty-seven early acoustic demos, fifty session takes,  and the original album's thirty tracks newly mixed by Giles Martin,  George Martin's son.  He did the Sergeant Pepper remix too, right?  He did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And he worked with his dad on the whole love show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That love show is so good.  How many times have you seen that?  A dozen.  Yeah.  It's so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every time I go.  I keep trying to get Stacey to come with me.  What?  Yes. She won't go.  She's too young.  She doesn't remember the Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no. The last time I just had other, I wanted to sleep.  I'm so lame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She had other commitments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your Beatles commitment is terrible.  You wanted to sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. I am not good.  Not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's such a fun show.  Even if you don't like the Beatles.  But if you like the Beatles, it's like heaven.  It's heaven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen to her.  Yeah, sure. We'll go this year.  Yeah, sure, sure, sure.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you got for us, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to do what I have for you because I didn't know it's kind of like something  that one of your sponsors actually does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't care.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Please.  I do.  Editorial independence, as you know, think of me as O'Malley is very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I did upload that picture of the Hulk behind me if we want to show that for my thing.  I'm fine with that.  I put it on the show notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  We'll show Kevin's picture of the Hulk.  This is we were playing before the show.  I am really stoked by these AR things.  There's Kevin.  And the Hulk apparently reacts to expressions.  So he does different things.  All of them do.  But come on, give us your pick.  I don't want anybody ever feel like they can't pick something because it's competes with  a sponsor.  That's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Well, so this is actually sort of old news because it was announced in March, but it  just was kind of re-announced on the Google Cloud blog.  And this is the VPN service called Outline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  This was intended originally for journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  But you can certainly use it yourself.  And what I found really interesting about it, you can put it on your own server.  Okay, that's no big deal.  But you could actually have it hosted in the cloud through a number of host providers.  Including our sponsor, DigitalOcean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  See, there's always a sponsor connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It looked to me, and I haven't set it up yet, but it looked to me like you can actually  have specific controls around different devices in your house.  And that's important to me because if I VPN everything, then I lose my YouTube TV, my  Netflix, everything else.  So I'm wondering, hmm, maybe on like a Google display, could I not have it connected to  the VPN through those services?  So I'm going to play with that.  And I just thought to mention it because it might be interesting to some of the viewers  who maybe are journalists or not journalists.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  VPNs use open VPN, but this is Google's own open source and I might point out independently  audited VPN platform.  Yes.  So you know what?  This doesn't really compete because it's kind of roll your own.  Correct.  So, you know, and if people just want to turnkey VPN, they're not going to go to this.  But if you're interested, you know, even in maybe you want complete security and run it.  One of the problems with the VPN is you have to trust the VPN provider.  Well, you could write it yourself off your own server.  Yep.  Then how safe would you feel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cool.  Pretty safe until I put a Facebook portal in my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  First thing I'm doing is calling you, Tuffel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't pick it up.  Don't pick it up.  Guess what?  It's Leo on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's 15 inches.  This thing is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only way I would take a call from you is if we played some vinyl over the Internet  to each other with the Beatles.  That I can do.  Beatles music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because everyone already knows you love the Beatles.  Yeah, I already see that.  Although what if you had bootleg content?  What if it?  What if I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait a second.  Where'd that come from?  Everybody has bootleg content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why do you think I need a VPN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right.  That's right.  He's been sneaking into Abbey Road late at night.  What do you have for us, Stacey Higginbotham?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do not have anything that I've actually tried.  I'm so sorry.  I've been on the road.  The world is a horrible place.  I did see this and I thought it was interesting.  It is called Helm.  It is a startup that gives you...  I saw this.  Yes.  Yeah.  It's basically a storage drive and a pre-configured email server that you buy and you put in your  home.  It's unclear to me if it's a $500 device, but it looks like there might be other subscriptions  related to it.  Yeah.  It's $100 after the first year.

Transcript:  I read about this on Hacker News.  One of the really great things about Hacker News and Y Combinator is that you've got smart  people reading it and commenting on it.  The immediate reaction from people was, how could this possibly work?  Most importantly, most internet service providers block outbound email.  Furthermore, if you do it yourself, there's no guarantee you won't be blocked because  most IP addresses are reused and most of them have dings.  You need a clean IP address.  One of the Helm creators got on to answer those questions.  Some really useful stuff.  The CEO and co-founder of Helm.  Cross-reference IP addresses we assign to gateways against known blacklists that keeps  you out of the black holes.  They fully support DMARC, DKIM, and SPF, which is really important email authentication.  They configure reverse DNS as well.  This is for somebody who says, I don't trust provider XYZ, whether it's Google or Yahoo  or Outlook to store my mail.  I want to store my mail myself.  Your stuff will get run through Amazon's S3, but it doesn't get stored on S3.  It's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon doesn't look into individual customers' S3 instances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Still, if you say, I use fast mail for instance.  I don't use Google for my mail.  I use fast mail.  I'm trusting fast mail, but if you don't trust anybody, Amazon's assurance is not going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're rapidly leaving that world where you could be totally self-sufficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that that's the case.  If you have always wanted to run a mail server, this would be a lot easier probably than running  Postfix and all.  It's an interesting idea.  I'm glad you brought it up actually.  Thehelm.com.  If you think outline is hard to set up, it's not for the faint of heart.  You can run your own personal email server.  Honestly, if you really care about this kind of stuff, you probably want to get a business...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You probably do it on your own.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was kind of curious.  Because all consumer ISPs block port 25.  They're not going to let you do...  Because of spammers, they're just basically not going to let you send out email.  Plus you get black-holed because...  But this sounds like a good way to get around all of that stuff.  So that's interesting.  Yeah.  I'm glad you mentioned it.  Thehelm.com.  It's kind of a cute looking box.  I wouldn't mind having that in my house.  It is a cute looking box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  500 bucks.  Kind of expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A lot easier than setting up an exchange server.  I'll tell you that right now.  Stacy, always a pleasure.  I got to pick stacy on iot.com.  Get on over there.  Sign up for the email.  Get on our mailing list.  Listen to the podcast she does with Kevin.  You recorded this morning, I take it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did.  This week, we did not do the same show.  What'd you do?  Exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you mean you didn't do the same show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some weeks, the news that we cover is IoT focused.  So I feel like we do the show and then we come here and we do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this show you mean?  Yes.  No.  In fact, you talk about a lot of stuff, including the Facebook portal.  Our opinions have not changed.  What you didn't know is Leo bought one.  That's what you didn't know.  And then don't forget to get the IoT newsletter.  Kevin Toffle has a great site for people who are interested in Chromebooks.  Do we have any idea when this slate is coming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So short of a Best Buy listing that had a release date of November 22nd that has now  been pulled, we don't yet have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so it won't be on Thanksgiving Day.  Might be the day after.  We'll have it there on Black Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because does Best Buy open some companies?  Oh, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They open at night on Thanksgiving Day.  Maybe that makes sense.  That might be a Black Friday deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could be.  Could be.  That means I'm going to skip Thanksgiving dinner then because I'm getting me a pixel  sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  And apparently the Chromebook Spin 13 is live now.  I have the Chromebook Spin 15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That thing is a monster, but it's a beast.  It's awesome.  It's a Chromebook like you never saw before.  It's a tank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is all from Kevin's great site aboutchromebooks.com.  Chromebooks Chrome OS and Chrome tablet news.  Thank you, Kevin, for being here.  Thank you.  My pleasure.  It's really great to have you.  You too, Stacey.  I appreciate it.  We do this.  We can Google with these great people, such great people.  You know, superlatives have lost their oomph ever since President Trump has gotten into  office because saying somebody's great is just like normal now.  So I need a new word.  Spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have this problem too.  On the show, when we're doing our show, I'm constantly, we have an awesome show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't say that anymore because it's like, it's devalued all superlatives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have a show.  That's all we say.  We have a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not great.  It's just a show.  Yeah, it's not great.  It's not not great.  It's just a show.  And we do this show every, every afternoon, every Wednesday afternoon, once a week at  1 30 p.m. Pacific 4 30 Eastern 20 30 UTC.  Actually at a couple of weeks, we're going to, we're going to have to fall back.  Fall backward will be at 21 30 UTC.  No, we'll be at 19 30.  I don't know.  I'll have to do the math.  There's an app for that.  Yeah, it's still 20 30 UTC.  You do the math.  You can, if you know what, if you get confused and you can't watch it live at twit.tv slash  live or join the chat room at IRC dot twit dot TV, you can always get it on demand at  your convenience any time of the day or night by going to twit dot TV slash twig or even  better subscribing in your favorite podcast application.

We'll see you next time on this week in Google.  Bye bye.
