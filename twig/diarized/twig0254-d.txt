We're a little late today because of the Amazon announcement  We'll talk about the fire phone in just a second  Also here, of course host of all about Android creator of think up at think up comm Gina Trapani founding editor at life hacker  Hi, Gina. Hey good to be here. Good to see you  Now did you last night on all about Android?  Did you kind of speculate about what?  Amazon might be up to with their new phone or yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday was gonna be an AT&T exclusive  So we talked about that a little bit. I mean, honestly  Not yesterday, but we had heard kind of rumors of maybe like some sort of Amazon Prime data plan that didn't really come to fruition  Right. It's just kind of a standard two-year contract with AT&T, right?  It's very standard  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only deal is if you're a prime member you get a year of prime free which is like a $99 discount  Yeah, yeah, so that I mean that's something I thought it was gonna be a little bit more prime

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oriented like the phone is free if you get prime or you get some sort of special data plan. That's Amazon  I don't know my imagination kind of gone wild with that a little bit because I think there's room for a lot of  Innovation around contracts and you know, the way that carriers work here in the US is you know, so awful  I was thinking well Amazon's really gonna you know, they're they're gonna be like  You know, they're gonna draw on prime members and they're gonna offer something, you know, we haven't seen before  So they didn't with it with the carrier situation. It didn't feel that way. Do you do get that prime discount?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's pretty it's pretty much in fact, I think Paul Theron observed this a testament to the power of the carriers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a interesting comment. It's true. Yeah, you can't do a phone anymore, you know, you have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to have a carrier even Amazon doesn't have enough market cloud to do it to go its own way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's a whisper net is that is that's that's the way that you you you can you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Be listening to the book and then it sinks with when you realize whisper sink. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so whisper net  I'm sorry. You're right now  So when Amazon first came out with a Kindle, you may remember they offered unlimited lifetime 3g connections  So you could download your book anytime anywhere originally was with sprint but of late was no Wi-Fi indeed. There was no Wi-Fi  right  And now it's with AT&T. So it's basically internet access on the Kindles  Was was originally unlike the basic, you know, E ink Kindle

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right. I had sort of thought maybe whisper net, you know, I don't know what network that is  It's AT&T. It's AT&T in the back end  You know, maybe Amazon will give free access to amazon.com, but we didn't we didn't really we didn't really see that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had kind of given up on that because they didn't do with the fire TV. They that's 99 bucks  They didn't do they haven't subsidized anything. I guess that the Kindle HDX the Kindle fire tablets are  Less or least less expensive, but they're roughly Nexus 7 pricing. They're not  Wildly inexpensive Amazon has always said hey, we don't have to make money on the device  We make money when you use it, but apparently they've decided to make money on both sides now  Because it's that's an expensive phone 650 bucks  Unsubsidized for the 32 gig version 750 bucks for the 64 gig version will be shipping June 20  I'm sorry July 25th five weeks  But there are some interesting things and I think for this crowd the most interesting thing is this is an Android phone  But at this point, here's my barely at this point  I would propose that we can now say they call it fire OS 3.5 that there is a  Fourth you know major  Mobile OS you've got iOS you've got Android you've got Windows Phone and now I think you could say safely say that fire  It's certainly not Android and you can't it's not a store. You can yeah, and it's not skinned Android  It's not like touch wiz or sense  It's it's amputated Android. Yeah, you would I mean you wouldn't they don't mention Android the only time they use the word on the page

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they use it once starts with Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh really yes, well, that's it. That's a departure. They never said that with the Kindle fire

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About the you know OS 3.5 whatever starts with Android

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's for developers to say look your Android app is gonna work on this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's definitely about developers. Yeah, I mean there's there's Google there's Google Android and then this fire OS  I think the fire OS is a very legitimate and will be very widespread  Android fork, I mean it's it  I mean, I think it's legitimate to call it a fork. Yeah, it's definitely a fork

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a fork of what what code did they start with 422 a OSP I'm not sure what version

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean they're the first company to sort of successfully  You know for or build an entire proprietary layer right on top of the AOSP to replace Google services  That's where Google's competing right with with Google services and play services and the Play Store and all those things  So it makes me happy because it's like oh, yes Android truly is open. There is an opportunity here  I mean, I think a lot of people for a long time said Android isn't really open. There actually is an opportunity  Nobody would ever start  From Android and build their own thing. They would just start from scratch. Well  We don't need to start start from scratch anymore. The operating system is built now. It's about the services and and the cloud APIs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And in fact interesting part Amazon is one of the few companies with enough  Size of clout and money to  Provide those services itself. It looks like in fact, we know this now. It's licensed the Nokia here maps for the maps  And those are actually arguably as good as Google Maps if not better. I think they're very good  So that's where it's getting its maps  What other you don't have a Play Store because for a long time Amazon has done its own store 200,000 apps in their store  Yeah, the app store they can even argue. It's more curated than the Play Store, right?  It's smaller

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those apps don't have access to Google Play Games Google Play Services, which you know, that's that's the part of the Google experience  But yeah, I mean I I uploaded my app to the Amazon App Store  My sales are not nearly what they are on the Play Store. That's interesting, but it's but but yeah, it's there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What did it involve to get your to do to text you're talking about? Yeah to do text. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, my app is pretty simple and doesn't interact with any of the Google API as a proprietary Google API as it interacts  Of course with the Dropbox API uses the Android SDK for Dropbox, which is you know  available for free from Dropbox and  So submitting it to the Amazon App Store  I didn't have to make any modifications the same exact APK that I've loaded to the Google Play Store. There's a review process  It took some time for them to review it and get back to me  And in fact at one point one of my versions I've uploaded several versions at this point got stuck in the review queue for really  A long time I had to I had to kind of get in touch and nudge them  I don't know what happened. It fell down a hole or something  But that's really the main difference is that there's a review process and sales are not as high  Right as they as as as in the Play Store with the Play Store you upload it and the binary just goes  Well take some time for the Play Store cache to clear but you're talking about a few hours  Amazon has contacted me quite a few times  Asking if I wanted to make my app the free app of the day because they do a bunch of free apps  You know, my app is whatever two bucks  Which is which was nice and flattering I turned them down because I was like  If I wanted to give this away free, I would just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't give you any money free is free for that week or where is free I guess it is  Yep, free is free. Oh interesting and you've so but you can turn them down

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can you can you just say, you know, no, thanks. You have to you have to agree obviously

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they don't they so they lose maps but they have apparently they they have the API the 1.0 API  Available if you wanted to use maps  So if you wanted to use a map and to do that text you'd have to use the 1.0 API  But you could call the here maps using that  You lose messaging which means you lose hangouts you lose  voice  That may be more significant, right? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mean not really because I mean Android just has these hooks in to share or to  You know, there's the generic hooks where it's like here's a web page you click on it  If you have multiple browsers installed it's like hey, what's you know, what default app do you want to use if you don't?  I mean if there's you know, they're generic hooks to invoke the dialer  Whatever version of Android you're running. Of course hangouts is proprietary  But I think with with Android's intense in the share menu if you're if your app isn't too embedded into the into the Google  Ecosystem, you know  If you're not using Google Play games and leaderboards and Google Maps specifically you can build a pretty generic  Android app that hooks into the low-level system API is that let you customize it  You know, you know, no matter what layer in of course Google's making this harder to do right because their proprietary services are  increasingly, you know more attractive  What do you lose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it that you what is it updates?  Yeah, you have your Amazon now is it's incumbent on them to keep the OS up-to-date  But yeah, I mean they significantly changed it. So that's not a surprise

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean the mapping if you're building a game, you know, Google Play games is great  You get to get a leaderboards and achievements and you get the social connections

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Amazon has an equivalent don't they they have an Amazon game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure do they?  I don't I don't think I don't think to the extent and you know, Google's only gonna make this, you know more  We have another story on the on the rundown. Google Fit is gonna be  Yeah, a big a big thing and it'll probably  Sounds like it'll operate a lot like Google Play games where it's a platform for fitness apps to talk to it versus just the fitness  app in it of itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Amazon phone doesn't have Bluetooth le I saw yeah no Bluetooth 4. It's Bluetooth 3 it has NFC. That's good  But it doesn't have Bluetooth le  That's a little bit of a surprise  But what it does have there a couple of things I find very interesting  What is this firefly button the physical button on the side of the phone when you press it within one second the camera is launched and  Much like Google's goggles you could point it at stuff and it will be identified  I mean obviously the first intent is that you pointed at a product and it not only identifies it  But I presume brings up Amazon's page for it so you can buy it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if we hear Google screamed out about using their market position and blah blah blah blah  Every retailer in the country. Can you imagine how Best Buy is worried about this?  Because I mean that you know we all do it now I mean I go to the bookstore and I shoot it because I also  Don't have no I have right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, that is if I paintings they showed Renaissance paintings if it sees a phone number on a sign  It will give you the number and it'll give you a chance to dial it  So as you're driving by a real estate sign you could point the phone at it and firefly the number and call

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's gonna be easy for everybody else to catch up on though isn't it? Yeah, that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's great, but yeah, that's software. Yeah. Yeah, in fact Google bought word lens remember the  Automatic translation software. Yeah, I mean I feel like these are features that Google's had with goggles almost every  One of these not a button away, but yeah, but Google doesn't sell merchandise  So although they are starting to do deals aren't they with people like Best Buy for delivery  Maybe maybe this this pushes Google ahead on on that process

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know, I'm waiting for the story to be it'll come out soon, you know  Some some store somewhere. We'll try to ban use of phones while you're shopping. Oh everyone will

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If our Best Buy I'd immediately say you may not bring this thing in here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Showrooming is the term right where you go. Well, it's the best best nobody going. Have you been in Best Buy lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's there might as well buy it online

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all it's all marketing space for Samsung and Microsoft and Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all they're making the money now. Now somebody said this makes this is interesting that the the payment  API is easier to use for Amazon than it is for Google. So Google goes through the wall  Amazon obviously everybody who has an Amazon phone has an Amazon has a credit card with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes that that hadn't occurred to me, but that doesn't that  absolutely true

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazon made a big point about having an SDK for Firefly so that your app even Best Buy could write an app  That says hey take a picture of it and wolves and then order it from Best Buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, I  Immediately ordered one of course because it's my job, but I'm very intrigued by it has an excellent no desire

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I you know, I'm put a gadget in front of me and I'll I'll I'll you know and ring a bell and I'll start salivating  but

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nothing the by the way, it wasn't 3d. I think it was widely misreported as 3d  The phone does not have 3d. It has what they call dynamic perspective  Four cameras on the front and the four corners that know where your head is  Not only not only angle and position in front of it  But how far away the Z the Z axis how far away it is and then based on that they can modify the image  So that you can look around columns you can you can kind of look around by just moving your head  This is of limited appeal it seems although they did show a game that apparently  Uses it again another product has an API. You know what? I think is very interesting  Have you ever used the mayday feature on your Kindle? I?  Don't really use the Kindle I use Kindle app on my next seven so I have I use it on the fire HDX you press a button  You get lonely yeah, apparently a lot of people who are lonely call this  You within 15 seconds actually the average time Amazon released this last week is nine point seven five seconds  You a person will answer you'll see a video of them. They'll see a video of you  They can control your device at least on the Kindle fire HDX. They can control your device. I presume it'll be the same on the fire phone  They can help you  AT&T says you they'll also have the ability to transfer you to AT&T if you need customer service on your phone  You know for the with the network  We were talking on our launch and Mike Elgin said they probably will have emergency services as well, right?  So you it's like calling 9-1-1 this this mayday button  I think is it is a selling point for first time well. I can't imagine it was that liability oh  Okay, but we'll say you what if you call them up, and you're bleeding from the head, and you say help me  What are they gonna? Do hang up on you Jeff they absolutely have that liability? Oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jesus yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of the Mayday examples that I've seen have been pretty softball questions about like how to use the Amazon  But but what if somebody like I mean I'm trying to imagine my mom  You know I feel like my mom not to use my mom as an example such a terrible example alright my mom  He's my mom  Goes goes Mayday. Hi  I saw this commercial where somebody pointed their phone up at the sky and could see what stars there were like how do I do?  That I feel like the questions would be really broad or like it's a do I can you know?  Listen to the you know the monk singing in Italy right like I'm trying to imagine like  There would be very broad questions. It was Mayday like general tech support

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not supposed to be but like a concierge service you mean yeah  Yeah, that's supposed to be but I can see them they built the infrastructure. Why wouldn't they have the ability to book hotels and?  And answer questions you know I'm trying to find the article. I read a nice article recently

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know supposedly I have that you know with various credit cards. I don't use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, you can call your American Express concierge service somehow I can see well well that's gonna work  I feel like this is a this there could be a lot here say Jeff is having trouble signing into his two Google accounts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Would you may day that well not that specifically, but yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something like that had to remind me

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a there was a really good article I read it was like mayday people have gotten customer reps have gotten marriage proposals

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know creeped out that guy in the commercial remember creeped us out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The woman did cuz she's yeah, he's like hitting me mackin on her and she's going oh  And we point and by the way her she appeared again in the slide deck that Jeff Bezos really yeah  I'm  Trying I really want to find this example they Amazon obviously preparing for this last week published a lot of stuff about mayday and  among other things some examples of  The kinds of things and it seemed like it was a very broad range I  Can't open this jar could you help me?  Probably not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well of course that's gonna lead to a whole whole list of videos of people trying to push Mayday to its limit

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well we thought that when they came out on the Kindle fire HDX and that didn't happen I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thought there'd be a lot of that  But now you can record it easier in your phone. Maybe I don't know yeah I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this is what my most interested about is that they now have an OS  Somebody in the chat room said, and I think this is fairly accurate  Fire OS is to Android what Apple is to Unix  Android is the underpinnings, but you don't see Android. It's an it's not a skin

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an entire interface and MS dos was to CPM  Yeah, I mean you know it's a  Go off on its own go off on its own and here it is. Whatever it is. Thank you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jason clinic Atlantis effin done in our chat room sent it sent me this CNET article that came out a month ago the Mayday button  Amazon reveals craziest Mayday customer support calls  This actually was in a letter to shareholders marriage proposals requests to speak with Amy the redhead we talked about  Say me there. No she went home  35 marriage proposals 475 requests to talk to Amy 109 requests from customers needing assistance with ordering a pizza  And they don't hang up on you  By a slim margin Jeff Bezos writes Pizza Hut wins customer preference over Domino's  44 instances when the Mayday tech advisors saying happy birthday to the customer  648 instances when the customer sang a song to the Mayday tech advisor  I could see that they must log this a customer sang me a song. It was bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We need this last one for bedtime three customer requests for a bedtime story

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So I'm looking at Google Play Services

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the advantage that Google has over over Amazon  They've been working with Android longer and they have they have a head start and the truth is that Google Google leads development on a OSP  Google Play Services has a lot of stuff now  I mean granted wallet it may be not as strong as Amazon's commerce tools  But you've got you've got maps and location and Google Plus  Which is like sign in with you know sign in with Google very quickly  Got ads in app billing cloud messaging. I mean just distribution through the Google Play Store  games, I mean, there's you know  Yeah, mobile ads. There's a there's a lot here and I mean Amazon has a lot of things that that match right?  They've got cloud storage that matches Drive. They've got I wouldn't be surprised at all if their e-commerce solution their pay their quick pay  SDKs are much better than than Google's but I don't know Google's been doing this for a while  Google's been doing this for a while even just something like Google Cloud messaging which makes it easier to send push notifications  I mean that's something that a lot of apps probably use and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, but who has better cloud infrastructure Google or Amazon?  I could argue that Amazon has been way ahead of Google in terms of services

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Services. Yeah. Yes. Absolutely. You're absolutely right about that for sure. This is exciting

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, cuz competitions good to have an who would have thought at this late stage in mobile phones we would have a new OS  true and  As one well Amazon's played it perfectly because they started the App Store a few years ago, you know  They it's been clear. They've been building up to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it doesn't  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ladies first Leo Leo was making the comments during your live coverage that this is like a battle of the of the I forget what?  word that you use but the infos of the  Ecosystems, yeah  Ecosystems. Yeah, see I mean as a consumer you almost kind of have to make this decision like am I a Google person?  I don't my app person. I'm an I am is on person or am I a Windows person?  Yeah, there is right because it's just because you know, especially with these devices  It's like I either have all the Google services or I have all the Amazon services, but not both  Right. I feel a little bit like anywhere  True true. It's not like a PC though, right?  Yeah, like it feels like we're harkening back to like are you macro PC time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is you're right generally, but I think there's a few leaks in that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is and I thought this with the Amazon Fire TV too, it's really clear now  Apple Microsoft Google and Amazon the four horsemen, right? Yeah are very much creating their own  Siloed as best they can ecosystems. They they don't too bad  Yeah, in a sense that's too. I mean it's choice, but it's kind of not the not not an open choice, which is a shame  I agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I still frustrated I can't use Skype on my Chromebook for example

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but isn't Google's the most open ecosystem of all of them all yes, because you can use the Amazon App Store on Google on Android  That's what that's the point. I'm trying to make you  But but you make a good point that on your Chromebook at least you can't use Skype  Although I  Suppose Microsoft could decide to do a Chrome plug-in for Skype. That's merely my guess  That's merely more Microsoft's choice Google wouldn't stop them from doing that right doing a Chrome app a Skype Chrome app right nothing to stop them from doing that  so I think Google I think Google has a  At least a bias in favor of open  Yeah, Apple does not have  Microsoft's oddly enough historically not had and is moving more towards  That we were talking about this one does weekly that this is very uncharacteristic  But they released the iPad version of office before they reached this release the surface version  They've really kind of said we're gonna be cross-platform so Microsoft may be moving in that direction  But Amazon's never gonna move in that Amazon knows what its business is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Google you know Google strategy was that was the entire Amazon strategy was was opening it up and right  You know you could say that Amazon used it against them  But but you know also here's the here's a different question then how if you're Google  How do you exploit what Amazon has just done?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well you do one thing that does is this is just as Gina said it confirms what you said all along Android is open  That lets you off a lot. It lets you off the hook. Yeah  I think that anybody that maybe Amazon has made a mistake by offering SDKs for  Firefly its purchasing  technology and for the  Dynamic perspective see the problem with the dynamic perspective is no other phone can do it or can it I don't know  It's just a GP. It's just a GPU accelerated thing right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's good question, but likely it's just for that phone right now, and nobody's gonna cross-platform that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or want to do it  Frankly, it's not it's not interesting enough to want to make it on the iPhone. I thought could do it for sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's sort of it multiplies fragmentation a little bit from the developer side  It's like I'm gonna compile this AVK does talks to these SDKs for you know for for Amazon  I'm gonna compile one for Google. I'm gonna compile one for whatever it has to go through approval processes for all of them, too  Right well well just Amazon right now  But yeah, yes, but it wasn't onerous was it did they?  No, I mean, it's you know it's at the upload it and you say hey, you know you check the box and many of the things  I mean email when my results are back, and then you get an automated email a couple days later  I mean it you know it's just one of those things where like it makes it difficult to plan a launch  I mean I whatever I'm a small indie developers  This is a weekend project, but it makes a little harder to sort of plan a launch and and  You know you have to kind of get get ahead of it. How long before Amazon releases its own language?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not  Like Apple did  All right, let's say let's talk so okay the other shoe is gonna drop though next week  It's Google I oh right yeah and Google  This has been a wonderful month for those of us who cover technology  We've had so much to see and hear and play with and Google gets the last word nice timing Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  True

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well is it is it good or is it or or are they are they rushing to match a feature announcement today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would think not well  But they're certainly gonna get to say they're gonna get to respond and I imagine will  respond with some things that only  Android open handset Alliance can do like for instance  This health health thing thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and and and look Google's gonna tell and they would have done this other anyway  They're gonna tell the distribution power or the Play Store  I mean they're gonna talk about how you know how many billions of downloads how many active users?  How many active users they're gonna talk about how many of those users I think it's over 70% now or KitKat or jelly bean  So the fragmentation problem is basically you know  Right no more toxic healths do right exactly yeah at this point  They're not racing it to answer with any features, but they can certainly just tweak their slides to address any of this stuff  I don't know. I don't know if there's anything here that Google is even gonna. I'll be surprised actually if they if they address  Amazon at all during the keynote we should start we should start a bet we should start some bets

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Response to CarPlay Apple's technology that puts iPhones in the car  Automotive news says if we don't usually report scoops by automotive news. This is the first I'm excited automotive news  Says three sources tell it that Google will unveil its first in-car operating system next week at IO  Known internally as Google auto link it'll be the first project to a move emerge from the open automotive alliance  This is a Google led consortium that includes Audi General Motors Honda Hyundai and  Nvidia which I guess makes the chips for the whole thing it is not an  embedded in infotainment system  That effect my Audi has that right now, it's QNX which Blackberry owns  But it will be much more like what Apple's doing which is a projected system  So that the display displays stuff that it's getting from the smartphone that makes a lot more sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That also means that it's more updatable in the sense that whatever your phone is at that minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can project it and use it but casting casting to the screen in your car, right? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a little chrome cast in the screen  So expect announcements there and demonstrations for the new gal the Google auto link  Will also according again, these are rumors also perhaps see Google fit  Google has tried before to provide a database of health information and ended that some what a couple of years ago now  Microsoft still maintains  Something and of course Apple has announced it's going to do health kit with a health app  Google fit according to the rumor in Forbes  Will also be launched at Google IO  It will aggregate just this is just like health kit through open API's  Instruction sets that allow apps to share information will also announce partnerships with wearable device makers  And  Do things like not only measure steps but also heart rate  It's just all this is a me too. I'm wearing the new  Samsung gear to watch we finally got a sample of this and they've really this is much nicer than the original galaxy gear  The cameras is built into the bezel now instead of being a big protrudence little pimple on the band  It you can actually talk to it you can do s voice commands it'll you can talk on the phone with it I think  So this is  I'm sure do you think we'll see it will see watches next week, right? Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I  Think it's gonna be the LG the rumor is that it's the it's the gouache. It's the LG G watch  So is that what the insiders call it the gouache

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to see the moto 360

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, that's the round one. So I so I think the one that they're giving away is this is the square one  That's so you guys are gonna be wearing a gouache when we go watch  Yeah, I was saying on a last night with with Google fit, you know  I'm hoping to see it I owe next week is run keeper and fit bits  You know up on stage saying we have integrated our apps with Google fit and like these are the things that made it so much  Better, right because those apps have been out for so long and they know so much  And I hope that it's about that  I hope that's about Google's platform sort of helping them out versus but here's trying to replace them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the question if they do that, does it automatically get on the gouache?  Or does the gouache have to support it in other words is the gouache like we were talking about  With the auto stuff is the gouache just a you a cast to the gouache or is the gouache its own thing?  With its own CPU and all of that stuff seems like that would be a good  Way to do that some put less intelligence in the watch itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  I actually am my Fitbit broke and and so I wound up just switching are you running the Fitbit Android app and then switching?  It to just the device have the device count my steps, right?  But my numbers were a lot lower because there's times that I'm walking around the house and I don't have my phone in my pocket  Right because it's in the other room, but with a watch I'm never gonna take that off  So I'm hoping to see a Fitbit or Fitbit like maybe maybe run keeper or just another great app  You know have the Android wear app that's constantly tracking and also using Google fit to tell me when I've you know  Whatever reach my step goal for that day or burn so many calories  And so yeah, I mean I hope that those integrations the Google fit, you know perfectly aligns with Android wear

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do like it. You can talk to you. You can say okay Google do your watch  Just as I do now to my phone and it will go what and you can do that  It's probably got Google now cards  But you come to think of it  They can't make it just cast to the watch because you you probably have the expectation that even if your phone's not nearby your watch  Still works still measures steps. Yeah still does stuff  Yep, okay, so that's you can't do that. The watch does have to have smarts and a battery and all that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, well, I mean I have my I now I have the  What's it called  Your watch what is that? Oh, this is this is the this is the the the it's pretty what does that do?  It's it's a Fitbit kind of thing, but it's not that my if I lost my Fitbit  And so I had this one. This is such a category shine. It's the shine shine shine

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This thing oh, yeah, that's the one. Okay, we did look at that  There's there's something use watch battery so you don't have to charge them, right?  But it does a lot less as a result doesn't have a screen for instance  Well, it has it has little little lights to go. Yeah, Mike Elgin reviewed the shine on before you I tried to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  use the Fitbit as a watch instead of my watch and  You know, it was like saying okay Google what time is it?  Look I just looked at this watch and there it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Skeptical on this category. I really am  Just skeptical

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I can't wait to get it on my wrist

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll be honest. I have worn every everything there is and they're all just glorified pedometers  This I mean really which by the way your phone is anyway  It is anyway as jazz Lisa Lisa as Gina pointed out you just carry the phone around  It measures all your steps does this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like with Google now, this would be totally being a fangirl by the way  But I feel like with with Google now behind Android where and like Android where be like connected to Google now  I feel like the Google watch running or the smartwatch running Android where and having the hooks into the you know  The Google layer is gonna be way better than anything we've seen in terms of smartwatches. I hope you're right  That's why I'm excited about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Canadian court has told Google  Then they have to take down websites

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All over the world all over the world whereas whereas the EU case of the right to be forgotten  They'll only take them down in EU territory. So here is Canada imperialistic world invading Canada  Saying that that they rule the world that you have to do this around the whole world

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  British Columbia Justice LA Fenlin  ordered Google  to remove  websites that  Have guys have stolen intellectual product property from equis tech solutions  used to manufacture competing products  Google had removed equis tech links from Google CA. They wanted more the judge said nope  Gotta remove everywhere in the world I  Note the judge wrote that on the record before me the injunction would compel Google to take steps in  California or the state in which its search engine is controlled and  Would not therefore direct that steps be taken around the world  But that the infection of the the effect of the injunction could reach beyond one state is a separate issue  So in other words he says you got to take them out of your search index in California wherever your servers are  But just that's a side effect that it does it all over the world

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  wherever your servers are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It affects it affects my ability to know something about my right to know there's a very this is really to a very very dangerous trend in  censorship  She compared them she compared them to an innocent warehouse

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That Google is an innocent warehouse that has been forbidden from shipping out goods for companies subjected to an injunction  The local order not to ship could also have broader geographical implications  This is an example of a real-world

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Physical analogy that just doesn't work so good. Let's work Canada get off our lawn. It ain't a shipping. It ain't a warehouse and  And so so so the sense that you're actually the right to be forgotten decision in Europe  We have this Jonah Ossera columnist for the New York Times  Defended the right to be forgotten which I find is a journalist shocking  And what you know what well they shouldn't have nasty things up there. They shouldn't have yucky things up there  So what the New York Times should have good news  Yeah, we have Joe Scarborough who went ballistic on Google. There's video up  I think on the on the rundown on the same issue saying that Google should be forced to take down everything that we don't like  We don't like hello people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can we spell free speech anymore? I we don't this is we get the internet we deserve and it's rapidly looking like it's not gonna be  a very good  Let's take a break when we come back. It's the change log Gina Trapani. You're gonna have to go to work. I'm sorry, but  You lazy person you

It's time for the change log  Google change log  Here's Gina Trapani with the latest

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the lull before the IO storm. So this change log is relatively short. I've got a couple of things  Google knowledge graph adds phone numbers with hangout integration to your search results  So if you search for your local restaurant a bar or business  Google will show you in the knowledge graph the top of your search results a big phone number you click on it and I'll  initialize a call  Via hangouts. I'll tell you truth. I tried it with a couple of pretty famous restaurants here in New York City  I didn't always work  Sometimes it happened I got the the sort of listing in the knowledge graph on the on the right side and the number there was clickable  But really nice if you want to make a reservation or ask if you know what time they're open  Kind of nice hookup and I hope that this means that at IO we're gonna hear a little bit more about  Hangouts and voice and kind of really unifying all the messaging  apps together  Waze Waze got an update. I thought this would make just  Yeah, yeah. Yeah ways is updated for Android and iOS the mobile apps with a new UI and enhanced location sharing features  So the new ways update it now syncs your phone's contact lists with your ways friends  and now you can share your driving routes with multiple friends at a time and  The people that you share your drive with can track your progress and will be provided with a real-time  ETA we should probably use this next week when we're driving up to Petaluma to do to do really be helpful. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Last one forget don't forget to add in the time for me getting out of the car and puking for you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have to get ways to send, you know scared emoticons when we're on the bridge  Google account your Google account settings area has a new section called Google account history  So if you go to google.com slash settings account history or just click on the account history tab  You'll be able to kind of control your history tracking so you can pause it's interesting. They call it pause  You can pause you search history tracking location history tracking and your YouTube history of things that you've watched you haven't and what's neat  About this doesn't sound like much right?  But what's neat about this new tab is that this this page first of all is beautifully designed and when you do click pause  You get a little pop out a graze that graze out the thing and you get a little pop-up saying hey  If you you know, if you pause your say search history tracking Google now is gonna be a lot less useful  You know, you these are some of the features that you'll be missing  And I really like that  I feel like Google does not only needs to give users the the ability to control what information  Google logs and shares across apps like now to Gmail to calendar, etc  But I think it's a really good way to communicate like hey, you know  This is what you get Google now is this smart because this is on and if it's off then  Then these are the features that you won't get  I also think it's interesting that pause was that was the word that they chose instead of stop or don't do this  You know this because pause implies that you're gonna start it again, right? So it's like gentle coercion

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But we're not stopping

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just pausing for now, but this is the kind of thing I'd love to see for Android app permissions, right?  Like this is I got you know, which are long and complex and complicated  I just would love to see like hey if I revoke this one permission or if I you know  You want this one permission for what reasons what features aren't I gonna get?  Anyway, that's that's all I got for today for the change log next week. The entire episode is gonna be a change log  I'm very excited

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can't wait that's the change log  Thank You Gina Shabani sure, thank you  Just do a couple other stories because I want to get you out of here for bedtime  Adobe at the same time as Amazon was having its event Adobe had an event call to upgrade the creative cloud. I  Don't know if there are a lot of big stories out of that. They are gonna continue  Promotion that I've took advantage of that lets you get for as a photographer  $10 a month access to Lightroom and Photoshop the two things photographers use the most  I got that as an upgrade er to from an earlier version or something, but now they're gonna make that permanent  If you have never had a Photoshop license $10 a month you get a Lightroom and  Photoshop that having some features to the iPad app for Lightroom, which is really a spectacular app and a very nice adjunct  If you use Lightroom on the desktop  They've added some new apps ink and slide  Are those apps or those are actual?  Physical pen and a ruler

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's a physical there's a physical  Pen that's pressure sensitive and does neat stuff  And then the neat thing about the ruler is when you set it down and then you just draw next to it  It'll draw the line where it shows you're drawing the line so you could use it for more drafting kinds of things  Pretty cool is a video there. It's pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's really interesting is it's 200 bucks  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So nice to sing POG on Yahoo Tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, David Pogue is weird. Yeah, I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is Lightroom so when you're like a real photographer is Lightroom the sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Accepted app real for a while Apple had a strong competitor with aperture  But they haven't updated in years and so I think most people use Lightroom  It's Apple Lightroom or Windows and it's great  And if you use like if you take a lot of pictures Lightroom is fabulous  But you probably also use Photoshop and if you use Lightroom you probably want to use the iPad app as well because it allows  you to preview your stuff and they've added now the ability to  Rank photos and all sorts of stuff and it syncs up there. It is. That's the that's the pen which is just you know a stylus  Traditional styles the it's the ruler that's interesting and then you have a new app called or two new apps called sketch and line  All right, very nice if it's getting a demonstration she draw directly onto the iPad so weird I  Just I don't  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What we realized was it's digital so it can do a lot more if we just have a single button on here  We can choose different shapes. You see if I click this button. I just can switch to it's just gonna scratch your screen up like crazy  And each of those can be manipulated so it's not I don't like it I don't get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just use it. You can be really all all kinds of exactly. Yes, I guess so  architects use iPads to as we explored for lots of point but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we could

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Draw I hope not by the way iOS only there's no Android. There's no Android which pisses me off  Yeah  There is a route for the galaxy s5. Thank you geo hot  And that geo hot's good. He's released a route tool. That's not only the s5 which has been very difficult to route  including the AT&T and Verizon versions of the s5  Xda members took up a collection for a geo hot of over  $18,000 and once once he got the money he created towel route

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Make it rain and elite

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And  If you're running 442 or earlier you can route with that method  Including I'll test it because I have an s4 that I've never been able to route  it's the unlock the unlocked s4 using an  Samsung processor which Samsung's managed to lock down pretty well  It's based as all of these route solutions are on a kernel vulnerability  Pinkie pie  The well-known hacker Pinkie pie discovered that one  So there so that's the problem is of course they're going to immediately  Now that they know there's there's a vulnerability fix it which means towel won't work anymore  But I do think Google has always said it's it's they you know you should be able to have the right to route your phone  It's the carriers and manufacturers who've thwarted people  Here's a convenience. There's a new smartphone out of China that comes with a malware pre-installed  Saving you time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And trouble the convenient feature won't download updates to the security which is which is convenient. Yeah, so simple simplify your life

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got a spy function on it. It's invisible to the user cannot be deactivated  and  Well, you know, maybe they're selling this to jealous husbands  You know, here's a because we have seen these before phones that are  Have this built-in spy capability  LG says no. Well, no, we're not Google hasn't contacted us about building a Nexus phone. So  LG which built the last two Nexus phones the five four and five apparently not working on any new phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there a new Nexus? That's the big question. That's the question, right? Is there a new Nexus at all?  Maybe not. I don't know. I hope so boys. Isn't that the rumor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We heard that there wouldn't be and then everybody said no  I think silver Matt cuts said no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There yeah Nexus right? Yeah, that's true. That's not exactly but that's what he strongly implied

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that he didn't think yeah, I want a new Nexus. I'm ready for a new Nexus. I mean, I like this one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is wonderful. I don't know if I believe this story. I'm gonna take this with a grain of salt  this comes from a site called social news daily and  They are alleging well first of all that you the rumor is true that YouTube is gonna launch a music service  Kind of like Spotify or RDO add  Supported free streaming music paid tier on top without ads and offline streaming Google already does this with Google music  I might add but I guess you get video  But according to the financial times about 10% of the music industry  Has not yet agreed to the terms of the new YouTube service  Many of them are indie labels like XL recording whose artists included Dell and the XX domino  represents the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand  It's over money obviously, but this is the thing I'm not sure I buy  According to social news daily YouTube will begin blocking videos from indie musicians on those labels  If your label does not agree to terms for the YouTube music service according to this article  Google's gonna not let you upload videos at all. Is that possible? You're to explain this one to me. I think this is false

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is just bogus, but the story is spread like crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems to me Google would have a huge problem if it did that I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think so too. Yeah sounds highly anti-concept  I've got this the Guardian the Guardian says the company's head of content and business operation Robert Kinsel  Google yeah  Total Financial Times that the service previously rumored to be called YouTube music pass will launch more widely later in the year his confirmation  That YouTube will block videos from artists from labels  It's all said this that do not sign licensing deals for the new premium tier will be hugely controversial among indie labels with trade body  WIN already filing the complaint to the European Commission

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Negotiating strategy, but it could be it could be that they are gonna block them from the service  But not from uploading to YouTube anywhere or they block them from YouTube everywhere. I think they are gonna have that is trouble

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, while we wish we had 100% success rate  We understand that it is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is our responsibility to our users and the industry to launch the enhanced  music experience said kinkle  Claiming the YouTube has signed up labels representing 90% of the music industry, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, well, we'll watch that with interest. I find that hard to believe if they do to do that  They're gonna it's not just gonna be the EU that slaps them around. Yeah, cuz this is this is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This doesn't make sense. It just doesn't  And if people like Adele Arctic Monkeys and Jack White, yeah, I think it's independent labels

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's probably a misinterpretation that though he'll block them from the service  But the implication is that that Adele would no longer be able to upload a music video to YouTube  I can't cuz cuz I can't video right that's can't I think well, we'll see yeah, you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I mean anybody can I can upload a music video I can  And I make a music video right and I put it up there wants to stop anyone else including Adele from doing just what would

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What it would come down to is if Google had was of sufficient size  To for this to be, you know monopoly issue a restraint of trade issue if Google can effectively say well  There's 800 other services they could upload it to we just don't want them on ours. I guess they could do that. I  Think Google is at this point  Big enough YouTube is at this point big enough that maybe not in Europe, but certainly in the US that would be restraint of trade  I think  Yeah  Here's another one that I  You know, I don't know what to say about this  I this is a I guess I guess the best thing to do would be warn people about it  This is a Kickstarter project called I find it's a item location tag  They were they went up a few weeks ago. They asked for $25,000. They've raised nearly half a million dollars well over their goal  And as far and I'd love to hear from somebody but as far as I can tell there's no way this could physically work  It is a battery free  Location tag  they claim that they'll be gathering energy through the air and  Storing it there's no battery  It recycles. This is the the text on the page at Kickstarter  It recycles electromagnetic energy and stores it in a unique power bank

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This exciting one is this the one that sir lacy's site has been going crazy on yeah, I think so this exciting feature

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Frees you from the trouble of charging batteries or replacing them through the manufacturer. I don't think that's physically possible  I mean there is RFID, but that wouldn't help you with if you lost your keys  It says sync the tag to your phone and you're all set  The thing is they've raised a lot of money now  I thought Kickstarter had had precautions against this kind of thing  But in fact, I know one of the things Kickstarter requires is a physical prototype. There is none visible  The president of this company  Previous job was selling herbal supplements. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've been very unresponsive in the Q&A's and the thing that really bugs me is this look at this paragraph under risks and challenges  It's a short paragraph says, you know, the main risk is  Our reliance on outside sources within the supply chain if they can't give us these circuits we  They don't mention the fact that this is physical impossibility that would that would seem to be a risk  Maybe I'm wrong. We're not sure if this will work. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny. It's funny. It was funny. I bet it's a better comic uh moment of the week. I think  Was the fcc chairman answering john oliver and john oliver answering in return

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The dingo have you seen this? No, because john oliver did a fabulous  Uh discussion of net neutrality in which he likened having tom wheeler in the fcc regulate  The cable industry likened it to having a dingo watch your baby

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So so chad if you would search for  john oliver  Uh fcc dingo, there we go. So  This is this is this is sure responded a couple of weeks ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, we did a piece about net neutrality  And there was a moment in it where we pointed out that tom wheeler the chair of the fcc  Which is tasked with regulating cable companies was previously a lobbyist for the cable industry  Something of a conflict of interest that we summarized thusly  That is the equivalent of needing a babysitter and hiring a dingo  Sure, it's a little offensive to australia's favorite baby eating animal but needs much for the joke  And you're probably wondering why i'm playing it again now  Well on friday the fcc held an open meeting and this happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm, just wondering if you watched the john oliver segment about net neutrality and what you thought about it  Oh

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said snap, right? Yeah, he's giving you pretty words

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so  What did he think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that it represents  the um  High level of interest that exists in the topic in the country  Um, and that's good

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I am not a dingo  Wait you're going, you know, I I I would like to  State for the record that i'm not a dingo

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He actually said it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  First wow  And second, we never said you were a dingo like said you were like a dingo  Similarly now you're denying it so strenuously. I'm honestly starting to wonder whether you are actually a dingo  After all he even tried to throw us off the scent by pretending not to know what a dingo even is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had to go look it up. It's a feral wild animal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the thing  That's exactly the kind of thing a dingo would say if he didn't want anyone to know he was a dingo. I mean  Just look at a split screen right now  The rightness is uncanny  Think about it  If you if you shave the one on the left, would it not look a little like the guy on the right?  Because now I have lots more questions wheeler such as have you at any time ever consumed a swamp wallaby for its nutrients?  You probably have your dingo  What's your answer to that? I'm not a dingo  You keep saying that  Now the burden of proof is on you unless you can produce an official document  Verify  That you are in fact not a 100 percent talking dingo  I don't think you can complain if americans refuse to leave you alone in rooms with their babies

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You gotta you gotta go back and see the full net neutrality clip because it really  It is probably the best description of why we're worried about the fcc  Uh, but and I should mention that patrick lehi has come back and proposed a bill that would prohibit fast lane

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh prioritization chances of passing god knows but at least we have legislation on to push it  And I want a t-shirt leo that says a dingo ate my internet
