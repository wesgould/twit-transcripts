No, actually, it's the old hosts brought back. It's so great to have you. I missed you all.  I disappointed everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, everybody's happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're like, oh, new hosts. How exciting. And then, oh, it's just them.  But I do have new resolutions that could really change who I am as a person.  Do you really?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My daughter is doing Con Marie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I already do that. Con Marie. Does it spark joy? If not, throw it out.  Something magic of tidying up. The life changing magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Why am I not surprised that you've done that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I haven't done that. That's how I live my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you didn't need Con Marie. It's just who you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do you like my wife love at the container store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I used to, but now I don't have enough stuff to put my stuff in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what Marie Kondo says. It's not about containers. It's about getting rid of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have long said my wife's going to bury me in Rubbermaid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I do have and I can't do it because I have a kid.  So, you know, sometimes I'm like, hey, Anna, let's play my favorite game.  She's like, is it keep or throw out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is. There is a tie in because Marie Kondo has a new show on Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. Have you seen it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Have you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not really excited about watching people.  Tidy up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's perfect, though, for a new year resolution kind of, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. Yes. And I'm curious, like, are these people like super hoarders?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, she says at the beginning of her book, which I am almost embarrassed to say I've read the life changing magic of tidying up.  She says that she's never had any regressions.  No one has reverted to their old untidy lifestyle.  I don't believe her.  I just can't believe that.  Except maybe that she just doesn't take you if you're going to be the type of person who might backslide on her.  Jeff's now going to show us how tidy his office is.  Jeff, you only have one remote? Slacker.  Yeah, that's more like my office.  I can barely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have a lot of credenzas and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's a professor. You have to have credenzas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. And then this is us.  Apparently, Jeff, we've lost your audio.  No, really? Oh, you was just silent.  It was a silent tour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just used to be talking all the time.  Yeah. I never shut up.  Is that what you're saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  Did you guys have a good did you have a good new year?  Jeff, do you do anything fun?  I fell asleep as early as I could.  Yeah.  I stayed up late watching a car wreck that CNN called New Year's Eve.  Oh, with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cohen. Five minutes.  Cohen and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've actually blanked their names out now.  The guy with the white hair.  Anderson Cooper and Michael Cohen. Andy Cohen.  Andy Cohen.  I just was painful. It was painful.  It was.  And what did you do for New Year's Eve, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went to a friend's house and we watched the ball drop.  At 11 o'clock our time and at midnight our time.  And we played games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What? Now, the game we used to play in Ohio while we were drinking ginger ale  and eating ham salad, which wasn't really ham salads made with bologna, was spit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you know what? I used to be a spit champion.  The card game where you like flip out the cards.  Yeah. Yeah.  That's a good game. It's a good game. I did that.  New Year's game.  Yeah. Oh, yeah. That would be good if you're drinking.  No, we used to play that before school and middle school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, ginger ale we were drinking.  When were you in Ohio?  My first wife was from a small town in Ohio just over the border from Indiana called Convoy.  It didn't have a liquor store. It had one light.  And I remember going to have New Year's Eve with her family.  They were Lutherans.  And ginger ale, ham salad and spit till midnight.  Then you'd go out in the backyard, bang the pots and pans, and you'd go to bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Yeah.  We did. So a friend of mine is a wedding planner and she was there and she brought wedding sparklers,  which you guys leg up on normal sparklers.  I've got to tell you they're metal.  They burn for like two minutes.  Those are the old sparklers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are sparklers I grew up with, but you can't get those anymore because they're not safe and sane.  Oh, well.  So I need wedding sparklers.  Wedding sparklers. They were very pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We enjoyed them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, those are the old magnesium.  Did you have any queso?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I did actually.  We had fajitas for New Year's dinner. Yeah, fajitas queso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. That's an awesome New Year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I won't be having those for much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. See what you're giving up.  So what's the planner? When are you moving?  June.  Six more months and then it's queso free.  So you sold them for what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are selling and we will rent for the first year.  Yeah, very smart. Get to know the neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Smart people.  Yeah.  Bleep Blur says in Austin we can only describe sparklers by law.  All right. I am stalling because I don't know if there's news.  There is.  You already got it.  There is news it looks like.  Zach Whitaker has the headline of the year.  Mark Zuckerberg posted something.  This is not the article, but Mark Zuckerberg posted something about what a tough year it was  and how much we're going to work harder next year and all of that.  Year end overview.  And Zach Whitaker had a great headline.  He said, Zuckerberg's tone deaf year end note reads like a thousand words of patting himself on the back  and shows little contrition or empathy for the harm Facebook caused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think empathy is something difficult for Zuckerberg.  I truly do.  I think he's a true believer is I think part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like he believes so much in the value that Facebook's adding to the world.  It's hard for him to see any harm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, that's where the empathy comes in.  Yeah, yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Though I also think that he's data driven and this goes back to his original comment on the Russian stuff and and and  and then if you look at the the different interpretations of the study that the Senate did,  there's a very good story I think in the nation full disclosure as I raised money for my school from Facebook.  I'm independent of Facebook and I received a money person from Facebook running the platforms and disclosure.  But the nation story that was very good saying this Russian stuff was actually penny,  any minor nothing and were acting as if they took over the election and the papers are trying to present it that way.  But he said the data just doesn't back it up.  And Zuckerberg is data driven.  I think the problem he goes back to is but the data says nothing really happened,  but he cannot say that because that's what he does.  He gets he gets smashed because people are saying no, we expect you to be can trade.  And he wants to say, but the data, but the data, but the data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you wrote a piece on Medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I kind of had to write something because so you know, I'm somebody attacked me because I wasn't attacking Facebook.  So it was based on that New York Times story.  But the thing was, it perhaps was not the best opportunity.  As I said at the beginning, I want to win against Facebook.  But this is not the opportunity because the New York Times story about Facebook turned out to be a load of hooey all at all, not entirely.  But when they complained that, oh, my God, Netflix is reading your messages.  Yes, because Netflix had read, write and delete access.  So you could do messages from Netflix.  That's how the works.  And so the Times made a big deal.  It's been a big deal.  And in this case, you know, Alex Deimos, who, of course, was ex Samo's, who was ex Facebook, but I think has been an honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's chief information security, security, said, said this is the way things are supposed to operate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We want them to open up. We want them to do this.  You're going to hell. James Ball, who is a really tough British journalist, said that this is the hill he's going to die on.  But sharing the content of messages was what makes messaging work.  So it was bad reporting from the Times and the problem.  You know, it's a standard media thing.  You've heard me do it before, but I kind of went off and I said, I think what media wants out of Facebook is blaring.  They ruined everybody's privacy. They ruined democracy.  Facebook has problems. Those aren't the problems.  I think Facebook's problems are actually are actually a little bit more second if I could, a little more subtle and nuanced and thus more difficult.  Facebook has cultural problems and part of what you said a minute ago, Leo, was the was the optimism piece is what gets them in trouble is they didn't anticipate and they didn't deal with manipulation.  Thus, they didn't protect us from it.  Their opacity is a problem. Their secrecy is a problem.  Their belief that they can do some crappy things like go after George Soros in private is a big honking problem.  So I've got Facebook has problems.  Let there be no doubt.  But all I'm trying to say is I think media are trying to go after the wrong problems and the simplistic problems and the wrong way.  Sorry, Stacey, I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, I'm going to I'm going to just tweak this a little bit and suggest that this may not be a load of hooey and it may not be the New York Times is trying and you see it in several of its tech focused stories.  So imagine the editor there with this worldview that they're trying to educate people about how they're sharing their data and what that really means because the tech companies aren't doing it.  So you saw that with their location sharing coverage.  You saw that with Cambridge Analytica.  And honestly, when I look at their coverage of Facebook about like the data sharing they had with Spotify and Netflix, that's how I read this.  I didn't read this so much as Facebook.  Super evil.  I read it more as, hey, you've been giving these permissions to Facebook and to these other companies in a way.  That's because you're smart, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm just.  That's because you're smart and you knew how to read it.  The way I think most anybody would read it and the way that all the tweets came out and the coverage came out and the TV coverage came out is, oh my God, Facebook's letting Netflix read your messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  And I think I'm not saying that I'm not saying the coverage was a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me read the headline in the sub.  Sensationalistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think that that's what we should expect from the New York Times because they're really trying to hammer this home.  And before Leo goes on, I really think it's good that they're trying to educate people about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a certain irony in the article because they say the New York Times is one of the recipients of this of this largesse.  The headline, which admittedly was probably not written by the authors, as Facebook raised a privacy wall, it carved an opening for tech giants.  The subhead internal documents show the social network gave Microsoft, Amazon, Spotify and others far greater access to people's data than it has disclosed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's that's who we that's what I call who we are.  That's a journalistic term in journalism school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I think the point and we actually made this point on the new screensavers a couple of weeks ago is that in every case these permissions were granted because these programs needed those permissions to do what you wanted them to do.  Spotify needed access to your direct messages so it could send a direct message with what you were listening to on Spotify.  That's part of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the feature people were turning on and allow you to delete that message from Spotify if you wished.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a larger question, which is Facebook neglected to turn off those APIs until this article appeared.  So they didn't take it as seriously as maybe they should have, even though they they they turned those features.  They say they turned those features off for those companies.  What 2017?  But the fact the API continued till the New York Times article came out.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Facebook's problem in this case was not they're sharing your data.  Facebook problems.  They were being sloppy and they were carrying enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're sloppy.  But I think that that's the lesson.  And I think, Stacey, if there's a lesson that the New York Times is trying to teach, that is an important lesson is that Facebook is sloppy with your data.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  And that is to that is most of these companies are sloppy with your data.  All of them are. Yes.  Yeah.  They don't store it in any reasonable manner.  They don't encrypt it.  They stick it on public databases.  Is that going to change this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this going to be the year that governments force this and companies in the face of potential government regulation in the US start paying better attention to this?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Companies are already starting to pay better attention to it.  They're getting genuine costs associated with it.  So, yes, we're going to see that.  And we're I think it's guaranteed that we're going to get some sort of privacy law.  I hate saying that because I feel like our political situation is so unhinged at the moment.  But I do actually think it's going to happen.  I don't think it's a great law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This will cause this will cause some service in the in the in the trio here.  But so I had a reaction that probably you won't share to the New York Times story about Facebook and suicide.  And there's been a few stories about that last week that that Facebook we've talked about this show before has the ability and it's and they've talked about this very openly that they have the ability to track warnings of suicide and in some cases specific intentions.  And they try to call authorities as soon as they can on this.  And this is always perfect.  It can be too late and they can be wrong.  But they're trying and they see this as a positive way.  Guess what? This works in the US.  It works in a lot of countries.  Where doesn't it work?  Europe because of GDPR.  And I said this on Twitter.  I said this on Twitter and somebody went after me.  The same person went after me about Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're leaving off by the way Jeff a fairly huge part of this which is that when Facebook gets it wrong it could cause unintentional harm like precipitating suicide or compelling non suicidal people to undergrow psychiatric evaluations or prompting arrests or shootings.  Okay so this is unless it's 100 percent perfect it shouldn't be doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know you're never going to be 100 percent perfect with anything Leo but if one person is saved their life is saved that has value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think the point we should take away from this so GDPR yes.  I think if we imagine Facebook as someone who actually cares about people and preventing suicide then making a mistake feels warranted.  If we if we look at this as Facebook trying to burnish its reputation and using data and only data without really caring what happens which has historically been how it approaches these things that isn't okay.  And I think motivations in this case matter because we are people and Facebook is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How can trying to stop suicide be anything that's cynical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because if you are trying to stop since if you because if you fail the repercussions are big.  So I think it's important like if I think someone is suicidal I as a person who cares about them and I step in and I'm wrong.  The person at least understands my motivation and the consequences are usually far less because I go in trying to mitigate the fact that I might be wrong.  If you go in saying my data is infallible and I am going to stop this thing from happening you're not coming from a place of caring so people are less likely to forgive you.  Right. So that's one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is infallible and turn it around Stacey.  What if what if if imagine the New York Times story Facebook has data that could indicate suicides but they choose to do nothing because of the fear of PR backlash.  People would attack them right there.  There are a bit of a no win here.  At some point I think you've got to balance.  I mean yeah if they're wrong all the time that's screwed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well we don't know because Facebook said that for privacy reasons it doesn't track the outcomes of its calls to the police.  It also has not disclosed how reviewers decide whether to call emergency responders.  So there's no review.  There should be at least peer review.  Even better is if Facebook said hey you know what we have this data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's use this to have a public conversation about preventing suicide and what we as a society in the US for example and in other countries they have the power to start those conversations because in a lot of cases calling the police is not the right way to deal with the suicide.  Right. So instead of coming in and being like the data says this we're going to try to take action.  Let's have a conversation and I think Silicon Valley is terrible at having conversations with people in organizations because they think they know because they have data and it's hard to have a hard media policy conversation about this.  But imagine the headline of Facebook says and they're smart.  Hey we have this data and we want to have a conversation.  We found that when we call police or we have seen the data around police calls to suicide and they proportionally end up harming people.  Let's have a conversation about what we should do instead and they start to spearhead that and put their weight behind that.  That's really interesting.  We don't have that kind of leadership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of these cases that were in the New York Times story wasn't about data.  It was about somebody specifically saying I'm going home right now to commit suicide. I'm going to kill myself.  What do they do then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do police well checks. They do. I mean that's what they do today.  Okay. That's what they're doing.  That's what they're doing.  Right. But with the scale they have they can send them to places.  It's one thing to do a police well check on Pete Davidson.  It's another to send somebody for like some person who is in a predominantly black area of town that is a high incidence of gang violence.  Those are going to get treated very differently.  And I think it's important to recognize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I agree.  We need a conversation and I agree that we need to set that they should want standards set from outside.  But what I'm trying to say is that we went after me for saying forget it GPR.  No, never ever use this data.  And I think that is cynical and I think that is murderous in some cases.  And we have something here that this has really been a case not just Facebook but other platforms around veterans.  And it's a huge problem.  And if we could together find ways to help people we should try.  All right. I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. Let's do a hypothetical.  A lot of TVs these days have cameras on them and A.I. is getting much better at.  We know this reading micro expressions.  The humans maybe sometimes sense but don't can't read accurately.  Let's assume I got really effective at interpreting these micro expressions.  Your TV could watch you and accurately predict when you were suicidal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to say no.  And here's why.  Because there is a key difference.  In Facebook you are publishing post and you are saying to the world something to at least your friends.  You are choosing to say something in the case of your TV.  You are not choosing.  And it would save lives Jeff.  If we allowed it at all but we don't allow that at all.  It's different here because we may we may we may be allowing it for advertising purposes as opposed to suicide purposes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's say that might be happening.  I think there's evidence it is happening.  But they're not analyzing it for suicidal intent or depression.  They're analyzing it for whether you want to buy that product.  I don't think it's happening.  You don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well they're they're not using the cameras.  No they're not using that yet.  No they've they've they're using audio for sure.  They're using audio not from your home.  Vizio was using that but the FCC no FTC was like hey guys stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not cool.  That will happen eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I mean I've seen proposals as far back as 2009 for you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CR1 in our chat room says his Samsung TV says sir you've been watching 30 straight hours of the Dukes of Hazzard.  I'm calling 911.  So but that's the point is the ability to do so.  The argument you just made Jeff which is well it's going to save a life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then the the ends justify the means I think in some cases Leo people are signaling on purpose right.  Often it'll save but it'll save lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll save some lives Jeff but it can also cause a lot of harm for other lives.  I agree Stacey.  We don't find the balance but we shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We shouldn't.  What I'm saying is what was said to me was no never not.  And I'm saying that's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's have a conversation about it.  But to say no never not Facebook let's lay off.  Don't do this.  You may know it but we don't want you to use it because we find it creepy.  Losing losing other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Facebook doesn't have to do that.  If I post on Facebook other people are going to see unless someone has no friends on Facebook.  Maybe Facebook's solution then isn't to call the police.  Maybe it's to beef its algorithm to say hey if someone posts this you like send a freaking notification to the people who click on their stuff the most.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should point out that the examples that the New York Times uses were in all cases people streaming their suicide attempt.  Yeah.  On Facebook Live which it seems like a call for help or something.  I mean it's yeah that's not exactly seeking privacy.  I think I think I'd be willing to go out on a limb and say if Facebook detects somebody streaming a suicide attempt they should immediately call first responders.  That's that does not seem to be unreasonable.  The deeper question is whether they're doing a sentiment analysis and that kind of thing and figuring out if somebody's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They talked about this and they have different interventions.  The intervention is not just to call a police and I don't want to court because I can't remember what it was.  It's online somewhere that the video is there.  They do know more than that.  But but this story there was a reaction around you're right.  You know that somebody's streaming their suicide attempt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they have a responsibility and they probably have a legal responsibility to to call 911.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah if someone's streaming their suicide then yes you do have to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way there were live in this story there you know a couple of lives are saved in one case it was too late which is very sad.  They also quote the director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline commending Facebook for this.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dana Boyd is on the board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's talking about two things.  It's talking about people streaming it but it's also talking about using data analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they talk about doing that.  That's the GDPR thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah one step leads to the next.  And so you're right.  They talk.  They talk.  There's discussion needed.  There's data that needs to be shared.  There's research that needs to be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  They talked to the director of and I even know this existed the digital psychiatry division whatever that is at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.  He says it's hard to know what Facebook's actually picking up on.  This is this is right after their illustration from Facebook of how text and comment classifiers work and how they're flagging based on text signals.  It's hard to know what Facebook is actually picking up on what they're actually acting on.  And are they giving the appropriate response to the appropriate risks.  And that's because Facebook themselves aren't saying.  So he calls it Dr.  John Toros calls it black box medicine.  Facebook says it works with suicide prevention experts to do it.  So I mean I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think those kind of things have to be a lot more open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a really interesting question which is and I brought up the hypotheticals because increasingly we're going to be in a world where these kinds of signals are seen and can be interpreted.  And then what do you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we're increasingly going to be in a world where that can be interpreted outside the home.  So there was just a story today about like maybe it was earlier it was on courts on the language people who are depressed use.  For example and you think about things like all the apps coming out.  Kevin and I talked about this on our show with CES called algorithmic health care.  There's a lot of data coming out on.  Hey I can predict if you're going to get Parkinson's.  I can predict if you're in the early stages of diabetes.  So when you start I mean the challenge we have and this is what GDPR is trying to address is is stopping that train before it leaves the station in some ways because once you can get that just from listening.  Sorry UPS guys here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can I can tell from your dog sentiment analysis on your dog tells us you're getting a delivery right now.  So Jeff what about this.  What about this.  OK I'm going to propose I'm going to try to put words in your mouth Jeff.  Let's see if they fit.  Let's never.  It's possible to move too quickly to stymie this.  It would be a better thing to do to watch learn discuss consider the policy implications for sure.  But I think you're worried and I'm not sure I think I would agree with you that you can also move too quickly.  You can move too slowly and too quickly both.  And to be fair GDPR lets you if you opt into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They let you use this data just nobody's everyone else is like oh it's too expensive we don't want to mess with that.  Let's just say no.  So if they if you say to someone hey I really want to study this I imagine a lot of people would self opt into this and you just have to design something with that in mind and what's happening now and this is what I think a lot of people who just are like GDPR.  Now we can't do anything.  Oh laws are in the way.  We can't do anything.  I think that's a you can't do it without difficulty.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I also think that there is also perhaps a rush to shut this stuff down maybe.  That's what I'm saying.  That's the techno panic you always.  That's what I'm talking about.  I think we all agree these discussions have to be we have to have them and we have to as a society decide what our limits are on all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I had another I know this is this is a little common you know this is cartoonish and it's extreme but but I had a case today where where there was a story Business Insider that Zuckerberg Chan Foundation is one of the things it's funding is putting sensors directly in the brain.  So some smart ass of course comes on and says oh what.  Well say that to somebody with epilepsy or Parkinson's right.  They're doing it for a reason but this kind of chatter has damage at some level and we're making these presumptions and.  And yeah we're not going to get into the whole techno panic thing today it's beginning of a new year.  But but but I just this is I worry about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what I would say and I think the reason there's people are concerned.  There are companies doing this out of a sincere desire to make life better but that but Facebook Google and a few others are doing it out of desire to make advertising more effective.  That's that's their business model chef.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said a few minutes ago that you think that Mark Zuckerberg is a believer and I think he is I think I think to a fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well I'm not sure what he believes in it might be that he believes in getting people together just for the good of it.  It might be that he believes that it's make it's a good business because when people share not only do they connect they also give us information we can use to advertise.  And I really honestly believe that if that the what we don't want is companies for what since we can't know their real intent.  We can only know what they do and what I don't think companies that are that are advertising supported should be in this business.  I think that should be the National Institutes of Health should be in this business that that agencies that companies that aren't trying to use this information.  For advertising purposes should not be in this business.  I just don't think media should not be doing health stuff because we absolutely I should not be in the business of in planning something in your brain to find out what you're thinking.  That would be the wrong thing for anybody to take it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's been in there for eight years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean that's honestly that's that is wrong because we can't we can't know people's intent.  Sometimes people don't even know their own intent but we can know what a business accompanies in.  If a company is in an advertiser is an advertising business pure and simple they shouldn't be doing this and I include Google in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  No because because again I'll go back I'll go to my business.  There was a big scandal in Germany the last two weeks a guy for their spiegel made up fly out made up stories.  And there was this and I wrote a piece about it.  Believe me you don't want to go into it.  It's boring German journalism stuff.  But but it's the seduction of the narrative.  It's the seduction of our business model to hold people's attention.  And and we do things in my business where we we mess around people's lives individually and wholly.  So you know it's not just platforms.  It's us too.  They just have better tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think Stacey is that I've just made up Leo's rule.  Is that a good rule.  And I'm sorry the rule was if you're an advertising business that you should be in the sentiment analysis business because that impugnes your motives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well you can be in the sentiment analysis business to to sell stuff to you.  Well that's what I'm assuming they're doing.  Oh OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you see what I'm saying is that it's not you can't.  It's hard to say oh that's a good.  Yeah that's a wonderful thing they're doing.  By the way I'm going to be interviewing this woman in a week and a half Shoshana Zuboff.  I love the age of surveillance capitalism.  Jeff it's a thick book 600 pages.  Very well supported with footnotes.  She's a first female tenured professor at the Harvard Business School.  She's very insightful thinker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah the Harvard Business School never had a tenured female professor before that.  She was tenured in 1981.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even so.  Well OK one of its first tenured women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to know why you want to know why American businesses screwed up that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That tells you something right there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK.  I think they can do it.  I think they would be best like their benefits to having a giant platform gather data.  One is you can get a larger sample population which is really interesting for public health.  I think if you are if you are sharing that data with people as opposed to grabbing it and doing some sort of weird algorithm of your own design without any transparency is when it becomes a problem.  So maybe I want my cake or I want to have my cake and eat it too.  I don't.  Anyway maybe I want things both ways but I do think that the ability to get lots of data into access data from lots of people even if it's opt in.  If Google tells you to do something because they think it'll help humanity.  I think that could be under the right framework.  OK.  So I would have a little addendum to your law Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I mean it was only a couple of years ago I said that Google is going to eventually become the A.I. king.  I mean it costs a lot of money to do it and it's probably better Google do it than the Chinese government do it.  I just I don't.  There's no simple rules.  Well we're going to stop them from doing this and everything will be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're negotiating norms we're negotiating rules and standards.  Stacy's absolutely right.  We've got to do it more in public.  What in the piece that I wrote I said that the transparency is not just about admitting your foibles which is what Facebook and politicians think it is.  It's also about there should be from the very top of Facebook there should be a view that everything we do here should shine brightly in transparency.  We should be proud of what we do here.  And if you're not then don't do it.  That's more to the core of what's wrong with Facebook and what they need to fix in their culture.  That's transparency that matters in a different way that says we're making judgments about what we do every damn day and we need structures to make good judgments about that and do them in public.  By the way the New York Times headline is judicious to say the least in screening for suicide risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook takes on tricky public health role.  It is indeed.  I don't think that that's you know and in fact it's not sensationalist.  It's exactly right.  It's what we're talking about.  That's true.  It is tricky.  All right.  Should we talk about Google?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well this is Google too really.  I mean it's all it's all a piece of the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacy's trying to make us happier here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No I'm just like at a certain point in time we go around to the same kind of.  We always do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I predict that this is going to be the year that we will spend a lot of time talking about improved capabilities for exactly this kind of thing.  I hope so.  I hope we have.  And that debate is important right.  We agree on that.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  No I totally agree the debate is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think that we're kind of like hmm we need to talk about it.  Well how about this.  Wielding rocks and knives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Arizonans attack self-driving cars.  Yeah.  Yeah you see that.  That's a Google story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a these are the Waymo vehicles going around in Arizona.  And apparently there have been two dozen attacks on Waymo's over the last two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not a huge number.  That's one a month.  That's what the original Luddites did.  So I mean that's.  Luddites.com yeah.  Yeah.  And we've talked about before.  I think we've talked about this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People really hate these self-driving cars sometimes.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People have pelted them with rocks.  People hate those robots.  The security robots.  Yeah.  The kick-to-the-livery robots and the security robots yeah.  In one of the more harrowing episodes a man waved a 22 caliber revolver at a Waymo vehicle.  By the way he was mentally ill.  He told police he despises driverless cars partly because of the killing of the female  pedestrian in Tempe.  His wife admitted he finds it entertaining to break hard in front of self-driving vans  and that she herself may have forced them to pull over so she could yell at them to  get out of their neighborhood.  She was yelling at the self-driving car.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They found each other.  The trouble started the couple said when their 10 year old son was nearly hit by one of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  vehicles when he was playing in a nearby cul-de-sac.  He says I don't want to be there.  I guess he isn't mentally ill.  This was another one.  I apologize he has a different one.  He says I don't want to be their real world example or their real world mistake.  That's a reasonable.  So this gets into something we don't think about a lot but as we stick technology in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  cities as we you know like smart city efforts as we start taking over more of the world  with technology we do actually risk not having these conversations and we don't want to be  We do actually risk not having these conversations as like a democratic process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're saying we're unwillingly debated subjects for this.  I guess that's a real point of view right?  That's reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's not like and that's the other thing like lawmakers did decide this.  So could they vote those lawmakers out?  Yes.  Could a politician run on an anti-tech platform?  Probably.  But that's not a great nuanced way to think about this.  And I think that's where technology companies really need to like wake up and realize that  they can't just fall back on data.  They have to start dealing with people in all of our horrifyingly messy glory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't realize that Douglas Russkopf who works at CUNY wrote a book called throwing  rocks at the Google bus.  Yeah.  He says in this article driverless cars are like robot incarnations of scabs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Douglas and I love him.  He's one of my favorite people on earth, but he's pure Marxist.  So it's a Marxist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's not a, yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it says that there's an intervention here in a job economy and that's what causes the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's why the Luddites revolted, right?  Yeah.  And they're sending their jobs to Jacquard Looms.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And these will, I mean, driverless cars are the future.  And I also think tech companies need to talk more about what roles they will have.  I mean, I just, unfortunately it's not out yet, but I filed a story for IEEE about the  role of people in autonomous vehicles and they will have them.  They will be remote controlled for quite some time in the future.  So will it be a one to one?  No.  But so, yeah, this is frustrating because I feel like a little bit more transparency,  real conversation between parties would actually go a long way.  And we're not doing that.  We aren't even building the tools to do that.  So I don't know how to solve this.  I'm going to go live under a rock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we need technology that motivates people to moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In Ray Kurzweil and his book, The Age of the Spiritual Machines, this is a great Wikipedia  article, by the way, which I found on Pinboard, talked about 2019 and some of the things he  expected.  Now he wrote this 20 years ago, almost some of the things he expected.  He said about self-driving vehicles, let me see if I can find it.  Computers do most of the vehicle driving by 2019.  Humans are in fact prohibited from driving on highways unassisted.  Furthermore, when humans do take over the wheel, the onboard computer system constantly  monitors their actions and takes control whenever the human drives recklessly.  As a result, there are very few transportation accidents.  I actually kind of wish that were the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, but people are going to hate that.  I mean, people hate it now.  Anytime we have something that interferes with our autonomy, we're like, screw you,  if I want to get drunk behind the wheel of the car.  I can do it.  It's my right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just talking to a guy I know here, a neighbor here, and his kids were a little  younger than ours.  They said they don't want to drive.  They don't want the driver's license.  They don't want to do it.  They hate it.  I think there's going to hit a generational point.  We're fine.  I can play my video game while I'm getting there.  Fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He also predicted that devices that deliver sensations to the skin surface of their users  will make virtual sex possible.  Aren't there those things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was about to say, those things kind of exist.  They kind of do, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I hate predictions.  It's hard.  The dumbest job title, the most hubristic job title on earth, this side of Messiah, is  futurist.  Really?  Not thought leader?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, actually, that's what a futurist is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're leading our thoughts.  All right.  I have some happy stories.  Good.  Yes.  Some positive, I'm sure, somewhere here.  Some good stories.  The guy who moons Google Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say boobs.  What?  He moons them.  He moons them?  Right there on the rundown.  Bloke moons Google Maps.  He's a cheeky lad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  That wasn't what I was thinking.  Okay.  It is.  You're right under the Waymo story, so I guess we should probably get to that.  Delighted.  It's not Maps.  It's that Street View car.  Yeah.  And he's delighted because apparently his bum is immortalized online.  This is from the mirror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It looks like they pixelated the brand of the bicycle riding, Bob.  They left his butt.  We didn't expect a butt.  That's why.  Exactly.  The algorithm did not know to look for butts because it thought that people were going  to be nicer than that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, some poor schmo has to write a butt detecting algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then from the Wall Street Journal, delivery drones cheer shoppers annoy neighbors scare  dogs.  In one of the world's most advanced drone delivery tests, sunscreen arrives in minutes  so do complaints.  This is in Australia, in Canberra.  Speaking of drones, I was amazed by the story in the rundown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had not seen this further extension that now there's speculation that the airport closing  in the UK that there never were drones.  Oh, yes.  There never were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mass hysteria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the poor couple that was busted, they let them go.  They let them go.  They said, no, they had nothing to do with it.  Yeah, that was that's horrible.  We talked about it because I trusted the news.  Yeah, my mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's I mean, you're not trusting that you're trusting.  I mean, the police officers in the army were saying, I mean, they said news was that it  was shut down because of this.  It was shut down for 36 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Six hours.  Gatwick was shut down for a day and a half, but there were no drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's still not definitive, I guess.  But it's looking like there were no drones.  That's just weird.  It is.  Everybody just calm down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It'll be OK.  Oh, I think that that's a metaphor.  That story is really a metaphor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We might have a 30 years war or two.  But once we get on the other side of that, it'll be OK.  We'll be happy.  Yes.  You know, this will be a good time to mention our sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see where you're going with this.  It'll be OK.  It's going to be OK.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We, in fact, have a sponsor called Calm.com.  Yes.  You know that will be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't let Apple's revenue.  By the way, just before the show, the chat room says Apple's stock has stopped trading.  What?  That usually is something serious.  In this case, it wasn't that serious.  They put out an update to their revenue guidance for the last quarter, which ended December 29th.  I guess it'll be another.  It usually takes about a month before they get the quarterly results.  But Tim Cook just wanted everybody to calm down and just be aware that revenue is going to be down a little bit.  It's going to be down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which Apple just doesn't do.  Apple always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why you need calm today more than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm too calm to do the news.  I'm so relaxed.  This is when you should tell me about, you know, European GDPR things that I wouldn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  Oh, that's true.  Let's see.  Well, there's there's not a lot of huge news this week.  I got to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So Amazon's going to expand Whole Foods stores.  I finally got suckered into putting the Whole Foods app, the Amazon app on my phone.  Because I was at Whole Foods buying goods for my Christmas dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you actually get any discounts?  Look, they don't put that much on.  No.  Yeah, there's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And all you do is your whole.  But you know what?  I'm going to tell people use this barcode.  If you want to save, just use mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it shows your store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a pretty good deal on ground turkey balls.  Regularly 599 a pound Amazon Prime 399 a pound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pre-made meatballs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't.  Ground turkey says animal welfare rated ground turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's ground turkey.  Oh, OK.  Yeah.  Sorry.  I was just like, it's a product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Salad greens.  Two for six dollars.  Normally 399 to 449 each.  It's some savings.  Look at that.  Grapefruits usually 250 pound now dollar pound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's good.  Grapefruits are always cheap in January.  I can't eat them.  I'm on statins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would kill me.  That's actually something that would kill me right there.  But you can't have.  It would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Amazon knew that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you on statins?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Don't eat grapefruit.  I don't have grapefruit.  Once in a rare while, I'll have a grapefruit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So before I give out medical advice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me just say what it says on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says you can't do that.  I'm pretty sure.  I thought it was like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Patients can eat.  Don't eat a large amount of grapefruit.  While taking this step.  Here it is.  Your fears with Healthline.com says why you shouldn't mix grapefruit and statins.  I'm just saying.  And I'm on Lipitor.  That's the one that's particularly bad with Lipitor and Zocor.  So there.  It could cause muscle breakdown.  Well, who says I have any?  Liver damage, digestive problems, increased blood sugar.  And neurological side effects, which explains an awful lot.  It does.  I'm feeling sleepy.  Okay.  This one I am mad about.  New York Times.  Cooper Quinton.  Who is from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.  Our cell phones aren't safe.  Actually, I think this is a very important article.  Security flaws threaten our privacy and bank accounts.  So why aren't we fixing them?  This is not about privacy, Jeff.  Well, I didn't even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  I didn't even click on the headline originally because I thought it was another.  You know, give you brain cancer story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's actually about SS seven.  Which we've been talking about for years on security.  Now it's the.  It's the software signaling system seven that runs in all cell phones.  It's part of the radio.  There have been weaknesses we've known about for years in SS seven.  Nobody's doing anything about it and they never have.  And he talks about in 2017, criminals took advantage.  For instance, for instance, this is just one of many examples of SS seven weaknesses to carry out financial fraud by redirecting and  intercepting text messages containing one time passwords for bank customers in Germany.  It's part you know, you've heard about all those stingrays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Basically, it lets you spoof a cell tower.  So if you want to spoof a cell tower and people feel that cell networks are very secure.  They're not.  You're like, hey, I'm on a cell network.  But like I was talking to somebody in the security world and they were like, yeah, we had a CEO of a fortune 500 company whose cell phone was  talking to a fake cell tower basically that they had set up that some hackers.  So it's a stingray. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're all over Washington, D.C., by the way.  Yeah, it's a big deal.  SS seven, which was written in nineteen seventy five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's older than I am.  It's older than Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shush Stacey. Shush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just saying that's good perspective.  I'm pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is actually I have lots of viruses.  I think it's bad to say this headline is bad because it's not quite really the issue is they're a security nightmare.  And this is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think I mean, and I used to run into this a lot when I was writing about technical topics like this.  This is hard to like headline and make people care about.  It really is because you have to explain so much.  So the headline and stuff like this is just.  Oh, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it was on 60 Minutes two years ago.  Yeah, they showed it being hacked.  They showed a senator who volunteered for this.  They show how easy it was to hack his phone and nothing was nothing.  A senator, a United States.  Nothing has happened.  So anyway, I mention it again.  It's not that anything will happen, but I mention it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm excited because the the story this was an interesting one from the New York magazine.  Oh, this is a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've been doing great stuff lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good because they're charging money for it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, I got to pay for another paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Court says paywall.  Now they have a paywall.  Everybody.  Oh, my God.  Children think they're worth a paywall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, and they are individually.  The problem is, I don't want to believe.  Yeah, Bloomberg.  I still haven't paid for Bloomberg because I just so you talking about which story on how much of the Internet is fake turns out a lot of it, actually.  This is about click fraud, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. And it kind of fits in with this idea that basically bots have taken over the Web.  And it's it's we're getting to this like worldview where there are no people and it's just bots fighting bots here all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here is a fascinating statistic from this article.  For a period of time in 2013, the Times reported this year.  But five years ago, half of YouTube traffic was bots masquerading as people, a portion so high that employees feared an inflection point after which YouTube systems for detecting fraudulent traffic would begin to regard bot traffic as real and human traffic as fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They called this like, gosh, it's like reaching consensus on the block chain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. They thought they called this hypothetical event the inversion.  Now, that was five years ago.  Do you think there are fewer bots on YouTube now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Well, so and that's always puzzled me because YouTube, the the view number viewership numbers on YouTube's are stunning and they're so fast.  And it just never made sense to me.  And it doesn't make sense to advertisers, by the way, because it's really cheap to buy YouTube ad impressions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a friend who does who pays people to juice his YouTube.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube, the company says, quote, only a tiny fraction of its traffic is fake.  But you can buy 5000 YouTube views for as low as $15.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we I mean, the reason part of the reason this is people reward that people are like, yeah, I can't even take you seriously unless you have this many YouTube views.  That's right.  I'm like, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that for a while there was a story was if you want to get a better deal as a Hollywood actor, if you want to get more money per movie, you have more Twitter followers.  Is that still the case?  Or do people finally twigs to the notion that really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good question. I'll bet. I'll bet. I don't know.  But I'll bet not because you can buy them and all that.  It's so easy to buy them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's I have never bought my Twitter followers.  Neither have I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no Twitter followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to have 600000, although I noticed ever since I deactivated my account, that number is dwindled.  I would imagine it had no.  It had been my experience that the less I tweeted, the more followers I got.  As long as you say nothing, it's the Vanna White effect.  People think you're on their side.  The minute you say something, people go on unfollowing that guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, you guys.  But I yawned.  Sorry, I yawned.  It happened to be actually looking at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is your story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're going to be kind of he does that to me all the time.  He makes me all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He doesn't he doesn't make you buy a Lincoln or bourbon because that's he's everywhere on my Hulu right now.  I was like, good Lord, Matthew.  I'm driving my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are two stories that I'm going to link together with little or no evidence to do so.  And I'm going to suggest that they point to a larger problem just around the corner.  911 emergency services go down across the US after CenturyLink outage Thursday at noon Eastern.  CenturyLink went down, which is what again?  CenturyLink is a one of the largest telecommunication.  You never heard of them.  One of the largest telecommunications providers in the US.  They do Internet and backbone services to AT&T and Verizon.  You thought maybe AT&T and Verizon did their own?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they do their own.  They also they also buy from CenturyLink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In any case, CenturyLink by level three.  I think so.  Or are they just?  No, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So CenturyLink didn't say what caused the outage beyond this.  It was an issue with a quote network element.  But it took them an hour or so.  Meanwhile, 911 services went down in many areas of Seattle.  Stacy, Salt Lake City, Idaho, Oregon, Arizona and Missouri.  Police in Massachusetts tweeted CenturyLink outage affecting wireless 911 capability in Massachusetts.  Then it came back a couple of hours later.  FCC says we're investigating.  We know what that we know what that means.  But then I'm going to tie it to this.  A malware attack brought down delivery of the L.A. Times and the Tribune papers across the United States, including the New York Times on the West Coast.  Is a server outage identified as a malware attack, which appears to have originated from outside the United States, hobbled computer systems and delayed weekend deliveries of the Los Angeles Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a couple things.  We I think we need to have for Harvard Business School folks, right?  We need to have understand the economic importance of resiliency.  And what we talk about today is.  That is not a priority in supply chains and all kinds of things, because we've only been thinking about the dollar costs of things.  Right.  And that's where I think as we get more technical, we are more reliant on technology, sorry, more reliant on technology.  We need to talk about resiliency and start creating case studies that understand the impact of losing that.  Because these things happen a lot and.  There are companies that design for this, and I think it's really important that they do.  And actually, it's a topic at CES. I was really excited to see that.  So this is just me thinking, you know, I'm like, oh, my gosh.  Now, here's why I connect these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They both happened on Thursday.  Uh huh.  Now, I don't want to say there's a boogeyman under the bed or in the closet, but I honestly think that nation states are trying out these weapons just to see what they can do.  I think this is a taste, a foretaste.  Yes, there's a there's definitely an economic and civic reason, Stacey, that they should be redundant.  But I think there's an even larger reason.  I think that this is the next battlefield.  Just saying.  Times and San Diego paper became aware of the problem near midnight on Thursday.  Programmers worked to isolate the bug, which Tribute and Publishing identified as a malware attack.  But at every turn, the programmers ran into additional issues after identifying the server outages of virus technology teams made progress Friday, quarantining it and bringing back servers.  But some of their patches didn't hold.  I don't even know what that means.  It's not like a ship.  Some of their security patches didn't hold and the virus began to reinfect the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So let me talk about my friends in the newspaper business.  And it so happens I was at the Chicago Tribune later trunk.  That's the company when they got their second CMS back in the 70s.  And that's how old I am, Stacey.  I was doing CMS is before you were born.  And they didn't build in any redundancy or enough memory because they wanted more features.  We're dumb about this stuff.  We're really dumb about this stuff.  It's a bad industry.  I don't know that it was like a Chinese or Russian hack.  I don't either.  And I'm not a good old stockholder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I don't know.  But Pam Dixon, executive director of World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit public interest research group said, quote, Usually when someone tries to disrupt a significant digital resource like a newspaper, you're looking at an experienced and sophisticated hacker.  Holidays are a well-known time for mischief because organizations are more thinly staffed.  This is from the L.A. Times, which was, in fact, held up on Sunday because of the attack on Thursday.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not related.  That's just when I see two major attacks like that on the same day of infrastructure that's fairly important.  It seems I feel like an alarm bell is ringing.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do have good news, and we're going to get to all the good news, the happy stuff in just a second.  But first, I want to tell you about Cashfly because that's a happy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And unlike Tribune Company and unlike major phone companies, I never hear you complain.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were talking about that Helm email server, Stacey.  Oh, yeah, like forever ago.  I bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had someone on your show from it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So he was on the screensavers.  Gilligan. No, that's not his name.  Gary. Gary was on the screensavers.  Gary Srinivasan, who is the one of the founders and the CEO, and brought a Helm and set it up.  And I was so impressed. I bought one.  They're not cheap. They're 500 bucks.  And you have to pay 100 bucks a year after the first year for the service.  But it's solved. I've tried to set up email servers before, and it's hard to do.  This works pretty well. I was very impressed.  It's interesting.  So the idea is instead of storing your mail on somebody else's server, you store it on a server at home.  There are all sorts of problems with doing that.  For instance, your IP address, almost all residential IP addresses are blocked.  Not only by your ISP who doesn't want you sending spam, but most recipients won't accept it because they say, you know, chances are that's a spam reflector.  That's not going to be real email.  So they solve that by you route your mail from your server to their server through a VPN.  They use Amazon Web Services and they use IP blocks that are clear.  They also turn on all of the reverse DNS, all the other DKIM.  I can't remember all the different forms for email authentication, DMARC, that mean that the recipients are likely to not assume that you're spam.  And in fact, I've had no problem sending mail out through it.  I decided to get a fresh domain for it, which I'm not going to tell anybody, but I will tell you guys off the air because it's a way that it's like going to be now the personal family server.  If you want to get through to me, because my Leoville.com is completely swamped.  I tried it at first at Leoville.com and it was just like a mess.  So but this worked pretty well.  So anyway, I know you mentioned this before, Stacey, having used it now, I think I could recommend it.  It's not, you know, one thing and they don't mention this.  I think they need to.  You have to have a smartphone to use it because but this is brilliant.  But they should really tell people ahead of time.  Each user has to have a smartphone.  The reason is this is your security token because you can't configure it unless you're in proximity.  He uses Bluetooth, at least you have to be near it.  And then you get the credentials for it.  But you have to do it through an app on the smartphone.  So no bueno.  Well, it's it's a it's more secure.  But it is it's like for a business.  If you set this up for business, every employee has to go stand next to the server or set up his account.  So that's a little weird.  Right.  But I think for a home server, be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, not every I mean, certain.  My daughter still doesn't have a phone.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I guess if you had a spare phone, you could set it up for.  But each that actually gets to go on.  Well, each phone is it's like a token.  This becomes your security token, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this isn't related to the news, but it's totally related to Google.  And I'm going to throw this out here because I in the middle of December, we switched from being in Madam A.  So an Amazon Alexa household to being a Google household.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just said the name.  I know.  I'm sorry.  Echo.  Amazon Echo.  And then she says the A word.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm very tired.  I didn't have coffee.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  I'm just teasing you.  So we started this and I'm going to do a post after about a month in.  But we're encountering all kinds of issues.  And the biggest issue we have is I had turned on personalization.  And I've complained before because Google doesn't always recognize my voice.  So that's one part.  But my husband trade his voice.  I quote unquote, train mine better.  So it gets me about 50 percent of the time.  But I don't know what to do with my daughter.  And it is a pain in the butt to set up the personalization.  And she has to have an app to do the voice training on her phone.  And so I'm very curious.  Does she have an iPad or anything like a.  She hasn't. So she has an iPhone that she uses and she has she has a Gmail address that's personal to her.  OK. And then she has her Google stuff for school, which is not linked out to any of the Google ecosystem.  So but. But yeah, it's really tough to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're getting into a world where you have to have one of these now.  Well, you should have to have no. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a problem that or if you if you just have that, then that's fine.  But like then I shouldn't have to do like an email account like with Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to do an email account. So well, that's one of the things I'm going to use the helm for is I'm creating an email for your house.  Well, yes, basically. So I have I don't want to say the domain, but I have a domain name.  Let's say it's my email dot com.  And then you can have anything that goes to my email dot com.  So I'm creating weird account names for everything.  That are non-guessable. That gives me some security, but also that I could trace.  So I know. So that's what I would do with the Echo, for instance, is I would set it up with one of these special names that only it has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see I'm saying so it could be this is why you find out who's screwing you over your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You see who's selling who's selling it to plus it kind of keeps it isolated from your main email.  Right. You just filter it all because anything that comes to Amazon Echo at my email dot com that came from setting up for an Echo account.  And so I can filter that out. I think there's an advantage to that.  You can do that with Gmail if you want to using pluses, although I know I think people are wise to that now.  Right. They don't let you do the plus as much as they used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so scooter accent me a thing all about this.  And I realized the app I was she wants to use isn't for families.  And that's why I'm encountering some challenges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So she can't turn on your child's Google account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she can't turn on our television right now because she's under 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Well, that's as it should be.  That's not a bug. That's a feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a flaw. Well, it also things like a babysitter right now.  Like, maybe, maybe can I turn off voice? Maybe I can turn off voice recognition for certain things like babysitter does not need access to Madam.  Oh, no, that's how you turn on her because it's actually a big selling point for us and why we are on the TV without Madam.  No, you can. But you have to follow. You know, we've got like a receiver and all this.  So like this way you just it's all done for you.  You just tell her to turn it on and it's always worked.  But now with Google, it's like, I'm afraid I can't do that for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, because your voice. Yes. So you need a guest account or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They need to make a guest account. Well, no, I just know it's not a guest account.  It would be they need to make it so certain functionalities.  I don't need to have voice recognition for because a guest account won't help you if it's voice recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What this show really is about is real world meeting digital world and the problems those that entails.  Honestly, that is what this show has been about.  And more and more it's about what it's about is how there's this impedance mismatch between humans and technology.  So I was going to tell you some good things.  For instance, the copyright law did not get renewed.  So any so as of yesterday, anything created in 1923 or sooner is in public domain or earlier.  Yeah, earlier. Not whatever sooner means to you.  Thank you for correcting me. I don't even know what that means.  I don't think sooner even means anything in that context. But prior.  Prior. That's the word. Thank you.  And Mickey Mouse in 2024. Remember that it was Disney. Yeah.  Disney got a yeah. Yeah. You think Disney will get involved?  Yeah. The Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act.  That's that's what happened in 1999. Stormy Daniels.  Yeah, Stormy should run for Congress. I'd vote for her.  Yeah. So the old point is every time Mickey Mouse's copyright protection has come close to lapsing because he was Steamboat Willie was in 1924.  Congress voted to extend copyright the last time in 99 for 20 years.  And that's why now it's but they didn't do it this year because they're so disorganized.  They just forgot. You think they could do it still. They could still do it.  But maybe they'll continue to forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rhapsody. You know, we don't have a government right now.  So, yeah, right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this is a good thing because I will submit it's a good thing for things to become public domain.  Like, for instance, I don't know, Grimm's fairy tales, because then some guy named Walt could come along and create movies based on Grimm's fairy tales.  But no one can create a movie based on Cinderella because it's still in copyright.  And so the bringing things into the public sphere, this is what Larry Lessig always talked about.  And one of the reasons he created Creative Commons, bringing things into this public sphere is good.  It's reasonable to say there should be some protection for the creator for some reasonable period of time.  It seems like what is it? A hundred years almost should be enough.  I think that's probably a little longer than intended.  Rhapsody in blue will go in the public domain next year.  Great Gatsby in twenty twenty one.  The sun also rises twenty twenty two.  But the big one is January 1st, twenty twenty four, when both Batman, Superman, Snow White.  No, no, that's later. Mickey Mouse will come into.  This is all from an article in this technical.  None of this is going to happen.  That's not how this is all dream on, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Disney has a hundred lawyers and three thousand lobbyists right now working on this.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is Sonny Bono's passed.  But as you say, Starmie Daniels Copyright Extension Act of twenty twenty four.  What?  Just a matter of. That's that's Jeff's name for it.  I don't. It was Sonny Bono's law. Sonny Bono.  No, I got that.  Well, we got to find a new celebrity congressperson.  You want the Michael Avenatti Copyright Protection Act of twenty twenty three.  You can have it. That's fine.  I had other good things.  Oh, hospitals are now going to have to post their prices online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God, thank God. Oh, my gosh.  We are living in fear for my daughter's ER room visit.  Oh, it's covered, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get an ambulance?  No, no, we took her in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know people who actively as chew ambulances because well, if you've got an ambulance bill, I have people when I faint, I tell people never to call an ambulance.  Unfortunately, a lot of times I'm unconscious.  So then I get a sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could just say, please don't call an ambulance.  I need a bracelet or bracelet.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. On January 1st yesterday, a new regulation took effect requiring hospitals to post the prices of their services online.  This is a provision called from, by the way, Health and Human Services, inpatient prospective payment system rule.  They have to share the prices of standard services online as well as make medical records more easily accessible by patients themselves and shareable between medical practices.  Why should these be online? Well, because you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't know.  So one of my graduates from entrepreneurial journalism named Jeannie Pinder has been working on the business on this for years called ClearHealthCosts.com.  Good.  Where she works to any way she can through patients, through insurance companies, through whoever to get the cost to be made more transparent.  And not just hospitals, but also doctors procedures because they can vary all over the map.  Huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's some more good news.  If the government shutdown continues, which it probably will, although we'll find out right tomorrow.  Because when is Congress sit? Tomorrow, right? The third.  Tomorrow. Yeah.  So maybe they'll do something about it. I don't know.  But if they don't, the FCC will shut down.  That can only be good, right? Because more government is bad government.  Isn't that what they say?  Let's shut the FCC down.  The FCC suspended activities will include consumer complaint and inquiry phone lines, consumer protection and local competition enforcement, licensing services, including broadcast wireless wire line management.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Use bad words. If you're on TV, you can use a bad word.  You can start swearing kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For competitive tech. Wouldn't that be funny if the thing that ends the government shutdown is Howard Stern swearing?  I'm broadcasting. That would be great. That would make me happy.  Athletes do not own their own tattoos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was fascinating.  It makes perfect sense. But yeah, problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's okay for, you know, LeBron's tats to appear on TV during a game, incidentally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But because there's a presumed license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But should that tattoo be duplicated in, let's say, a video game?  Now we got a problem because the design belongs to the tattoo artist.  A copyright lawyer who, by the way, represented the guy who did Mike Tyson's face tattoo.  And successfully, I think, defended it in court, right?  That's exactly what it looks like. So I could get sued next as well.  I'm putting my hand on my face. His name is Michael Kahn.  He says video games probably says it like this. Video games are entirely no area.  There's LeBron James, but it's not LeBron James. It's a cartoon version of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm hoping the guy actually went to Cambridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. Michael Kahn, Michael Cohen. Is there a difference? I don't think so.  So Lionel Messi's heart-eating gorilla. Oh, no, that's Connor McGregor has a heart-eating gorilla.  Lionel Messi has that sleeve right there.  Yay. You got some splaining to do.  They're facing a copyright infringement lawsuit after the cover of the game NFL Street,  including an illustration of running back Ricky Williams.  I can't read anymore. Included an illustration of running back Ricky Williams and some of his tats.  But the artist withdrew his claim in 2013.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the interesting part. This is where it is to solve this problem.  They're saying when you get a tattoo, if you are a famous player or something,  you should get a license to have that become part of your digital likeness, which I think is really fascinating.  Honestly, I think as a normal person, I might be like, hey, if I were going to get a tattoo in a highly visible spot, I might do that too.  Just in case I want to create an accurate digital avatar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. So think about that, kids, when you're getting that face tattoo.  Make sure you have the artist sign over the rights. That's what Mike Evans did.  He's an NFL receiver.  Gotti Flores, who they call the Teflon tattoo artist, has spent at least 40 hours tattooing Evans.  He had to give permission for his work to be reproduced in the game.  Really, it didn't even matter to me, said Mr. Flores, who signed a waiver for no compensation.  It was dope to have my tattoos on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you say it, Mr. Flores, you're absolutely right. It was an honor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was dope.  It was dope.  But there have been other lawsuits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I get it. I also think, you know, yes, I'm thinking about back in 2003 when I got married.  I arranged to have for my wedding photographer, I actually bought the digital rights as part of my photography package.  And she's like, no one has ever asked for this before.  She very much undercharged me. So it was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's smart.  I am a futurist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you put them up?  I hope you put them up under Creative Commons so we can remix them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get permission to use the Eyes of Texas or upon you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? I think in that situation, I don't know, I've been working on the railroads in public domain, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was just the music, not the singing.  No one sang it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when in doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't the Eyes of Texas or upon you. It was I've been working on the railroad.  This is a call back to an earlier episode.  I invite you all to listen.  A federal judge in Oregon says the state law that defines what an engineer is violates free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this a software engineer issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it's an interesting story.  It's a really interesting story.  A Beaverton guy, Matt Yarlstrom, didn't like how short the yellow lights were in his town.  Was it in Portland?  I think it was in Beaverton.  He had got a ticket for running, actually his wife got a ticket for running a red light in 2013.  So Yarlstrom, not who is by the way, has a bachelor's of science, a BS in engineering from Sweden.  Spent three years analyzing the method for calculating the duration of a yellow light.  And found the formula failed to account for drivers who have to slow down to make a legal right turn.  Or left turn, a legal turn. They have to slow down to make it a turn.  Did not account for the fact that they are in the box during the yellow, it turns to red because they've slowed down to make a turn.  He sent his traffic light calculations to the state board and identified himself as an engineer to not only local media, but 60 minutes.  Who did a story on him?  The state fined him $500 for violating a law that governs who can call themselves an engineer, finding that he wasn't registered in Oregon as a professional engineer.  He's not an engineer. He doesn't have the hat or anything.  But maybe the state should have thought a little bit, this is a guy who spent three years analyzing traffic light data to get his wife out of a ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there's no better definition of an engineer, I can't imagine it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or someone who is likely to challenge that $500 fine.  He did. He went all the way up to a federal appeals court and won a 25 page written ruling saying,  saying, Yarlstrom may study and communicate publicly or privately privately about his theories relating to traffic lights, as long as the remarks occur outside the context of any employment or contractual relationship with a governmental or other group that regulates traffic light timing.  He may in fact describe himself both publicly and privately as an engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is a I guess if you were not an engineer and you told the media that you were an engineer, do you like, is that fair?  Like if I called myself a doctor, I'd be committing fraud, right? If I'm not actually a doctor.  He studied engineering. He does the acts of engineering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And OK, yeah.  And yes, there is licensing for engineers to some extent, but not the way there is for a doctor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let's be this is I mean, they did say you can't pose as an engineer.  You can't come to the state and say, I'm going to design a bridge for you.  But you could, if you wish, send traffic light calculations to the state board and talk to 60 minutes and say, I'm an engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we had that for a while in Texas where you could not anyone who did software, you could not call someone a software engineer because of licensing requirements.  So that actually was a big deal here for a while.  You definitely wouldn't want a programmer to design a bridge.  Well, yeah, but you wouldn't want to you wouldn't want a mechanical engineer to design a bridge either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Right. So yes, but mechanical engineers.  OK, which beta? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bridge 2.0. Well, there is if your first one falls down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So I think that's a victory for free speech and engineers everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we doing a change look? I can now wear the hat.  Oh, Lord. No, there's not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we could, but there's very little change to talk about.  I think Google, Google. Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. He can't stop himself. He pushed the button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He pushed the button.  Well, Google had this article on kickstarting your New Year's resolutions with Google Fit.  But it's not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You made it. That's the change lock.  That was it. All right. Change lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's over. Well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well played, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a very provocative article.  We probably should have led with this in the New York Times today about a move from the Commerce Department.  They're considering security restrictions on the export of artificial intelligence technologies.  They don't want the Chinese to get a hold of our research, I guess.  But according to the Times, Cade Metz writing in San Francisco,  a growing number of Silicon Valley insiders are worried that proposed export restrictions  could actually short circuit the preeminence of American companies and the next big thing to hit their industry, artificial intelligence.  So this is actually under discussion right now.  There's only a few days left to comment on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just don't understand how they could do it.  I mean, do you regulate the algorithms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they tried to do this with strong encryption, you remember, calling it munitions.  The Commerce Department has a January 10th deadline for public comment on AI export rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess I could go read the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what Silicon Valley is worried about is exactly what you just said, which is you can't do anything about it anyway.  They're not going to make these rules.  Why are making a difference?  And they could harm companies in the US, help international competitors and stifle technology improvements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so that's why we need to know the how, because, I mean, theoretically, I mean, that's what everyone says when they're faced with these things.  So I just automatically throw that out.  I'm just like, but how would you do it?  Because that would have the impact of that would determine the impact.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, for instance, if you say, well, no American AI scientists can give papers outside the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you can publish them.  I mean, how do you contain it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's well, hello.  That's this comes from in August, Congress passed the Export Controls Act of 2018, which added export restrictions to emerging and foundational technologies.  So basically, you can give it away.  You can't sell it.  Well, we don't know.  That's right.  Because we've got to find out what these rules will be.  We're still in the comment period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and do you do things like, oh, you can't manufacture GPUs over there because that's how we train a lot of stuff.  I mean, do you not have data sets that are available?  I mean, there's different.  Yeah, a lot of AI innovation is actually being done and made in public.  The things that are private today is access to the underlying technology, which is highly commodified.  So that's not a place to do it.  The only other way to do it is access to the data sets.  But the data sets just that's not the innovative part.  That's like access to steel.  So you can build a cool building when you're really trying to stop some style of architecture from escaping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Federal regulations exempt publicly available information from export control.  That means the government is unlikely to bar companies and universities from publishing fundamental research.  That would be a violation of First Amendment.  But yeah, well, I don't know.  But it could establish controls that restrict foreign access to that information.  How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One thing that might do.  Putin brought us national boundaries.  The Internet takes them away.  Right.  We have nationalists going crazy because their fundamental view of themselves is challenged.  And that's why you know who is trying to build a wall in a last futile attempt to hold on to a border.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a nostalgia for something that never really existed.  But that's what Harari talks about in his 21 Lessons is that nationalism doesn't have an answer for global problems like climate change.  And AI and all of this stuff because it's nationalistic.  This doesn't apply to a global world.  You know, like the Internet.  Yeah.  Overly restrictive rules that prevent.  Here's one way they would do it.  Prevent foreign nationals from working on certain technologies in the United States could push those researchers and companies into other countries.  It might be easier for people to just do this stuff in Europe, which means they wouldn't do it in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where they'd also have to worry about GDPR and be compliant there and have better business as a result.  Move to China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you want to do AI research, move to China.  Anything goes.  Well, well.  Speaking of which, the Chinese takeover of the Indian app ecosystem.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Almost half.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was interesting.  Wasn't this interesting?  Almost half of the apps currently in use in India, popular in India, are from China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Waiting for China to come to the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2018 is likely to be remembered as the year when the Chinese took over Indian smartphones.  Well, they're doing it in America, too, because who owns TikTok?  TikTok is owned by a Chinese company.  It is.  Yes.  In December 2017, the top 10 mobile apps on Google Play Store in India.  Five out of the top 10 are Chinese.  There were 18 Chinese apps among the top 100 across various categories.  You see browser share it, News Dog.  Oh, that was last year.  This year, 44 out of the top 100.  Almost half.  This is what's changed.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's India, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is another example of, and I've kind of come to understand this a little bit better, too.  Thanks to some people who've written us.  Thank you.  And to some books, including Harari's book.  China is very much interested in controlling what's going on inside of China with its own citizens, but it's very global in its outlook.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yes and no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you think that the major Chinese apps and companies, Alibaba and such, would be here.  It's kind of like, why bother?  They have so much growth left in China.  Right.  And they don't need us here.  But I keep on waiting for that moment.  But India is a big economy.  So it makes sense that they would approach India.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  All these American companies that want to go to China.  I kept on saying, go to India first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  Well, they're trying.  And there's no mention of China.  Huh.  None.  None.  But it is owned by a Chinese company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's among the top apps in the US as well, is it not?  I think it is.  Is it?  Yeah.  Well, your teenager would be or she's not a teenager yet.  I guess that's the problem.  Top apps on Google Play Store in US.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm sure TikTok's in the top 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you used TikTok?  I used it briefly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's really not for me.  You old fart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You.  As you're old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's number two in the US.  Number one is Color Bump 3D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Never heard of Color Bump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never heard of Color Bump.  That can't be right.  These are probably as of last week or something.  But I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  As of last week or something.  But yeah, TikTok's number two.  And the company's called Musically.  And it was originally an American product that was bought by a Chinese company.  Which one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Musically or TikTok?  Musically was American, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  TikTok and Musically.  Yeah.  Are they separate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  They're the same now.  TikTok bought Musically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or I didn't know.  I thought they left it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  I don't know.  They merged it.  They killed Musically and they merged it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you guys.  The road near my house just got closed down because of falling rock.  I just had to tell you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you just get a text?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I just got a notification.  I signed up for those when we had the fires last year.  They call them Nixels here.  And I get them all the time now.  There's police action all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have a mountain near you, Stacey?  You have people going after Waymo cars.  How do you get rocks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Limestone.  We have limestone cliff areas that we tunneled through for our roadways.  Oh.  Limestone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if you have limestone anywhere in the world pretty much, you've got holes in  the ground.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Central Texas is on a giant karst system.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's famous.  Texas Karst.  Anyway, sorry.  That's what Karst was named after, I think.  Aren't you named after the Texas Karst?  No.  This is our last story, but this will make you feel good.  A cafe has opened in Japan.  It's staffed by robots, but the robots themselves are controlled by...  People?  Paralyzed people.  It's a startup that specializes in robots for disabled people.  The Orihime-D is a 120 centimeter, four foot tall robot that can be operated remotely from  a paralyzed person's home.  Even if the operator only has control of their eyes, they can command the robot to move,  look around, speak with people and handle objects.  They get paid $8 an hour to do it, but of course there's bigger benefit because they're  out there working.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A staff of 10 people with conditions like ALS or spinal cord injuries are working from  home.  They're paid a thousand yen an hour.  That's the standard wage for part-time work in Japan to serve up coffee and interact with  the clientele as robots.  It was crowdfunded.  They raised $26,000 to do it.  It will not stay open after a few months, unfortunately, but I think what an interesting  and I think great idea.  So these are not robots taking jobs, but giving jobs.  Isn't that cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really neat story from SoraNews24.  Their headline is, bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia today.  Which is not, okay, admittedly the best slogan.  It's maybe a little better than democracy dies in darkness, but it's, you know, yesterday's  news today from Japan and Asia.  That concludes our list of stories for the day.  Oh, I should say one more thing I'm very excited about.  I got, so earlier last year I mentioned that we hadn't gotten our What Three Words banner.  And I got a nice email from Giles at What Three Words saying, what?  You didn't get your banner?  So, ladies and gentlemen, I can now unveil without further ado the What Three Words address  of the Twit Eastside Studios Glow Walnut Nasal.  Wow.  Glow Walnut Nasal.  We're going to put this up.  Where should we put it up?  Outside the door?  Right where you put the numbers, right?  Right numbers.  Glow Walnut Nasal.  If you ever need to get to our studio, just remember a glowing walnut in Leo's nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I just say, you know, hey, G, where is, or take me to Glow Walnut Nasal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you can in some, some jurisdictions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just searched on Glow Walnut Nasal.  Besides you talking about this, the next is Nuts About Walnut.  Yeah.  And then plastic surgery in Danville.  Oh.  If you need to get the glowing walnut out of your nose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you need to get removed, yeah.  Yeah.  So this is what.  This has confused Google considerably.  What Three, the number three, WhatThreeWords.com.  And if you go to their map, which isn't very complete, but if you go to their map, you'll  see Glow Walnut Nasal leads you right to our front door.  Google it?  Yeah.  And then I think there's a way to like, then send glow, send those coordinates to Google.  Like, yeah, like navigate to location on Google maps.  You pick your app.  Yeah.  So it tells you what it is, how to get to Glow Walnut Nasal.  It's one minute, 13 feet away.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's going to take me less than a minute, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe there's some traffic somewhere outside the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Heavy traffic in the hall outside.  Exactly.  So thank you, Giles.  I got it.  I, I, for some, he said we sent it to you.  I'd have it here, but maybe it got lost.  Maybe the postman stole it because he doesn't want to be put out of a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still demand credit for being the first to mention WhatThreeWords.com.  You did, many years ago.  The network.  Long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very long.  It's gotten completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we did.  Yeah.  And of course, I, egotist that I am, made sure to point out.  I'm just thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, they give this to you for free.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anybody can get this if you go to WhatThreeWords.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I have a problem on Google Maps is that it thinks my house is about, it doesn't know where the street goes.  Exactly why you need this.  But it doesn't, it refuse, stops back there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, the thing about WhatThreeWords is it's not based on street addresses.  Anything as primitive as that.  They've divided the entire world up into three meter squares.  Everywhere in the world.  And every three meter square has its own unique three word description.  Which I think is great.  So, yeah, I don't know if they still offer the free placard.  But I'm thrilled to have mine.  Yay!  Yeah.  I like this.  We should, yeah, let's put it next to our number or something.  Or just in the, put it on the door.  I don't know.  Glow walnut nasal.  All right, Stacey, do you have a pick this week?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had a great one for the week before.  But I did not, I'm sorry you guys.  The holidays, everything.  That's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did all of your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so what happens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Automated stuff work in your house like the Christmas and did all of that happen?  Yes.  And the blinds go dancing and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The blinds did go dancing.  The, yes, everything happened.  I just, as I'm, as I'm taking stuff down, I'm also taking other stuff out for the, like getting ready for the house to sell.  So...  Oh, no.  I'm dismantling.  This is serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's dismantling her IOT creation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be, and I'm going to put in some other stuff anyway.  Are you taking the reformer with you?  Yeah, the reformer's going with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I've moved my reformer several times now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it won't be here when we're showing the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like free of hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love my reformer.  Well, how about you, Jeff?  Do you have a number?  I have a few.  Oh, good.  I'm going to make up for Stacey.  Stacey's a derelict.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, thanks, Jeff.  I'm going to make up.  I am.  Okay.  Well, one, the business one.  So Google has evidently, says this report, profited $3 billion on made by Google stuff.  Everybody made fun when they had their laptops and their stuff.  That's a significant amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Three bills.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From their hardware.  Because their hardware gains traction.  So I thought that was actually newsworthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is actually an investor predicting that they'll make $3 billion this year from their hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but the fact that they could even be close to that number would surprise the heck out of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, their revenues are actually pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty hard to separate them out.  But yeah, they're selling a lot of Chromecast.  They're selling a lot of stuff.  So the fun ones, since we're on a podcast world, is that in the last week, BBC made, I hope you didn't have this already, 16,000 sound effects available for free.  Carsten, go mad.  Oh, I want them.  So I did two searches here, one for screams and one for doors.  So you can pick a few.  There's one that I think of the screams at the bottom of that page as orgies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about one woman, three fairly short screams?  That's a good one.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about teenage girls screaming in a theater?  They're a little slow.  What is a burlesque scream?  Well, we'll find out.  Let's find out.  Oh, it's like a, it's like a.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most of these are marked comedy, by the way, just to be clear here.  These are not.  I got all set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds like Stacy.  Oh, like the second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The second they put her page, it had beheadings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought, oh my God, they didn't do that.  But they were comedy beheadings.  Wait a minute.  This says standard orgy as opposed to, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the whip for?  60s.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's totally average.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think maybe orgy means something different in the UK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it means like, like, it's probably a technical term used by the BBC to indicate  like a riotous.  Fuck is this.  I think it's like, like, it's probably a technical term used by the BBC to indicate like a riotous.  Rock is calamity.  There's a lot of funny door ones.  There's machines of all kinds.  If you search for things, you search for line of type, you can hear a line of type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could you could you could you could you could away.  These were, I presume, used, you know, by BBC Radio Theatre and others.  That's things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  You know.  Oh, I see.  See, I take screams out, right?  Unmodulated groove on a blank record.  See the.  I think that's I think Moby used that in one of his recordings.  Anti aircraft batteries, Aquaria Army braiding machines.  Here's what a braiding machine sounds like.  No idea.  No, here's some.  I know, I hear some fishing industries sounds.  by 베더  Here's some fishing industry sounds.  Wow, this is great.  It's as in beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's one fizzy liquids was below fishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why we pay for our television licenses here in the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, you don't live in the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nevermind.  Oh, this is a radio heaven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so so Karsten, I think I think that when we do certain things, you got to have sound effects already for us.  You can mock us in all kinds of.  I already I had a huge selection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's find something for techno panic.  Let's have every time someone says techno panic, we need a screams page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here, let's.  Techno panic struck earlier today.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Wow, this is probably a lot of this is great.  So this makes reminds me of the fact that I've been watching homecoming on.  Is it Amazon Prime?  I think it is Amazon Prime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watched that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's based on a podcast from Kimlet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, hey, you know what?  Here's a suggestion, although it's old, so it's probably not applicable for most people.  We're listening to the unexplained disappearance of Mars Patel with my daughter and I.  And that is wonderful for a serial.  It's like cereal for kids.  Oh, cereal for kids.  It's in they use like kids voices and it's very fun.  And if you have a child.  And where is that?  On all your iTunes.  It's a podcast.  Yeah, it's just a straight up podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Should I start doing some fiction?  I guess I feel like already I always I always wanted to.  But I thought but I need good scripts.  Yes, you would have to write them.  They're hard to come by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I always start not this Friday, but next Friday.  I am volunteering to teach a podcasting class for my daughter's school.  And we're either going to do a story based one that they write.  Or we're going to do a news one.  That's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So actually speaking of podcasts, and you might include this, incorporate this into your curriculum.  This is a new site called ListenNotes.com written by one guy in San Francisco scratching his own itch.  It's a podcast search engine.  So if I enter Jeff Jarvis in here, it will come up with your appearances on The Good Fight.  This week in Google 488, our last episode, avoiding airway disasters with Dr. Jeff Jarvis.  That's the other Jeff Jarvis.  That's the other Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the one who actually has talent and is needed in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a German one that you did.  OMR Media Mit BFI.  So isn't this cool?  And then a bunch of twigs.  So you can search for any subject.  Let's search for, I don't know, Waymo.  And they search through many, many, many podcasts to find the words.  You know, it's Google for podcasts.  And it's really very cool.  I wanted to give him a credit for creating this.  Who is he?  Who he?  It says here somewhere.  Do you have a name on the site?  Yeah.  I found it somewhere.  Here it is.  About.  Sorry I asked.  Wenbin Fong.  He lives in San Francisco.  I quit my day job from Nextdoor 748 days and 23 hours ago.  Obviously a programming nerd.  He says I'm an avid podcast listener.  I listen to five plus hours every day.  I used to subscribe to only a few, but I still couldn't listen to all episodes.  So he created this.  I built it.  He said it was another.  I can build this in a weekendish project, but it's gotten bigger and bigger and bigger.  And so I think this is really cool.  He has a form for submitting a missing podcast.  Who means a discovery.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We mentioned something else while we're here.  So it's German.  Steady HQ dot com.  I needed when I wrote this piece about the German journalism stuff, I wanted to read  this one guy and there was a paywall.  Oh, hell.  And this is an amazing site that has pages and pages and pages of seven pages filled  with sites that are all German, but membership sites.  And so it makes some sense.  Yeah, we're not going to pay for all of them.  But it's an easy way to throw some money at some place and join as opposed to a paywall.  So I wish we had something like this in the U.S.  That was an aggregator of membership opportunities.  So you pay once and you get all this.  You sign up once.  No, you sign up once and then you can choose to easily say, OK, I want to I want to join  that one or that one.  Steady.  Steady HQ.  So you go to explore on the top.  What we're learning is that the German journalism is a very, very, very, very, very, very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very successful  and very, very successful.  And so what we're learning in the video world is that there is re aggregation happening  because Roku has just announced that it's going to do as Google already does with YouTube  TV and others to give you a chance to subscribe to Showtime or HBO within the Roku ecosystem.  So you get one bill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that like what texture is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, of course, Apple has bought texture and I don't know what's going to happen to  it.  I think it's going to be incorporated into an Apple News product.  That's the rumor.  But we don't know yet.  There's some problem because, you know, remember, texture was created by magazines like Hearst  and Conde Nast as a way to sell magazines in digital environment.  But all those deals occurred because they were owned by themselves.  Now that they're owned by Apple, I think all those deals are off the table and Apple  has to renegotiate.  And I think having a sticky time renegotiate.  I'm not sure.  But with all the magazines are in trouble.  There was a story somewhere today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I forget where I saw it, that women's magazines particularly in trouble, which is interesting.  Stacey, do you did you ever try 17 when I was 13?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  When you're 13.  Yeah.  You know, I pick up a Vogue every now and then just to look at the fashion spreads.  But I don't subscribe to any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were never a glamour reader or any of that.  I like Cosmo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not really.  No.  I mean, no, I don't read a lot of I only read really highfalutin magazines.  I don't know what.  No, I was like, I read Scientific American.  I read The New Yorker, The Economist.  I'm like, God, I am a pretentious person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought you were a family circle type.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I read websites for my silly women's comment, like my fun kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think this is why they're in trouble, because I look at almost everybody I know.  People don't subscribe to Dead Trees anymore.  They just read it online.  I used to buy them by the pound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had to double bag me at the Hudson News.  Yeah.  Because I just don't buy them anymore.  Well, that's good.  I still subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I subscribe to four magazines.  They just are really expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A funny quote thing happened with The Atlantic.  I have a digital subscription to The Atlantic and I got a paper copy of it last month.  And then I just got an email from them saying, due to some to an error, we sent all our digital subscribers paper copies.  But if you would like to continue your paper subscription for free, check here.  So I said, well, yeah, if it's free.  What's that all about, Jeff?  You know about how this is now owned by the Atlantic.  You got that too.  I got it from Wired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, candy trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a new trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it to goose subscriber numbers?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, that's readership numbers for the ads because you make more money on the print ads.  And so I've told the story on the show for my late father-in-law, who died many years ago.  We still get magazines because they think that it's going to go into his waiting room.  And we get different magazines every month sent to us because of that reason.  So they want to they want to boost the readership numbers on the magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to get those too, even though I didn't have a waiting room.  But because you were business.  Yes. They thought I'd put them in the lobby.  Right.  Oh, that's really interesting.  And that's probably where they get the pass along numbers.  That's exactly right.  Yes.  800 people read this because it was in Leo's lobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So some weeks we'll get like three copies of dogs and guns because they need more circulation this month.  Next month, no, we get Sports Illustrated.  Next month, we get something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Atlantic isn't owned by Condi Nast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Atlantic is now owned by Lorraine Powell Jobs and the Emerson Collective.  Oh, the Emerson Collective.  Yes. And so she's doing amazing and wonderful things around journalism and media.  Good for her.  And one of them was buying the Atlantic box, knock and barrel.  So it's so just as the Washington Post has its Bezos, Atlantic has its Powell Jobs.  Time has its Benioff.  Some of these folks are now going into the magazine world to try to save them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you worry that this is a little bit like the patronage system of old Venice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no. I mean, the New York Times has been.  They make money, though, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And they're the family has control, but the family owns really relatively small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Family's owning. I mean, like the Hearst Corporation.  But when I'm talking about patronage, where you buy something and run it, you don't expect to make any money on it just because you want to support good journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that. Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, I think Benioff wants to make money on this, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a personal with with Ben and Mark and his wife.  I wanted to get him to the journalism school to talk about that.  He wasn't available to do that.  I'm really curious because I don't know what I would do with Time magazine.  I had no idea. I used to work in the company. I don't know what I would do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody's going to get their news from a News Weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a general interest magazine. General interest is what's dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about The Week, which is a kind of compilation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that works because it's the value of aggregation. Yes.  And the guy who launched The Week in the US then worked with the last owner to save the Atlantic and really made it work.  And then now is it Bloomberg Media? Oh, and as your question about patronage, Leo, I think that what we're seeing is Gutenberg time.  Watch out. But I think we're seeing a return to earlier business models as we try out things.  And so patronage is a temporary solution to a problem as we try to understand where the value really is and rethink our models.  There's a lot of people declaring advertising dead. I certainly hope not. And you certainly hope not.  I don't think it is. I don't think paywalls are going to solve everything.  But I think patronage is a way to it was was was a model of the very early days of publication of books.  And it's coming back for for a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a conversation Lisa and I have been having because we looked at Gimlet.  Gimlet did three things. They have ads, but they also got raised at least 20 million in venture capital.  And they asked for money from their listeners.  And I've always felt like you can't you can't you pick one. You can't do all three. But I guess you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can. So what do you what do you guys conclude? What do you what do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lisa says, well, why don't we do why don't we ask why don't we create a club or something?  I think so. Some value added thing that we could then say, hey, you know, support twit.  That's how I discovered you way back when Leo Laporte. That's how we started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We never raised because because Jake Jarvis wanted to give you money.  And I said, who's this Leo Laporte guy you want to get money to? Oh, so it worked out. I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got some money. I got you. Young Jake joined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you didn't know anything about that. Who's this Google guy? We do a Google show.  But yeah, that's how that's how I knew you before you knew me.  That's what we originally thought we would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we never made enough money to support more than one show.  And so but advertising has been very good for us. I just you think it's going to go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that your advertising is the last that's going to go away because you have the added value of the relationship to the public and the trust and all that.  But advertisers are constantly under a lot of pressure. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I'm figuring I'll just retire at that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But your son, your son, if I were 30, I would be very worried.  Doesn't your son want the business? Yeah, he does. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But he's going to have to if he does, he's going to have to solve it, right? He's going to have to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the membership patronage. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The technical ecosystem will be so different. So well, Patreon didn't exist when I was asking Jeff's son for money.  Right. Patreon would have made that a lot easier, although.  I don't know. I mean, I just don't know. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just read something I'm doing my Gutenberg research and I just read a piece of this pile of that pile.  I don't know where it is, but on on on books and arguing that, you know, there's a major system of patronage now around books.  There's a major system of self-publishing around books that the books don't die.  But the business model of books. Yeah, changes has already changed pretty radically.  Yeah. What do you, Stacey, what do you think about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you have ads for your shows.  You also charge for a newsletter, which I think is. Oh, no, you don't.  I don't charge for my newsletter. So you don't have anything you charge for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Should you? Should you, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't. So I don't have the confidence to charge.  Neither do I. For my stuff.  I guess I know that sounds I just.  I don't like that model because I think especially given if I were slightly more tradeish, I would.  And I am kind of tradeish, but I also deal with like what I feel are really important issues that we should be talking about.  So I want more people to talk about them and think about them.  And I still do a lot of consumer facing stuff.  So that's kind of why.  Yeah. No, I don't know.  I don't know. I mean, that's why I hate to hear the notion that advertising might not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love ad supported free media because it gives us freedom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It gives us a lot. And I worry greatly about redlining quality media for just the privileged.  Yeah. So this amazed me.  So this amazed me. So this is this was in Wired, which I do have to subscribe to because there's all kinds of things I want to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I paid for Wired too, but I didn't pay for Bloomberg.  I couldn't bring myself to do that.  You know, part of the reason was, god damn it, don't they make enough money on those terminals?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so that's but that's part of the reason why you don't go to the well four times.  You know, I think as somebody who would buy this stuff, I'm not going to give them money.  They just got venture capital. They have ads.  It bugged me that for a long time Hulu had I had to watch ads after I paid for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I pay for the New York Times and The Washington Post, I'm not paying to buy content.  I'm paying as I support their work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the difference. I think it's patronage then. Yeah, because I do that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So so the future book is here, but it's not what we expected in Wired on July 20.  I mean, December 20, 18. So just out.  So they say Craig Modd says this. I couldn't believe this.  Almost half of author earnings now come from independently published books.  Wow. Independent books don't outsell big five books, but they offer higher royalty.  That's the point. 70 percent versus 25 percent. Right.  For the first time, perhaps since the invention of the premium press, authors and small presses have a viable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, did you ever get 25 percent for a book? No. That's crazy.  Fifteen percent. Yeah, at best. And it's not 15 percent of the cover price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's 15 percent of what the bookstore pays. And you give up 50 percent of your 15 percent to the agent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. OK, so that's really it's a low bar because it isn't hard to make more money when you publish yourself,  because the publisher is not taking the 85 percent or more of the of the revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, but you also don't do I mean, they don't do marketing or things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't do marketing anyway. They don't do marketing anyway.  That was the big lesson to me with the publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're if you're Danielle Steel, maybe you'll get a book tour and some marketing dollars.  But any other book you get, maybe an editor. Nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe the lesson I tell the authors is you've got to hire your own publishers with your own money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why if you're doing that, you might as well hire an indexer and a proofer and a layout person and just do the whole thing yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or in the old days, you know, when I was reading books past, the way to get to the bookstore shelves had to be right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You had no choice. You didn't get an end cap on your own.  And now, you know, I don't know. Yeah, I published 13 books with a publisher.  You don't make any money at it. But now, that's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you reconsidered that kind of stuff now. Yeah, it's all new.  It's all a different world. Business you control more. You can market it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm too tired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of tired, you guys. Thank you, Stacey Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody go run. Subscribe. Stacey on iot.com. Don't give her money.  Just listen to the ads and buy the products. She and Kevin do such a great job covering IOT.  You must listen and then get a newsletter because that's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I subscribe. Jeff Jarvis, he gets paid handsomely as director of the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There will be. And I'm coming on this week in tech on Sunday after CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right on. That would be great. Thank you for doing that.  I haven't been to CES in a while.  How many years?  God, I don't know.  I think it's been five or six, maybe seven for me. It's been a while.  We used to go every year and cover it. We used to have a big booth on the floor and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, that's expensive. It was. It was. That's why we stopped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  South by Southwest. Well, I think we're going to do South by this year. Really? Yeah.  Should we all get together? This could be your last hurrah, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, for South. I was like, dude, I'm not dying. No, but you're leaving.  I'm just moving to Seattle. You're leaving Austin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I'll let you know. I'll get back to you.  But we've had some interest in doing the Capital One house again.  And if we do that, we'd love to have you both there. We'll figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I might be in Sweden during South by, but I might not be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you want to escape. This is so typical of Austinites.  They just get out of town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm getting paid to talk. We'll get Wes Faulkner on instead.  There you go. Good. There's lots of great Austinites I can hook you up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, anyway, Sweden. That'll be fun.  I love Sweden. Oh, give me Stockholm. Jeff has a restaurant.  Stockholm and Helsinki. I love Stockholm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know Helsinki is not in Sweden ever, but I'm just going to the Nordic countries.  But yes, I am going to Stockholm as well.
