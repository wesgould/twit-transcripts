We're looking in Skyward.  But before we do that, let's say hello to our panel today, a  great panel joining us from all over the world.  Well, not really.  Starting with Gina Trapani, who is calling from San Diego.  Hi, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am great.  Thank you for being on Twig on Sunday.  It was really fun having you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was so fun.  It was so great to finally see the cottage.  I'm back in my office in San Diego, a little sadder to be  here instead of there.  But love doing Twig.  It was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Gina and I had some special time together, which  was great.  We got to talk and stuff.  And it was really nice.  Also welcoming another fellow who is also on Twig This Week,  which is Kevin Marks from C-E-L Sports and chatter.com.  Great to see you.  This time in his garden in a beautiful setting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there any birds you hear at my fault?  I'm just hoping you won't hear poodles and lawn mowers too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or children.  Also joining us and very apt today, Danny Sullivan from  searchengineland.com, because Google had a big search  announcement yesterday.  And we'll talk about that in just a bit.  Thank you, Danny, for joining us.  Thanks for having me.  Good to have you.  And a quick look at the moon, just to see, yes, it's fully  occluded now.  Google's actually streaming this video on YouTube Live,  youtube.com slash Google.  So you can watch, I guess where is it?  South America, right?  So we're not in the Northern Hemisphere able to see this.  But what's even more fun is the Google Doodle today.  If you go to google.com, it's too late if you're listening  after the fact.  But if you go to google.com, they've got a little slider.  And they show you exactly, in real time, the state of the  moon, which is fully occluded as we speak.  And you can go back and forth.  I don't know why they put a slider in there.  But you can go back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure it's HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course it is.  They're demonstrating another HTML5 control, right?  You think that that's a widget that's built in, or you have  to actually, you must have to do it, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a built-in slider in HTML5.  Is there?  Oh, that's neat.  Is that really cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And look, the hand changes.  Pretty sure.  From its arrow, pointing Mickey Mouse glove, hand.  And we can drag it around.  Yeah, of course, every Google Doodle now is really going to  be an HTML5 demo from now on, right?  Yeah, pretty much.  That's just a given.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I thought.  They've been doing a good job with them, though.  Oh, they're fun.  The Les Paul Doodle was really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The guitar that you could actually play and  record your music?  Yeah.  Is there anybody who's uploaded those anywhere, or  what people have done?  I wonder.  Let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was disappointed that Google didn't actually make it easy  for people to upload them in exactly that way.  There were a couple papers that did some roundups.  You can do a search for best Google guitar songs, and you'll  hear people who were playing Stairway to Heaven or other  stuff like that.  But it was like, come on, carry on with it.  Make it easy for people to submit.  They got the cool doodle, and they didn't have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  follow-through after that.  I think you'd have to have a camera and record it.  Here's somebody who did the.  Planet has the same spin.  Who's talking?  Oh, this is the YouTube.  So there's narration.  Wow, there's nothing really quite as  dynamic as a lunar eclipse.  It's inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It faces its parent.  And moon is not the oddball.  It's not an oddball.  Title forces have done this to absolute music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, you know what would be cool is if I played the music  from the Google Doodle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there it is.  There's the same features that we always see.  Behind it.  Because that's the side that always faces us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's a really interesting point you raised

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there, Bob, because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought our shows were boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As we learn more and more as we go about the universe  around us, what once appeared to be unique.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This guy's a little over-awe.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Isn't as unique or special as we thought it was or wanted it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll turn off the eclipse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exoplanets around other stars.  That's really too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is from geek.com.  PC Magazine Creative Director Chris Phillips.  Oh, no, that's not this.  It's called Hockbill's Cannon.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's pretty cool.  I didn't know you could use a keyboard, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you had to turn off Google Instant to make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's another thing.  They don't explain this.  Could it be that hard for you to maybe?  They're doing more of these interactive things.  It's discovery.  And it's fun if you write about them,  because then you can discover this stuff  and explain to people that, oh, the test tubes.  Everyone, they did the test tube thing.  And if you moved it really fast, it was going to go boiling.  There are all sorts of different things going on.  But it's nice if there were some instructions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, think of it as like Easter eggs, right?  I'm sure they treat it kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, there's that, too.  You kind of want to take away, oh, you got the discovery.  But then, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Lady Gaga's Paparazzi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, that is awesome.  I was like, what about that?  Sounds so good.  I was so frustrated, I kept trying to use the keyboard,  but it kept executing a search.  And I couldn't figure out why, because I  had read instructions somewhere.  And so now I know I had to turn instant off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should have gone to search engine land.  He would have explained it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It should have said something like,  it looks like you're trying to play the guitar.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you need to play the guitar?  Microsoft would have done that.  OK, here's a.  This is the new Google Instant, yes.  Here's where we violate copyright and probably get  this video pulled off of YouTube.  Ironically, because it's a YouTube video of a guy doing  Beatles music.  I like that.  Guy with really good voice.  Yeah, guy with really good voice.  You don't want to miss that.  He's actually the lead singer of the band After Edmund.  The Google guitar, thought I'd play a song.  So he's actually a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, June.  Don't make it bad.  Take a sad song and make it better.  Remember to let her into your heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you can start.  OK, so for people just tuning in,  you might think this is kind of dumb until you realize he's  doing this with the Google search page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  With the logo.  The logo.  He's playing the Google logo.  It's crazy.  Better than Pac-Man, I'd say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  Should we say it's the best Google doodle of all time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe I take back my better than Pac-Man.  If you're a musician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's pretty cool.  Pac-Man had a habit of starting to play the Pac-Man music  when you weren't expecting it to, which upset a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a little annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Pac-Man is the only one that survived, though, right?  That Google actually saved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, all the logos have been saved.  Really?  Even when Google doesn't say, oh,  here's our special save place.  You just go to their special Google Logos page.  A search for Google Logos should bring it up.  And then you go to the page, and all their logos are there,  and they're listed by date.  And that's their permanent location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  I shouldn't really be playing Pac-Man.  So you can go back in time.  That's another great tip from Danny Sullivan of Search Engine  Land.com, ladies and gentlemen.  So you search by date?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just search for Google Logo.  And then the first page you should get,  it should say something like Google Holiday Logos, which  is, again, sort of a dumb name for it.  But that's where you can go through and see all  the different logos that they've done.  Oh, look at this.  By year.  That are listed there.  And then they have.  And different countries as well that way.  They should have links to some of the interactive ones  that kind of come up that way.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they were originally holiday logos, weren't they?  But I mean, you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, I did this post.  So it was like all the Google Logos,  I think, will bring it up.  These are fan logos.  I got to go back and finish it up.  But I did this post.  You can search for it.  It's called Those Special Google Logos, Sliced and Diced.  And I did it about a year ago.  And I actually went through and categorized all the logos  by what was the most popular holiday  and what was the most favorite national day that  was celebrated.  And I need to finish picking up the project.  I don't.  Because I don't know.  I just like to do it.  But they've got all these crazy logos.  And the one thing that you'll find when they do this is,  the logos never happen on any time that you would expect it.  This was like what?  The 92nd anniversary of Les Paul, right?  And then they'll do something for like the 23rd anniversary  or the 72nd anniversary.  And it's really rare for them to actually do something  like on the 100th or the 10th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was surprised they didn't do anything for IPV sixth day  last week.  I thought, since they were behind it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll celebrate the third anniversary of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  It was IPV sixth day.  This is a great article, Danny.  You know what I'm sad about?  And you must be sad about this too.  When I did a search for those special Google Logos,  I got the very first thing I got looks  like a demand media site.  Oh, no.  Technews.am, is that you?  And then AllThingsD, and then searchengineland.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, that's all your personalized results.  I get something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is it?  I wish they had a minus one.  Well, I'll just plus one you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so you can do that.  Actually, it's interesting.  I'm signed out, and mine is coming up second.  I don't know which one's coming up there.  I see AllThingsD.  Hey, I'll take AllThingsD.  They were just linking over to us, so that was nice.  That's better than nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get Danny first, signed in.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why does Google think I'm the cheeseball?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  You are your Google search result.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at this.  I've not seen this before.  Have you ever seen this before?  After I plused one, it said, you plused one to this publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Google's very worried now that ever since that whole FTC  thing at Google Buzz that they want you to know you did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was logged in when I did it.  That's weird.  One little complaint for plus one.  I put on my blog, I'm ashamed to admit, but I put like  buttons on there.  Because you've got to kind of have like buttons nowadays if  you want to drive traffic.  You must use like buttons, Danny, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have them.  It's interesting.  I'm about to do a post where having them on our pages  doesn't really, we'd serve out like maybe 50,000 impressions  in a day, and you get 22 likes.  Yeah, that's about right.  We have them there because I think it still makes sense to  do it, and I think it can help in other ways.  But I think a lot of the activity for us and perhaps  other sites happens on Facebook itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I put a like button there because I am able in, they have  a space in the JavaScript to specify a URL.  See, I have multiple posts on a single page.  So by specifying the URL to be the permalink for the entry, I  can actually have it.  But I can't put a plus one button there because plus one  doesn't give me that feature.  It just takes the whole page.  Oh, yeah.  So I only could put the plus one button on the specific  permalink page, which I do, but it's kind of sucky because  I'd like to put it on the total blog page where it would be  seen far more times, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, that's my design mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just thought I'd say that.  I know we have a few people listening at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be fixed by the end of the show.  It might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've got to be careful because you have to have the  same domain thing.  Otherwise, you could spoof people.  Right.  So you have to say, OK, it's within the same domain.  What would be the negative of spoofing?  We can put plus one buttons on a page that will then promote  something else.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was happening though with Facebook.  I think that people were using the Facebook buttons and  behind the scenes making it so that if you were clicking on  something else, I can't remember what it was.  You could specify for any like button a URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can make it look like somebody likes something other

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  than what they're looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you put some code in that URL, you could do something.  For example, let's say I'm Amazon logged in.  I've got a cookie on Amazon for one click.  If you put an Amazon buy link in there, would it just go  through?  Unless they sanitize their inputs, it probably would.  So there's a flaw.  And I'm sure what Google's going to say is no, because a  plus one is for a page.  So if you'd have a plus one button anywhere on any page,  you're plus oneing that page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Google would say that get is supposed to be  idempotent, because that's the kind of thing  Google would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Idempotent, is that the phrase?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I suspect they just didn't think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told my wife that last night.  Honey, I'm idempotent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Danny, about your low level of likes on your pages, I have  this theory that our audience, like the geek audience, just  isn't as likely to use Facebook.  I got that sense in conversations at Food Camp.  I have a hard time finding developers to work on the  Facebook plugin for my open source application, because I  just have a lot of developers who outright say, I don't  have a Facebook account, and I'm not going to open one.  So I don't know.  It's just kind of a theory.  But that seems like a very low level of activity on your  like buttons on your site.  Your site targets a pretty geeky audience.  They're too geeky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it's weird.  I mean, what surprised me is that you will get some posts  that will have hundreds of likes on them.  But those are posts that have gone viral on Facebook itself,  independently of the site.  I see this with LinkedIn, right?  We have huge amounts of traffic coming in from LinkedIn.  We don't have a single LinkedIn button on the site.  I'm going to change that, just because I'm feeling bad  about it now.  But there's this whole activity that's happening on  LinkedIn that's working independently of the buttons.  Facebook, when I talked with them about it, they were like,  well, you've got to be even more social.  And you need to have the like buttons at the  top and at the bottom.  And it's leading me to the point of thinking I'm just going  to write articles that are nothing but a giant like  button, and maybe that will do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds like a good social media strategy, Danny.  I think you should try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every article is a giant like button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, the most likes I ever got was on the post where I  said I'm going to put a like button on here, but I do not  like it.  And I got 188 likes on that one.  So I don't know what the hell's going on.  By the way, thank you.  Our chat room has said there is a way in the advanced portion  of the, let me see if I can find it here.  Where is it?  Oh, here it is.  In the advanced, so these are the add plus one to your  website, google.com slash webmasters slash plus one slash  button.  And if you go to advanced, you can actually put a URL in  there, and since I could put some, it looks like I could  put arbitrary PHP in there.  I'll be able to put the PHP code for the  permalink into that.  So I guess I can fix this.  So Google did know about it, unless they just added it.  I think it did not.  I think it was there, and I just didn't notice.  So thank you for correcting me.  I was wrong.  So would you say not to have, it shouldn't, it's funny  because Bradley Horowitz was coming around with plus one  buttons at FooCamp.  Did you get one?  Real.  I did.  Little lapel pins.  And when he gave me mine, I said, I like that.  And I thought, oh, I shouldn't have said that.  That was probably a mistake.  So yesterday, Danny, Google had a live event announcing some  interesting new features in Search.  And we had cupcakes, too.  And you live blogged it, of course.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the announcements came kind of fast and furious.  There wasn't anything that was really on  its own like this big thing.  The last time they did one of these big search events, it  was for Google Instant, which really was  this big, huge change.  Yesterday, it was a bunch of more incremental things.  Actually, some of the stats I thought were interesting were  some of the stats that they shared that  you're showing there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at the search traffic by day of week.  The worst day for search on the desktop is Saturday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but what he's saying is, and that was the thing, he's  saying you look at that and you think, oh, well, at the  weekend, nobody's searching.  But then when you look at the mobile traffic, when the  desktop traffic goes up down, the mobile traffic spikes.  And so what he was talking about was that basically,  we're going to continue to search wherever we can go.  And we're doing it on our devices more, which led into  the first part of their analysis.  So Alice Cooper was right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody's searching on the weekend.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't quite remember it that way, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really sorry.  Continue, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should have had him there singing that  that would have been great.  That would have been cool.  That would have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's actually really interesting, that mobile just  peaks on the weekend.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was.  It was very much so.  And in fact, they did also by time of day.  That's the next thing that you see there.  And you'll see that what happens, you get a little  lunchtime slump, as they called it.  And it becomes lunchtime, so everybody is  going off to eat.  But then when they went to the mobile, and then in the  evening nobody's searching.  And then the mobile, they said, you see a lunchtime peak.  It was funny.  Emil was saying, so everybody's eating with one  hand and searching with the other.  That's fine.  And then in the evening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're searching where do we go?  Exactly.  Where should we go?  Should we go eat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they rolled out these mobile changes.  I think the most dramatic thing was if you go to Google  in your mobile browser now at the bottom of the page, you  get these little icons that say, find a local restaurant  near you.  And that's why.  It's really interesting.  It kind of keeps you away from doing the kind of browse type  of search.  And there's some of the buttons that you can see on  there, but I can't even find my camera there.  It's like restaurant and coffee and martinis, bars.  Is that at Google.com?  That's what you get if you go to Google.com in your mobile  browser now.  In fact, here I am on my mobile browser.  And this is right at the very bottom.  And you'll see it is saying restaurants, coffee, bars.  And then there's a little more button.  And they're just icons.  And if I click on one of those icons, I'll see whatever is  sort of closest to me.  Like I clicked on coffee, and it brings up and it tells me  that Alta, which is a nice coffee restaurant around here,  is popping up right there at the top.  And so a lot of these things that you do on your mobile  browser, you're going to do the same things all the time.  We need a restaurant near me.  And so that's a common thing.  And so here's Google not even making you having to type in  restaurant, you just push a button, you get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of funny.  I mean, how many people go to Google.com on their mobile  browser?  That would be my guess.  Well, apparently somebody does.  Yeah, some people do.  The button as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The search button, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it?  So what I did is I went to Google.com and Safari.  No, because that's what I do is when I search.  So what am I going to search for?  Lunch?  Search for Captain Crunch and see what you are.  Did you see that I was searching for Captain Crunch?  You did.  And that was because, oh, never mind.  This previous search is yes.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What other cereal will rip up the top of my mouth now?  What's going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was worried that they had  discontinued Captain Crunch.  I had heard that rumor.  But as it turns out, it was just a rumor that still Quaker  Oats will continue to make Captain Crunch.  So I've searched for lunch.  I'm getting the Wikipedia entry explaining what lunch is,  which I guess that's OK.  I'm places for lunch near where I am.  Aha, look at that.  That's very good.  That's the Google Places.  This is becoming more important.  Boy, I tell you, you see people.  I've just heard about a company, I shall remain  nameless, Yellow Pages, that is charging people hundreds of  dollars a month saying we'll drive lots of traffic if you  have an online entry at yp.com.  And if you just Google something, this is really how  people find stuff.  And it's free.  Google Places.  Why pay for something?  Lunch 2.0.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you click on any of those entries, you see the  little preview next to it over there on your right hand side.  Now go back down to one of the actual listings.  See onto your right, there's a little button there.  And if you click on that, that should let you know you can  start flipping through.  And this is something I've had before, but they stressed it  again that you have this is sort of Google instant previews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They just recently added that.  I remember we talked about it on the show.  So one of the things that they found when they looked at  search results.  Yeah, isn't that cool?  Yeah, it's a cool feature.  Kevin's looking at that.  Never saw that.  One of the things that they found out in stats, and they  have a graph to show it, is that lots of people are using  speech now to search on Google Mobile.  I really love that.  Whoops, let me get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one of the things I like.  And that led into this other thing that they've added, which  is if you have an Android phone or you're using the Google  app or iPhone, you can talk to the phone and it will do the  searches for you.  Android's amazing because you can talk to the phone and do  any number of actions as well.  I do it all the time.  I'll hold down the search button.  I'll say navigate to someplace I want to go.  And it's fired up the GPS and it's directing me  within a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or send text or send email.  Isn't that less laggy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I always used to find it would sit there for ages and  have to slap it for it to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It depends on your connection.  If you have a good connection, it's almost instant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I find it's been working really well to the degree that I  actually make use of it.  Which is something that they stressed in the talk, which was  the more that they get the voice accuracy right, the more  that people start to use it more and more and go back to  it.  They feel like I can trust it.  And so now they brought it to our desktop, which seems kind  of weird because I don't quite know that I'm going to be  sitting around on my desktop and doing a search and then  say, oh, I want to talk to my computer and do the search when  I have a keyboard there.  But maybe it'll help drive awareness that there's voice  search available, period, which might cause more people to do  it on their mobile devices.  So how do I do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it available now on Chrome?  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's in Chrome 13, which is like the Canary Dev channel.  This is my tip, but it's fine.  I'll come up with another one.  You can enable it in Experiments right now.  There is a voice experiment that you can enable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Well, we'll save that, and we will show you how to do that  in Gina's tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Anyway, go ahead, Danny.  I want to hear about the cupcakes, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, the cupcakes.  I just tweeted a picture that was a hot part.  Are they from Magnolia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where were they from?  Who's the cupcake company out here?  Citizen Cake, right?  Is it?  No, let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We probably have different ones down south.  I'd have to look them up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Where's down south?  Down south of California?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Gina and I are close enough.  I'm in Orange County.  She's in San Diego somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where's the cupcake place in San Francisco?  Do they have one in Mountain?  Where was the event?  Was it Danny?  Was it in San Francisco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was at the Yerba Buena Center for the Performing Arts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Those are some good looking cupcakes.  Yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  Is that on search engine?  We should probably talk about instant pages.  But I had to find it.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's lunchtime.  I want cupcakes.  You've got to see the cupcakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was actually I got the Twitter  doing their own image hosting now.  And I just saw it pop up for the first time today  that I could do it from within my Twitter account.  So I thought, oh, I'll throw some cupcakes out there  to see how it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's Twitter.  I got to go to Twitter.com.  What's your Twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Danny Sullivan.  Twitter.com slash Danny Sullivan.  And then if you pick dot Twitter.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the first time I've seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they just launched that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they said they would be rolling it out to people  over the coming weeks.  And so I saw something like, wow, I've  got a little photo button.  I can upload this.  So I probably should go back and do a blog post.  But I figured somebody had already  done that by this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it should just appear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you keep going, it was earlier this morning.  You have to specifically click on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to talk about those Chromebooks in just a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Marissa Mayer invested in a cake company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think you're right.  Yeah, there it is.  See where it says hey?  And then if you click on the little button to the end.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, those look yummy.  And branded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Inside search.  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I brought two home for my kids, actually.  I managed to get them into my bag into a cup.  And they didn't know if they could eat the things on the top.  I said, no, you're safe.  Google's not going to poison your tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All delicious.  Even the little badges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now see, the other thing you could do  is you could take that picture.  And the thing I thought was most interesting  was the search by picture feature  they rolled out yesterday.  And this lets you literally take a picture.  You can drag it and drop it into the search box on Google.  And it will go out and find other pictures that  seem to be similar to it.  And it's kind of neat.  If you've got, say, some place that you've been at,  you're not quite certain where that is located at,  it may find matches.  Or it may find other kinds of things that match.  Sometimes it gets it horribly wrong, but it's not perfect.  And that's supposed to roll out to everybody  over the coming week.  You'll know when you get it, they said,  because you'll see a little camera icon that will appear  when you're at Google Images.  And there's some extensions and other things  that you can do to it.  Oh, shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to search for cupcakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Danny, did you get a chance to try that out?  Did they roll it?  Did they give it to the folks in attendance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have it.  See, the camera icon.  You have it.  I don't even have it.  Let me drag cupcakes here.  Oh, let's get some more cupcakes.  Let's see how small it is.  Whoa.  Uploading file.  That's kind of cookie.  And now thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am turning green right now.  I may have crashed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  OK.  OK, now what?  Nothing.  Got some errors.  Let's go back to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I played with a bunch of things.  I pulled a bunch of pictures off my blogs of places  like when I was in Alaska, just like a mining village.  And I dropped it in there and it found the location.  So it did work pretty well.  And then there were occasions where you're like, wow,  you totally didn't get that right at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It kind of didn't.  It's broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Identifying places seem to be the thing that they demoed,  the thing that they kind of pointed out as the use case.  But I'm wondering about things like plants, animals,  like food.  Are the limitations similar to Google Goggles,  which says basically we're not so good at plants and flowers,  but we are good at other things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems to be.  They didn't say that there was any particular thing  it was good or necessarily bad at.  It really seemed to be if there are  a lot of pictures that are similar to what  you're looking for, it would probably  have a better chance of finding something.  I asked them specifically about facial recognition.  And you know what I bet's happening is that logo's breaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's that stupid logo's breaking it.  Google Doodle is breaking image search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're not doing, they said they're not  doing facial recognition where they're trying to really go  and use the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want the eclipse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go away.  But they are, like in one case, I  gave it a picture of some smokestacks  that were at an angle.  And it couldn't find where that was located at.  And yet, I had done it in a sepia tone or whatever.  And it matched some photos that were amazingly  of the same kind of colored background.  So it's looking for color matches,  certain kind of pattern matches, and other things.  Which is why you kind of get the misses that  come up at some times.  Now, because I'm using an experimental version

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of Google search, should I turn that off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, turn off all, like leave all your experiments.  I got plus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So just leave my experiments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Image search is one of the experiments?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  Instant on images, no.  OK, now I am like vanilla Google experience.  Let's go back to Google.com.  See, it doesn't say, OK.  OK, let's see this.  I think that's what's breaking it, is that slider.  OK, go back to images.  Still have the little camera.  See, switch by image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want that camera so bad it hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know why I lucked out.  OK, I'm dragging cupcakes, because I want more cupcakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I sure don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, oh, it was.  It was.  But, oh, the cupcakes are all people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, but definitely color matching.  But they're cupcakes like people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, let's do that again.  Let's do that with one of us.  So here's Van Gogh's Starry Starry Night.  Let's see what happens there.  Here's the ones they guarantee to work.  And look, yeah, that's the ones they, look,  similar images, they're all the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just tried goggles on a picture of the plant behind me,  and it did find a similar looking glance.  That's good.  Let me see if I have other.  But mostly the same color, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Grab anything on your desktop and throw it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, just see what happens.  Here's a picture of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the results are other images.  Oh, it guessed Twitter.  Yeah, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, of course, it had that in the name.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me get a picture of me.  This is the ultimate vanity search, right?  Exactly.  Let's see.  I'll go to images.  Search for Leo Laporte.  OK, now I've got a picture of me.  Let's get a good picture.  OK, I'm going to drag that to the desktop.  Oh, you can drop it there.  I could just do it from the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should be able to right click and search.  Yeah.  And there's a bunch of other extensions and ways  to do it, too.  When you have the Chrome extension or the Firefox  extension is very nice because if you're on a website  with a picture, you can right click and tell it  search by picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't really drag there.  It is image here.  It guessed my name.  Got lots more images.  That works.  That actually I think that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, those are other images from that same shoot, right?  Leo looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they are.  Not only.  Yeah, they're from the same shoot.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It makes sense.  If you use Picasso, it ends up doing that, right?  When you give it one face, it'll recognize the faces  from the same sequence because the lighting and the hair  and everything was similar enough that it would know it.  It takes a while to get the more generic ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trying to drag these.  I don't know why I have so much trouble dragging stuff.  All right, well, anyway, I'm sorry.  I'm just setting sidetracked here.  But I just think that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a twig tradition.  Ego searches are a twig tradition.  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just want to say the one with the beer belly  is photoshopped.  That is not really me.  Just so you know.  It's looking like it uses some text as well.  I mean, like the tags and so forth.  But that would make sense.  Why wouldn't?  It should use every bit of the thing it can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's actually doing geolocation by looking  inside the image for geolocation tags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, why not?  Anything else they announced?  What else did they announce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the last thing, if I remember correctly,  was they did this Google Instant Pages,  which is where they will preload or pre-render  a page that they think you're going to click on in the search  results.  How do they know?  Well, they're guessing.  I mean, they're doing a search.  And I think it's not one.  It's the top one, which is most likely  what you're going to click on.  They're not doing it, though, for every search.  So it's a bit weird between when they think you're most likely  to do it, and I suspect when they think it's worthwhile,  pulling down data from a website that might not  mind them doing it.  But basically, behind the scenes,  they're loading up probably the first page  in those search listings, guessing  that you're going to click on it.  And so that when you do, the page is right there.  You're not waiting for everything to load up.  And it's similar to how they had been working through Firefox  to do pre-fetching, which was they  pulled the first page in the search results, HTML code.  But then all the images would still have to come in.  And when I was talking to them, they got to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Firefox got in trouble for that, didn't they?  I mean, people yelled at them for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they did.  Everybody yells at everything at first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, so that's what I was saying about idempotent.  So I'll just explain what that actually means.  The way when you do an HTTP get, it's supposed to not matter  if you do the same get, you should get the same thing  and it shouldn't have side effects.  That's what idempotent means.  And so if you view your pages properly,  it shouldn't matter whether you fetch the same page twice  or get it from a proxy or anything like that.  It should be the same thing.  And the problem is if you use a get to actually have  a side effect on the server, then you can get into  all kinds of trouble on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say the server increments a number every time  the page is loaded.  That will increment that number.  But aren't most pages dynamic now?  How does that impact it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the dynamic pages are constructed by running  JavaScript after you've done the gets.  So one of the things they did with this was that  it's not just pre-fetching the page,  it is actually pre-rendering it.  So it's doing everything it would do to render that page,  just putting it off screen and then when you click,  it takes it straight through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it doesn't do another get at that point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but this is the thing that Chrome does  that Firefox doesn't do.  It's not just pre-fetching, so just downloading the bits  and having them ready.  It's actually creating the whole rendering surface,  doing everything we do, restarting the JavaScript running  and so on.  And one of the demos they did, they showed it where  they were clicking on the image and it had some kind  of rotating slideshow and the slideshow would have rotated  twice before they'd actually clicked through it  because the JavaScript is running in the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if I search for something on Danny's site  and Chrome pre-renders in the background  because it's the first result, so the time it takes me  to move my mouse and click on it, it does that.  If I don't click on that result, it looks to Danny  in Danny's logs, like I have looked at the page  when I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unless my analytics tool or I've done other things  to look for the clues that will tell me that,  oh, that was just Google pre-rendering the page.  It wasn't an actual human visitor,  of which I haven't even bothered to do yet  because I'm still resting up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you do that by IP address?  How would you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I talked with them briefly about a youngster,  they said there were all sorts of technical docs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The refer might look different.  The refer would be Google, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, it's your browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Your browser's pre-fetching and rendering.  I imagine that Google Analytics has this built.  If you use Google Analytics,  I imagine that Analytics has something.  Basically, the browser has to let the page know  a human is actually looking at this somehow  when you actually do the click.  So I'm sure that there's white or Python generated files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, there's a page visibility API,  which lets you tell if the page is actually visible or not,  which is also useful if your tab isn't front-most.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, if they're pre-rendering the page,  I don't know that they're then also executing  all the JavaScript, which would be what you'd need  to have running for Google Analytics to register.  That's a good point too.  The Analytics is part of the page.  Right, and then for example, if you're using Chartbeat,  it's constantly pinging back and forth  to tell that somebody's there, so maybe that's not running.  But it was like what happened  when Firefox started doing this,  and Google and Firefox are doing it.  Within the first month, a lot of people  were really concerned this was going  to mess up their Analytics,  that they were gonna get all these things registering  in their Analytics that were people  who really weren't there, didn't click through.  So I've done a Google search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this turned on on Google search now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe it's coming up.  Not yet. Coming up,  and the next version's a Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a Chrome 13. It's a Chrome 13.  It's a Chrome 13. You need to be on the Chrome Dev Bill

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to see it at the moment, I think they said.  Okay, okay. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when I look right now, as I am at Twitter,  it's not prefetching anything in Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it depends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what they said is it's like when you click  on a link to put it into a new tab,  it does the same amount of work as it would do  to create that tab, and then when you switch  to the tab, except it's doing it with an invisible tab.  And I didn't click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you didn't click.  Which is the significant issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You see where this is all going.  You no longer have to search,  nor either go to websites, and in fact,  if you just turn your computer on,  it will be everywhere. It's gonna load  on your sites. Yeah.  I think you'll be later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's incredible.  Not a good idea.  Well, I can see where that's gonna screw up analytics.  It is kind of a competitive advantage  for Google Analytics, isn't it?  Because presumably they account for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When they don't seem to be happy,  they might have to do it.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm Quantcast and Comscore  and all these guys will chart beat.  I use Quantcast Analytics and Chartbeat.  What I should do is compare the three  and see if there's a significant difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And web developers can use the pre-rendering technology  on their sites too.  You can put a link rail attribute in your HTML,  which you specify the page that you think  that the user might click next.  Like if you have a next page of posts  or something like that.  So it's not just for Google search results,  which is kind of nice.  So you can kind of speed up your site too,  if it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you could tell that from the analytics.  80% of the people go to this page  after they go to that page.  So preload this page.  Right. That makes sense.  I've preloaded my Netflix page.  We're gonna take a break.  Danny Sullivan is here from searchengineland.com.  Gina Trapani from smarterware.org and thinkupapp.com.  Kevin Marks from salesforce.com.  Go to his new, what is this chatter.com, Kevin?  What is chatter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So chatter is like Twitter or Facebook  for the people inside your company.  It's basically gives you that stream of updating events  that's tied to all the things that are going on internally.  So you sign up for it with your work email address  and you can create an internal activity stream  full of the events that you send to each other  and any actions you take as part of the business stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually really cool.  We are currently using IRC kind of like that.  We have a back channel on IRC that's always running.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  That's the sort of classic way of doing that.  Many sort of web projects work that way.  But what you've seen is that, A,  not everyone wants to run IRC.  And also they like the richer rendering  and the links that you get that's more like a Facebook stream.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's good to have all three of you.  We'll talk more in just a second.  You're watching This Week in Google,  brought to you this week by Netflix and Netflix Streaming.  It is the simplest hassle-free way to get movies right away  into your computer or your gaming system,  your console, your Roku box, your Apple TV,  pretty much everybody.  This is the gold standard for streaming now.  I mean, if you're selling a box or a TV  that has internet connectivity,  you've got to support Netflix.  Watch instantly.  And I just love it.  Tens of thousands of wonderful movies.  I never plan ahead anymore.  I don't have to.  I get home and I know I'm going to have a great movie  waiting for me or a great TV show waiting for me.  Every time I go here, there's something new,  which is also kind of fun.  I want you to try it out for free for 30 days.  This is $7.99 a month,  but you could try it free for 30 days  by going to netflix.com slash twit cancel anytime.  You know, there's no contract.  It's as easy to turn off as it is to turn on,  but you're never going to want to turn it off.  Xbox 360, PS3, Nintendo, Wii.  Just look at all these movies.  Look at them.  I love this.  I don't know how they figure this out,  but they know where I am.  And they say, here's the favorites.  Here's what people in your town are watching.  Wild.  Wild.  It's really fun.  Netflix.  Your town has taste.  Yeah, I think we, you know,  we've got Battlestar Galactica.  These are all the ones I watch.  It must be, they just,  I must be the only one using it in my town.  Sean the sheep, Parks and Rec.  The office.  Okay.  Bill Burr, I don't know who he is.  These are, these are what people in Petaluma are watching.  Oh, busy town.  Who doesn't love busy town?  And play time for Kipper.  So, you know, it's kind of interesting  to see what your neighbors are watching, isn't it?  I actually never really paid any attention to this.  Netflix.com slash twit.  Find out what your neighbors are watching and watch it too.  Free for the next 30 days.  So that was, so that was the, the search event.  Danny, you think a worthwhile event,  not as exciting as instant search,  but still there's, that's, that's a lot of new features.  Mostly Chrome features though.  It's just kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they rolled out, I think it was searched by,  I can't remember which one it was that rolled out  and it was both for Chrome and for Firefox,  but it wasn't for internet Explorer,  which was interesting.  Cause they probably could have supported that easily as well.  And some of the other things were just Chrome only.  They'll, they'll almost certainly come to the other browsers  though they do tend to do that.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's, it's inevitable.  Moving, I guess we, I guess we've covered the search event.  Moving on to patents.  Why not?  My favorite kind of news story.  Well, first of all, Apple and Nokia settled  their long standing fight back and forth.  Both are seeing, suing each other.  It looks like Nokia won this round.  Apple will be paying them a large undisclosed amount,  enough to change Nokia's bottom line,  they said in the press release and ongoing royalties.  I've heard some people say as many,  as much as $300 million.  Now we got to check other, other patent lawsuits.  This is a never ending story.  Although one of the things that companies do like Google  is they buy patents from other people.  Google bid for Nortel's patents,  probably for defensive purposes, right Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, yes.  That is primarily what they're, what they're after is  they want the, the patents to be,  to expand the patent portfolio.  Because Google doesn't, doesn't tend to use patents  offensively.  I don't know, I don't think they've done that ever,  but also their goal is generally just to make sure  that they can implement their stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That just shows you how big a deal this is  because they offered $900 million for the Nortel patents.  It's almost worth a billion dollars.  The justice department has concluded now that Google  could own these patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So they're just making a bet that this will be less than  what their future legal fees would be  if they didn't have these defensive patents.  Isn't that amazing?  It is truly, it's truly amazing.  It's sad.  All that brain power going to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We gotta do something.  Yeah, it's horribly wasteful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, gotta do something about this.  It's just not, this patent system's terrible.  Google has changed, changed my maps to my places.  I've used my maps before,  because I use that Google tracking program,  my tracks on Android, and then you can save your tracks.  I actually, it was kind of fun.  I played in a, we played all day,  the company Paintball game, or I guess it was LaserTech,  and I ran my tracks, and it's fun to watch me running  all around like this.  So now, does this mean Hotpot  and places are now part of Google Maps?  I'm not sure what this impact of this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds like they're just trying to simplify things.  I feel like maps and reader have this problem  where there's all these different ways to mark things.  This is my favorite, this is the place I've been,  this is the place I've rated,  this is the thing I wanna share,  this is the thing I wanna tag or comment.  And so this particular update to maps,  honestly, I haven't looked at it.  I don't do a whole lot of curation with maps.  Just looks like they're sort of simplifying things  of like any place that you've visited bookmarked,  rated, or saved to a map.  Any place that you've indicated there's some sort of,  apparently I was in Paris in April.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ha ha!  Oh, actually, this might be places  you've searched for too, right?  Not just places you've been to.  Although it's pretty interesting.  I mean, these are all places I've been to,  and I guess rated or something, or somehow indicated.  Maybe I checked in.  I use latitude, so I check in all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So yeah, you've got a history there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope this is a public.  I just want Google to make this stuff just easier.  Like one indicator.  I'm kind of hoping that plus one will just be  the single canonical way to indicate  this is something that means something to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does tell you, so I rated, rated, rated, rated,  rated this place, I reviewed this place, I reviewed this place.  So does tell you kind of how you came to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got nothing to add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going through it, and I've done,  it's things that you've mapped.  I've made a whole bunch of custom maps myself.  And we have like the Fourth of July down here gets crazy.  And so I've done custom maps to explain to people  how to get onto our peninsula,  and get off it and things like that.  So I'm looking at it now,  and I can see that all that stuff is organized.  And those were my maps before,  and they literally were just my maps.  Things that I've starred,  although apparently I haven't starred anything,  so there's nothing there.  And apparently I've reviewed TechCrunch Ranch.  By the way, here's the laser tag map

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that showed up on the list too.  That's me running around shooting at people.  Nice. That's weird.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like modern art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See you in motion.  It's really fun when you put the satellite on.  Oh, nasty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was that you using latitude, and it was just tracking it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is something called Google Tracks  is an Android app.  Oh, Tracks is great.  My Tracks, I love it.  And so that was kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how do I link to one of these maps?  Because I've gone to one of mine,  I can't find the URL for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you have it in my maps?  Okay.  And then it also, it shows stuff you've bookmarked.  Just kind of interesting.  I like this.  This is kind of fun.  This is nice to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The things I put on this must need to fall into the sea.  That's kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could share it.  I'll be using my Tracks more.  Share my random walk.  You had some reviews, Danny.  The Chromebooks are now available for sale.  You talked a little bit about this on a search engine blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was mainly,  I've yet to actually play with one myself, the new ones.  I had the CR 48 and looked at it.  But now, everybody has access to them supposedly  that you can go out and go to either Amazon or Beth Buy.  And if you want one of these Chromebooks,  you can show out your $400 or so, $400 to $500 for them.  So they're there, although they're not.  Because as it turns out, Amazon,  we were supposed to have both Acer editions  and Samsung editions out today.  And the Acer ones have all been held up.  And that's kind of important  because the Acer ones are the cheaper ones.  You can get into an Acer edition for $380.  And if you're not certain,  maybe that $50 difference versus the lower end price  of a Samsung one might make a difference.  So Amazon has one of the six different models  that are currently available  from either Samsung or Acer that's out there.  Best Buy has two of the six total models,  which are two of the Samsung ones.  And the Samsung ones on Best Buy,  you can get them either with 3G built in,  or you can get them as Wi-Fi built in.  And so, yes, it's been two and a half years  since Google said we were going to have a Chrome OS computer.  And now they finally arrived to sweep us off our feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anybody have one of these?  Gina, do you have one?  No, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they were supposed to send Google I.O.  to have these ones.  And I haven't gotten an email  or I haven't received it in the mail.  That's a long story about this product launch here, Danny.  I'm like, I glazed over, I was like,  oh, this is like Android.  There are so many different handsets  and it's hard to tell which one's better.  That's sad that the most inexpensive one though  isn't really available today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what surprised me was this is the big launch date  and then to go into Amazon  and there weren't any real comparisons.  I couldn't go through and easily see  why I would want to go for the Acer versus the Samsung.  Best Buy, when you look at the product pages for the 3G  and the regular Wi-Fi only one,  it didn't make it clear on either of those pages  right up top what the differences were between them,  which made me think that neither of these retailers,  and these are your launch retailers,  really kind of for whatever reason have gotten behind it  or maybe they weren't prepped enough to get behind it.  They've had plenty of notice that it was gonna be coming.  So it wasn't, I thought a really good launch day for it.  And of course there's nobody to line up  in front of the Google store to buy one  because they don't have a Google store.  This reminds me a lot of the Nexus One launch

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  where it just kind of goes out in the space.  And no wonder they don't sell stuff by retail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the other thing is, the real story here  may be what happens in the business and education spaces.  I could see this for school makes a lot of sense.  Yeah, and they have separate programs for that  where they say if you're a business  and you wanna deploy these things,  you can buy them from us.  And if you are a school and you want this sort of things.  And these kinds of devices may make a lot more sense there.  And the consumer products maybe will never sell that much  except for the person who loves their Chromebook  so much at work that they feel like  they need to have their own edition of it.  So it's still watch and see.  But at least we'll find out what consumers think  short enough, soon enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I fired up the CR-48 when this was announced  and updated to the version just to see and play with it.  It's like, oh, it's Chrome.  I mean, it just doesn't feel like a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's one of those things,  when you see somebody who's really attractive,  I see why this person is attractive.  I just don't feel attracted to this person.  I get why other people would think this person is hot,  but it's just not for me.  That's kinda how I feel about the Chromebook.  I would buy this for my nephew or for my in-laws.  I just, it's hard to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying it's the George Clooney of netbooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Clooney is probably a good example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like I get it.  I love it.  Not for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When the Chromebook, when the CR-48 first came out,  I mean, I got the demo one and it arrived  and I wrote my review and I was done writing the review  before my kids got home from school.  So they got home and I said, hey, check it out.  It's the Google computer.  Nobody has these, go nuts.  And I talked it their way.  And it was like, 30 minutes later, they were done.  They didn't care.  They were going back for the old MacBooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's like, I want a computer.  Give me, it doesn't play Minecraft.  It doesn't.  It was, the trackpad wasn't as nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a working, the ones that they sent out,  the CR-48s are really kind of rugged.  They're not, they weren't elegant computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not like the Chromebooks at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, and they're nowhere near like say a MacBook Air,  which is just the thing of beauty.  Right.  And so, but I think that's one of the hard things too,  is that if you're, even if it's supposed to be  this different kind mindset and different kind of computer,  if I'm using a Mac Air and it's an elegant computer  and everything loads up fairly quickly and it's really nice  and I'm not having all the hassles that go with it.  Like how do I get things off of my phone?  Can I even get the music from my phone  to one thing or the other?  Because those things haven't gone away.  You're going to be left underwhelmed.  And then that may be the case for the next year,  until cloud services maybe catch up to the degree  that maybe you are weaned off of  the more traditional computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's also why a business or a school  might be interested in these.  Because they do so little.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if you're running a business through the web,  then they work.  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.  But you need to make sure that you're not,  so many businesses start with sort of running  some ancient version of DOS or Windows  to run their point of sale systems.  That as we see that transition happen,  these may make a lot more sense, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the pricing's different there too, right?  Because you're not buying the computers you're paying,  I think like 25 bucks a month or something for them.  And you have other costs there too, right?  I mean, you're not going to have to upgrade these computers  from Chrome 7 to Chrome 8.  They just, they update themselves.  And that's a big issue for administrators  that have to deal with this sort of stuff.  For the consumer front, if you're thinking,  well, I got $400 to spend and I could probably get myself  a Windows computer at that price  that does all this other stuff.  And I can get this other thing and I don't know  if I can do all these other things I want to do with it.  You're probably discounting the fact that,  well, did you buy the antivirus software?  Would you need that and all the other stuff?  And that's probably not factoring  into your mindset for the cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what you're saying, Danny, is like Gina,  you're not a chromosexual.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just not that into you.  I'm just not into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am open to all computer orientations, but.  I, and I happily go between both the Mac and the Windows,  although I orient more towards Windows,  but Chrome has yet to come into my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the third species.  We just don't know what to do with it.  Yeah, yeah.  Third gender.  And we're going to take a break, come back with more.  Danny Sullivan is here, Kevin, Mark, Gina, Tripp, Hanny,  and we've got some rumors about the next Nexus,  speaking of the next, you're going to want this one.  You're going to want this one.  Before we do that, though,  I want to tell you about squarespace.com.  It's the secret behind exceptional websites.  It is really a great way for you to get a website up  and running literally in minutes.  Even a very fancy website with all sorts of connectivity  and widgets and so forth is a snap with Squarespace.  So I want you to go to squarespace.com slash twig6.  We're going to have a different URL every month now.  So squarespace.com slash TWIG number six  and sign up for the free trial, 15 days,  no credit card required.  In fact, I'll show you how easy it is.  You click that green button and all you need is a site name,  a password and an email address and that's it.  You create your website.  Now you've got complete access to the Squarespace tools  for the next 15 days.  That means those great 60 plus designer styles,  the fantastic social widgets,  the Squarespace client for the iPhone and the iPad free.  You can import directly from your existing site  using the classic APIs movable type WordPress,  type pad or blogger and export too so you're never stuck.  And when I say import, I mean, it works.  Even all the permalinks, all the images, all the comments,  they all get brought over.  That's nice.  They've got all the features.  Everybody who does websites is looking for photo galleries,  forms, forums and a server system  that is the most robust in the business.  It just never goes down.  And that's what you're getting when you get Squarespace.  You're getting hosting plus the best software out there.  Very affordable too.  Prices start at $12 a month, but I'll tell you what,  you sign up for more time, it costs even less.  So you really, it's a very good deal  considering getting hosting  and the best software out there and automatic updates.  I just went to my WordPress blog  and yes, I have another WordPress update I got to apply.  And then it's 313 and then they say,  oh, 1-3-2 is gonna be out in a couple of weeks.  And it's like, come on, how much time,  I spend more time updating WordPress  than I do posting blog posts.  Not with Squarespace, it's all done automatically.  Squarespace.com slash twig6.  You may ask why I continue to use WordPress.  Well, somebody's got it.  It's actually how I keep up  with what's going on with WordPress,  but I'm sorry, I'm trying to think.  So here's the news on what they,  some people are calling the Nexus 4G.  This is from Boy Genius Report.  These guys are good.  I don't know where they get this stuff.  Boy Genius Report has exclusively learned  Google's next Nexus device, probably called the Nexus 4G,  will feature a next generation dual core 1.2  or 1.5 gigahertz CPU, perhaps an OMAP 4460  or a Snapdragon, 28 nanometer Snapdragon.  But this is what's interesting, 720p display.  No more Android menu buttons at the bottom of the screen.  We know that because of Honeycomb and Ice Cream Sand,  which everything's gonna be software-based.  Forge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I miss those.  Huh?  I miss those on the tablets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do too, I'm with you.  I like the physical buttons.  I wanna miss it too.  Or at least the kind of, you know,  the one I have, the two, what is it, the LG G2X,  at least has electronic buttons at the bottom,  but they're buttons, not just on the screen.  But that's what happens with the new tablets too.  It's all screen-based.  There's nothing on the front.  It's just, I guess, is it cheaper  or just they think that's more modern?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can turn it any orientation, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  It's the orientation thing, isn't it?  Orientation doesn't matter.  It's chromosexual also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It goes every way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It goes every which way.  4G radio, gig of RAM.  This is all from Boy Genius Report.  It's all a rumor.  1080p HD video capture and playback.  That's kind of become the standard now.  They say a very good five megapixel rear-facing camera  delivering class-leading image quality  and superior low-light performance.  That's one way the iPhone is really beating Android right now.  The iPhone 4 has the best camera out there.  It'll, of course, have a one megapixel front-facing camera.  It will be running Ice Cream Sandwich,  ultra-thin Thanksgiving.  No word about the carriers.  Could be at AT&T.  I mean, it's been T-Mobile all this time,  but that T-Mobile AT&T acquisition is in process.  It's possible they're just gonna say go straight to AT&T.  And BGR says this will be  the flagship Ice Cream Sandwich device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this will be the first phone  that's actually more powerful than my first computer,  which I got in like 1998.  Wow.  Yeah, I gotta pull out that old receipt.  I kept the receipt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gotta check this back. It's more powerful than,  it's almost as powerful as my MacBook Air.  If it's dual 1.5 gigahertz CPUs, I mean, in a phone.  Yeah, that's crazy.  Gig of RAM in a phone.  It's just kind of stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it kind of doesn't matter.  I mean, it's like,  the phone is no better than its weakest link, right?  So it can have dual processors,  and yet if I can't get the 4G signal, who cares?  If I'm stuck with the 3G signal,  or if I'm stuck with the 3G signal,  but I'm not getting all my throughput  in the way that I'd wanna have.  So, you know, and it was like,  the 720p thing kind of confuses me  because that's something you hear talked about  more on televisions than on computer screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's gonna watch a movie like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and I mean, it's like,  if you take the retina display on the iPhone, that's-  That is 720p, right?  Well, it's not, I mean, the P is how much  the scan lines are happening, right?  Forget the P, but 720 lines.  So 720 lines, so the iPhone is 960 by 640,  so it's not that-  It's not quite, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So would it even be more than?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then when you start looking at,  because I've gone through this, I just did a review  when I was looking at the Droid Charge,  and the Thunderbolt, and the iPhone,  and you know, like the Droid Charge has a big screen,  it's 800 by 480 or whatever,  so you can actually see a bit more,  but you're always still having to blow pages up.  I mean, the screens, they're still only gonna be so large  to the point that even if you had that resolution  that you could have all the crisp type,  you may very well still need to blow it up anyway  just to read it unless you're, you know,  not as old as me, I suppose, or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that actually is a very legitimate point  because as in this preview that Google's loaded,  yeah, this is on an iPhone,  there's some great detail there, but how am I,  I can't read it.  I mean, it's there, but what am I gonna, I can't,  I have to pitch-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the 4G, if it's real 4G,  which to me means Verizon 4G, that would be nice  because I just got the Sprint Nexus S,  mainly so I could have that as a reference phone  and so that whenever they roll out Google Wallet,  I can play with it and see how that works.  But you're thinking this is your flagship phone  from Google, this should be the benchmark  that everybody else is meant to go at.  And it's Sprint 4G, which is better than the AT&T 4G,  but it's, you know, it can come in and out,  it doesn't seem to match the speed I have on my Droid Charge  through Verizon, which is 4G.  Oh, by the way, it'd be nice if it had a zoom.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nexus S sort of lacks that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, carrier, carrier's another issue.  We're all stuck with these crappy carriers.  I like the idea of it.  If it's 720p, I'm gonna presume that means 1280 by 720.  There's no screen on a phone like, I mean, that would be-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be nice, but I'd also love that if it's LTE,  does that mean, and I just don't know enough of this,  but if it's LTE, does that mean I can slot in  an LTE card from AT&T, then take my Verizon card  and slot that in as well?  Because that would be a real major change for us in the US.  If LTE means that we can all have SIM cards  and we can interact among the different systems,  that they're all on the common thing,  but I have a feeling it doesn't quite work like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll buy one.  I don't care what you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll probably buy one anyway, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting is you're starting  to see some standards, like for instance,  all the rumors now that the next iPad will have,  also have a retina display.  You're starting to see that that high resolution display  is gonna be across the board on these devices.  Fast processors across the board, lots of memory,  better cameras, these are gonna start  becoming the standards, aren't they?  It will become our computers.  They are really our computers.  Gina, I mean, I'm trying to think of the first  1280 by 720 display I had, that wasn't that long ago.  That was pretty recently.  Of course, it was a 15 or 17 inch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're really, we're moving ahead fast.  Other stories in the news, then we'll get to our picks  and our tools, Samsung Galaxy Tabs on first class  on American Airlines starting soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I wanna know how that works.  Do you sign in, do they just hand them out,  and do you sign in your Google account, or do you just?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Preloaded with special stuff, including movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it's instead of the sleep back to TV,  it's a benefit, right, as long as you have someone  to rest it on.  We've seen this actually for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I remember seven or eight, nine years ago,  there was a company making, they were this thick,  making tablets that they wanted companies to hand out  as you got on board.  It's just easier for them to do that.  They don't have to have a system that goes throughout  the plane for one thing, they could just have individuals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, it'd be like an entertainment console.  It's not like you get one and sign in your Google account  and start checking your Gmail, you get to watch movies.  Well, maybe you can too, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That remains to be seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they've got wife on the plane, that might work.  I was actually using that tablet when I was driving up  to Sebastopol and the Twet Cottage as my in-car nav system  with the external Verizon, Wi-Fi like thing.  And it was amazingly good.  The only problem was it wasn't actually attached  to the car and kept falling off.  But having the Google navigation stuff  on something that big is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree, I use on the iPad, there's a third party GPS  program called Motion X GPS.  It's easily the best GPS I've ever used.  Having that much real estate makes a huge difference.  Wow. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But particularly with the Google nav stuff  and the search board, it's like,  oh, I need to find this thing.  Oh, there it is.  Right, it's right there.  This is the ultimate.  This is the part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll have some of the passages see.  It's an information tool.  Let's see here, what else?  Oh, this is gonna be very interesting.  There's a new Senate bill just proposed  that would increase the fines for lip syncing on YouTube.  Actually, not fine, the penalty for lip syncing  on YouTube to 10 years in jail.  They're trying to make it criminal again?  They're trying to make it criminal again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the thing Quint was talking about on Sunday.  He was saying that when they were seizing domains,  they were alleging criminal copyright infringement,  which is actually a civil offense.  So they were seizing domains on the basis  of a law that hasn't passed yet, which is pretty scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they wanna have a law now.  For lip syncing, this is SB,  just in case you wanna kind of follow this  through the Senate, I can't imagine it'll pass.  It's SB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it'll be called the Millie Vanille law.  Well, it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could say it's in, you could say  slip syncing's in bad taste, but 10 years in jail,  now that's really in bad taste.  SB 978, it's proposed, let me see if I could find this here,  bill to amend the criminal penalty provision  for criminal infringement of a copyright  and for other purposes.  Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota,  proposed it, now this is brand new,  so I just wanna give you some warning.  It would make it illegal to upload lip synced videos  among many, many other things.  It's kind of shocking.  Anybody reading Sarah Palin's email?  Did you see this, the Sunlight Foundation?  That was a weird segue.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it criminal to read Sarah Palin's email now?  No, it's legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tina Fey was lip syncing Sarah Palin there  for a while on SNL.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, you could search for Tina Fey.  So they did a freedom of,  you remember, she was governor of Alaska briefly,  and they did a freedom of information act.  The state of Alaska said,  we can't give them to you electronically,  so for $700, you can print out all 20,000 emails.  So the Sunlight Foundation has scanned them,  indexed them, and put them online.  It's called sarahsinbox.com.  They have some sample searches that I quite enjoyed,  including Flippin' Believe It,  Bridge to Nowhere, Tina Fey,  Horrible People Are Bringing You Down,  Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline, Barack Obama,  Crud, First Dude, Who Leaked It,  What a Dumbass He Is, and Who's Gonna Trim My Hair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a very Gmail-like interface, actually.  It's a Gmail-like interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love this.  You can just read through email.  It is, they even have the Gmail older, oldest.  3,770 messages.  I don't know if you wanna spend a lot of time  going through it.  Let's see the Tina Fey one.  Here it is.  Governor Sarah Palin, she's cc'ing her assistant.  Oh, actually, this is from her assistant, Pat Galvin.  My suggestion is you offer to go to Saturday Night Live  and play Tina Fey, and you interview her as she plays you.  And then you can go back and read the thread.  I mean, it's just silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Holy.  Yeah, it's silly.  It's an interesting look through,  for about two minutes.  It's kind of fun to run some of those example searches.  But kudos to the Sunlight Foundation  for creating the interface that we all know how to deal with  versus scanned documents.  They scanned and they used OCR,  so you'll get some weird typos.  I'll say sent from my Blackberry  with a couple of different, you know,  an extra E at the end.  But still kind of fun to flip through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I told my wife about it.  She said, how is that legal?  I said, well, she was the governor.  It's, she was using her state government email.  So it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, state email is a matter of public record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it made me think when you're looking at that too,  it's like, it was so crazy  that they were printing out these emails.  I mean, what a joke, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, 700 bucks a set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you almost wondered like, well, maybe, you know,  if you're dealing with public emails like that,  then this is all being done through a Gmail-like interface  that anybody can search through anyway.  The problem is, of course,  you've got the sensitive information  that can't be out there. Right.  You had to redact it, exactly.  But it could be that on a daily basis,  you go through the emails and you tag the things  that are for public record and you just throw it out there.  And then, you know,  we don't have to go through this sort of stuff.  Maybe we can read through whatever they want.  Speaking of- If it's all public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of snooping,  it's always fun when a company goes public.  You can read the S1,  the document that's offered to investors.  We've had fun with Groupons.  Now it's time for Pandora.  Pandora had its IPO this morning.  Big valuation.  Stock closed at 17 bucks, up 8.9%.  The original IPO price was 20 bucks.  So, oh, I'm sorry.  20 bucks.  Yeah. 14.7 million shares.  Problem is that Pandora has not been making any money.  And there's a big kind of balloon payment  coming up on Pandora.  The price of the music that they offer  is gonna go up quite a bit soon.  A number of analysts said Pandora's stock price  was inflated.  Morningstar said it was worth $6 a share.  So, you know,  maybe the bubble never got inflated.  I like Pandora.  I hope that they can pay for themselves someday.  They've got this,  the problem is this licensing deal that they've got  is gonna really kill them soon.  And you know this, they've been fighting,  and Tim Westergren, who's great, I love him,  the guy who founded the company,  has really been fighting the good fight  to keep licensing costs down on internet radio.  And has sort of won,  has sort of managed to keep them down,  but the costs are gonna go up dramatically very soon.  Moving along, we're gonna wrap this up here  before we get to our tips.  New York City?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go ahead.  So I was just gonna mention turntable.fm.  I don't know if you guys have been playing with that,  but that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I just, tell me about it,  because I just logged in,  and you have to have a Facebook friend who's using it.  I guess I got in because of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what it is, is you go to a room,  I made a twig room, go in the twig room.  And there are people playing music.  There are DJs on the stage and people on the ground.  And it takes a little while to load it,  it's not playing whatever I'm playing.  And you add music to your list up there on the right,  and then you can step up on stage  and play music for each other.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Little art of noise, good choice.  And you take it in turns,  basically the people who are on stage,  it rotates around and you can say,  I like this, I hate this.  And if you have people hate it, it gets skipped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like this, there's a lame and an awesome button.  I'm gonna press awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see, that got me a point, you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who else is in here?  Gina's in here.  Yeah, I just have to...  I'm in here, there's Sermy,  and Eileen, our producer.  This is cool.  So I can add a song, but do I have to have the song?  Or it could just be anything in their library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there's stuff in their library,  or you can upload things that aren't in the library.  So I can play like stuff I recorded myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm gonna search for a song,  and the propeller heads, this seems to fit in.  I'm gonna add history repeating.  So then the next song will be whoever is next in the queue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  That's cool.  So it's, and there, you know, they're already...  This is so illegal.  No, no, it's legal,  because they're using the same licensing as Pandora does.  So what happens is,  they won't let you just play songs to yourself in the room.  So the rule with this cover licensing is complicated,  but it basically means you can't know what's coming up.  I like this.  And you can't play the same artist  more than N times an hour or whatever it is.  There's a whole bunch of stupid rules like that.  And Pandora came up,  which was designed to stop you setting up request lines.  Pandora set it up so they have their music DNA thing,  which is, you give them an artist,  and they have to find artists that are like them,  because they can't keep playing that artist.  So this is another twist on that same game  around the same set of rules,  which is you rotate around five of you.  And the fun part of it is when you do exactly what you're saying,  oh, that reminds me of X,  here's one that I think would go along with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could see spending a lot of time in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the other thing that we've seen with this  is that lots of people are doing it for,  if they're a startup and they've got people  in different places,  they just have a room, they play music to each other.  And then they just log in and use the chat for that  the same way you might use an IRC or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And when you say something, it pops over your head.  Yeah.  So we've got five DJs,  what happens after your song is done?  Do you move off or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, you can stay there until you decide to leave.  So a total of five people.  At last, it becomes the room admin, yeah.  This is neat.  It's very nice.  I mean, it's basically,  maybe Pandora can have enough money to go and buy these guys  and make it scale a bit better  because they were running out of service space, I think.  They were canceling sign-ups for a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is turntable.fm.  You can ask for an invite or if,  I like it because it uses Facebook Connect.  If your Facebook friends,  any one of your Facebook friends is already a member  and I presume because Kevin, you were,  I was able to do this.  That's right, yeah.  You jump in and so it spreads virally  through your Facebook friends, which is kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the other thing is when you log in  and you look at the list of rooms,  it puts ones that have got your friends in at the top.  Then it puts ones for the most people in.  Yeah, and the agent says that lots of companies  have made their own rooms like simple Geo Media Temple.  So it's very neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll have to have a Twit company room.  Love this song, by the way.  I'm sorry, I'm just listening to the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If actually every room turns into dubstep  unless you police them carefully.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really, is that true?  All songs lead to dubstep, is that?  That's interesting.  My son would be thrilled to hear that.  He's a dubstep composer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As Twit leads to ego searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My sons have basically been living in this since I showed.  And they're dubstep fans too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sign into it and play stuff back and forth.  The kids today love the dubstep.  I don't know if you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dubstep is actually pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you heard my son's music?  I went to the GitHub conference

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and they played it like the whole entire time  and I started listening to dubstep Pandora station.  It's great to code to.  I find myself like stomping around  and very authoritatively committing changes.  It's good.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The most popular room on here is coding soundtrack  which has always got over 100 people in it  and is mostly dubstep.  And it's for coding.  The idea is it's music to code to.  Which is, basically you can't have lyrics that disrupt you  because you start timing the lyrics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, all of us listening to music  is killing your bandwidth.  Of course a bit more.  Yes.  Kevin, you gotta turn it off now.  He's starting to...  I'm trying to find my...  Yes, I should probably...  I'm trying to find my son's music here  because I'd like to play some dubstep for you.  We'll save that for later.  Wow, that's cool, Kevin.  Thank you for sharing that with us.  That's really neat.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New York City, Twitter capital of the world.  Facebook hires, I'm just gonna go through a few of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You talking trash about my hometown?  You didn't say Brooklyn.  Of course, New York City is the Twitter capital of the world  because New York City is the capital of the world.  Okay, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  Hey.  They continue, carry on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pretty obvious, isn't it?  Facebook hires former White House,  Clinton White House press secretary, Joe Lockhart.  Do you care about the Webbies?  Now, I can bring this up briefly,  but I don't care about the Webbies  because it's so mainstream focused.  It kind of bugs me.  It's like, well, yeah, it's all about the celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, geeks don't care about the Webbies.  Is the Webbies the one where you have to pay  to submit your thing for an award  or is that another award thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think first you have to be, I think,  nominated by the Academy of Web Sciences.  They seriously just like some,  there's some like weird Academy thing that's like-  And then you have to pay.  And then you have to, I think, pay.  That's just ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  I went to the Webbies once a few years ago.  The reason they're well known  is because of the five word thank yous.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, those are fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The winner speeches are short.  And the best one this year, I thought,  oh, I don't care.  TechCrunch, best $175 AOL ever spent.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I liked Dan Savages.  He said-  What was his?  Tracy Morgan's Suck My-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it was Can Suck My  because he had to do five, right?  All right.  I thought that was good.  Nice.  Dan did win for It Gets Better.  And I think deservedly so on that.  We've talked about that before.  Behold, thanks to TechCrunch,  Facebook's secret photo sharing app.  TechCrunch, did you see this?  The Facebook said, oh yeah,  we have ways to turn features on and off.  In fact, everything in the next six months  is already in our code.  And we just say who could see it,  but we have a kind of blanket,  TechCrunch can't see anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  Yes.  That was the thing they tested by turning on a special  send pictures by fax feature just for TechCrunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And TechCrunch, did they do a story on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, they just threw it and they said,  why is there this feature for sending things by fax?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just faxed to the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The gay in Iraq blog turns out to be an American guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At least we're talking about lesbian bloggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But then that host of the lesbian blogging site  that she was posting on turned out to be another  American guy.  That was this like, this section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good Lord.  Get your minds out of the gutter, American guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like, here's a way I can say that I like women  without being a scary guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just creepy.  All right, we're going to move on.  I think it's time to do our tip tool and actually  Danny will do our number of the week.  Oh no.  I'm sorry.  No, you won't.  Kevin will do it.  Danny, if you want, I will give you my tool.  That sounded wrong.  So very wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would lightly accept it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what I mean.  One homosexual to another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm experimenting.  It's fine.  Yeah.  He's open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Curious.  So if you have anything that you think would be  an interesting tool for the Google folks, the twig folks,  you can come up with that in just a moment.  Your tool can pop up in a moment.  But first, Gina's tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We talked about this a little bit earlier.  So Google announced search by image and search by voice.  And those are going to be rolling out in the next couple  of weeks, but if you want to try them out now,  you can go to google.com slash experimental.  And there's a voice search experiment, which you can join.  And then there's a search or instant on images,  which is not search by image.  That's different.  Instant on images means that you get the Google instant  dropdown with suggestions as you type.  So you can join in either or you can't go in both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that bugs me because I was plus one, right?  So now I've left plus one.  So I'm going to do voice search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So if you opt in of the voice search experiment,  you go to the Google search, google.com search page,  and you'll have a little microphone on the search box.  If you want to give it a try before it's official.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. So now I click it.  Search for, oh no, I don't say search for, stop.  Let's take two.  Gina Trapani.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeanette Rapani.  Don't make me laugh.  Kevin Marks.  Yay.  That worked.  The guy from search engine land.  Yeah.  Danny Sullivan.  Okay. That was close.  The question is, does it work in my accent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cause that was always the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Well, let me try it.  Let me try it.  I would like to know more about the Chromebook, please.  Yeah. Crown ladies golf.  I think that's close.  Crown ladies golf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can have some more golf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lisa, have some more.  So that's good.  That's a good tip.  Thank you, Gina.  I'm going to leave that on.  That's fun.  Cool.  That's very fun.  And now for our number of the week,  Kevin Marks filling in for Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the number I've got is a rather special one,  is 208 quadrillion quintile Gentilian.  What the hell?  Which is-  I've got a link for you to stick up.  There's a-  I've got it right here.  So there was a bunch of discussion we had at the weekend  about gamification and can games and play work in business?  And my colleague, JP Rangaswamy,  gave a talk about that yesterday.  And then there was this wonderful slide set  that Cathy Sierra recommended  that talks this through in great detail.  And one of the points it makes is  Google indexes 20 billion web pages,  but the number of possible games of Go  is so much larger, it's ridiculous.  And that's the difference between an actual game  that creates a set of rules that you can explore  for as long as you like,  because you've created something open-ended,  or a game like Lego,  where you've got lots of little pieces  you can plug together.  And some of these ideas of gamification,  which boil down to taking the crudest,  simplest high score table  and attach that to your business.  So I think he wants slide 27,  which is where you can see the number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I probably could just enter the slide number somewhere  if it were well designed.  Oh dear, I've clicked too many times.  I don't know where I'm going.  Doesn't even have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, this presentation is really worth a read.  If you've been thinking about games,  games and gamification at all,  this is like, here's the Go stuff.  This is so cool.  So that's the number of pages that Google searches.  The number of possible games in Go,  which is why computers can't play Go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  208 quadrillion,  quintuagenetillion,  or 2.08 times 10 to the 130th possible games.  That's more than there are atoms in the universe.  Wow.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's my number of the week,  which is the favorite number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we'll put a link to this slideshare too.  Or you could search slideshare four.  Don't play games with the promises and putfalls  of gameful design.  We have a link in the show notes as well.  That's really cool.  Good number and big.  That's the biggest number we've ever had.  Do you want to do a tool of the week for us Danny?  Yeah.  Turnoff turntable.fm.  He's still playing the game, listening to the music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you still there?  Yes.  Oh yeah.  No, I've got two tools, if that's all right.  Yeah.  All right.  No, it's okay.  One's mine, but I think you'll like it.  But I'll do, first is Bitly Pro.  Well, it's now Bitly.  They just announced today that they've made available  a lot of the Bitly Pro features that you either had to pay  for, you couldn't get into.  And the primary thing is that if you're trying  to shorten a URL, you can have your own custom URL.  So I can search engine land,  our custom URL is selnd.com.  And you've probably seen the New York Times is NYT.  Right.  And something like that.  And so anybody can have those sorts of things.  And it's just a nice way,  I think both of keeping your own branding  and also if for some reason you ever decided to migrate  the short URLs that you yourself were putting out,  you can always move that to another server.  You're kind of in control of your own domain.  So now I just go to my settings,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I say add a custom short domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You gotta get one, but once you've got one.  Oh, I have to have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They recommend that you go try a couple of those  short URL search engines to suggest one  based on your current one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it were Google would have already gotten one for you  before you even had it.  It should be, yes.  Oh, you want leo.im, of course you should have.  Yeah, exactly, you'd have been there.  The other thing was something we put out about two weeks ago  it's called the periodic table of SEO.  And the reason I suggested to the audience  is just that there's a lot of misunderstanding  about what SEO is or the ways that Google wants you  to do stuff or Bing wants you to do stuff.  And so we put together this thing to try to explain,  these are the most important things  that you really need to think about  and not make it overwhelming for people  and try to have people focusing things like on CQ  which stands for quality.  This is great.  Or CR which is doing your key read research.  And so I'd really suggest that if you know someone  who's trying to get up to speed  or if you're a developer who's trying to understand this  and you feel like it could be overwhelming  or that there is just too much garbage out there  you think SEO, don't you have to spam a bunch of blogs?  No, don't.  That's what it's designed to help you do.  And there's a whole online guide to tell you more  about each of those different factors that are out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Danny, I could promise you that,  cause we get a lot of questions in the radio show  from people who have been approached by SEO,  snake oil salesman.  I'm always saying, no, no, no, no, no.  I will now tell them, go here, read this, you're done.  Don't pay any money to those guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope that it's helpful.  And yes, in general, if everybody,  you ever get a cold call email in your inbox  you can safely delete that.  There's not gonna be any surprises for you there.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Great stuff.  Thank you, Danny.  Danny Sullivan is at searchengineland.com.  That's where you'll find the periodic table of SEO  among other things, searchengineland.com.  Really great to have you.  Thank you so much for having me.  Thanks for being here.  Also joining us, Kevin Marks from chatter.com  and salesforce.com.  Always pleasure having you on.

That's about as close as I'm gonna get today.  And of course, Gina Trapani.  We always love Gina.  She's the best.  It was so fun to have some time with Gina.  She's at smarterware.org.  Get some time with her there.  At Gina Trapani, or Trapani on,  I guess you spelled the same on Twitter.  Either way.  Yep.  And of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great to be here.  Great show.  I missed Jeff, but awesome show.  Thanks for coming on, Kevin.  Danny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't mention at the beginning, I apologize.  Jeff's just out of town, right?  Yeah.  Where did he go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I forget now where he's at,  but he's somewhere he couldn't call in,  which is somewhere must be very remote.  Because normally, as we all know,  Jeff is able to Skype in basically from everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's called us from all around the world.  So it must be somewhere like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It must be the middle of the night somewhere,  where Jeff is.  Maybe that's it, yeah.  Jeff will be back next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We do miss him.  But thank you all for being here.  We do this show every Wednesday,  1.30 Pacific, 4.30 Eastern.  Actually, we try to do it at one,  because we move it up.  This is the one show we try to get on time.  1.00 PM Pacific, 4.00 PM Eastern.  That's 2000UTC at live.twit.tv.  But you know what?  You don't have to be here.  You can always download the show after the fact.  twit.tv slash twig,  or just anywhere finer podcasts are offered up.  And episode 100 next week.  We'll do something special to celebrate.  Maybe we'll buy a twit brick.  Bricks.twit.tv.  I've got some bricks behind me on the shelf here.  These are great bricks.  And we are selling them to raise money for the new studio,  which I believe we will be doing this show from  in about a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's exciting.  That's gonna be really exciting.  Did I take you by to see it, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We drove by, but then I had to run and get my flight.  So I actually haven't gotten a tour yet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a reason to come back.  You'll see it when it's done.  You've got to see the old cottage,  which is the bit that's going away.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gina and Kevin have both seen that.  Thank goodness.  And so now we can tear it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. You now have my blessings.  To move forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I may hang up when you go back to that.  Cause I'm pretty lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Pretty awesome.  Thank you, Kevin.  What a great tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure somewhere they,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently O'Malley just emailed us saying,  I want to tell Leo about turntable.fm.  Too late.  He's got his own room.  Yeah.  Does he?  Yeah, he does.  This is the coolest thing I've ever seen.  I am so excited about this.  What a great idea.  We've got to have a twit room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the same sort of thing that Pandora plays on,  except that instead of using all these people  to do music DNA,  it's a bunch of people you know or their friends.  Right.  So the guy who is like the complete music nurse  is on the stage, the rest of you just hang out and chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?  I think we killed him.  I bet you did.  Yeah. Could not connect.  Please try again.  If you still cannot connect,  you may have your firewall blocking your connection.  No.  I think it was broken.  No, I broke it.
