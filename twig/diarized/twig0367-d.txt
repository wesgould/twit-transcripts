Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We you know  I'm not gonna deny that I would have liked to have stayed in the brick house because I really loved it  But it was over big was about two-thirds bigger than we needed and it was over expensive  And it was over because the company that owned it sold it into another company, which is turning into a brewery  So there was no choice and we found a nice little space. I think when you get here, you'll see that it's different  But gets the job done. That's all I care about. I just gotta make the shows happen here  Jeff is the author of a number of wonderful books including what would Google do?  That's how he got on the show in the first place  But since then he's done public parts and Gutenberg the geek and geeks bearing gifts and he blogs at buzzmachine.com  and medium and a good great  Plungster alive man. I like throwing in the plugs  Well, you do this you do this, you know  You you sacrifice significant amount of time from your very busy schedule to be here every week. I thank you  Also here we're thrilled to have her stay. He's the real the new star of the show Stacey Higginbotham  She is from Stacey on iot.com at gigastacey and an expert in  Iot, but also a longtime observer of the tech industry in general. So she is  Expert on all of this stuff. You're our expert Gina Gina. Trapani was our expert. You're our expert  We're just blatherers Jeff and I are blatherers  You you you come with the facts in hand. I try I try to keep you guys honest like that  Do I like that so this was the week that Gawker died and of course  For I thought a fairly self-serving eulogy from the founder of Gawker Nick Denton in the New York Times  Following and an even more self-serving opinion piece from Peter Thiel with the New York Times at least they got it covered, right?  Actually Gawker's  Denton's piece was on Gawker. I'm sorry was a Gawker. Yeah, Peter Thiel's was on New York Times

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a spires road. I thought a much better piece in the Washington Post  He was the former founding editor of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then that I wrote one too and when that that's what brought me to the subject is reading your medium at peace  Which I thought was really great and the bottom line at the very end of the piece. I think  You said it very well and it applies both to Peter Thiel and to Gawker, which is power corrupts  And that's the real lesson here. Yeah both both Peter Thiel and  Gawker  Suffered from success in some ways I of having too much power, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really got me thinking a lot about so I this this happened last week  I got to speak to all of our I got to brainwash all of our new  students at CUNY at the J school a wonderful group and I began the week asking them to define journalism and  There were you know 90 different definitions of journalism and some really interesting and one really reminded me of Nick's own view  Which is you know freedom for its own sake that we destroy we pull down we we upend  Institutions if that's the only reason that journalism exists and then for that matter that's the only reason the blogs exist and social media exist  Why do we bother if we're not also building up if we're not also improving things then and just destroying  That's ridiculous. And I think the same is true of cable news right now  It's it's let's let's do everything we can to tear it on everything, but we can and then we think oh good  Our job is done. Have we actually improved society in any way?  I'm one of the student the new incoming students have what I thought was a brilliant definition of journalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did like that and I was very impressed that here she is a  Student and I thought she encapsulated the role of journalism quite well. I don't have it in front of me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have that I can get it? Yeah, I'll pull it up. I actually wanted to quote

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a  Little more humorous quote from Finley Peter Dunn that the duty of a newspaper is to comfort the afflict  Afflicted and afflict the comfortable which I've always liked and I think Nick Denton used that as his that yes  But I think it leaves out the important the essential piece that you  You know you articulated something I felt but I couldn't articulate and I was really glad to read your piece  Which is that if it's fine to tear down, but you also need to  Build up you need to you need you need to make the world a better place all of us need to make the world a better  place  Ultimately and failing that you you know all you are is a destroyer  And so so let me read her definition  Yeah, I have your I have your art. He Ryan is her name Kate Ryan Kate Ryan. Let me see  It's in it's in your medium piece right right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a means to inform the public and in doing so cultivate an educated empathetic and engaged society

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a means to inform the public but doesn't stop there and in doing so cultivate an educated  empathetic and engaged society  It's actually not surprising a student would write that because I think that could be the motto  The second part of most schools and education to cultivate an educated sympathetic and engaged society  Yeah, is journalism ultimately educational?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's I believe it should be I believe if we don't you know if you look at brexit  I'll try to stay away from this election, but if you look at brexit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From now on let's use brexit as code for Trump. Okay. Yeah, perfect perfect

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what we mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dog whistle there  By the way, I'm surprised. I actually looked online yesterday. I'm surprised. There are not Trump branded dog whistles  I  Please do by the time the show's over delivered by drone opportunity  Yeah, so so so  The other thing that occurred to me  There's one more point and they're eager to hear what Stacy said that thinks about all this too  Is that when Elizabeth Spires talked about about this she's she saw the story of God in the story of Gawker  She saw the story of blogs and she started blogging before I did in 99  I'm sure I blogging in 2001 and and Lord knows I've said things  I've not been proud of there have been moments when I had plenty of snark and fits and feuds and and so on  But then it stopped being fun anymore. We got it out of our system  I thought and and you know, I wonder whether the death of Gawker is  kind of the death of blogs that we went to a supernova that it became the best and the worst of everything we could have  had and  You know this within a week of each other Ariana Huffington who started a blog company leaves  and goes out of media and Nick Denton leaves and goes out of media and  the mass media business model that drove Gawker to do what it did to get more page views page views page views  Let's put the most outrageous crap  we can up to get the most page views we can get and we saw that ended up ruining lives and  that's where this went and  And so there was a to me a moment of reflection not just about Gawker  but about  Blogs social media the net and journalism itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  heavy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so heavy. I'm like dang. Okay, I  I  Think the people who embraced blogs early on were  Maybe not in the hunter s Thompson vein, but I think journalism goes through that and we have they were console  Donzo journalists. Thank you  There was a bit of that in blogging and it felt free and fun because the internet was no rules  But I don't think this is the death of blogging. I think blogging has irrevocably changed journalism you  Gone is this ideal of objectivity and we can argue if journalism is really objective or not  But that's like a journalism class kind of thing  And now we're we're seeing hopefully  Big publications pull some of the best aspects of blogs  I think in asking for crowdsourced and community kind of participation on project if if you look at how ProPublica is changing  And then I would also argue that we are still in a world where journalism and  The best journalism is empathetic and builds the community and I would point to the New York Times  Just that quick thing and well their well column about  EpiPens and the cost that's one of the biggest stories of this week. Isn't that huge? Yes. Yeah, and  So that is that is a wonderful example of a paper still doing that type of work and then everyone latching onto it  It's a tightrope though between

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  objectivity and advocacy I  mean  To some degree that was an advocacy piece, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It had took an opinion it had a voice all journalism starts at a level of advocacy  You're gonna you're gonna stand up for justice freedom the little guy  What's what's fair? So you're saying your goal should be to get to the truth

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And improve life and improve life

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say is it  Go ahead as a tech reporter who's doing who's done this like reported on technology for years  I've had two goals overarching goals. One is for the consumer  so  As someone who buys and plays with or whatever  And relies on technology in life. I do I advocate like if you read my stories about broadband you will see I have a clear  position on all of this  in  but I also do the research and I  Made a point of understanding the technical underpinnings of anything I advocate for and I feel like a lot of journalists  Don't necessarily take that second step and I think that's the most important part  because otherwise you just have opinions unfounded by

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything useful and there is there's trade press versus regular journalism  You and I come from trade press and the risk there is a risk that the new york times doesn't face  But is to be co-opted, you know, but I guess they do face it in beltway journalism to be co-opted by the people you're covering  So it's really good. I think for a tech and i'm completely with you. In fact, I learned that lesson from jerry pornell and his chaos  corner chaos  manner column in bite magazine  Which was so different from all the other tech writing that was going on in the 80s  Because he took the point of view of the user  He was a user and he reported back as the user and the user really almost in  opposition to the tech companies to you know fighting for the user over the tech companies  And so in trade press, I think that you're absolutely right. That's a vital  Very important distinction. I don't know how that applies  No, I know. I think it absolutely applies. I think it absolutely does. Let me let me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll try not to get too controversial right now. But but as has been obvious i'm transparent about this  I've been transparent about this since 2008. I support hillary clinton  And I decided to go and kind of uh embed and live this i haven't written this up yet  But last weekend I went down and I volunteered in philadelphia in west philadelphia  And I went out and registered voters and I drove people around and they even did a little bit of canvassing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More people should do that. That is such a vital perspective on uh on what's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I did as a partisan I am a partisan I am for hillary clinton, uh, make no doubt about that  Uh, jorge ramos at univision said that you know, it's like world war two. What did you do in the war daddy?  What did you do? Uh, you know during the trump time daddy  Uh, people are gonna make their own decisions and whatever those decisions are that's what democracy is about is to be able to express them  but  to the point now  This is where I know I get people in trouble, but I got bright-barded yesterday  So it can't be any worse than that. You got bright-barded. Oh, i'll leashing the dogs of trump. Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I gotta read that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe my daddy started again. Don't start it again

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you what it was. Uh, uh  There was a discussion on brian stelter's show on cnn on sunday about why helman clinton's not doing press conferences because that's the meme du jour  Right, uh, and I said well consider the s show that would be with the you know  All the push about nothing but email and foundations and nothing about issues, you know, can you blame her for not doing this?  Oh, I was accused of  Of just excusing her doing the journalists went after me  Because I wasn't standing up for the the property of press conferences uber ala so press conferences are s dot dot shows  They're they don't accomplish much interviews accomplish much more. And then of course the trumpets went after me because I was defending clinton

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that aside but that is in my microcosm is what's kind of happened to uh, the to journalism, uh,  Uh, I mean it's gone so far beyond advocacy journalism to being uh, kind of like polarizing point of view journalism  And punditry. Yeah, but it's worse than that leo and then then there's the other side of it your friend your colleague j  rosen's always bemoaning the  The the fate the faux balanced journalism where you no matter how ridiculous  The point of view is you get both sides equally equal time  Um, but that you know, I don't know. I i'm glad I don't have to fight in these wars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure everything will be written by an algorithm. Yeah, thus this will all be solved soon  True, but I think well, that's an interesting point though because the computer is objective  So it's true and we have to program the algorithms. What's what's the priority? So we have to give the algorithm a point of view

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dang it. Yeah, it does. We have to be transparent about it. Um,  Uh, where was I headed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't mean to derail you  Your bright body age that doesn't know and the trumpists and everybody getting on your case for defending hillary and this is the perspective

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got right two things one  I don't hear i'm an enthusiastic voter for hillary clinton. I never hear that in media never anywhere  It's oh that she's the less of two evils that she's a horrible candidate that people are enthusiastic  It's only because of trump they're voting for you know  And I went out and I was with people who were enthusiastic and I didn't see that represented  That's the one thing right?  There's a lot of people who get represented right if you're african-american in this country, you don't see yourself in media, right?  If you're if you're an unemployed white person is a trump voter  You didn't see yourself in media for years and years and years and thus the frustration so  Point one is media does a very bad job  I think of reflecting the communities that exist and reflecting their concerns whether you're a trump voter or whether you're african-american or whether you're a hillary  voter whatever  But the second point goes to the conquer point  Is that if you listen to cable news all it is is  Constant constant constant nattering let's find today's little scandal today's little meme at no point do they say why are we doing this?  When in gawker's life do they say we want to report this because because we want to tear down the powerful and show how free  We are what does that actually accomplish?  Once you afflict the comfortable what then why do we exist? What are we doing?  What are we doing what we're doing?  And that's the problem that I that I really have that makes me very depressed about my own field

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and and it's challenging though. I know it's not obvious what the right answer is. It's not like, you know, I think if you watch  You know all the old movies  It seemed like oh that's just a clear path that you just do the right thing and  Fight, you know, it's obvious and it's not obvious. It's not easy. I think it's very challenging to figure out what to  What to do especially in this age where we're unmoored  Although the unmooring is probably good

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and so the question that more relevant to the show  finally is  How does that relate to?  Blogs and social media and i think stacy's right blogs have had an irrevocable impact  On mainstream media on the voice that it has on the perspective it has  The fact that people feel like listen when I listen to morning joe and I want to scream at the tv  I have no means to do so a lot of other media. I have a means now to talk back  I can talk directly to columnists of the new york times on twitter and piss them off if I want to  Not that that's you know a goal but you know, or I can praise them or I can I know that I have a mechanism to get  To them that's new in this world  But why do we exist in social media? It's it's  You know, why does twitter it's it's I was thinking a lot this week about what you said last week leo about about twitter  And you know, why does twitter exist?  One has to ask at some point

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile nougat came out  I'm like, oh man. Okay. Thank you. Well, I should warn you stacy that both jeff and I have this kind of  tendency towards uh  the the heavy  You know, what do you I don't know pontification leo puts leo puts the helium back in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Normally I go nuts.

I'm happier. I'm much happier  I don't look at but i'm happier. You're happier with nougat or just with the fact that  I'm not neurotic about wondering if i'm the tenth on my block to get nougat. I want nougat

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want nougat. Um, have you been playing with it stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't um, I am not signed up for the beta program  Which is weird because I thought I had been but you know, that's cool  You'll get it. It will come when it comes. I'm i'm  It's not a significant place of peace I like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not significant. I did notice I think and it's really hard to measure but I think I noticed better battery life on the 6p  Which already had doze right but now they're doing this surprised me apparently doze didn't apply when the phone was sleeping  So now when the screen is off doze applies that kind of shocked me I read that in the notes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be the way that  It was architected like I know that it's weird with the arm designs like  Well, okay. Never mind. I'm just not going to try to explain that because my brain's not working

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it could be something totally different in any event. Uh, I just I weren't drinking  Yeah, what are you drinking and why didn't you bring some for me?  Topo chico, what's a topo chico?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? You don't know. Okay, you don't know topo. I know topo chico the new york times did it  Yes, it's a trend story

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was but it's like three years too late. It's just is it I want it water from a  Like a spring in mexico  And it's like the hipster thing to drink in austin, but it makes us our tenders love it because it's just seltzer  It's not alcoholic  Well, no, yeah  I thought it was but it mixes really well with alcohol. Why does it mix so well?  Um something about whatever minerals are in there really  Accentuate like various properties in your alcohol. This is from my my stabby bartender friends. I really can't tell wait a minute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's something in there that does make you more drunk, but you have to put you add you add the alcohol

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just tastes better. It doesn't make you more drunk. This is how rumors are formed  I've been drinking topo chico all day topo chico. It makes you more drunk

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, is it in every grocery store or is it something you have to go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is oh no, no, it's in grocery stores. It's in gas stations. It's all over the place. Does it taste better?  It does. I mean  If you like seltzer water, it's a good seltzer water. It's a good seltzer water. I don't know. I mean  all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where how do we get there? Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We were talking about drinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nugget

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the other thing is the double tap for recents to pop to the last thing you did  Pinning, you know, do we split screen split screen? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the notifications are much better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, the combined. Yeah, I like actually do but see I've part of the reason I've forgotten is because i've had it for so long

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now yeah same here. You forget what's fresh. Yeah, also that you um  The the this screen has more customizability the setting the screen I think doesn't it  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like you can move things around on it. Yeah, big deal. But yes, actually that is okay. I was gonna say actually that's exciting  There are things I want to do. That's fine. I don't mean that part of the problem with the fragmentation of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android is for instance, i've been using the new nexus 7  The new nexus 7 and it's got all sorts of other things who knows what's what right?  It's new nexus 7 note note 7. Sorry. I've been doing that a lot. I was gonna be jealous the nexus 7 is  No, I I you know, actually this is an interesting. So let's take a break and there is a story. I want to talk about which is  that  The note 7 which is a very nice  beautiful phone snappy and looks good and everything  Is is  Designed in such a way that reviewers love it because they don't have to use it for very long  But that all of samsung's phones  Slow down and become crap  Really a few weeks later  Well, well, let's talk about it. Is that the case?  I'll tell you my mom my mom and dad just bought one. Yeah, I really like the note. I'm a big note fan, but um  Hmm first though, let's talk about zip recruiter  Because if you're the person hiring in your business you're doing the most important thing  That you can do in your business which is building the business brick by brick person by person  I can say this with authority now that  I've been running a business of my very own for 10 years  It's a small business and certainly the smaller the business the more important it is because each and every person  Can make or break your business a great employee can build it  It can make your business sing a bad employee can bring it down  You want to find the right person and the right person is out there  The trick is finding the right person and that means you have to get to where that person whoever he or she is  Where they are  And that can be the challenge you post it on one job board. There's no guarantee you're hitting that person  But with zip recruiter you're hitting so many more people 100 plus job boards  With one click of the mouse on zip recruiter plus social networks like craigslist and twitter and facebook and linkedin  And you're also because zip recruiter also is a place people go to get hired  You're immediately matching against six million current resumes  So their chance of you hitting the exact person you want  Is much higher  And then the beauty is you don't mind getting all these candidates because they all come into the zip recruiter interface  They don't go into your inbox or call you at your  Office or at home they go into the zip recruiter interface. You can design questions there, you know multiple choice or essays or  You can you can do you can rank the people you can screen out what people that just aren't good  That won't fit you can find the right person fast and you'll have applicants within a day  Just because of the speed of how zip recruiter works. You'll also have applicants  Who are mobile only because they have a great mobile application process  That number on the page over 800 000 businesses is now a million companies have used zip recruiter many hundreds of the top  Uh fortune 500 companies use zip recruiter. It is a it is now known to be the tool  for hiring  You'll find candidates in any city any industry  Nationwide and I want you to try it for free at zip recruiter.com  Zip recruiter.com slash twig we've been using it and we love it and you really want to try it zip recruiter  dot-com  Slash twig we thank them so much for their support  Of this week in google  Stacey Higginbotham from stacey on iot the podcast the newsletter the website  Is here the empire the empire the rock opera the rock opera  The topo gigio of tech  Um, do you think it's the bubbles because they always said champagne gets you drunk faster because of the bubbles

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I think there is something on that but i've never i've never actually researched it. It speeds absorption. Okay, we're gonna do a test

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I was about to say do you have champagne?  This week we'll we'll we'll get stacey drunk this level and next week. We'll you know time it's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd be fun drunk i'm thinking you'd dance you're a dancer

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would think you'd get I think you'd get even more honest

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, dear, that would be bad  So, I don't know. Do you you probably don't have an over the shoulder shot yet on this set  The um, you did sunday. Oh, yeah, we do look look at that. So this is the galaxy note. I've had it for a week  look here  already  in  It fine scratches those are scratches at the bottom. I haven't dropped it back when iphones were scratched

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all would have fits. Well, this is like a glassy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Finished back and when the galaxy s7 came out, which was is basically the same as this phone  People had all sorts of scores on the glass even though it's gorilla glass 5  This is a very fragile phone. Thank god today the case came but it was even as new as this phone is it's already too late  For this and this is kind of in a physical world a manifestation of what?  The folks at xda developers are saying that's the great forum  for android  Fans everywhere they're saying the press never gets it right on samsung phones  Because they always start out really fast and slick  But in the real world over time  performance  sucks  Now I have to say i'm i'm the press right? I I have a new phone every few months. I probably don't use  These phones long enough to experience the slowdown if there is such a thing, although I did on my s6  A couple of generations ago. See you  significant hesitation and slowdown not so much on this one. I'm kind of a fan of this phone this has the  Uh, according to display mate the best screen on any phone on the market. It's a beautiful oled screen something apple still isn't doing  Um, of course the stylus everybody loves the stylus or if you do love the stylus, this is the phone right for stylus lovers  You can write you can you can actually translate handwriting  uh, it's uh, you know  You can draw pictures renee richie who is you know from i'm more and clearly a apple  Lover loves his iphone and his ipad was said every big phone should have a stylus. He loved he was drawn back. I wish I had one  I never use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, but there's no habit. It's like I don't use google now enough my handwriting is so terrible and i'm not no artists

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so but yeah, I mean you can take take screenshots and there's a lot of and by the this is one of the reasons that i'm  I don't know if nougat is such a big deal for me there. They have added samsung adds all sorts of stuff, right?  There's it's full of stuff that isn't in android  Uh, like one of the things I really love that's been in most of the galaxy phones for some time your parents might like this  Uh stacy is the adapt sound where you actually take a hearing test you put in your headphones  You take a hearing test and they generate an equalization curve  Uh that will make stuff sound better and it makes a huge it makes a huge difference for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, i'll have to tell him about that. Is it like an automatic thing? Yeah. Well, it's buried. No, yeah, that's the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, I read a review of the s7 that said it's a shame samsung doesn't do that anymore, but they did they just  I guess didn't fight you go to sounds in the settings and you have to scroll all the way down to sound quality and effects  And there's an equalizer but at the bottom of that there's adapt sound and what it does. This is my curve that it generated  Uh, there's the light blue below you can see as with most old folks  My high end is really poor and the darker blue is what it equalizes it up to to give me  Uh excellent hearing across the board and it's definitely noticeable. I mean it really sounds much better to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is so awesome. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's not nougat  Uh, it also does you know things that like it was the first to do split screen now nougat does it but i've been doing that  For a while on my samsung phones. So  On the other hand, you know a lot of people say and I I don't disagree they junk it up with other things, right?  There's all sorts of weird  cruft

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know the other day my my chromebook at work, you know finally got slowed down  I actually thought the tweet deck is freezing on me constantly. So I thought maybe it was the chromebook  So I rebuilt the chromebook and it takes literally two minutes  Why can't that be the case for a phone? I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it is that's actually if you're going to take one thing that's great about nougat  When you update android now instead of going through each application real one by one  App one of 293  App two of 293 you might as well just go to bed  In fact, many android phones have a setting  It's not default in android but many android aftermarket settings say  Check for updates in the middle of the night and and apply them in the middle of the night  So I don't have to look at it in the morning  Nougat doesn't do that anymore. It's almost it is almost as fast as that. It's almost two minutes. It's very quick  Oh, yeah, okay. Well, that's a big improvement  So  Part of the problem is this note seven is of course marshmallow because it came out what like one week before nougat came out  And because it has so many adaptations  It's going to be a while samsung says no. No, we're going to get it out in two months. We'll see i'll see it  I'll believe it when I see it  but it takes them a while to  Adapt it because they have to take the android new android source code and then add all their  doohickeys  and stuff  So if i'll tell you what if I get a better camera and better battery life on a nexus, I would I would choose the nexus

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish they  If I could get a pure android experience on that hardware. Well, that's the I mentioned that before right?  Right, so you used to have you know, remember that that was a brief period around google play experience for one phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They sold it. It was great. No, that was more than one. I thought they did a couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well  But it's gone. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, I I like the nexus 7. I agree that sometimes samsung phones deteriorate over time, but um note 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Note 7 sorry  That's okay note

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nexus  Note 7 part of the confusion is the last one was note 5  So I don't and there was a nexus 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was yes, which I missed terribly. You know what? Yeah  Googlers I know adore the nexus 7. We still carry it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't they just did they cut off support for that finally was that?  The news or was that no, I have one. It's up to date through 601. I don't know if it'll go to seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have the second year nexus 7. Oh, no nougat support for  Next 2013 nexus 7, which I think is the second one. Oh  Oh  And a tablet really can use that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah screen and stuff. Yeah, that's a shame the nexus 7 to me was the perfect size. It was a great tablet  I absolutely loved it, but  When I like my pixel c but it's just it's just very different

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's much bigger you will get nougat on the pixel c too soon. It did darn well better. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're so cranky jeff, I know he's like it's great we just count on jeff to be peeved  miffed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know why everybody's miffed with me so i'm gonna be miffed back. He was a tv reviewer for years. That'll that'll turn your turn  You sours. I have I have hate mail from bill cosby

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is now very something to be proud of. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see  I dropped a study in just because I thought it was interesting. This is apropos of nothing but um  It was i'll find it. It's on how typing  or actually voice  Input is three times faster than typing on your little tiny phones. What a surprise it took stanford

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Study to figure that out, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, exactly i'm like but they also included as part of that  It looks like some of the challenges that you have when you do voice recognition when you know  You're like having to go back and fix things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was like, oh you fooled yourself on the street. Here's something surprising from that study though  Speech recognition is three times faster  than english  Typing but only 2.8 times faster than chinese typing you'd think it'd be the other way around. This is all  Because they can do a paragraph. Oh, you're right and a character. Oh, you're right. Each character is one word

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right. Of course, that's that's not is that how like the it's pinyin keyboards. Is that how you say it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's pinyin, but I don't know how they do keyboards. I don't know how they do it either pinyin is the anglicization of chinese  Audiographs, I don't know how they do maybe they do pinyin. I don't know what they do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's google. How do you type in chinese?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My sense in the in the physical keyboards. I don't know how they do it on a phone and physical keyboards  You'd have series of shift keys that would add that you so you slowly build the character up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, wow, it was pinyin still, yeah  Is it pinyin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To enable english error rate is uh, 20 lower mandarin error rate is 63 lower when you speak  Which is interesting and this was not using google's uh speech recognition, but bido's deep speech too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So and it was it was let's see it was on ios keyboards it was a built-in querdate or pinyin pinyin  pinyin apple ios keyboard the ios

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keyboard is horrible, right?  That i'm so inaccurate on that because it's small  Because it's small  It only recently had lowercase keys too, you know, you had to guess what the shift state was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you want to see I don't know I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can watch a video. They did a video. I was looking for one. Yeah, I love the course they did  Stanford's got this great open. They have to make videos

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like the old hbo so great speech recognition, but it really hasn't worked well enough in terms of error rate  Do they have budget look at this real applications this is 60 minutes quality production here  That's only speech recognition was working really well to camera shoot due to deep learning and big data  But they got some wardrobe budget got wardrobe  So we ran a study makeup where people had to take very nice lenses over 100 phrases  Using both speech recognition and i really wish they wouldn't shift back and forth from the server close up to the regular  Out there today and we were able to see which one was faster

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know why they why people do that by the way because people who do tv think you're an idiot

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. Amen. Leo. Amen. You know what? I really hate  I hate when they do the two shots and one of them you're looking like this. Yeah  You're looking at nothing. I you know, yeah, it just makes no sense at all  Or looking that way  Because tv people like this show because I can actually talk to the user and yell at them even  But instead on tv, i'm always looking that way people on tv just think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The viewers are the most short short attention span  nudnicks  Yeah, yes, they are and we got to keep switching it. You're absolutely right or you will be so bored

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which side are you on am I doing it the wrong way? Yeah. No, I have to look like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They actually make you do that the reporter as you know sits to the right of the camera. Yeah, it says talk to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So in fact and then they edit it like i'm not like that guy's never in it  So why don't I just talk to the people but no I end up over here  Talking to some imaginary person because i'm an idiot. I don't know where the camera lens is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then well when people talk directly to the camera, sometimes they look like serial killers  like if you're on tv, they're like  That really like when I do this a lot because I get really excited about things and you're like intense and you're looking at them  And they're like, whoa  So if you if you if you approach me at an angle, i'm a little less scary. Oh, that makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I mean that makes a lot of sense  But did you ever work in television?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, why would I work in tv?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it's only the best medium ever invented

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like writing is the best medium ever invented then podcasting. Yeah, kutenberg i'm sure that's true. Uh-oh drink

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kutenberg  Oh, is that what this is? Uh-huh  It's breaking game drinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, anytime you mention all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good study and it doesn't surprise me. I dictate whenever I can  I am so much better dictating than I am typing on a little dinky keyboard. I always dictate

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen a lot more people talking to their phones lately. We I think we talked about this this whole  You have it, but I've seen I  I was in um, where was I I was in the the admirals club at um  Some airport one of the airports I was in I think it was san francisco  um, and this dude was just like  Talking do do do text and it was so funny watching him because it was like jackrabbit quick, you know like

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sent like  Dictating his texts, but it was weird because he was such a public place and there was a lot of noise around

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, i'll do that though because i'm so much better at speaking than typing  And but the problem you do for a living well, it's just it's just easier the problem is you always have to correct it  There's always some time spent going  No  I didn't mean conveyor belt  That's another thing I learned uh from my time with the movie star steve martin can I ever drop that in lately?  Please do he told me two weeks. He sent me a text. He sent me a text  That said we'll have to be late later for lunch because I have a nook rehearsal  I said, oh, that's probably a  Uh, a movie term a nook rehearsal. So I asked him what's a nook rehearsal. I said, I don't know he said  He said that's what all the young comics do now. They don't correct their autocorrect  They leave it as is that's the that's the thing the in thing to do now  It's kind of you know that ironic  Just leave it leave it as is right even if it's modern texting. Yeah modern texting don't fix it  So so just so you know when you get weird texts from me, that's what's going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She she has a skype account  But if you wanted to skype with her you had to call her you had to arrange the time because she had to sit up  And it was uh, well, that's true

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is one thing that's better than skype is you don't have to have it running to get a call

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, right  That's good. Yeah, that's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, don't don't I got I didn't even know there was a job category  See I get mad because I go through you know, they say what's your occupation and they never have media  They always have to pick like businessmen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have media

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot of times they don't know  But boy if you're a domain name blogger, what the hell is your job?  entrepreneur

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  entrepreneur

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so the reason I was asking was is are you two gadget freaks in one house? Are you the gadget?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, he comes on the podcast sometimes I I use him as my  Voice from the real world because he comes in he's like yeah, but he's not he's not the real world if he's a domain name blogger  He's he's pretty normal other than that and you know, he's lived the horror stories

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stacey's trying out another darn doorbell  Can I just have a doorbell you hit and it goes and it makes a sound like a ding dong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we've got to have fancy doorbells, oh that must be hell for him, huh? There's always a dude to hickey

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like I was trying the sunrise feature on like some philips hue light bulbs. I think it was in our bedroom  and for some reason  I don't they didn't tell you this but you have to set like I set the schedule but I didn't set my time zone  So it thought I lived in the middle of the atlantic. So around four in the morning it was sunrise

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we're both like what the hell's going on?  Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I got a similar story I had hue lights mainly the bottom line in both these stories is do not have hue lights in your  bedroom  Yeah, I have hue lights in my bedroom, right? Same idea, you know slowly ramp you up in the morning  Sunset at night what they don't tell you and this makes sense  Is that when the power goes out and then comes back on they come on full bright like  bam  middle of the night, I'm  Lisa and I are in bed  And bam the lights go on but this is exactly the difference between me and lisa  I I get my phone out and try to launch the hue app  She just goes over to the wall and turns the lights off and goes back to sleep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're gonna have if you're gonna have smart bulbs I would recommend putting in a smart switch because if you have the smart switch  Or just don't put them in your bedroom. Also totally legit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I understand why they come on full bright because you want them, right?  But it is not a nice way to wake up, uh, you don't know sunrise at 4 a.m. You're not in cura body. Come on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's first the the worst way to wake up is having all of your sonoses  Decide that because you're home. It's time to run the welcome home sequence not just in your bedroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But around your entire house. What's the welcome home sequence? I don't have a welcome home sequence

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I was playing this was an early iteration of an app  and it no longer has it it works now, but  When it had geolocation and it wasn't as fine tuned  so what was happening is  It kept my phone would be in and out of like range  So it kept thinking I was leaving the house and coming back in so it did that  in  the middle of the night and I had set it up so  welcome home my lights some of my lights came on and then  The sonos would play like welcome stacy. Oh my god, you're such a geek

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you record that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean I could but I didn't record the mess up because it was the middle of the night

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How did it have a recording that says welcome? What song should you play for welcome home?  Well, what do you think your dreams where you take it out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's an automated voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Welcome home stacy. Yes, I am the robot that has taken over your house

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Please enter and close the door behind you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no the app does that for you  That's even scarier

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you come in the door and it goes bam  No, it doesn't it doesn't there are no windows and no doors  So I have a similar thing with my sonos  Uh often this is a bad habit when we're leaving for the  The day i'll be listening and then i'll do the mute button on the sonos and that mutes it, right?  Mm-hmm, but there's a problem because our cats like to sleep on the sonos  So in the middle of the night  Because I often have the sonos connected all through the house the cat will lie on the sonos  Set the off the turn off the mute button and the blaring music in the middle of the night  Yes  Yes  So those so what we're saying is smart houses are pretty dumb

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes  agree  But there's so much fun

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what it means to be a pioneer that and living with a domain name blogger

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, he likes the echo though. Well, that's how I knew it was a real device for people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I yeah, you know what? The echo is an interesting thing because you wouldn't think so but then you just you just love it  Um, so so you think duo is going to be a hit then because it wasn't I think the jury was out initially like is this  What a mocking of it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I  I actually do you all remember tango? Is that even still a thing? Yeah project tango. Yeah  No, no, no, no, not not google's project tango. Sorry. Uh, it was an app. It was a video calling app  Yeah, yeah, let's go around. Yeah. Okay. So like I use that and so my family use that fiber

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were a whole category of them and then whatsapp  And facebook and all these others added video calling  So now there's 800 ways to do video calls. Go ahead. I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I was just saying that I think this is probably a really solid entry. It's so easy. It's so much easier  And I love  I love the I mean, I like this setup. I like that. I could call my mom right now. She would kill me but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but she's a big button there. No, but that's the beauty of it. She's a big so get this  I've replaced  So maybe there is something there. I thought it was just me. I've replaced the phone icon on my  Phone with a duo icon with a duo icon  Oh, wow, how about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because the people you call a lot show up right there. It's very easy. Is it going to come with nougat automatically? No  Why wouldn't they do that nor will alo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's four just ask well, who knows what google's up to what what's going on with hangouts for crying  But I was I wasn't sure that this would take because I remember spaces that was here and gone google's done this a lot  and um  I wasn't sure that this would become popular, but but I think it might be one of the case where  Tech journalists kind of gloss it over because we know there's 800 other ways to do this  But real people go that's nice and easy  I don't think i'll use that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know someone was asking in the chat room about 9-1-1  Dialing 9-1-1 on something like that. If you don't have the phone icon. Yeah, is it that you still have your emergency thing, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I have a phone icon in a folder somewhere. I could still dial it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want so the other day I was I was choking  and like not total choking not full on heimlich yet, but  I was also trying to tell the echo to stop  Uh a timer and so I was like alexa  Wow  I was like, how awesome would it be because she's already listening to me if she could like  Do you want me to dial 9-1-1 and if I didn't respond?  You know boom that happened. So I was starting to think about things like in a connected house  How you could call emergency services so that person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The chat room iPhone will do that  It will if it gives you choking ios 10  And the apple the apple watch has an emergency button  I'm trying to remember the details of it. Um, but yeah, I think there's something like that on the apple watch  and with ios 10 and then um  The reason I don't need a phone icon also is because I could say, okay google call, you know who?  So I most of the time if I I don't make calls very often. That's that's part of why that that's there  Is alex william was here on twitter a couple of weeks ago and he said I don't have a phone  What do you need a phone icon for? I don't ever use this for phone calls. He's a young person and I thought  Millennials, but that's true. I rarely make outbound phone calls, but when I do I can easily go. Okay, you know who you call your kids  Yeah, but so okay  So they're they the people I call I have a little dedicated contact button here so I can call them or text them rapidly

We don't know when alo will come out a duo is part of a duo alo is the second half of the duo. It's a  chat  Application that will also be I believe cross-platform do they say it was cross-platform  Exotic. Yeah, I think they did. Yes. This is where they stand in direct  opposition to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the weakness to both is that you've got to get people to download it. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This I I mentioned this earlier this bugs the hell out of me  We we we're it's retrograde  You know when chatting first started you were you had or even email for that matter  You had to be on the same system as the person you were chatting with her email email eventually got federated  So one email address if it was an mci mail or genie or compuserve could email other email addresses  That made email take off that made email useful  Chat was the same way. It was icq or msn or  Or yahoo chat and you couldn't talk interoperate  Then they then times went by and xmpp came along google was a big proponent  We could all talk to one another now. We're going backwards again where everybody says no, no, it's bad for business  We want to silo you can only talk to people using our app  That's terrible

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just tech  We silo then we come together then we silo and come together. So it's a it's a cycle you think  Oh, it totally is. I mean  Not just in chat and apps  but think about things like even enterprise tech and like  How we built all these separate like siloed things for I don't know  Erp and hr and all this and then now what they're like  Oh, let's bring it all to the cloud and link everything via apis. I mean, it's just  Like hey, there's money here. Let's build something. We don't want it to work with anyone, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google uh google's alo. I think one of the most interesting features there are many  And by the way, i'm just hoping this is google's final, you know  Bid for check because they can't seem to make up their mind what the hell they want  For messaging, but they will also have an assistant built in and you can talk to the assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I wonder whether that isn't the primary use of alo. That's what I think too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be great. It's great for users, but it's also going to be great to train the  think about google does they've got this like  When I search something on google even when i'm doing it via voice  It's much less natural language, right?  But now you're going to get all of these very natural language requests written into text with people and that's going to be  wonderful for their

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their machine learning efforts and google on tap will work better because you can search the text on the screen  I'm super excited about it. Me too. I I want to use it. I want a good centralized messaging  Platform that I can use with everybody i'm using facebook messenger right now. That's really not great

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody what's the rumor on when?  google assistant  Google home is going to be out any rumors

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are no like it's it's I have heard that it is being tested, but that's all i've heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So with that it starts to all come together  It's like the matrix

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, except not the matrix isn't it funny how I want to I want to buy into this  I want to I want it. I want to go all in I want to google you can have it all I want it all integrated

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Though has really I think taken nest to lunch haven't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um according to an article I read the phrase

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is not eating nests lunch not taking them to lunch. That means something completely different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right, uh, they're still behind them  It is I think it's a better thermostat the ecobee three is a better thermostat than the nest  But that's that's my studied opinion, um, it's a good one though and  Let's see. They recently got 35 million  Kevin and I on our show for tomorrow. We talk about the new  FCC filing but we we did promise people scoop. So I want to stay sort of on track. What is scoop?  We don't know but they think it's going to be like the echo or possibly the google home  So this is a tiny it's a it looks more like a dot it has a wrist strap so it's probably like a  Dot size tap was that just crazy? Yeah  It says it's got a usb jack a charging port  And play and sound control buttons  Volume, that's the word. I was won't you be disappointed if it's just bluetooth speakers  That's kind of what I thought it looked like to be totally honest. There is a microphone. So  Yeah, i'm like, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well  Don't we really want sonos as you can talk to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, so that's that's the promise of google home in all honesty to me. It's the  Ears and mouth of your home. When are we getting that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hurry up google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that or sonos I would prefer sonos give us an api because i've already got the sonos's  How awesome would it be to use stuff? You've already bought

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I mean I have tied my google my echo  tap  No, my dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've plugged your dot into a sonos. No, I do it by a bluetooth into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Into wireless speakers and there are people who've who've jerry-rigged it to work with sonos  But I would have to leave your computer on  Yeah, it's a pain. I would really love to be able to talk to my sonos  You know, it's funny too as I kind of  The sonos is expensive and I always thought oh, they're probably not very good speakers  But I was listening the other day we were having a party and we had a party mode on the sonos  And then I have a sonos connect connected to my fancy expensive hi-fi  And I thought the sonos speakers actually sounded better at least for a party  They really sound good. They built

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  inside chips  Optimized like they did a lot with digital audio to make the speaker itself high quality  Like a couple years ago, I interviewed them and they talked a lot about this that I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, because um, they're not huge  You know, you'd think that the my subwoofer and my tower speakers should sound better than this little  Bookshelf speaker, but they don't  They sound lovely. They sound good. And I usually use two  For left right, right? Are they the threes or the no i-fives? I have all fives. Okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, have you optimized it with your iphone so you can stand in the middle of the room and  Play the music and you should it's actually pretty cool to make a difference  It does make a difference. Although maybe you can't hear it unless you've got it tied to your samsung phone. I have my sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In every room of the house we got so I'm so but it's been over time  It's very expensive but i'm so all in on sonos that I would like it to have the amazon echo capabilities

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, well they won't have the not only the most recent ones have microphones

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So right and I don't have any of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so you would have to be able to talk to the echo to make it happen  Yeah, I mean i've got wired speakers in the ceiling and then like six bridges downstairs  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So i'm with you. Let's make it work with the echo. How hard is that sonos just to talk to amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, they have to get an approval. They have to release an api that's approved and  We can talk about amazon and their new music service. Maybe maybe that will inspire so that's why maybe just one dies one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Comes five buck music service, but it plays back on the crap echo speakers. I don't want that right?  Neither do I well, I guess I could tie my I could use it with my dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I I mean I listen to my echo speaker. I've got  My i've got a sonos in my kitchen and sonos in my living room  But I listen to the echo about half the time now because for books I do all the time. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so easy just yeah  It's sad. Yeah, and I and I don't have it. I  You know if you don't so one of the biggest things they change and we talked about it when they happened a couple of months ago  Is initially if you asked for music it was it had to get it from amazon prime which has such a constrained  You know number of songs only about a million songs compared to the 20 million on the other services  But recently they allowed you to use spotify as your default music service or pandora  So now I made spotify my default music service and now I can say  Play something and it'll almost certainly have it because spotify has everything  And that works great and I listen to my spotify playlists and I just I don't have to say spotify anymore  I just say, you know listen to my coffeehouse playlist and it'll play it's nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ooh one of your chat room people posted on github a  An http api for sonos and you've seen that don't I have to have a computer? Isn't that the one you do? Yeah  So, but you know, I didn't think about this, but if you stuck it on a pie could you just have that running?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet you I could all right. I got a pie lying around. I got a pie lying around. I could leave that on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, because I'd leave a pie on but not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I also have a server running all the time in the house. Maybe okay  Maybe I should sit down and get to work on that  But then again, maybe yeah, okay. I just feel like it's easier  It would probably work better and be easier if it would just be endorsed and supported by amazon and sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, yeah, because not like I mean jeff is like you guys are geeks  But so most people are not going to be like, oh i'll just pull some clued off github and run it on a pie

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That I have lying around. It's easy. You just clone that compile it put it on your raspberry pie

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gishi yeah, i've known about this one for a while. Gishi's node sonos api

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what'd be cool is if you could put what if somebody did a tindi  And you stuck you stuck basically this on a pie and made it just work and then you could sell  You know basically the sonos api on a stick. Oh  That might be fun. I wonder if that's legal

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, probably not. Why wouldn't it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um because sonos well what okay, so legal is not the issue sonos with the api if they change it  Then you have to update. Oh, yeah, you know what i'm responsible. Yeah, so yeah  And if if you're a normal person who buys that and it's like, oh I want to do this  Let's see if I can make it work and then they change the api you're gonna be like now. I gotta update it  What I gotta flash up what no, ah  This is a piece of crap. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so cheap you just sell another one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you can sell for 50 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not that cheap man if I spent 50 bucks on something if you spend as much as you spend on sonos

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nothing. Oh my god

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't even want to think about it  Yeah, so expensive  Chase is going to start supporting android pay next month september 7th  Isn't it weird that they didn't?  Why don't now there's a big battle brewing we talked about this on mac break weekly yesterday in australia  Australia and I think this is legit the mac break weekly guys did not they defended it but you know, uh  So a number of australian banks and retailers  Uh have complained to the australian competitive board and they want  Because they say apple is being anti-competitive by not allowing them access to the nfc chip on an iphone  If you're going to use tap to pay on an iphone, it has to be apple pay  Period because apple pays the only  Apple's the only company that can access that nfc chip  They say you got to open up  You got to make apple open up that nfc chip so that we can make our own tap to pay solutions  And I hadn't really thought about this but in a way android pay on on android and apple pay on ios have kind of a monopoly  um  Android pay less so because there are other solutions  I use samsung pay for instance because this nfc chip is available  And I think samsung pay is just as secure as android pay is just as secure as apple pay. It's not an issue of  Security it's issue of competition apple can take as much of a cut as they want because if you're going to use an iphone  And tap to pay apple you can only use apple pay  So the the australian competition competitive board is now has to issue a ruling  Over what's more anti-competitive all the banks and retailers in australia getting together  and complaining  Or what apple's doing with its nfc  And I think that they're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, are there security? I mean apple usually argues security when it closes off and i'd be curious to see what kind of filings end up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like how technically i'm sure that i'm sure they'll raise the specter of security  But like I said, I don't feel any less secure using samsung pay  Or android pay because the an open nfc chip doesn't mean well, I don't know maybe you can hack it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't i haven't seen well, that's why that's why i'm like I want to see the technical documentation that they'll ask for because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good chance to answer that apple's going to absolutely say. Oh, well, we can't let everybody have access to nfc  That would compromise our platform  Of course, they're going to say that  Anyway that fight we'll we'll hear more about that in a couple of weeks when the australian competition board rules  Um  Do we care about google phasing out chrome apps for windows mac and linux? I was wondering about that. Should I care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean i'm on a chromebook. So it doesn't matter to me  On on my mac, I can't use the same apps. I think the reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's hard to explain this is nobody knows and myself included what's an app and what's an extension? Yeah extensions will continue  The apps will not and I feel like I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think i'm using one app

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's probably the case. I mean i'm looking at my app store  So on google on chrome you have on the left of your bookmark bar  You have the show apps thing and then you'll see all the apps these say apps, but most of these are not apps  They're just extensions chrome extensions  Um, yeah, so what am I going to lose? I'm on linux right now. I have to say it's fabulous  Because it means that I can do a lot of things  In chromium i'm not even using chrome i'm using the open source chromium on linux. That would be hard otherwise  Uh because there's no linux app for because it's developed for all across platform  Now is google photos an app they're calling it an app, but I don't I don't know if it's an app  What does that mean? And does that mean no google photos? No, it just means you go to photos.google.com  Instead of clicking a button. I'm not i'm not sure what this means. I don't think this is a bad thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think this is a bad thing  Oh, well this effect. Okay. Hold on. Let me open up something new and see what happens  Are like I mean like dots or docs docs and all of that are those like the apps that we're talking about or because those are the actual apps that I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know  Yeah, i'm confused apps are standalone  And i'm only running one of those you can go to drive doc you could go to google docs  On google drive on your web so you're not going to lose it  um, but the apps  On mac and I guess on linux. Oh, i'm not sure. Yeah, I guess on linux on the mac for sure  You get in your doc you get an apps icon and even if  This is I think it's almost optics even if chrome's not running  You can run that app, but of course chrome is kind of running because as soon as you launch that app chrome's the back end for that  So I don't I don't really know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry y'all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well  Yeah, google says the usage numbers are low approximately one percent of users on windows mac and linux actively use chrome packaged apps  And and this is the key most hosted apps are already implemented as regular web apps  So this may be a distinction without a difference this may not be something  Anybody's gonna lose any sleepover  Maybe that's part of it. It's just like people didn't even know what these what they were  So middle out compression is coming to silicon valley and i'm not talking the tv show  Uh google is going to start using artificial intelligence to compress  photos  And as cute as quartz says just like on silicon valley the tv show  It's not middle out compression, but it's the next big thing neural networks  To do compression  That's how a pipe pipe does it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't they just have an algorithm? It wasn't a neural network was they said it was a neural network apparently. Yeah. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? Yeah, I don't know. It's fiction. It's fiction. They made it up  Did you i'm, sorry, would you say did you like it or not? Oh, no, I said I got sick of that show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I stopped watching it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was too real. It went down. It was too real. You know, that's so funny  bill atkinson  One of the found one of the creators of the macintosh. I asked him if you watched he said no, it's too real  I don't want to go through that again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like I I spend all day on this I do not want to watch it watch this at home  So, um, that's cool neural networks they're going to be google's using them everywhere  I mean everybody's using them everywhere google and facebook are really like taking it to the next level with their machine learning  and  We're going to see a lot of really cool stuff and then we're also not going to see a lot of cool stuff that is just going to  Make things a little bit smoother and it's going to be nice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a phy customer, right jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Phi google phi yeah on my second phone. Yeah  Um, uh, yeah, but so I mainly use outside the country

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't even know about this. I'm a phy user. This is on my nexus 6p. Um, there is a thing called a wi-fi assistant

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what this is apparently if you see because you don't know because you don't know when you switch between the two  Cell services, but also wi-fi it'll switch you seamlessly among all three, right?  So you never know what you're on  but  Uh, you know every time I go around and I see only wi-fis  Starbucks makes you sign in  um  Everybody else in new york subway makes you sign in new york street makes you sign in  Everything makes you sign in. So what is it that's open that this can get into?  You know, you can't get into comcast networks because  You're not um a comcast customer you can't get into the at&t networks because it's not at&t  So what wi-fi is this signing you into that's it's now going to come to other nexus phones, which sounds great

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except I don't understand what it does for you. So it says you open android assistant. I mean open android settings  tap the google  item  Here's the google item and then from the google item type tap networking. Okay, good. Good. Good. Ah, yeah  Ah use open wi-fi automatically. I have it turned off automatically connect to wi-fi. That is so dangerous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes  I recommend people don't even have their wi-fi on when they're out and about if they don't want to be tracked

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, just the act of trying to find an open wi-fi network  Your phone basically shares other shares its data about what other wi-fi networks it's connected to so that's how a lot of companies like  Euclid and others get like demographic data  Um, there's peter teal invested in a company that does wi-fi free wi-fi for coffee shops  And that's one of the big  Ways they're getting data on people  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That you sign in it's well and hackers use it too because here's the here's the uh, here's the method of attack  I query your phone. Tell me about the wi-fi networks, you know  Find find one that you join like your home wi-fi automatically  then  I'm sitting in the coffee shop. I rename my access point to that use my pineapple router or whatever to name it to that  You see a strong signal. It's your home router. Oh  Who knew I could get this in my you don't do it their phone does it. Oh  And joins the home router automatically and all of a sudden you don't see anything  You're on your home router sending all your information through the bad guy's pineapple  That's not that's not what you want  So I yeah, I turn off the xfinity thing that you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't use that and I oh their public wi-fi thing on your own router or a modem. Yeah and router  Here's a foot. So go ahead  Oh, I was gonna say on that  If you don't use their modem does it still create the public hotspot? Because it's just sorry if you don't use their router  Yes  If you don't use their their gear basically that you have to lease and pay for  Does it still create a public wi-fi hotspot on xfinity? Okay, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's only people and I think it's all consumer users  I don't know but you have to buy a dual router wi-fi  or you know have to but that's what comcast puts in your house if they can is a is a  Is a is a cable modem router with wi-fi, right?  And if you don't turn it off, it automatically creates another channel that is the xfinity wi-fi  It's all over austin. They have everywhere right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have we have time order cable which why did I think austin was one of the worst places for it petaluma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all over here  Uh, if you it but the problem is half the time it doesn't give I don't get bandwidth  Now google does say in this setting high quality wi-fi. So they're doing something to check the wi-fi  But I don't know. I don't know if that's a good thing. Where was the setting again? I I couldn't I missed it  So you go it'll be maybe it's on new settings  You go to settings google settings google, right?  And then you go down to networking  And it's the only setting I don't have that. Oh, there was networking. Okay, and then it says use open wi-fi automatically automatically  Wi-fi at select locations. That means I probably turned mine off because I bet it defaults to on yeah, I would bet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mine's on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does seem on the face of it dangerous. But on the other hand  Google we know is pretty sophisticated about uh online hazards  I don't think I don't think they would let me do anything dangerous  Wi-fi assistant auto connects you to high quality high quality public wi-fi hotspots and helps secure your connection  To help protect you on public wi-fi your data is transmitted. Oh  Through a secure vpn managed by google. Oh, that's how they do it  A key will appear at the top of your screen. Well google's in the middle, but I trust google  Yes, so i'm turning it back on  So that way the man and you know the hacker with the pineapple down

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But how many purely open networks are there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a lot. Um, someone just put in that there's 500. Oh, these aren't purely open  You have to log in with your subscriber account to your isb. Yeah, most of them are captive portals capture captive portals, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're enough

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I i've whined about this on the show before  I wish just for once starbucks google runs starbucks wi-fi. Ah, maybe that's it because google does  Ah  That's google wi-fi  But all I want to do is I want to I want to sign one thing once that says yes  Yes, I will not do porn or blow up the world or do horrible things or kidnap children  Just let me join you once and for all every time I go into starbucks. Just put me on right get boingo

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was like that's what those services were for right? Right, but that's expensive too. That adds up. Yes it is  So if you went to defcon speaking of defcon  Uh, you may have noticed this is a from a piece on github. He stated in uh, uh,  And actually motherboard reported this jeffrey vaughn is a security researcher who stayed  Uh at caesar's palace in the paris hotel, which is across the street in vegas  During that time he walked around the strip went shopping with his wife  And he went to defcon  And when he arrived before the start of black hat defcon, there were eight gsm towers in the neighborhood  By the time the conferences started there were 38  Now, of course you could you might say oh, well, i'm sure they turned on more towers  for conference attendees  But knowing it's defcon  I would guess that a few of these were what we call stingrays which are phony cell towers law enforcement uses them  But with a raspberry pi and a couple hundred bucks you could build one yourself  These are probably fake access points from from phone networks  That your phone would just join and all your stuff would go through these stingrays  Uh, it's it's about 1500 bucks to build your own  low cost  stingray  Yep  So, uh when they say don't use a cell phone a smartphone. Don't use a laptop at defcon. They mean it  They mean it  Do you go to defcon stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because I don't have a burner computer that I want to like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I send I send my priest  Father robert goes I figure he's he's safe. He's he's not going to get in trouble  Actually, this looks like the way they do this wi-fi. Um  Assistant that looks really smart with a vpn and everything. I'll have to ask steve gives him what he thinks about it  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  so comcast would offer me cheaper service if they

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly, except that's a hard plan to find. Yeah, this is from the next web brian clark writes comcast hopes you don't notice  It's twice as expensive in non google fiber  markets  Competition is there anything it can't do?  You  So is your what is your do you have comcast data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, I I don't have comcast comcast isn't in my market. I have um time Warner cable well, so you don't know  But I will say uh john brodkin over at ours technica  He called the comcast 70 gigabit deal the kaiser soze of internet office offers because  Some comcast reps can't even find it. No one can get it  Um  So it's worth noting that it's possible you could get this but you could have to work for they don't promote it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's actively being hidden, but they apparently according to  Comcast responding to an ars technica piece  They said no. No, you can get it  You just got to know where to look at it. It's uh  You know where so here's the thing take a left at jimmy hoffa and there it is. You'll find it

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even no, even if you're in austin

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you're not in a google market, you could pay twice that right? Yeah  and  I on the other hand can get no gigabit despite putting cat six cable in my house  Just in case I could get a gigabit. It's gonna come I have faith

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, uh cat six is so last year. We have cat six a  A

Yeah, it has 12 years  Exactly 12 years  Uh, my pick of the week is kind of a little uh, weird thing called cube composer  It's a game  But it's a game that will teach you  Uh functional programming through transformations  All right. I mean, I know this is crazy, but how would you turn this red and yellow stack of cubes into?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, i'm just so bad at spatial relations. Well, but you're gonna learn you're you're gonna learn

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you just map the uh yellow to the red right? We'll drop that function over there. Oh, yeah that worked  So let's go to the next level now. You might say well, this is pretty obvious. Oh, how do we get that to be all?  All yellow, but what you're actually going to do is you're going to learn  Uh functional programming techniques and by the way  There's a lot in here  There's a lot in here including  Don't panic  This is the last level  Uh really cool idea absolutely free  I'm a fan of functional programming and but one of the hardest things to teach people  In functional programming are lambdas and mapping and some kind of sophisticated  Kind of almost mathematical set theory stuff that is you know, if you're not a mathematician a little tricky  This does it in a in a kind of a time-honored way  non-verbally just gives you just gives you a  A puzzle that you solve and by the end of it, you'll kind of understand what mapping is  Uh, anyway, I just thought I'd pass along I found that the other day. I thought that was pretty cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is cool i'm gonna play with that because i've been really getting into functional programming not actually doing it  But just writing about it writing about it
