Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you so much.  I'm excited about today's show.  Oh man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I was prepared to announce this show as the show for Facebook haters.  The Facebook Hater Hour.  But now I don't even know if we'll talk about Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't even know if that's going to be in the stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis is also here, journalism professor from the City University of New York, an expert  on Google.  His new book, Public Parts, comes out in just like less than a week.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I think somebody sent me a copy.  Yes, I did.  Oh, oh, oh, get me that book.  I can actually now hold up a real book instead of the cardboard facsimile.  Is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course.  Oh, this is good.  Oh, I got to run down to the mailbox today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh look, he wrote something in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My handwriting is illegible, so.  He wrote everything in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to read it out loud.  He wrote everything in it.  That's really nice.  Yes, he did.  He wrote everything in it.  Just some of it's in purple pen.  Some of it's in purple prose.  So it's perfect.  Public Parts, how sharing in the digital age improves the way we live and work.  And it is now, I think this week, right?  Tuesday, this coming Tuesday.  This coming Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audible 2 and all that.  And I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So did, go ahead.  On the back, the log rolling is all from people with Twitter handles.  Yeah.  Including Val Kilmer.  I know.  I don't figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spend a quiet day reading What Would Google Do by Jeff Jarvis and watching the Lakers  play as if they forgot how to play.  Jarvis knows all, says Val Kilmer.  Is it the Val Kilmer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We think so.  I don't know.  So you just.  Says Val Kilmer on the account.  So as long as it has a hat sign, what do we care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is so great.  I can't wait.  The new book is out and I cannot wait to read it.  Thank you for the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really excited.  We've got so much today.  Twig Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is Twig Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is Twig Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of Plus, Mr. Mike Elgin is here.  He is, of course, a former editor at Computer World, but he's now on his own.  He does a great newsletter.  And Google Plus has been huge for that newsletter.  It's become his publishing medium.  He's one of the few people now who just does it all on Google Plus.  Mike, good to have you back.  Glad to be here.  Thanks for joining us.  ComputerWorld.com.  But Plus Mike Elgin is what you really want.  Oh my God, where to begin?  Let's start with Eric Schmidt, because he testified it before Congress today.  Google actually released a guide to the Senate Judiciary hearing, which is good because otherwise  I wouldn't know what to think.  But thank you, Google, for telling me what to think.  I didn't watch it.  I was busy doing other things, mowing the lawn, having breakfast.  What happened?  Gina, did you watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was watching the feed from the Sunlight Foundation, which is awesome.  They do incredible work.  And what was really neat is that they would show the donors to each senator as they spoke.  You could see how much they had actually donated, which was incredible.  But the stream was a little choppy.  So there would be this key question.  What do you say to people who say that you're unfairly using your position as this most  popular search engine to rank your content higher?  And the feed would be like buffering.  So I did see quite a bit of it.  But I wound up actually switching over to CBS News because they were also doing a live  stream as well.  So I caught kind of the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Barry Schwartz writing in Search Engine Land.  In preparation for the Antitrust hearing today, Google has released a guide to the Senate  Judiciary hearing web page.  When you hear Google is a gateway to the web and controls what you see, remember.  And then when you hear Google favorites its own content, remember, I won't read what it  says to remember.  But this is like Mad Magazine.  Remember, you used to do a feature.  What they're saying, what they're thinking.  Google's telling us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what's fascinating about it is essentially they're using the Microsoft argument, which  didn't work for Microsoft.  But the attack is coming in the form of, OK, you guys have everybody's attention because  you're this big platform that everybody uses.  And you're abusing that to favor your own stuff.  In Microsoft's case, it was Internet Explorer or the media player.  And in this case, it's Google's many services.  And Google's response is exactly like Microsoft's, which is that, hey, we're just one step away  from completely failing.  Anyone can replace us.  We're vulnerable.  And so the old Antitrust arguments don't really apply to us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He actually invokes Microsoft in the third sentence of his statement, saying, 20 years  ago, a large technology firm was setting the world on fire.  Its software was on every computer.  Its name was synonymous with innovation.  But that company lost sight of what mattered.  Then Washington stepped in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was hilarious because the name Microsoft was never said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we know, right?  He doesn't say that.  We all know what it was.  Yeah.  He says, we've absorbed the lessons of that era.  We get it.  He says, we get it.  The lessons of our corporate predecessors first, he says, put consumers first.  And focus on loyalty, not lock in.  I mean, you got to like all this stuff.  Third, be open, not closed.  Fourth, be transparent.  Finally, the only constant is change.  Has Google lived up to those five precepts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the problem.  They're talking about favoring search results.  And it's kind of like we've had a conversation like this in journalism.  Is there such thing as unbiased journalism?  There isn't.  And is there such thing as value free search results?  In other words, if you're ranking something and setting priorities and making decisions  about what's more important, what's less important, set aside for a moment the customization.  Those priorities are based on values.  And this was really revealed when Bing first came out and started doing this stuff about  to be more natural languagey.  And you search for something like, you search for Home Depot and it will offer alternatives  to that, which are other mega chains like Home Depot.  But that's a value judgment, for example.  What if the alternative to a giant chain is a little mom and pop store?  Microsoft's values in Bing, as expressed in Bing, were that the opposite of Home Depot  is another mega chain.  There's all kinds of subtle stuff.  There is no such thing as a value free thing.  And whose values are there?  They're Google's values.  Mike, you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I tweeted today that there is no such thing as objective journalism or there is no such  thing as objective algorithms.  They are the formulae of their rules.  And there are rules.  And they are proprietary rules.  And that's that.  As Schmidt said at one point, ranking, you know, there are winners and losers.  Welcome to the dog eat dog world.  It was a very strange thing that they wanted to attack Google for putting Google Maps on  Google search pages.  And they wanted to say that was a bad thing.  But of course it's not.  Would you say to the New York Times that you can't promote your own food section?  You have to report, you know, push the daily juices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but that's a very different thing.  The New York Times is a publication, one of many.  Google is the search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's very...  But it's only 65%.  And one of the centers...  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that everybody realizes Google is it, right?  I mean, come on.  It's 65% because 35% of users are too stupid to change the Microsoft default search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all.  But we hate a winner.  I mean, Eric did say that he recognized special responsibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And well, he also invoked that famous saying from Calvin Cluelage who said, what's good  for business is good for America.  That was later changed to what's good for in the 50s.  What's good for GM is good for America.  Essentially, he said, we are good for America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he was saying that the internet is good for America.  And he's making the argument that Google is good for the internet.  You know, he was saying that users can switch search engines, right?  Which is, I think, is a fair point.  You know, here, listening to him discuss some of these tenants that he mentioned, he did  say that Google could be more transparent about the way that they rank sites.  Although he did explain that that's kind of the source of Google's innovation.  That's the secret sauce.  I understand.  But he said they could be a little better.  He talked about the data liberation front, which made me really happy as a nerd.  It was like, oh, that's great.  He said, hey, you know what?  We have this mechanism for users to get their data and switch so they can.  But, you know, thinking about this from the perspective of like Yelp saying, hey, you  know what?  We don't want to be bolstering Google's place pages.  We want to show up in search results, regular plain vanilla search results.  But we don't want to be showing up in things like place pages.  I don't understand why Google doesn't create some sort of mechanisms like a simple robots.txt  thing where the Yelp can say, hey, you know what?  Show us in search results, but don't include us in place pages.  I think they should give companies like that, content companies, a little more control about  where they show up in different Google products.  I feel like that would be a better...  I've got to disagree, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the real answer is that the users say whether Yelp should show up high or low  in a search result, right?  In a search results, right.  Yeah, in search results.  So it's not, you know, one of the senators kind of said something about how companies  ought to have more certainty about where they appear.  No, you don't.  They want more certainty about how many products they sell, too.  But you don't.  Welcome to business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Right now, you can say in your robots.txt, Google, do not index my website.  Right.  So you can opt out of regular search results.  I think that companies, there needs to be shades of...  Companies should be able to say, I want to be able to opt out of just Google places,  for example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they did that.  They did exactly that.  Right.  Yelp said to get us out of...  I mean, granted, it was after an attempt to buy them and they refused and all that.  And I don't know what the rest of the deal was.  But Yelp did say, take us off place pages.  And they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google made that decision to do that.  But...  No, Google said that Yelp asked to go off.  That's what Schmidt said today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  OK.  And then they will remove them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's one issue, which is that users determine the results in the generic, you  know, for everything.  And then there's the other issue of customization.  They have these, you know, filter bubble type customization algorithms where people see different  things.  And this is going to come up in a big way as a defense that Google is going to use and  say, look, everybody is going to get search results that change depending on what people  do and all these 80 something signals or whatever it is.  And you know, ultimately, that's kind of hard to argue with.  It has some privacy implications.  But from a, you know, favoring Google's stuff, if they can demonstrate that individual choices  and actions result in everybody having different search results, it's hard to say that Google  is always favoring its own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Leo, I want to go back to this notion of the media comparison, right?  In search, well, first off, let's say there's no law that says that search has to be unbiased  or fair, right?  What was the original business model for search advertising at Yahoo, which was that you bought  search placement?  Google's innovation was to say that was wrong and we're going to offer something else.  But there's nothing to say that Google couldn't sell a search placement.  The only issue is their credibility with the public.  That's part one.  Part two, Google has features, right?  They have financial stuff and they have maps.  And in any world where you tell them they can't promote their own features, that just  makes no sense to me, right?  But any media company has features that they promote over others.  In fact, media companies in the old days promoted nothing from anyone else.  You bought the product and they never mentioned any competitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think actually Eric's being a little tone deaf.  He says most of the complaints about us come from...  Again.  Yeah.  Oh, as always.  He says most of the complaints come from websites that don't like where their site ranks on  Google's search results.  And I admit that's where complaints from other websites come from.  I think he's misunderstanding the fear that Congress, that this committee has, and the  fear a lot of Americans maybe rightly have that Google is just too powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What does that mean?  Where is the statute that defines...  Well, we give them the power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I understand that because we use them.  And Eric's right nominally that, well, anybody could take over.  But in practicality, I don't think that's the case.  I think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But here's the problem.  It's got to rely on law and principle, right?  I'm just saying that something makes us creeped out because they're too big or too this or  too that.  I think I mentioned last week briefly, I'm reading this magnificent book about the great  A&P.  And there used to be in a place like New York 50 customers to every grocery store.  Along come chains.  Chains have advantages.  Of bulk buying, chains were able to lower prices.  Well, it became a political issue and the Robinson-Petman bill came in and didn't outlaw  chains but made it incredibly difficult for them to operate.  Reach prices for consumers.  And that's what I was hearing today was a little bit of Congress interfering with a  company that hasn't been shown to do anything wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the problem.  This isn't the A&P.  This is a different era.  And unfortunately, there isn't law or precedent because we're in an internet...  By the way, I'm somewhat playing the devil's advocate here.  I just want to make sure that this point...  I see the horns on your head now.  Yes.  I want to make sure this gets represented.  But I do think that we're in a different kind of era where a company...  We've never had a position where a company can control so much of commerce, of information,  simply by the search results that they deliver.  It's really stunning the impact Google has.  And we see that when Google added to its recipe search engine a very simple change about...  I forgot what it was, but it completely changed...  Maybe websites were furious because it changed recipe rankings when you did a search for  recipes.  And it just changed everything by billions of clicks.  And even a little thing that Google does can have such huge impact.  The problem is, I don't think...  I think you're right.  Al Franken doesn't really understand, nor does Congress, nor maybe do any of us what  to do about it.  But I think what we're expressing though is a legitimate concern about the amount of power  that this corporate entity that really...  Let's be honest.  It doesn't have a fiduciary responsibility to anybody, but it's stakeholders who demand  profit who say make the advertising work.  They don't have any real responsibility to the American public, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well here's the thing.  The internet gives somebody that power.  So the question is who gets it?  Who gets the power?  The idea that it could be somehow distributed evenly by law or something like that is a  bit of a stretch.  One of the things that either came up today or is likely to come up soon is, if not Google,  maybe Baidu.  Maybe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be terrifying if a Chinese search...  Now talk about the hearings in Congress.  If a Chinese search engine garnered 65% of the search, I don't know.  I would like to see a thousand search engines bloom.  And I think it's a little disingenuous for Eric to say, well there's Yelp and Expedia  and Amazon.  I mean those aren't search engines and they don't have the same kind of cloud.  And Bing is the only competitor, what is it, 7%?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well he cited Facebook as a very big driver of traffic, sometimes bigger than Google.  So that was interesting.  I mean listen, the person who gets in first and does the best job and has scaled the largest  and has the most data and the most experience, like at this point wins.  And that's really the case in I think a lot of web businesses, because we're in such an  early stage.  I mean the folks who are there first and Google is there first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's why this is difficult, because the American way is you do it better and you  win by doing it better and you become a successful company.  They only have 65% so they're not a traditional monopoly.  And yet I think there is absolutely a legitimate cause for concern at the amount of power they  wield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Microsoft case is really, really instrumental here.  Everybody was afraid that Microsoft would dominate the world with Internet Explorer  and Windows Media Player.  And Microsoft said no, we could be replaced, somebody could come along with a better browser  and everybody.  And that's exactly what happened.  History has shown that Microsoft was right.  And I think it's exactly the same case.  The most likely thing that's going to happen with Google, everything else being equal,  forget about belief in Google or whatever, is that they will fade.  Because this is what companies usually do.  They rise to power and then they fade out.  Google probably won't because they're really, really good, but that's the point.  They're probably not going to stay on top because they are coasting with their, you  know, abusing their monopoly or whatever.  They're probably going to stay on top because they have demonstrated, especially recently,  the ability to reinvent themselves.  And so that's really what it's required.  It's really, really hard for Google to stay on top.  It's not something that happens automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if they do screw up, they do violate our trust, you know, we really can move en masse  to Bing.  It can happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It takes one second for you to start using enough search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the here's this.  This will drive you, Mr. Since you're playing devil, you know, this this will get you going.  When asked a question, Schmidt said, and I quote, I'm not sure Google is a rational company  trying to maximize its own profits.  What is he was arguing that it was also a company that follows the principles you listed  and that that, you know, puts itself up on a pedestal, which, you know, I like trying  to argue that it has principles, but that also sets it up for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would you say that the Google shareholders have the same point of view?  Because really, Google can run itself.  It can have this fantasy about how it runs itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google could have maximized shareholder value.  That's their job.  But they but they but they've not right now.  You can argue with this with the case, but but but as Eric has said in the past, they  They pass up billions and I mean billions of dollars that could go if they use the home  page, for example.  And also it's easy to have principles under this profitable and successful, though.  Exactly right.  Exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd like to see when Google has a has a bad a bad year, how they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could Microsoft have been a more principled company?  You think, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Could Microsoft have been more principled?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.  I don't know.  It's hard to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that Google started.  I mean, it was the very beginning of Google was, you know, don't be evil because there  was there was a sense of what you could do, you know, the power of technology and what  you could do to really screw things up.  And I think that Microsoft was just so early that it just didn't have that in its DNA and  its culture.  So so early on, I think it was everything was just so new.  In both cases, they had.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  In both cases, they were both very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In both cases, they were both run by visionary founders who could overrule everybody and  basically make decisions based on their own values.  And in both cases, they've done that.  The difference is that Bill Gates had different values than the Google founders who actually  have made, as as Jeff pointed out, lots of decisions that don't necessarily blindly  bolster the bottom line of the company or benefit shareholders.  Lots of decisions.  Look what they did in China.  I mean, if you read if you read the in the Plex, there are a lot of examples in there  where where either Sergey or Larry would just overrule something because they don't like  they don't like it. It's counter to their values.  So they're they're optimist.  However, you can't really you know, who knows what's going to happen with eventually the  Google will become an increasingly conventional company.  It has to because it's growing and and and so on.  And so but but I think that's really the only difference is the actual values of these  founders who can just make who can dictate their their their will were different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And as Eric says said once at Aspen, when asked about the classic question, is Google  too big? In fact, I think it was Brian Lehrer from WIC NPR station who asked him the is  Google too big question?  The thing you're asking Leo and his response was, well, who would you rather have run us?  Us or the government?  Right, because that's really the choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. What other choice you got?  And and so I can take off.  I am now going to take off this devil's advocate hat and point out that even if there is  something to be said for the fact that we are legit, I think legitimately afraid of this  power that Google has, there isn't an obvious solution.  And you just brought that point up.  Well, what what do you do?  I mean, I think let me let me propose this.  Would it be a preferable world if there were five search engines each with 20 percent  market share? Would that be preferable?  I think it would be. I mean, I don't know how you make that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but I don't get the question, would it be preferable if if I'm forced to drive five

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  different cars? No, you can pick your search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can now. If I don't like Google, I can live happily on Bing.  Well, why do people pick Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For instance, I just saw a study that took the branding of Bing off and put Google's  branding on on it and at people and switched them and people preferred the Bing search  results if they didn't see the Google.  It was the Google brand. It was very it could very well be that after 10 years of looking  at the Google doodle, we just like the brand better.  That it isn't has nothing to do with the better than Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if your question is, would it be better if there was way better and more competition  in the search engine? Yes, that's absolutely yes.  Absolutely. Yes.  I just as there is in social now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. And I think what Eric Schmidt's trying to do and I think it's somewhat somewhat  disingenuous to say, well, Facebook and Expedia and Yelp are the competition.  Maybe they are. I mean, we've talked certainly about the fact that social and location based  searches are, you know, eating.  Search is not the business anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Search search is is the battle of the past.  Right. I argue that signals is the battle now.  And the battle is between Facebook and Google there.  And if you want to get after Google for monopolistic positioning, I've always said that  where it is not search, it's advertising.  It's it's market share and advertising online.  And that's the case where I've long said that Google is in a position to play God.  And say that, you know, Matt Cutts is God.  And by the way, God's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we like Matt. And that's one of the reasons Google's very smart to push Matt forward.  To give it a face. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And so if if if Google thinks your business is bad and and they can just cut  you off at the knees or above.  And that's that's that's that's the area where I think Google has a potential to not  favor its own stuff necessarily, but to have a power of God that comes from their market  share in advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did Schmidt talk about Bing?  Because I'm looking at the the the compete results of search market share results from  February and Bing powered if you include Yahoo and other Bing powered sites was 30  percent of search Google 65 Bing powered 30 percent and the rest the long tail ask AOL  stuff like that.  That's that 30 percent is a pretty big number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And look how short a time it took to develop.  So Google's gone.  Did Eric mention that?  Because I think that that might have reassured.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I bet.  He didn't mention the word Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  At all. He didn't know no M word past his mouth.  Does that mean he's really most afraid of them?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.  Bing Bing, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, 30 percent's huge out of nowhere.  Yeah.  So maybe we don't have to worry about this.  I certainly don't think a government solution, a government imposed solution is the right  way to go either.  I don't think an antitrust action against Google is the right way.  I by the way, I don't think there's any guarantee that that's not going to happen.  Have you been watching now the cross examine?  Is it still going on?  Are they done?  No, they moved on to Yelp.  They're they're talking to Yelp now.  So what did Al Franken do that everybody's so incensed about?  What did he ask?  Anybody?  He wasn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was he started off saying, let me say first that I heart Google.  You know, I love Google and plays and it's a wonderful thing.  And then he turns around and he was just bumbling.  He just there was no there was no focus to what he was saying.  Basically, what he tried to come around to it.  I was wrong about this in Twitter, but he tried to basically hint at the idea that  because because Android's so big that, you know, can you can you it was it was it was  exactly as Mike was saying, exactly a Microsoft argument.  Can you kill Google places and install Yelp?  And Schmidt kind of said, it's the web.  You can get the either.  Whatever you want.  And so I said that in Twitter and someone said, no, no, no, no.  Places is a subset of the mapping application and Yelp also does have an application.  But the truth is, you can get to both from this thing called the web.  And so he was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was talking about the Google specific apps that come preinstalled with with Android,  right? At that point.  Yeah. Yeah. So here's a good here's a good question from our chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Web 944 says as an analogy, what if a corporation controlled the card catalog at a library?  Would that be a good thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the library doesn't matter.  It probably wouldn't matter because essentially, well, I mean, all things being equal,  because what Google does and this is a distinction that may be too subtle for a lot of people to notice,  average users to notice, but compared to, say, Facebook, Google doesn't filter anything.  They rank things.  And that's an important and powerful capability.  But in the case of, say, Facebook's edge rank, they're actually filtering things, preventing you from seeing things anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so but isn't moving something to the second page isn't ranking something lower.  In effect, it's de facto filtering.  I mean, if something who did that, we did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it is. But getting back to the life of the card catalog would would also have everything.  And in a library, I don't think in this there's some way to rank means everything's ranked alphabetically.  I don't know. I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, specious argument, then we'll throw it out.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you know, the reality is, is that that's not I mean, it's not our it's human nature to just look at the first page of search results.  I mean, you know, everything's alphabetized in the card catalog by letter.  But, you know, I think the filtering distinction is a really good one.  But I don't think you can say, well, users are just too lazy to go to page two to find the thing that's on page two.  And that's crazy.  I realize that we did it.  How many times do we dig?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many I'm just curious, how many times do you dig to page two on the search results?  Never. Very rarely.  Never. And I mean, only if the first page doesn't give you anything at all that you're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, right. I mean, everything everyone sitting here at this table are really good at searching Google.  You know, we understand ands and ors and different kind of filtering mechanisms.  But yeah, you never you never go never go to page two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you know what you're looking for, you'll go through multiple pages.  If I if I'm looking to find out if I'm looking to find out where an old colleague of mine works.  And I don't find him on the first page, then I'll keep going second, third, fourth page.  But if it's something like I want to just find out what happened at the Schmidt hearing today, first link, second link, and I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you also have a brand there.  You may decide you want the Washington Post version of the TechCrunch version over the whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the point, which is that Google's algorithms determine really what you're going to read.  And Jeff, you said, well, no, we did it.  Well, yes and no.  I mean, if Google's algorithms were absolute, I mean, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that you're going to say fair or unbiased or equal, and there's no such thing, right?  There are winners and losers and the big get bigger.  That's true.  The chat room reminds me, too, if you want to know the most biased algorithm you can imagine, it comes from a library, the Dewey Decimal System.  Right. David Weinberger.  Totally biased. I agree.  Or wonderful book called Everything's Miscellaneous.  And I'll get the numbers wrong here, but just by scale that there are, you know, 25 numbers for Christianity and two for Judaism and one for everything else.  Right. Right.  And Mr. Dewey's prejudices.  A little biased. Yeah.  Exactly. And that is inevitable.  That is absolutely inevitable when you make those decisions.  So there is bias.  But the key for Google, I think, in the bias question is if the algorithm doesn't change, right, if it at least treats things equally in the sense of not being worse to this one entity, then you can dislike the algorithm and say it gives you bad results.  But the reason Google works and the reason the big grow bigger is because we like the results.  Yeah, that is our goal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's assume then, is it safe to assume that Google, certainly Google massages the results.  They want to have the results that are going to drive the most traffic.  They're going to make you happiest.  That's their goal.  And so presumably they're operating as a business.  It's in their interest to keep you coming back to Google.  So they want this and they tweak their algorithm in such a way that the search results, the stuff that's at the top of the pages is the stuff that will make you come back.  Safe assumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the paid placements, right?  And the ads, I mean, you know, which are marked, but ad words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think they even let that influence search results?  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  But I'm saying just that the items that show up on the page, the yellow paid placements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to put those aside and just say just search results, because this is really what the issue is, the filter bubble issue in general and the issue of Google's power is in general is do they look, there has to be some algorithm.  There has to be some decisive algorithm.  What is the bias?  And is the bias merely to get you give you the result you will be happiest about getting and come back for more?  And I would say if they're doing their job right.  Yes, that's what there's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a flying ointment, which is this.  As we all know, whenever you use one platform, companies, services, it's a lot easier to use the other ones.  So in my case, I gave up everything for my Google plus diet.  I'm using Google plus for everything.  And suddenly my Chromebook seems a lot more useful.  And suddenly Gmail seems a lot more, you know, and it's and so if Google search, let's let's say I'm not claiming that this is the case, but let's say Google's search results did favor Google features and you did sign up for those features and start using those features.  And then those features start favoring Google search.  It goes back.  So it's a kind of a self.  It could be theoretically a self reinforcing phenomenon that would be unfair.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's where monopoly really that's why monopoly is a problem because monopoly drives you to stay within the monopoly itself is self perpetuating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's a difficult problem because ultimately it's about user choice.  So is the ranking issue, too.  If if if users pick the first thing or they say I'm feeling lucky or whatever, that's a choice.  That's a user choice and using other services as a choice and doing everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that was Microsoft's defense was, you know, well, there's other offices, there's Apple, there's other operating.  That was their defense.  There's other browsers.  You there's always choice.  Even if there's a monopoly, as long as there's even one little tiny other person, as long as it's not a 100 percent monopoly, there's always choice that does not protect you.  And Microsoft was right.  They were right, as it turned out.  Yeah.  But that's that that's always the defense of a monopolist is, well, wait a minute.  You know, you don't have to buy your oil from Standard Oil.  There's other oil companies out there.  That's not in and of itself a defense for any against antitrust action.  But look at how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.  Where's the line?  What's the principle?  What's the remedy?  Right.  Otherwise, you risk doing what I hate in the privacy discussion of just saying, oh, it's creepy without defining what the principle is.  What's the violation and what's the remedy?  So is Google violating?  Is it, you know, is there is just being big is not and should not be illegal in this capitalistic nation.  Being successful is OK.  If we make being successful wrong, whether it's A&P or Google, we're going to be in a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the reason there's antitrust law is it's not the fact that you're successful.  It's the fact that you use, just as Mike was talking about, your success to predispose people to continue your monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that alone isn't isn't the violation is if you use it to smash down competitors.  Right.  So show me and I know I'm sound like a Google fanboy today, but it's my turn.  Show me the smoking gun of what you think Google has done to be unfair.  The one the one I mentioned is when Google unfairly does kill a company that isn't a spam company and uses his power of God to do that.  I will start with there, but I have real trouble saying where Google has unfairly and wrongly used its power to kill worthy competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it not the ultimate intent of antitrust law or of any anti monopoly law just to keep it at 11 level playing field?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As Eric Schmidt said today, the Internet is level playing field.  And I think we accept that.  And if we do, then we have to say case closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, kind of.  I mean, there are two issues here.  One is I think Facebook is the best evidence for Google's argument because Facebook came from nowhere and now they kind of control a huge amount of traffic and links.  And just in the last two years, if Google was the all powerful monopoly that was squashing all the competition, this this Facebook thing would not have become what it has become.  The second problem is this whole algorithm thing.  I don't even think there's a single Google engineer who fully understands the Google algorithms, let alone Congress.  Al Franken doesn't have a prayer of really understanding.  It's way too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And in fact, for this for this to continue and for there to actually be prosecution, they have to demonstrate something even at an even higher level.  They have to demonstrate a conspiracy, an attempt at restraint of trade.  They have to find smoking gun that says, well, Google conspired to keep Facebook out of the search business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Leo, actually.  Yeah, I wish that were the case.  They don't have to do that.  No, not not to hurt Google, not to have an impact, not to change the course of things and make them and put a chill on them.  And there may be a line of business they should go into that they don't just because they fear they're going to get stopped because Congress doesn't like them.  So, no, it's not just about the law.  I came up with this A&P thing, but it became a highly political issue to say that small grocers are good.  Big grocers are bad, even though big grocers save people money.  And I heard similar rhetoric today.  What about the small businesses, small businesses?  And Eric said, we're good for small businesses.  We point we can get to more people as long as the small businesses in the search business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, Google has done the work of scaling to incredible dimensions, right?  And now more companies have that, you know, have the prices and the ability to scale a lot further, a lot faster.  But this is kind of what I was saying earlier when I said first, which was incorrect.  Of course, Google wasn't first, but they've been in this business for so long.  They've been indexing the public web for so long.  They have so much data and so much knowledge and scale and technology.  They've been in it the longest, so they have that advantage.  And yeah, I mean, I think that Facebook is a good example of a company that could come in and be really successful and drive more traffic than Google.  But Facebook is a different innovation than Google.  Facebook is not a search engine, right?  And that's that's at Leo's point, like Facebook innovated in social and Google innovated in search.  And so that there is a big difference there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Search is not the world anymore, right?  The amount of traffic that goes to sites now through social means, through links, proportionally in market share, you know,  forget about about Google for a second and just talk about search versus other means of discovery.  And now, again, we humans and our links in Twitter and Google plus and Facebook are becoming a force that will rival Google, I believe, will rival search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody just pointed out in the chat room, this is a good point.  If you search Google for Bing, the search, the first result is Bing, Microsoft Bing, as it should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a really good point.  I mean, the fact is that Google doesn't want other companies to stop making great content.  Google provides a great service and makes a ton of money because there are tons of websites out there that make great content that they can serve up in their search results.  You know, shutting out other companies is not in their best interest.  I mean, the reality is that Google is going to create all the content, you know, all the great content on the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, that whole page of Bing search results is Bing, except for one thing, which is a Matt Cutts article about Bing.  But in every other respect, everything here is it's about Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. I think I think the problem that's coming, if I if I may just quickly search is becoming right now we think of searches.  You go to Google dot com or Bing dot com and you type in a search query.  But search is going to be, as Eric Schmidt has has has pointed out, is going to become a virtual assistant on your phone where you'll be walking down the street and your phone will beep and it'll say, hey, there's a you know, they're having a sale at the store or, you know, your friend is 300 yards away.  Would you like to meet at this restaurant? You both like Italian food.  It's going to become to the point where when people use it as a virtual assistant, it'll be the equivalent of everybody using the I'm feeling lucky link.  And then it becomes problematic because at that point, Google is just choosing things for you.  And then what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, that's that's that's the filter bubble argument.  Right. That's Eli Perez's argument to some extent.  So you go into.  What's your big grocery store around there?  Safeway.  Safeway. You go into Safeway.  Of course.  Whole Foods.  Excuse me.  You hippie.  So so so let's actually have good examples.  So Whole Foods buy its brand and everything you think they're going to pick the stuff that's good for you.  Right. That's just that's the impression.  And you go walk into the ketchup aisle.  And why is Heinz in a better position than Del Monte?  Why is Del Monte hidden?  Why are they pushing Heinz?  Because they make more money on Heinz.  Well, it's probably because Heinz pays them.  And Heinz pays them for doing this is the way that industry works.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fortunately, that does not happen in search anymore.  Used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Precisely. So what I'm saying is that there is more of an economic filtering going on.  That's true.  In the rest of life.  In your grocery store.  In search or even in that case.  So now back to your point.  So you this was part of the point I think that was fair about a 10 10 listing search page versus a Google map.  And Eric said, well, 10 listing search page doesn't work very well.  You're on a phone.  You're on a phone.  You want to know where am I now?  What's around me?  You want to navigate that.  But that goes right to your point.  The better and better and better that gets, the more it knows you, the more signals you give, the more indeed will  give you something for you.  But it's but but here's the thing.  It's doing it because it thinks it will please you.  As Leo said before, if it doesn't use you, it fails.  So there's still a test there.  Now, if you're ignorant to what else you could have had because there was a business deal.  Yeah, it's a problem.  But that's not the way Google business operates.  Right.  The ads are there by an auction.  And and so the architecture of it solves a lot of the problems.  The problem here is the Senate doesn't understand this architecture to save their lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to I'm going to table this argument.  It's a really good discussion.  I'm really glad, Jeff, that you were there to defend Google.  And I think we attacked and attacked and attacked and you held strong and you held firm.  And I think this this is what I would propose as our conclusion from the panel is can we just get Congress to wait and see if Congress had maybe a waited a little longer on Microsoft.  They would have saw, hey, it's not a problem.  Let's wait and see.  There's no smoking gun yet.  Mike, you're shaking your head.  You think we can't wait?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's all about election year posturing.  It has nothing to do with reality.  They're all just pandering it when that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nobody's going to get nobody is going to get one vote by attacking Google.  I don't think that that's the right way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's going to get a vote?  I think I think here's what you might get a vote in Redmond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bill, I think you live now in the evil part of America.  I live in what used to be the evil part of America.  What?  Think East Coast liberals and all that right now.  It's these scary geeks in tech land who are taking over our lives and somebody has to  watch out for us.  That's what the whole privacy debate is about.  I know that's not a book plug.  It's just a point.  And that's what this is going to be about.  I think one last point, if I may, I think the miracle today that I think Eric Schmidt  got through the whole thing without any Schmidt ism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not sure yet, but we haven't found any Schmidt isms.  Thank God.  Do you think that they were sitting there in Mountain View?  Marissa Meyer, Larry and Sergey holding hands going, please, please, please.  They have a kill button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably.  Dave from it was right behind him.  You could just see him.  His eyes going up, looking nervously.  It was hilarious to see that.  Then there's somebody that some of the fact total on the other side who's just nodding  his head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it says that's the German guy.  Christina Warren in Mashable, 10 quotes from the Google Senate hearing.  Not one bad.  We regret what happened.  That was a mistake that was on the pharmacy, the Canadian pharmacy search results.  Representative Klobuchar, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.  I recently Googled myself on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She also said, she also said Google is an important part of the Internet.  Thanks for the newsflash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Amy.  We have to represent the web how it is and not how we wish it to be.  I like that.  That's why pirated content shows up in search results.  Al Franken.  I love Google.  Al Franken, if you don't know who does, this is about the about the search algorithm.  Eric Schmidt on Yelp.  And ultimately, we bought a company called Zagat to do something similar.  I'm not sure why that's a good quote.  Mike Lee, some of my fears have been confirmed by our conversation.  He was such a bozo.  And I would say again, who gets a vote by attacking Google?  Nobody.  It's like attacking American flag or apple pie.  There's nobody going to get a vote out of anybody for attacking Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that antitrust, even when the attorneys general go after it.  I mean, if you look at the Microsoft case, that was pure grandstanding.  All of those attorneys general had the states did.  You're right. The states did.  Yeah.  Yeah. And Google is a big giant company with a lot of visibility and people are  unemployed and stuff like that.  It's a it's a it's a you know, it's a downtime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can see Elliot Spitzer trying to make some hay on this.  Fortunately, he's busy at CNN.  So, yeah, so I don't know.  Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, comparing Google to a horse race.  You run the racetrack.  You own the racetrack.  You didn't have horses for a while, but now you do.  And your horses seem to be winning.  Al Franken then says Google might be doping.  Google might be doping the horses.  And the end scene curtain and so much for Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, kind of like Sue Sylvester running for Congress on a no artist platform.  I swear to God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There we go. Drinking game.  Big risk here is losing votes, not gaining votes.  There is no I would hope that the Senate would  get a clue and realize that the only risk here is just losing votes.  I don't think I don't think you cannot make hay here by by  raising the creepy bar.  All right, we're to take a break.  There's so much to talk about.  That's just a little teeny weeny bit.  The thin layer of ice on top of first six hour twig.  I know Facebook. My God.  What's going over there?  Google Plus. My God. What's going over there?  The social networks, they're going crazy.  And even that's not all of it.  There's new Android phones.  I brought all these phones.  We're not even going to get to them.  Come on.  Can you just spread the news out as a thin layer of peanut butter throughout the year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought Google Wallet was going to be our top story.  She's who cares?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two cities, one phone, one carrier, Google Wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all relative, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all relative.  Netflix, as you know, is one of our sponsors.  That's there's also a news story because.  So here's what I'm going to do.  I'm going to take save some time by taking the news and put it in the ad.  Perfect multitasking, multitasking.  So, as you know, I got the email.  We all get the email from Reed Hastings saying, what do you say?  I love it when a CEO sends me an email saying I made a big mistake.  It was great.  He said, I blew it.  The pro pricing thing.  We're going to divide Netflix into two pieces.  One piece will be the DVDs by mail.  The other be the streaming.  And, you know, I don't know about you, but that's all we've been talking about  for the last six months, because to me, the streaming is the great deal.  Now, I know a lot of people say, well, you can't get everything on streaming.  But that's to me.  This is fine.  Tens of thousands of movies.  Seven dollars, 99 cents a month.  Every night I go home and I watch some great movie or TV show  on Netflix streaming.  So, you know, I think they made the right decision.  This is this is where the future is.  And if you've got a Roku box, a PlayStation 3, an iPad, an iPhone,  any Android phone now, most of the Android, I think all the Android tablets,  you can watch Netflix for the kids.  Give them a give them a tablet and some kids movies.  And they're good to go.  It's just fantastic.  I am a big fan.  Seven dollars, 99 cents.  You all don't give the kids the kids stays in the picture.  That's not a kids movie.  This is the story.  Oh, I started it.  Let's not watch that movie.  Oh, I love this movie.  It's Robert Evans, the Hollywood mogul.  Sex scandal and movies.  It's a really good documentary if you get a chance to see that.  But 799, this is what you need to remember.  These are your takeaways.  Netflix dot com slash twit.  If you're already a member, throw open the window.  And I want you to yell as loud as you can.  Netflix dot com slash twit.  It's free.  And just that's all you need to do.  And that's it.  So we got a couple of a couple of birds killed with that one stone.  Google Plus, Mike Elgin, you're still a big Google Plus fanatics  and big features added, including I was stunned at the top.  Search Google Plus.  Finally, Google and search.  What do you think of the search, Mike?  Is it is it work for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's it's fantastic.  It's it turns Google Plus into a real it's like Pinocchio.  You know, it's like a real thing now because now you can.  I'm a real boy.  Yes. Yes.  And and you know, you can you can do it.  People are already doing all kinds of stuff.  They're they're saving searches and it's great for discovering new people to follow.  I think there was a it was funny because a couple of days ago,  the big story about Google Plus was that it was a ghost town  and nothing nothing was happening.  And all this stuff hit.  And suddenly, I mean, the activity level is just through the roof.  And a lot of it is search.  People are there's a lot of circling going on out there.  And I think a lot of it has to do with search.  But it's it's fantastic.  And we all know it would happen.  So it's not surprising.  But, you know, here we went we went from having no search at all to having,  I think, significantly better search than Facebook.  I've always been frustrated by Facebook's search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at what you can do now.  So I typed in Eric Schmidt testimony.  You can save it and now becomes part of your sparks.  I don't know if they even still call those sparks, but those are the saved searches here.  That now explains why this was a good idea.  And then, look, you can do everything.  People Google Plus posts or sparks.  You can do best of or most recent, which is very Facebook reminiscent.  This is this is fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is really important.  This is I had lunch and so happens with Bradley Horowitz.  And this was right before it launched.  He went off to the men's room and he came back.  He said, we just launched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He launched from the men's room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he pushed the button.  He pushed the wrong button.  He thought it was the he thought it was flush.  It was lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so, you know, I think that kind of gathering around a topic  in a social atmosphere, yeah, was really important and really powerful.  And then the notion that you're by saving it there, you're now following it.  Right. Yeah.  And so these are I love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't mean to go ahead.  I'm sorry. I love best of because it shows you stuff that your friends said about,  you know, mad men or true blood or whatever you're searching for,  which is really cool. That's definitely my favorite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the best of is how does it judge by the number of pluses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's people that you're friends with or people that's people who are in your circles.  And I think they probably use number of plus ones and comments and things.  But it's a good really good results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an illegal use of Google's power to manipulate your brain.  That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, see, and this is the disconnect because we love this.  Google wants to give us something we love.  And yes, absolutely.  By doing so, they build market share.  So there's a problem right there.  Save us, Al Franken. Save us.  This is exciting. So that's feature one.  They've added search.  They've also redone Hangouts.  In fact, one of the features that's great about the new Hangouts is you can broadcast them.  So Hangouts have been limited to nine people.  But now when you do a Hangout, you can also tell people they can watch it.  As many people. Is there a limit on the number of people can watch a Hangout?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One hundred and fifty thousand.  OK, well, there you go.  And it occurred to me that if I if Leo, if I if I had now that I have this,  all I need is your talent, your experience, your staff, your studio.  And I could give you a run for your money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but as a broadcaster. Absolutely.  This is a very interesting.  In fact, I want to use this somehow because I think this is a very interesting opportunity.  Why don't we do the show on it next week?  I think I think we should.  And I've been wanting to talk to you guys before I decided to do that.  But so what we would do is we would have we create a hang out with us  and we maybe even could bring other people into that Hangout  and then people could also watch it live streaming.  I mean, yeah, let's do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty nice. I asked Bradley, could we do quick on this?  He said, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. I mean, what is the advantage?  This is streaming it on this instead of, you know, you stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's here's the funny thing.  Depends on who's talking.  So Eileen doesn't have to switch.  You lose the switching power.  Sorry, Eileen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, actually, I think we believe it or not.  I think what we would do is we would feed the video not from a camera on a laptop.  We'd feed the video from our own video stream that we are switching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I've done a couple of broadcast hangouts.  This is before they announced this feature through YouTube and Mike  Michael Mozart.  And it's really kind of an interesting thing.  It's it's not elegant and professional like like like this show is,  but it's because you don't control it.  And sometimes it gets stuck on a person or whatever.  But it's it's really it's really going to be great  because what you can do is the second this thing starts, you get a link.  And now you can take that link.  And it's when we did it, it spread throughout Google Plus like a virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we got lots of, oh, I think what we will do is we will switch it.  We will lock it on our feed and we will switch it so that you will get the main feed  will be switched exactly as professionally as we switch now.  But then we will have nine viewers in there that we can then switch to  to get their commentary or maybe additional people in there that we can switch to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the idea.  Like, I think you have a Greek chorus, a Greek chorus.  Right. And I've long many years ago, I tried to get TV people  interested in the idea of having a TV show, which was a wall of monitors  with people on them out there with WebCamp. Right.  And, you know, before Twitter having that's this  what they're saying to you in fan hangouts.  So and then you have the master, which is you standing at the wall,  you know, saying, now we're going to hear from Gina.  And now we're going to hear from so and so and we're going to hear from so and so.  And you keep a conversation going.  And it's like the unconference of the virtual unconference. Right.  It's it's I think I think that's where  plus could be really interesting.  You could have we have the back channel now in chat.  It's hard to imagine a video with audio back channel  because no one will listen to us anymore.  But you could have the opportunity for somebody to have a good opinion  and base an audience member in chat could say everybody could say, hey, let  I'm just picking somebody at random here.  Patterson and Patterson saying great stuff in the thing.  OK, Patterson, get on. You can come in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I love about it?  Purely from a purely selfish point of view.  One of the great risks of this business that I created called  Twitter is that we rely on the kindness of strangers, of these streaming operators  to give us free bandwidth for the video streams.  And that's just in TV.  You stream bit gravity.  We try to get on YouTube Live. They said no.  But but well, it's complicated.  They don't want to. And we couldn't have any ads.  Oh, so they said, yes, you could do it, but but you can't make any money  at it or something. I don't understand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, Congress, I think that's restrained trade.  Sorry. Actually, you know, it is actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Eileen, could you call Senator Franken and let's talk?  But if they all pulled the plug, I could use this.  Yeah. And we could stream and we could be exactly the same.  I want to try that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe. Will this allow ads?  Is this is this, you know, like you can't have a business site  are they going to try to come in and say, oh, we think we just saw an ad.  Would you ask Bradley?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I put an ad in there?  The reason the YouTube Live doesn't want ads is because they want to monetize  with their own ads. They don't want your ads in there.  They want other people.  They're not going to monetize hangouts, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I could be wrong if he's to become big.  Mike, you're right. If you could do a whole show here,  if you could do your own mini Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, anybody can. And that's really to me, frankly, it's not about me.  It's about you, Mike, and anybody else who wants to do this.  And actually, I'm terrified because, frankly, it gives everybody  the opportunity to basically be a broadcaster, have a broadcast network.  By the way, there is a new extras feature that you have to turn on  by clicking that gives you named hangouts, shared notes and sketchpad,  Google Docs integration and screen sharing.  This goes right against Cisco and Citrix and all the other folks  who are doing online meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is really cool.  As someone who works at home and often has to use corporate  teleconferencing software, I'm very, very excited about this.  I'm excited about this also from just an educational perspective  to be able to do.  You know, I interact with my developers, I do a code review  and have to kind of do, you know, do demos and show off how to do this,  that other thing and screen sharing and Google Docs integration.  I mean, this is really like what wave, you know, the waves vision,  but actually grockable with, you know, very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you do wave style stuff in here?  I mean, it seems like some of the way I saw some of the wave, wave, wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, when you when you combine the chat of the hangout  and Google Docs live editing, then basically, yeah. Yeah.  You've got wave.  But what's cool about Hangouts is that you've got all these different  experiences that you can have in real time.  And that was waves vision.  You know, we've had these gadgets and you can have polls and games.  But I feel like Hangouts and plus has just has just framed it  in a way that's really understandable.  And I said, hey, look, you can watch YouTube videos together.  OK, you got that. All right, cool.  So you can, you know, edit docs together.  You can share screens. You can doodle together.  You can game together.  And now they open up the Hangouts API so that and actually they call them gadgets.  When if you make an app that you can load inside a hangout,  it's called a gadget, which made me think of wave and lets you  like generate a shared state in your app so that people in the hangout can  can can interact with that with your app and that it's broadcast  in the same state to everyone.  So I haven't had a chance to play with the Hangouts API, but looks really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there is an API for it. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Hangouts, the Hangouts API.  So the Google plus API came out right after we aired our show last week.  Yeah, right. Yes. The weekend working with I built a plug in for ThinkUp  and super easy is just Jason. Really simple.  I mean, the plus API is very limited right now.  It's just public posts and you can't get comments.  You can only get common counts and plus ones.  But then the Hangouts API lets you create this sort of collaborative app  where, you know, it maintains state and it plugs into the Hangouts window.  And you can and you can.  So I haven't actually had a chance to play with any of the  the Hangouts apps, which are more like collaboration, whereas the plus  the plus API is more like getting content out of plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's people showing up.  I don't know what to do with them, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to take a party if people come.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Draw a sketch. Draw a sketch.  Yeah, yeah. Doodles, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can hear you. Is that Shirley?  Hi, Shirley. Nice to meet you.  Just should tell everybody who's joining us now that you're on a live  streaming broadcast from the Twitter network as we demonstrate these Hangouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good. Now I can plug my Google Plus account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all about that.  Look, I could draw a picture.  Let me draw a picture.  Oh, there's a line and there's a line.  That's cool. This is neat.  So this is a little this is for drawing.  You could share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Famous Hangouts with extras, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is my first time.  What do you tell me about it, Stephen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hate the the blackness underneath the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't like the blackness. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, I think it's because they're trying to do it for businesses.  If you're trying to share a document, that's why it's long ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love that. Yeah. Google Docs integration.  They should have done that since day one.  So I do like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, and oh snap. Snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, well, it was a lot of fun while it lasted.  A sad folder.  Sad folder. A sad folder.  What else? So API and you think this is now the API is not very complete right now.  This is a very simple part API, but you were able to build something for ThinkUp already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was you can authorize your account and then start pulling your pulling your posts.  And so I just think up now charts your posts, your plus ones and replies over time.  So so yeah, it was really it was day and a half of just hacking  with a couple of other developers and IRC is very easy to implement, but very limited.  So I'm assuming that it's going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What other features would you like to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I want to I want to get back comments.  I want to say I want to do things that make up like color,  the comments that are from people in my circles, color, the comments  that are from people in my inner circle, you know, that kind of thing.  Just kind of conversation analysis type of thing.  You know, and think of we do word frequency analysis on a particular thread.  I would like to do that kind of thing with in with the Google Plus stuff,  you know, ranking comments by a number of plus ones.  You can have kind of a mini dig, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The power of this is going to just explode as people take the API  and take it to the next level and create custom Google Plus  clients, both on the web and on mobile and mobile to mobile is a really important part of this.  I mean, think about what how how third party clients made Twitter happen.  Google Plus is already to that point now add third party.  It's mind boggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think about it with mobile.  And I've done this before.  I thought the wave was going to change journalism forever.  But so did we all, Jeff.  So if you're at a news event,  being able to show people online and then have that passed around  of what you're seeing, that's that's very common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We also should mention that Google Plus went public a couple of days ago.  You no longer need an invitation.  And boy, I think, you know, forget the ghost town comment.  Just look at this graph of my Google Plus circling.  It just boom boom.  But bang, three thousand new followers.  Yes, you're also on the list, right?  I am on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're all three of you are on the list.  And I was recently removed for some reason.  So I'm not on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you are now. I'm back.  They've updated. Yeah, both Gina and Jeff are now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But not Mike Elgin.  There wasn't enough room for you and Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at Tom Anderson, who was hovering at one hundred  twenty eight thousand for the longest time, and people found out about him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boom. But, Gina, you're in news and technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thousand. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're making this stuff up as they go along.  That's funny.  Can you get Franken back on the line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Reportedly, they're going to they're going to come out with an alternative  to the the the recommended the suggested user list that's going to  be related to search.  They're going to build a search tool where you can say, well,  I'm interested in this stuff and it'll give you some people  instead of just this list that's awkwardly categorized and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, for those for those who say Google Plus is a ghost town,  just look at this.  I had a hangout, which we closed because it crashed 98 comments already.  What is it? Five minutes.  Yeah, look at them go by.  Yeah. So it's this is I think far from

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  speaking of ghost town.  And I asked Bradley, though, I said I sensed that  the activity level, the scoble problem is far reduced.  I said, I presume you've been tweaking with that.  And he said, yeah, you know, there was there are two problems, right?  Either it was crickets or it was overload overload.  And they're trying to find that kind of happy medium.  Now, on the other hand, I know we're not going to Facebook yet,  but with Facebook, subscribe one post I put up on Facebook that was  and you can only you can only comment on things that are put on Facebook,  not things imported from Twitter.  And suddenly I got more comments on that one post than I've ever gotten on Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, huge amount of traffic on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's you know, I'm seeing both go up in their level of interactivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That, by the way, is what Kevin Rose also observed.  But I pointed out that it also depends on the audience.  I suspect there will be posts that will do better on Google Plus  than would do on Facebook and vice versa.  So I'm not sure that's a there's a good way to measure engagement.  Google Facebook has made.  So have we got all the changes on Google Plus?  I think we have.  Facebook has made some considerable changes and more coming tomorrow.  I should point out we will be going live nine thirty tomorrow morning,  Pacific, twelve thirty Eastern to cover live the streaming and F8 announcements.  Tom and I will be here.  In fact, if you guys want to join, please feel free if you're around.  I'd love to get your commentaries.  But I don't know what they're going to announce tomorrow  because they made some massive changes over the last couple of days.  The subscribe button was just the beginning.  They completely redesigned the newsfeed.  This is the new newsfeed where you get these little blue corners for top stories.  You get on the right a live scrolling update of what's going on.  You know, remember last week, I avert that maybe Facebook had gotten too busy,  too complicated for the core audience that it's trying to serve.  It looks more like Google Plus than ever before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Google Plus on the on the left and Twitter on the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The difference is that well, but it's not Twitter on the right  because this isn't chronological.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's and it's and it's heavily filtered.  It's heavily filtered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's what's you can still get all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if you can do that in one feature.  You can select each individual user and say, I want everything from this person,  whether you can do that for all people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they've totally deprecated.  You know, there's no status box.  You actually have to click a button to get the status box.  Yeah, or or this new thing of asking a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mashable did a survey and found that they said, you know, they asked, love it  or hate it and 70 something hated it in 12 percent.  Isn't that always the case?  But exactly, it's a lot of this is just Valentine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think this is not the audience they should be talking about  because the Mashable audience is people like us.  I wonder, to be honest, what the real we talked about this last week.  I just think that Facebook is losing its way.  They are going my space on us.  And I just I fully believe that that they they are going to alienate  their core audience who want simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's what I fear the problem is, they succeeded in getting Grandma  and cousin Elmer and everybody.  And now that's that's their best feature and also their biggest problem,  because people just want to share photos and get the gossip  and interact with their relatives and friends from high school and stuff like that.  That's pretty much all Facebook people want.  When you try to start a conversation on Facebook about Facebook,  nobody wants to talk about it.  They don't care about Facebook on Google Plus.  You want to talk.  That's people love talking about Google Plus because they're enthusiastic  about the platform.  Facebook users not enthusiastic about Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is good.  They're real people. Yes.  Yeah. And like, look at us.  We're talking to tool for them.  And the problem is, is if you got a hammer that every three weeks  changed how it worked.  It's like, well, I hate that.  Just give me a freaking hammer.  And I just I have to think that this is going to only annoy their core audience.  The reason that it hasn't killed them is there's nowhere else to go.  And they're not going to go to Google Plus because that's that's  people who like Google Plus will like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I'm concerned about the media platform  aspects that are coming tomorrow and in the near future, where  people are going to be listening and streaming music and TV shows.  They're going to add in addition to the like button,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they're going to have a reading and watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I mean, I don't think people want people want to.  Some people want to share, but no, I don't think people want to be shared with.  I don't want my my my stream to be filled with what people are listening to.  You know, but I don't think anybody wants that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I agree with you.  But I think Facebook, what they're both struggling with  is giving you control on various levels, right, control of what you publish  and who sees it and control of what you see.  Yeah. And trying to make that more immediate to the act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love it because right now Facebook is suggesting I subscribe to  Eduardo Saverin and Sean Parker.  How did they know?  And the Winklevi, no Winklevi, but Chris Cox, Vice President of Product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what's the saying?  Watch them get into a fight.  This is bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is who they're saying I should subscribe to.  The two two early founders of Facebook and two current executives at Facebook.  Bizarre.  Oh, but you're you're an edge case.  By the way, I am proud to say that Facebook does not consider me a journalist.  I did not make it onto the list of 50 journalists who are  subscribable on Facebook, and I didn't either.  Yeah, but some interesting people did.  I'm not confused. I can't even find that list.  Yeah. Well, it's not even Arrington.  I don't mind. I think Arrington's legit.  It was a very strange list.  And I'm hurt because maybe Facebook doesn't know I have some people  who actually follow me.  All right. Moving on.  Anything else to say about Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, so tomorrow tomorrow, we'll see.  We expect media stuff, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. A study says, I don't know if this is your number.  I won't say it. The Facebook's created quite a few jobs.  Is that your number, Jeff?  Oh, no.  Facebook has created, according to a study,  182,000 jobs by their platform.  The app economy.  That's kind of what Eric Schmidt was saying.  The Internet creates jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is what confuses people because, well, number one, it doesn't.  My argument that that technology leads to efficiency overgrowth now  says that, you know, Google at its height  has a fraction of the employment the GM had.  And that will always be the case. That's the issue.  But it does create when you're a platform, you do create entrepreneurial  opportunities atop you and networks atop you.  And that's what's happening with Facebook and and Google.  And it's a good thing.  That's what we should be looking.  That's why we should be supporting their efforts to create jobs,  which was part of Eric's point today, rather than saying, oh, my God,  they're too big. You start cutting them down.  You also cut away jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they but and that's true.  And Google and Facebook are good from the job creation point of view.  But these numbers are completely meaningless.  Number one, I don't think all these people would be unemployed without Facebook.  Number two, we don't know how many people have been put out of work  because of Facebook. I mean, it's just it's just a number that it's just out of context.  And we have to we need more data before we can understand this.  Well, you're not going to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder how this this number compares to  Apple, you know, Apple's applicant app platform. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the computer, the Internet, the computer, all of it.  That's all it's good. It's good.  Makes. Hey, here's some data.  This is a video from Foursquare, which had one billion check ins.  This is one week of check ins on Foursquare.  Talk about big data here. I love these kinds of things.  Yeah. And the bars.  Oh, I don't know what it is, but I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look at the bars are arts and entertainment colleges and universities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Food is yellow or green.  Or the Mississippi sure is a line, isn't it?  Yeah, it's really going on there. Wow. Look at that.  It's just, it's just cuts right there.  You can't check into the muddy Mississippi nightlife.  Oh, look at Sao Paulo going crazy, crazy, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the coolest thing news about a Foursquare is that they now enable you  to check in at home without revealing the address. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you could turn that dress. Oh, that's smart.  It's interesting because I think at first they didn't want you to check in at home.  You know, it was like, yeah, this should be a business.  But now they realize everybody checks in at home.  And in fact, it's kind of muddling their their results,  because now when I go, I see in addition to five businesses,  30 homes and there's going to be a problem down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, at least it's a funny thing is what happens when the milkman  becomes the mayor of your home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, hey, I'm not the mayor of my own home.  Actually, somebody at O'Reilly Media started checking in at my house.  I don't know why.  And the other thing that happens is the Balkanization of businesses.  We have like four or five check ins inside Twit right here already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm the mayor of Master Control. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eileen Rivera, our producer, is in fact the mayor of Master Control,  as she ought to be.  It's time now for our tip, our number and our tool of the week.  Mike Elegant, chime in if you have anything to say in that.  But I just hope I'm not the tool of the week.  You are not the. Hey, that's a good idea.  Maybe we should rename the tool of the week. All right.  I'll get I'll have a tool of the week in a moment.  But first, Gina's tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, we kind of covered all of all the best tips are to go to Google Plus.  Sign up. It's open now.  Try search and try Hangouts and that those the collaborative apps inside Hangouts.  But while doing other tips, we covered that already.  YouTube has a new video editor built in and I haven't had a chance to try it out yet,  but it's got quite a few options.  If you're logged in, you're looking at your videos, you click an edit video link.  You can rotate your video.  You can remove shaky camera motions, just contrast and saturation, color temperature.  You can add effects right, you know, right in on YouTube dot com.  And there's a there's a video demo I linked in the show notes there.  So there's another apparently there's another video editor  that they already had that let you mix Creative Commons videos from other users  into your video. So this is this is a this is a new this is a new video editor.  That lets you put in effects and and and and calm down the Blair Witch effect.  So check that out in your log into YouTube and go to just your videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Look at that. Very cool. Yeah, there you go.  Stabilize. That's nice. Yeah, stabilize is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish the thing is the people getting their cameras and their phones  90 degrees the wrong way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we'll fix that rotating that by itself is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My students used to do that in the early days here at the journalism school.  And we had to find all these apps to find and turn their precious video around.  That shit everything in portrait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, this is cool. You even have a Lomo button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's really cool. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that is neat.  Our number of the week, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, considering all the Google talk, I thought I'd go with this one.  The com score came out with its top websites.  And of course, this is a bit of a red herring because Google makes its money  all over the whole web.  And and it's not really a website.  But in terms of the fears about their size,  just looking only at that number of unique users,  Google is number one at one hundred eighty three.  Yahoo is still amazingly to be number two at one seventy seven.  And I don't know. I've been Yahoo in 10 years.  Microsoft one seventy seven.  I still have been a Microsoft sites.  Facebook, one sixty two, AOL one oh nine and Amazon one oh one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  million people. And my that's amazing.  Look at that. And I like how it's like on Tractor Feed.  That's good.  I think this is the modern day.  You don't actually have to use dashes for lines separating  the items on your.  What the hell is that?  It's like they typed it.  That is funny.  Dot matrix printer. It's very retro.  Well, there's going to be a new you know, there's the eight bit trend.  Now they're going to have the dot matrix trend.  All pronounced are going to look like that.  I'm inspired by Mike Elligan.  I'm going to make my tool of the week, not in fact a software tool,  but I'm going to need the Hewlett Packard board as our tools of the week this year.  Not only have they taken a great company and run it to the ground today,  news comes out that the board is considering  replacing their CEO Leo Apotheker with Meg Whitman.  So I'll tell you  if you thought it couldn't get any worse at Hewlett Packard.  It might.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there's such a book in that.  Yeah.  And on top of everything else, yesterday I was screaming at my fax machine,  making me align print things when I'm not printing.  I'm just faxing. I don't need this.  I hate I want fax machines to die.  I want printer drivers to die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're here.  Here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm concerned about is that I mean, whether Meg Whitman ends up  being the governor of HP or not is is one question,  but they're obviously getting rid of the current guy.  And he's he's the one probably who's so anti web OS and anti.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He engineered all the changes last week.  Yeah, he bought he was buying the company in Britain  because it's the same business he is in.  He used to do.  I mean, this is if you get rid of him, it's like you said, let's go this way.  No, let's go that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but when they get rid of him and the new people come in,  I think there's a really good chance they're going to say,  you know what, this whole web web OS thing is pretty great.  We should bring it back.  So maybe it's our best bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, quiz, which company has the worst board, Yahoo or Hewlett-Baker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, maybe they should just swap boards.  Nobody would notice.  It's a doofus in for doofus number one, doofus number two.  Meg Whitman, of course, the former eBay CEO, who so so famously bought Skype  without getting the key technology that made Skype possible.  And now we are done.  Thank you so much for being here, Mike Elgin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff, why did you put toilet man on the cover of your book?  And of course, Gina Trippani, who is at SmarterWear.org  and a creator of the ThinkUp app at ThinkUpApp.com.  Is there any way that I mean, I'm on ThinkUp,  but is there any way that people can, you know, get in, get it somehow  besides running their own server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, we actually we have an Amazon AMI launcher where you  I mean, it's still kind of geeky, but you copy your your Amazon EC2 key  into a web form and you hit one button and it spins up the server and installs  it and it totally it works great.  It doesn't auto update yet.  So we're still in beta.  So things are still a little once we have the one to release,  you'll be able to hit one button, launch on Amazon EC2,  have a full instance running with auto updates.  And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how much would that cost for somebody who just wanted to do that,  to have an EC2 instance running?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think EC2 has a deal with the micro instances now where it's free for a few  months, a couple of few months.  But then it's like, I don't know, 15 bucks a month or something.  It would be it's the equivalent of a cheap web hosting plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Join Barack Obama, Steve Martin and Leo Laporte.  Have your own think up account today.  Yes. I'm actually running on Gina's server.  I tried to set up a server. It was too hard for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it was you were missing a module.  Pio, silly PHP module.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And my our my sys admins quite wisely will no longer let me do anything  like install PHP modules on the server.  So I just had to say, OK, thank you, Gina.  Thank you, Jeff.
