When we talk about Google and all the Googleverse and the Facebook and the Twitter, we got the old gang back together.  I'm so happy to see Gina Turpani in her offices. Hi Gina. Hi. Nice to be here.  I saw you yesterday and all about Android looking at that one plus one phone that Jason had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dang, that is a nice looking phone. I don't know. I really was like, I like seeing Cyan and Jemad on the back of a phone.  Isn't that kind of cool? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It made me really happy. I was like, oh, hackers legitimize that. I want that phone.  I think that's one of the few non pure Google phones, technically non pure Google phones that I really want.  It's a great price. Unbelievable. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Also here, Jeff Jarvis. That's him. You hear that baritone. That's JJ. He's a professor.  Bosso Profundo. I'm sorry. The Bosso Profundo of Jeffrey Jarvis.  Look at him. He's a professor of journalism at a university, City University of New York.  The author, he's a published author of Public Parts and What Would Google Do and Gutenberg the Geek, blogs at Buzz Machine.  Actually, your latest post will be fodder for today's conversation. Also with us, good to have him, Mr. Kevin Marks in his garden. Hi, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice to see you. I actually even have a bonus juice for my treat to drink today. Oh, that looks delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you are so obnoxious, Marks. You're outside. You have the breeze, the good weather.  It is a bit warm. I've got so much ice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is how my mom got us to move to California from Rhode Island.  She said you can go out on the porch and pick an orange from the tree.  Oh, freaking California. Little did I know that's that's how they got the Joads to move from Oklahoma and grapes of wrath.  Didn't work out so well. I miss it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I miss the weather and picking oranges off the trees. I have to admit, I really do.  What's the weather in Brooklyn? Well, you know, the temperature, you look at the temperature, it's fine.  It's just if you walk two blocks and you're like instantly soaked and then you're getting on the subway and like surrounded by smelly people.  Like it's just it's just a different lifestyle. It's just a different way of life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My office is right on Times Square and I had lunch the other side of Times Square and trying, you know, I always said San Francisco was brilliant because there are two San Francisco's the San Francisco, the tourist sea is the one the residents never go to.  Folks, no San Francisco ever goes to Fisherman's Wharf or Jerry.  Of course not. They don't ride the cable car. Right. So it's a separate city just for the tourists.  Just for the tourists. Kind of brilliant. New York now has a separate city. It's called Times Square.  No New Yorker walks through Times Square and hugs a Guatemalan refugee in an Elmo suit.  No New Yorker, you know, except that one lady.  Yeah, or the naked cowboy.  No, you're right. That's the only one right. No, New Yorker does any of that. But I had to actually walk through it today and it's torture.  It's torture. We don't go to Bubba Gump's shrimp.  Oh, any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's true.  McDonald's day, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, we have in the in studio with us today, Ranger Craig. He's the Ranger at Alcatraz.  One of the Rangers and Craig do a lot of locals visit Alcatraz or is it mostly out of towners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When they have someone from out of town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If they're there, they're towing somebody from out of town along with them.  He's been I've been of course to Alcatraz, which is a wonderful tour, highly recommended.  But Craig has always said, you know, come for this. I'll give you a special behind the scenes tour.  And I keep meaning to drag the kids there. And so I just never have gotten around to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think we should try to do the show from there.  One of the cells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't they let you in there a night tour where they let you kind of spend some time like extended time in the cells?  Is there a tour? There is a night tour. Yeah, I don't know.  Anyway, enough of that. Let's talk about this.  The first phone with the word cyanogen on the back.  This is the one plus one, the phone you cannot get from one plus.  They just put five thousand more invites on out.  I don't what do you say? What's your speculation, Gina?  Maybe you guys have talked about this on all about Android.  This is, you know, they call it the the the what do they call it?  The killer, the high end phone killer.  But it's three hundred bucks, three hundred fifty bucks for the sixty four gig version, which this one is, I think.  And it has all the all the specs of a high end phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this has a shot of becoming the new Nexus.  And when I say Nexus, I mean the phone of choice for power users who want the kind of pure experience with a few extra settings.  Right. Like cyanogen is is is is basically like stock plus a little extras, but no crappy extras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. And you still somehow and I don't really understand this. Maybe you can explain it.  You still get Google services. There's the Google apps are on your Play Store is on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they clearly got Google certification.  Right. Because Google doesn't let any phone carry the Play Store or any of the proprietary Google apps unless they're they're Google certified.  And with that agreement, I don't think all the terms of that agreement have been disclosed, but there's certain home screen placement and that kind of thing.  Right. So you're not dealing with an alternate app store. You get the Play Store and all that stuff.  But it's cyanogen. And I mean, the phone itself is actually it's pretty it's gimmick free.  I mean, it's a pretty straightforward phone. There aren't 17 front facing infrared cameras.  There's no scrolling on the back. There's no crazy. I mean, it's just a it's just a flat phone, but it's it's a high end phone.  It's a beautiful phone and it's it's sleek and it doesn't have a lot of extra crap where and it's pretty pretty plain looking.  But the geeks will love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not like the Nexus 5, isn't it? It basically looks like a Nexus 5, but it's it's bigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's five and a half inches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it has that silver ring. The back feels good.  Right. I mean, in the cyanogen branding, I think it's powerful for for Android hackers and nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, what we could what I don't know and I don't know if Jason knows this yet.  Is the bootloader unlocked on this? Is it unlocked? You know, yet, Jason?  He's not there. He says he's pretty sure it is.  But so it's kind of it's hard to figure out exact.  You know, can you mind if I put it in recovery mode?  Jason, let me let me let me try rebooting it because as it reboot into clockwork mod or or Torp or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, Gina, for for I'm not saying that this is ever going to be a big problem with regular consumers.  But if a regular consumer happens to pick one up and get it, are they going to be befuddled by any of this?  Or to them, it looks like an Android phone that just happens to be different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The bootloader is not unlocked, but unlockable, says Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, so it has a straightforward Android phone, you know, that that I think will be pretty self-explanatory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The issue is you can't get it. You have to you know, you have to get an invite or so. It's weird.  Right now, I can find a few places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Expanse US apparently has it right. And so does Panda will.  And then also, yeah, I found a few places at a premium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So what sounds like I don't know how much the availability is.  It sounds like they're somehow getting it from somebody who got an invite maybe and reselling it.  I don't know. How does it look to be any reputable places yet?  All right. Well, expansive is reputable.  But I, by the way, don't see it on expansive's front page. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The scarcity is certainly working their favor.  It's a marketing. It's a marketing thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Would you get this over the G?  Oh, yeah, it's been available like in onesies, twosies. I can't figure it out.  Are they is there some some constraint on manufacturer or is it all marketing?  It's all marketing, isn't it?  And yet at some point, you've got to open up the pipes.  There's no point in great marketing if you're not going to sell millions of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm not sure.  Maybe a wrap up thing as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe they're hand making them one by one in a small sweatshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sianogen in the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they may have a process that's not completely perfect yet and they're still debugging it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But let me say this. If you put out this exact phone, which Oppo may have, because I think the Find 7 is the same phone.  If you put this exact phone out without any of the marketing hype and you just put it in the market with all the other flagship phones, does it does it stand out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess price wise, it sounds like price wise because it's like the other ones, but it's it's a lot cheaper.  So half the price of the Samsung flagships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The market price on eBay is running four hundred fifty bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even then, it's still a great deal. It's one hundred fifty dollars, two hundred dollars less than a comparable flagship phone.  I love seeing the Sianogen Monda logo on it when you're booting it up.  Now, this is of course we anybody's rooted in and phone and put on custom firmware is used to this, but it's still it's kind of cool to see it on a phone.  And Sianogen stands to make some money because they're selling themes.  So you can customize this with the Sianogen themes.  It feels very much how are they selling those themes? Are those themes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're not in the place. There's an app called Themes Showcase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Gotcha. And they're typically a buck.  Well, wait a minute, not here's a buck ninety nine. Here's two dollars, twenty three cents.  Here's three dollars. Maybe it's third parties that are selling this and maybe there's a sign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I had to quit the Nexus five, Nexus seven Google Plus group is all people did was say, look at my theme.  I know. So boring. Oh, it's so boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And when they say theme, they show the lock screen. Yeah.  Often with a scantily clad woman on it and and icons that are look good, but you could never use.  Yeah. It's like, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, this is probably when I get on the show. So now I'm ready to go buy this phone somewhere.  No, no, stop. The show. Stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because the Moto X plus one someday soon, they said summer.  That gives them till a couple of months.  The LG G3, a lot of people raving over this phone.  It's got some it's the first ultra HD phone.  I said six are we.  That's a good question. Are we going to see a Nexus six in the next in some time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, our dear friend, Matt Cutts and others said, don't don't don't despair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Nexus line. Yeah, but that didn't mean we're going to make one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's worrying because my son just bought a Nexus five like yesterday.  So he's going to be grumpy with me. I see no evidence that there's a Nexus six.  I don't know. His previous phone was a Galaxy Nexus, which was three years old.  So he's actually very happy with his phone.  Yeah, if they if they come up with a better one tomorrow, he'll be cross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, I have to say, if this were in widespread society, if the one plus one  were in widespread distribution, easy to get, you could walk into a phone store.  This is the replacement for the Nexus five. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's the same. It looks like a Nexus five is that bit cheaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's cheaper and better screen.  What's its storage?  64 gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's twice the storage. OK. Yeah. Then that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For three. When it comes time for an update.  Right. Regular consumer buys the phone. It works. It's Android.  How does it get updated? Is it an automatic update or they have to go through?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They've promised automatic updates.  They've promised that within a few months of the L release that they will have L for it.  A few months. OK. What release means, I would guess, and and Gina's going to correct me on this,  but release means when the source code for L is released, not when L is released,  because then they can't get to work on that until the source is released.  Which is what is the lag been running?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We don't know. It's been so long since we've had a major release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's usually after they actually release it at the point where it's it's available to the public.  Then they release the source. That's the usual model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. There's the Google consumer release. There's the AOSP release.  And then there's Cyanogen's release of their software on the OSP. Right.  So there's going to be a little bit of lag.  But I imagine that the moment that the Cyanogen has been updated for L, this phone will get the updates. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that was the other thing with my son buying a new Nexus 5 was that it then said there's a software update.  There's a software update. It basically made him run three software updates in a row to get up to 444.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's frustrating. It's like Windows all over again. Yeah.  Badly done. Service pack 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like make all the diffs Google. It's not that hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I have to say, though, there's only one phone that allows you to get a digital tattoo to unlock the phone.  This is so weird. It's a tattoo, temporary, admittedly, that you put on your skin.  They say it lasts five days. You unlock your phone, your Moto X only by tapping it to your flesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wait, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we sure this isn't a real you can buy it now? Pack a 10. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From Viva Link Magnetic. What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's an NFC tag in a it's really it's a sticker.  OK. And Motorola has done this for a while. So they've had the clip.  That's the clip. And if you buy a set of these stickers, which I have all over the place, but there's the tattoo and it looks cool.  It's a sticker. It's a sticker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what a tattoo is a wart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a wart. I'm waiting for them to inject something subcutaneously that will let me unlock my phone.  Prove your identity. It's really just an NFC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was the science fiction movie where you had the port in your in your wrist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there were a couple of those. Wasn't there the one where Logan's Run where you had a little dot that would tell you.  But then there was more recently one that actually would give you a countdown.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there was Existence where there was like a port in the back of your neck and then insects went in and out.  That was that was that doesn't sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't want insects in my port.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I saw a discussion on the Google Plus Chromebook discussion that in dev, it was a flag you could set so that you do the unlock your computer with your phone.  That wasn't working yet, but I think it was a little too sad.  That's actually very risky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's an app for the Mac called Knock that lets you knock with your iPhone on your Mac and unlocks the Mac.  But it's very risky because unfortunately, when I installed it on my Mac, Sarah Lane got permission to unlock my Mac.  I don't know how, but it's not what I would call secure.  So that's a bummer.  The movie was in time and then you were thinking of Johnny Mnemonic that I think was the one with a port where the insects could get in that.  Was I? Was it Johnny Mnemonic?  That was the Cano Reeves is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Burke says it's Existence. Existence. Yeah, that's what I was thinking of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, that's going back.  1999. Yeah, OK.  I'm old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Johnny Mnemonic, you could still jack in.  There were no insects involved.  So the insects was the key.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Cronenberg. This is Cronenberg said, OK, this is your body.  We're going to send insects into there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  David Cronenberg has a fascination with insects, starting with the fly.  Something creepy about Cronenberg.  All right. A weapon against trolls.  Could it be?  Matt Cutts says he's created a patent or there is a patent troll solution.  He's explaining it.  Called License. Yeah, he's not responsible. He's just explaining it.  License on Transfer at LOTnet.com.  Companies like New Egg Dropbox, Canon, Google have agreed if they sell a patent, the other companies in the group will get a license to that patent.  Oh, so it only protects you if you're in the group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't understand this. If you sell a patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Depends on the license group, right?  Explain it.  And I need to read this now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I put it up there so you can explain it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is what they write in there on their front page.  Dear industry colleagues, had we formed LOT Network in 2005 and if every operating company had joined that year.  If approximately 10,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually becoming a cartel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this has got to be illegal.  And how much does it cost to join?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I kind of don't trust them because it's written in cold fusion.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really?  That's depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at the CFM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, listen, I program in PHP.  So I'm the last person to be judgy about programming languages.  But this website, I don't know, I spent some time on it and I still kind of don't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the idea is you sign an agreement, you execute it, you send it to them in Beaverton, Oregon.  There is a modest, they say, administrative fee.  Let's see how much it costs.  Well, depends on revenue.  If you're a small company, less than $10 million in revenue, it's only $1,500 a year.  If you're a billion dollar company, it's $20,000 a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the idea is this is the phrase costs for anybody in the group that gets sued around patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, they say they won't sue you.  They say you're basically buying a license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It reduces the value of trying to sue over a patent because so many people have licenses to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's the other cost is if you join, you are now a member and you have to adhere to these terms.  So when you sell your, if you sell a patent, absolutely, they'll reduce the value of that patent.  This is like secondary blackmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay.  So if they sell a patent to a troll, then you get protection against the troll for your $1,500 a year.  So it's a protection racket for people who like giant large companies who have lots of old crappy patents that they want to sell off to trolls.  Now Google has joined it.  Like BlackBerry, for example.  Okay, BlackBerry is about to be this problem because they're going down the toilet, but they have patents.  So they're going to sell the patents off to trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  And if, and in fact, if they had they been a member of this group, they might have gone down the toilet sooner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if they do that, then the patent trolls will pay less for the patents.  That's exactly it.  Because they're doing it's actually a reverse indemnification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Matt Cutts has stopped his run, has pulled over.  There's steam coming out of his ears.  You don't understand this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he's on leave.  He's hanging out with his wife.  I hope he's on a beach somewhere.  I hope Matt's not listening to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He'll say, Hey, I just listened to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He put up a big picture of roses that he gave his wife.  And my response was just simply, well, so you did stop to smell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nice. Isn't that great?  Good news. Google's bringing free Wi-Fi to New York City phone booths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was like, I remember where the closest phone booth is to me.  And I have no idea.  I didn't even know they're still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is this an onion article?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you look at the picture, if you look at the picture, Gina, it'll you realize that there are ads all around the streets of New York.  And that's what a phone booth is now.  See that?  Doesn't that look familiar?  You see, you don't think of it as a phone booth.  You think of it as a billboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  You're absolutely right.  And I guess Sandy did sort of make phone booths useful.  Oh, yeah. You need phone booths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because when I was working at BT, this was one of the things that I was saying is like, oh, we have all these like big red boxes in the street.  Wouldn't it be great if they were Wi-Fi hotspots?  They were like, yeah, that could work, but it's going to take a lot of changes to the phone booths.  But it actually makes a certain amount of sense because the phone booths are in the places that they haven't been.  They've been taken out of all the upscale neighborhoods already, but they're in the places where people still actually use them.  So they will be a good place to fill in the Wi-Fi hotspot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you get Wi-Fi for 85 feet, at least around each site and phone service.  Free 911 and 311 calls.  311 is information.  The city is also encouraging people who want to do this to offer cell phone charging stations.  That would be useful.  Short local calls for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to stand there in the middle of the street with my phone plugged in in Times Square.  Then I'm going to have Elmos coming up trying to hug me and get paid.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you may wonder, you may think, hey, well, doesn't Bell Atlantic or actually now Verizon own those phones?  No, Verizon and all the big telcos long ago gave up pay phones and sold them off to smaller companies.  Currently, the pay phones in New York City are owned by 10 different companies and the companies do have to franchise.  I actually know one of the guys who does this.  It's a very interesting business.  He bought his phones from AT&T.  AT&T was a small enough business and growing smaller all the time.  AT&T just didn't want to deal with it.  He says for me, it's still a billion dollar business.  But for AT&T, it's like, who cares?  And he says almost all these he services phones all over the country.  Almost all of them are now cell phones.  They're not connected to a landline network.  They look like a pay phone.  Interesting.  Yeah, isn't it?  It's an interesting business.  He says, you know, I said, nobody has, he says, well, look in front of Wal-Mart, in lower income communities, in the bodegas, in the small stores.  How do you use a phone card?  He used to sell phone card.  In fact, I think he still does phone cards.  That's how he got into the cell phone or the pay phone business.  And he says really this was really interesting to me.  The real business is how do you collect the coins?  People are using coins.  So where this guy has this guy's great.  I don't remember the name of the company or I give him a plug.  He's the father of one of Henry's best friends at college.  And so I was visiting Henry and I sat and talked to this guy for a couple of hours about the business and I was fascinated.  He makes a very good living on this.  And what happened is that the key is being efficiently picking up the coins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's the first user case I've heard for Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe.  I mean, I think you probably can use cards and so forth.  But remember where these are and how they're used.  People still want to drop a quarter and make a call.  You don't have a phone or you lost your phone or whatever.  You need to use a phone.  It's basically it's basically a loaning you a cell phone for a fee.  And he's he's actually developed algorithms.  He says very much like UPS, our trucks don't turn left.  They've developed algorithms to efficiently collect the coins.  The more efficiently, the more money you make.  And he's branched out.  He's become in many states the guy who services the Nestle's freezer cases because the same algorithm used to pick up coins from coin pay phones have become very useful in delivering.  Ice cream sandwiches.  And actually, this is the other thing.  Those freezers are heavily instrumented.  He says, I said, well, he said, we need to know when to bring ice cream and how much ice cream.  And I said, well, you count them or something?  He said, well, we do have sensors inside the thing, but mostly we just weigh the thing.  There's a little.  Yeah, you weigh it.  There's a little sensor.  And when it gets when it gets light enough, time to send a truck because we have all the flavors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, that is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The world is an amazing place.  It is.  And and they're all the I think there's lots of businesses like these where people say, oh, that's not exciting or cool.  I don't want to.  This is an entrepreneur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We get so caught up in Silicon Valley entrepreneurship.  This is a real entrepreneur who sees an opportunity.  Brilliant guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Does it? Yeah.  And in software is what made him successful because it's the software that tells the trucks where to go.  By the way, it's true.  UPS does not turn left.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because a left turn is time consuming because you can't imagine the UK where they don't turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, then they don't turn right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, and they do it sometimes.  There are places they'll turn left.  But the software that's routing the UPS driver or the ice cream truck guy is smart enough to let it turn left somewhere where it can be done easily and effectively like a one way street, but not where it will be turning left on a two way street onto a two way street.  Because that's you got to wait till traffic gets by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I imagine a guy in brown shorts who just decides I'm going to I'm going to be a rebel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Turn here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to take a little break in the intersection.  Yeah.  Yeah, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So related news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Google is offering free Wi Fi and Uber black cars in Philadelphia.  It's in the rundown somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is smart.  Google's Google's doing the little breadcrumbs thing.  You know, you don't have to make a whole loaf.  Just add up enough crumbs and you get Wi Fi everywhere.  But you don't want to come up against regulators.  Hey, it's just in the phone booths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just in the Ubers.  Well, I remember when we got to Metro Wide Wi Fi.  Philadelphia went through a big project where they're ice cream for routers at every phone pole and the government got bald and there were like five bitters.  And then it never happened.  You know what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Comcast and Verizon and AT&T went to the state legislatures.  They got laws passed in more than 30 states banning municipal Wi Fi.  Your old comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Speaking of phone companies, just about Josh Marshall, who's a wonderful, wonderful journalist of Talking Points Memo was online.  He has a great tale today.  He got a five thousand dollar bill.  I think it was for Verizon.  And he's not a Verizon customer.  So they tries to call Verizon to say, what is this?  And he has to verify that he his number.  But of course, he doesn't have a number to verify.  He's a customer to say, I'm not a customer to kick at the bill.  So it goes as holding.  They try to say, well, this is a this is a government requirement to have an emergency phone line.  What?  And then they gave that up.  And then when he canceled two years ago, two of the lines self replicated.  What?  And they're saying that it's Josh's responsibility to pay the money.  No, this is this is a sequence that's going to keep going on.  This is like slamming.  Yeah, it's it's it's it's the Verizon equivalent of the Comcast call we talked about.  God.  These are these monopolies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And people complain about Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I've got to go through Fios.  I just realized I was saying, boy, a little slow at home.  I pay for 50 megs.  It was a story that.  They're now going to go symmetrical.  Same up, same down.  Well, yeah, so let me do a little check here and I can I can I can do a screenshot and put that up and be happy.  But I'm paying for 50.  I got 25.  Now I got to go to the whole McGill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm convinced that that Ryan Block Comcast call is something Comcast likes because they don't want to talk to you.  And so what they really want you to do is dread getting on the phone.  I mean, we know this is true.  They get they get those Comcast reps get ranked down if the calls get too long, if they take too many calls.  The worst thing that can happen is somebody calls once and then calls back again because it wasn't resolved.  Best thing to do just don't call us.  And generally, that's going to make a money because what do you do to call?  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I need to call the but the bar is up because my phone, my Comcast bill is now three hundred dollars a month.  Do you not dread them?  Do you not dread that call?  God, do I actually want to go and do this today?  No, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not worth my health.  Literally.  I should do it.  I have one on the air and then we can troll them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to call Comcast tomorrow.  I'm saving it up for a day off because I'll be on the phone all day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do it on the show.  There you go.  Yeah, this is recorded for service reasons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will. Well, yeah.  And by the way, you do have to say that in some states in California is one of those states you have to tell them it's a two party state.  You have to tell them you're recording.  I want to I want to give them more money.  I want to add Turner Classic Movies.  You've been trying to do that for weeks.  You know, for weeks.  I tried on the website.  OK, there's no way to do it on the website.  You can upgrade your package, which I have to I want to do.  But as soon as you do that on the website, it says, OK, make your installation appointment.  What? Oh, and but I know, but I don't need an installation.  I just so I OK, I clearly the website they want you to call them or something.  So but I didn't want to call them because of Ryan Block.  So I did a check and I chatted, explained to the guy and the guy said, OK, he walks it all thing.  He said now and now this is half an hour later through this check because you could tell the guy's doing 30 calls at once on the chest because there's long pauses.  And he said, you still there?  And then and then and then he says, OK, now log into the website and add the package.  I said, but I did that.  Now it's going to want an installation.  He says, oh, just ignore that.  OK, he said, schedule an appointment, doesn't matter when I said, OK.  Now I'm very nervous because I know a truck's going to show up tomorrow.  So I scheduled an appointment and then he said, OK, now this is the Comcast chat representative.  He says, now, now that you schedule, you're going to get a new chat with somebody else.  Tell him what you told me.  But I just told you.  So now I tell him.  And so and he says, OK, I understand.  He doesn't say there's not going to be a service call.  He just says, OK, I understand.  The other guy says, OK, first guy says, bye.  Bye.  No, and then me and another half hour goes by.  This isn't chat.  Another half hour goes by and they say, so you want to downgrade your service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I'm so afraid that they're going to cut off my Internet or they're going to do something bad that I just I disconnected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You should have just been like OMG, FML, KMN.  You're killing me.  Chat that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think Comcast wants us to have PTSD.  They really don't want us to have any interaction at all because the likelihood is they go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's their goal.  The goal is for them to for me to go, oh, God, three bucks a month.  OK, but can I face calling them this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's worth it not to talk to them.  A Twin Cities man is upset about the way his family was tweet tweeted on a Southwest Airlines flight.  He was asked he was on a flight from Denver to Minneapolis with his kids on Sunday.  He was asked to get off the flight because the gate agent didn't like a tweet he wrote about her service before boarding.  The man, Duff Watson, and the agent had a disagreement.  Watson says I was left, you know, very upset, very embarrassed, very humiliated.  He's an A-list passenger.  That means he gets priority boarding.  But the agent wouldn't let his kids board with him.  Six year old, nine year old.  He said, well, you can get on, but your kids can't.  And Duff said, all right, real nice way to this is literally a quote, real nice way to treat an A-list.  That's their priority, guys.  I'll be sure to tweet about it.  And he did.  He tweeted, wow, rudest agent in Denver, Kimberly S.  Gate C39, not happy at SWA.  Got down, sat down, the family sat down.  They kicked him off the plane.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  On what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then and then they forced him to erase the tweet before they would allow him back on.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  His kids are crying, literally six and nine years old.  He said there was no use of profanity.  There were no threats made.  There was nothing other than, you know, a tense exchange between a customer service agent, a customer and a tweet.  The customer service agent said, I'm going to call the cops.  I feel I feel threatened.  She said you cannot board the plane until you delete the tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  Took about a beast with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A strife and effect for that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Southwest has apologized for the incident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the passenger says he's never flying Southwest again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apparently.  Oh, they gave him.  I'm sorry.  They gave him $50 vouchers, which he can never use because he's never flying that airline again.  The new the new corporate misbehavior is screw your customer, then apologize.  They were to investigate this.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, but that's in it.  The point is that they use the Twitter sub reaction.  That was my I clicked on a link this morning and I got fished by Yahoo ads.  Oh, that's nice.  But that was lovely.  So I tweeted about it.  Now Yahoo, Yahoo concierge services email me saying we're trying to explain about fishing to you.  It's like, no, this is what happens now.  You are serving fishing ads.  You need to fix this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  At first, when you tweeted, you know, Frank Elias and then the Comcast cares at first when you tweeted, they they jumped and they did something now.  And I this happened about a year ago because I remember I tweeted about Comcast and I got a call from Comcast executive whatever.  And it wasn't a call to say we're sorry.  We're going to fix this.  It was it was it was berating me.  It was no.  Yeah.  And so that's the new thing is, oh, my God, let's not fix the problem.  Under what basis?  What do they say?  Oh, I can't remember.  She was mad that I I don't know.  I hung up on her.  Jesus.  Let's move on.  I don't want to talk anymore about this.  I just feel like there is some there is some trend here that is not a pleasant trend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody watch Twitter tomorrow for Leo's Comcast call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I stopped tweeting because I don't want the I don't want the executives to call me and yell at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just with them record that as well.  It's like, oh, it's an endless thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're going to win because they're a monopoly.  There's nowhere I can go.  So we are held hostage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There really is a fear that they would just cut you off.  Just just just just to F you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's worth three hundred dollars a month not to get cut to cut off.  So I'm paying.  OK, so one of the things I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true. I don't want Congress cut me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I spent a lot of money, two hundred dollars a month to go to Comcast business so that we would have unmetered hundred megabit service with no bandwidth shaping.  That's two hundred a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Two hundred a month.  I'm cancelling my domestic one and paying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's great. It's worth it.  And then wait, because I thought, well, of course, Comcast one company, they'll cancel the domestic.  So now I'm paying even though I don't have a router.  They came. They took the router.  They put the business router in.  But they didn't cancel my regular Internet.  So I'm paying for two and a half.  And then I have to make a call.  Oh, and I'm not going to because I'm deathly afraid that they will.  You can call, but I'm deathly afraid at least at least it will yell at herself.  But I'm afraid. See, what I don't want to do is come home and Lisa says the Internet's not working.  Because I canceled the you know, I you know, that's what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it happened to me.  I haven't to happen here when I was in Paris.  I called for my wife saying, you know, it's not working.  I had to do with that Comcast chat thing in Paris.  The worst thing is like, can you?  It's like, no, I don't have that information.  I can tell you where to get that information.  But I'm in Paris.  Just cut my family off the Internet.  Stop it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Coming home to spouse rage while like the Netflix spinner on your TV is going like this is the worst way to come home from work.  It's not happening.  Last night after all that Android, I went home and I was like, oh, my God.  Why does our Internet suck so bad?  Yeah, get that one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A couple of weeks ago, we actually called the Comcast out because the TV stopped working.  And the guy who came found that under the house, the the the hub that they plugged the UHF connectors in had been under there for so long that like rats had nibbled it or something.  And it had just got to the point where the TV stopped working because it's digital TV now.  So it just hit that point where there were enough bits being dropped that it could no longer send this TV.  And we were wondering, well, that's kind of a bit slow.  And he said, yeah, this is this is what happened.  Rats.  Rats.  They charge you for the service call.  They didn't charge us for the service.  They replaced that piece and they unplugged the cables that were going to the rooms and it only use and so on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Occasionally, you know, it does happen.  And I've had this happen.  You get the service and they're great.  And so it's not universal.  And I don't know.  I mean, Jeff, you you got contacted, I'm sure.  But I got contacted by Comcast reps who anonymously said, well, let's you know, it's not completely our fault.  They sent you to do this.  You know, your pay is dependent on it.  One guy contacted Mike Elgin and said, you know, what you don't also know and don't hear about is the software that we're you.  Comcast grew by acquisition and none of the software talks to anything else.  Right.  That was that was the guy who said to me.  Right. Yeah.  Was that you? Yeah, it was.  It's a mess.  And so what you don't know is our systems are crashing as we're talking to you.  We're not allowed to say that.  Yes.  Is that great?  The rep in the field is not only untrained, but we can't even interact with them and give them what they it's just a mess.  It's a systems problem.  Google is the here's a good thing coming out of the EU.  I think Google has been told by the EU to stop calling games within that purchases free.  Apple has also been told the same thing, but Apple hasn't done anything about it yet.  But we know these in-app purchases are really the big cost of games and sometimes cost a lot more than upfront costs.  So starting in September, the Google Play Store will no longer use the word free for any game that requires in-app purchases.  It also is going to come up with some targeted guidelines for games to prevent encouragement of children to buy items.  This is an ongoing problem.  Apple got sued and settled a class action lawsuit by sending us all gift cards because of in-app purchases by kids.  The EU says Apple has regrettably not provided any solution or timetable.  Apple's response.  Apple takes great pride in leading the industry and parental controls that are incredibly easy to use.  We over the last year have made sure any app which enables customers to make in-app purchases clearly marked by court order.  We've also created a kids section of the app store with even stronger protections.  Our goal blah blah blah.  And we will continue to work with the EC member states to respond to their concerns.  So Apple's dodging.  Well, I mean this is a plague on gameplay, isn't it?  That's really the larger one.  I mean, yeah, kids are going out and buying fish and every once in a while I'll get about 10 emails from the iTunes store.  Each of them $2.99.  And these things happen.  The worst plague is you think you're getting a free app and it's just unplayable unless you give them more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It feels like we were talking about this last night.  There's kind of a difference between the apps that are effectively impossible to play unless you pace for something, right?  Like you can do very, very limited stuff in it versus the apps that you can do a fair amount.  But then, you know, but there's the where's the line?  You know, how do you how do you draw the line between those two?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, we in our reviews from I think we might be do this in a more formal way, but have always when I review a quote free app, I'll explain in that purchases and I'll review it with the point of view of how playable is it if you don't.  I have after my bad experiences with the Simpsons tapped out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't it's not just it's just not games either.  I just Tim O'Reilly recommended an app, which is a very good app, and I'll probably pay for I'm not going to resent the money I'm going to pay.  I told him the upfront called Sleep at Android.  I think it's called.  What does it do?  I know it monitors your sleep sleep as Android.  And, you know, I've got I've got, you know, these things on my wrist.  I can't get to do that.  But but but this you put this is wacky.  You put the phone on the mattress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's better. It could be worse to be in your underpants.  But go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, and so because of motion and noise and the sensors is the power of these things with sensors.  Yeah, it sees whether you how much you slept.  And the great thing is I compared it to my wearable and it's pretty similar.  So it gives me here's me see if I can find a graph.  So here's a graph of my sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is like the if it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's I don't have to wear anything.  Here she is putting it in her bed.  Well, she's here's the here's the other thing about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute. She's sleeping on the bed.  So you don't put it like under the mattress.  You have to put it next to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's on the mattress next to you.  It has to be on the mattress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I tried it last night and I put it on the nightstand.  No, didn't work as well as beyond the mattress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's best to see if you if you wiggle here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you want, it doesn't really work if you have dogs, does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or anybody in bed with you?  This is for the loaner.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's here's the if you want to it will record your snoring.  Oh, I do want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When you go up, you know who's snoring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a little bit argument.  Yeah, it's a question I have.  So I don't know in any of these apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't told me how much of my sleep is deep.  Nobody tells me what I should have, how normal it is.  Yeah, that's so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They all say like I have I've done this and I said you you were restless 89 times.  Is that a lot? Is that a little? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It gives you zero data.  So I had this was a good night.  I had 52 percent deep sleep cycles.  That's good. That's very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You slept. Is it good?  Yeah, what you're supposed to do now, but everybody's different.  I was snoring 25 percent of the time.  You're supposed to say to yourself, how do I feel today?  Do I feel good?  Well, then that's a good number.  Do I feel tired?  Oh, then that's why I always feel crappy and tired.  Me too.  What do you expect?  Those of us over a certain age are tired all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It feels like they could put those numbers into context based on other users data and that they should.  I'd actually I'm going to say that it's the responsibility to do that.  I have a deeper version of apps and I mean, I build an app that shows numbers.  But my argument against so many insights and think up is like, what does this number mean?  Like, it's a tough thing, right?  Like without without context.  Right. What does 12 mean?  You know, is that a little?  Here's a nice feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So if the alarm goes off, it gets you out of bed.  You have a giant QR code next to the mirror in the bathroom and you can stop the alarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you can have an ask the alarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The alarm gets you out of bed.  You unplug the phone.  You go in the bathroom and you show it your QR code.  You're awake.  You're awake.  Otherwise, you couldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you were like other things, it'll pick the moment to wake you up.  Yeah. So the other morning woke me up a half hour earlier than I wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's not cool.  Not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It plays you lullabies.  It's a cool app.  I'm playing.  So presumably a lot of these are in-app purchases.  Also, anyway, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you want to hold on to do something, it's four ninety five.  And again, not much money.  And I wouldn't resent that.  But I just want to be a front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It will it will work with your hue so you can have the hue slowly wake you up.  The hue lights could slowly.  Oh, yeah, you like it.  It'll work with your pebble.  So if you have a pebble, you can just wear the pebble, Chad.  I wonder if it worked with Android Wear.  That'd be already have this app.  Not yet. Oh, you already have it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there's a way we wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't use it.  The thing is, is for why it's funny, though, you mentioned it waking you up 30 minutes early.  There's a there's kind of a an idea that you should be woken up when you're in the light sleep cycle.  And so that was actually what I was looking for.  I just kind of got over that.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You said what you're going to do is set a range.  Right.  And if you set the range at don't set it before you want to wake up, set it so that it'll wake you up sometime in a half an hour after you want to be woken up.  Otherwise, it'll wake you up earlier.  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's what the gear the gear four did.  And I had an iPad app set up for that.  I just kind of grew out of that.  Now I just want to wake up when I need to wake up and and monitor what time I go to sleep.  The QR code just one of seats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This the problem is and we've had I know people like this, but they'll hit the alarm unconsciously.  It turns it off.  Yeah.  And they go back to sleep.  So there's they give you you could do math problems.  You could challenge shake the phone a certain amount.  Or you can find sheep.  Or you could do the QR code.  So forces you to get I think this is kind of cool.  So I got to point out I'm in the Google Play Store.  Maybe it's different on the phone.  But here it doesn't show me what the in-app purchases are on the website.  That's my point.  It should.  It should.  Apple does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a difference between this and spending six hundred dollars playing the Kardashian game.  Right.  By the way, great game.  Unless you have the Kardashian game.  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  It's amazing how well it's done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's wonderful.  I just read about it on Jezebel and thought five hundred dollars on that.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  That Jezebel writer.  It's easy.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Abby's trying not to buy K-stars.  My daughter is playing it.  She says a really annoying thing is it keeps sending notifications.  Your fans are losing interest.  Quick.  You know, do something Kardashian like.  You're not playing, by the way, you're not playing Kim Kardashian.  You're playing her friend.  Or actually, you're not even her friend.  You have to get to know her.  It's like Sim Kardashian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Sim Kardashian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am so proud to say I have the faintest friggin idea what you're all talking about.  Yes, you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I'm staying that way.  You know, you know who the.  Who was it?  Was it the.  Was there was a member.  I know who they are.  I don't know what this is.  There was a member of Congress who said, what's a Kardashian?  Is that a machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're actually for you, Jeff, like they're an amazing brand.  Like that's that's just embraced every single platform.  Right.  And this app, the fact that this app is doing so well, it challenges my notion that these  are not smart people.  Right.  Like these are smart people.  Yes.  But it proved that Faust lived.  So it's John Dingell, who is among the oldest members of Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's 88 years old.  Apparently, he doesn't know anything about the Kardashians.  But it's fun.  It's fun to follow him on Twitter, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, Instagram is like, you know, is their thing like their.  Here's I'm the last original author of the Clean Water Act, but I have no idea who or

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  what a Kardashian is, and I rarely play games.  Staff has now informed me of what a Kardashian is.  I'm only left with more questions.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm following him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I love him.  Oh, this is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, yeah, no, I was going to check this on the phone.  Do they tell you on the phone whether there's in-app purchases like on the phone entry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just found another app for these people called Mindroid.  Yeah.  What's that do?  That it it's an audio auditory visual stimulation device.  I need that.  A mind machine or psycho walkman.  It provides each of your brain hemispheres with a signal, either audible or visual, with  a slightly different frequency in order to stimulate your brain waves.  Wow.  Then it says at the bottom, caution shall not be used by users suffering any epileptic  or cardiac symptoms.  Oh, dear.  I don't think I've done more than that.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, we got to take a break.  I forgot that we have that this is a show to do.  I'm just having so much fun talking with you.  This is really just like sitting around having a beer, talking with friends.  Kim Kardashian, by the way, made 80 will make 81 million dollars on that app this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that's amazing.  See, that's that's the redistribution of wealth.  It's like the the the lottery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  The wrong way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stupid enough to play the lottery.  Suddenly get lots of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She won the lottery when she was named Kardashian.  Yes, that's true.  You know what?  My daughter did not know.  And what I think a lot of people who know who the Kardashians are, you know, because  they got famous because of reality television.  But you and I know that the reason that their dad was the first Kardashian became famous  because he was he on the defense team for OJ Simpson?  Yes, I think that's what it was.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that's I'm in the midst of watching season eight.  I have just watched all eight seasons of the Kardashians.  Gina, Gina, is it good?  Yes, it is.  It is great trash TV.  I mean, it just is.  I'm shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just shocked.  You've you've you've you've crushed me.  I thought you were so much above the the the flotsam of the world, Gina.  Oh, no, you're human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying not to be judgmental or a whole heady toady or over intellectual.  I mean, the Kardashian, the Kardashians are a huge brand.  I didn't understand who or what they were, why people cared about them.  I started watching the show and yeah, I mean, I sort of I sort of get I get the appeal.  I won't go into my Kardashian thing, but I but particularly with this app, I find them  a fascinating brand.  I think that they've done an amazing thing across lots of different platforms.  I think there's like really interesting sort of interplay of like gender and media  and like who's a personality and publicity and privacy and like just, you know, I mean,  they made a show.  Oh, yes, Gina.  You've justified it all just now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've got to wonder what I mean, their father, Robert Kardashian, was the first celebrity

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  in the family, friend and defender of OJ Simpson.  He died in 2003.  You've got to wonder what he had, by the way, at the age of fifty nine.  So, but you've got to wonder what he would have thought of all this.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that's sort of a theme.  Oh, they refer to him.  Yes.  They talk about him a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so I guess so.  So the mom was actually friends with Nicole Simpson and was really upset.  It sort of it sort of contributed to the their divorce.  Whatever.  I'm not going to get into.  So they were then and when she married Jenner and then Kendall and Kylie women, she married

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Bruce Jenner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, Bruce Jenner is is like is her current husband.  Yeah.  And then they had two kids.  Bruce Jenner, the swimmer, not triathlete, the race, the race guy, the track guy, the  76 Olympic medalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, he's a swimmer.  He's a swimmer.  Remember, he remember the and have you looked at his plastic surgery recently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Way out of control.  Oh, oh, OK.  Now we got to look up Bruce Jenner.  He is, according to his website, the world's greatest athlete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sitting there saying tacky Americans, tacky Americans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Decathlon married Chris Jenner or decathlon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, OK.  It was Chris was Chris Kardashian.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, he's decathlete.  I thought he was a swimmer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that well, then he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Kendall Jenner goes topless channels.  I'm sorry.  I've lost.  I've lost.  I've lost control of the show.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Make some money, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I want to play this game now.  I might have to spend some of that money on Kim Kardashian, Hollywood starlet or whatever  it's called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Superstar superstar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But it is not cheap.  Have you played the game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have not.  I've actually resisted the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm going to put it on Jason's one plus one phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I watched the show, so I don't want to spend any more hours on these people.  But I do find them fascinating as a brand and as a marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Abby really likes the game.  She says it's actually a really engaging game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  Abby's 22.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But, you know, our show today brought to you by the one place in the world that wants to  bring better websites to the world, better websites through all for all through Squarespace.  Have you played the Kim Kardashian game, Henry?  No.

This is a prize, part of the little box challenge.  Kevin, what's a power inverter do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It changes AC to DC, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's the brick that we have on every device we plug in.  Because AC is what's coming out of the wall, and most batteries want DC.  What's wrong with the existing power inverters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I'm going to tell you.  Good question. They probably waste too much power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We believe, says Google, that inverters will become increasingly important to our economy.  Wow.  As solar, PV, batteries, and similar power sources continue their rapid growth,  more broadly, similar forms of power electronics are everywhere, of course,  in laptops, phones, motors, drives, electric vehicles, wind turbines.  We expect that innovations inspired by this million dollar prize  will have wide applicability across all those areas.  So there's a number of different kinds of inverters, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can they also make them lighter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they do. You know they're wasting power because they get hot.  And we do know that inverters, if left plugged in, will use power even when there's no draw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whenever Google puts out these calls for either bug bounties or crowdsourcing invention,  you know it's a really hard problem because the brainiacs at Google haven't figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point. That's a really good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love this page for the Little Box Challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  LittleBoxChallenge.com  Wait a minute, let me start it over again.  It starts with they're squishing a truck.  Think shrink, it says.  And then a giant dog trying to get in a little tiny dog bed.  The Japanese, the Tokyo subway station where they're stuffing more people into the car during rush hour.  A kitten in a cup.  Using a hose to vacuum.  I can't continue to narrate this.  So Little Box Challenge is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh sorry, sorry, I had it backwards. It's the other way around. It's the thing that makes AC from DC.  Oh, that's an inverter. Okay.  That's the inverter, right. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it takes it from solar panels and batteries.  Yes, and then gives you AC to run existing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or from your car battery to make a laptop work.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is something less common, but very important if you're trying to do solar energy for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you've got... so I mean, the obvious answer is, well, why are we making AC when the things at the other end are turning back into DC again?  So if you can cut the middle man out, that makes more sense.  Because you're... if you're... we're going through this process and then we're replacing all our lights with LEDs, which actually want DC,  but they have to have a transformer in them to turn the AC into DC because we're screwing them into AC sockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did we mess up? Was Edison right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Should we have gone DC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It depends what you're doing. DC is better at short range. AC is better at long range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the whole point of AC is that you can have a power plant and at a distance, it can send power at a distance because it's alternating the current.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And so it's easier to scale it up to very high voltages and transmit it because it ends up being an oscillating transmission.  So it's a wave you can guide along wires.  But the DC is much better for short range because you're not, you know, you basically when you've got AC, it's doing that all the time.  And you've got to like put it through a capacitor and clip it off and make it into a DC thing so that your your screen isn't flickering all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So thanks to our chat room, who are all experts on all of this.  They say, for instance, that you probably have an inverter in your laptop for the screen, that hams are very notoriously hate inverters because they're noisy.  They put off a lot of RF.  They're used to export power back to the grid is what one of them says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the other thing is that the grid wants AC.  And so if you've got a giant battery or a solar thing, then you would need to basically give them a waveform that they like to look of to feed into the grid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Google's saying they want to get it smaller.  So applicants have till September to register their team the end of September.  And then next year, registered teams will submit a technical approach.  So you have like about a year to get working on this thing.  You have till July 22nd, 2015.  In October, 18 finalists will be notified of their.  This is something Netflix did this with a Netflix prize where they wanted to get a better recommendation engine.  I love this idea where commercial entities will say, hey, you know, this is so important.  We'll give a million dollars to somebody who comes up with a better way of doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The X prize.  The great thing about that, but the Netflix thing was the honor of winning it became so important.  People spent more than a million dollars to win a million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. It's really fosters innovation.  It's a great idea.  And there's a lot if you want to know more at little box challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the other half of this is saying, well, are there ways we can like not need to have, you know, running a C around the house and then having like, you know.  Having something like this connected to every device you're using is less than ideal.  And especially with LED light bulbs, things like that, you're literally putting one of those into every light bulb.  So just because that's what you're running around the house and if you can actually run DC wires and the LED bulbs could be that big rather than the size of the bulbs they're replacing.  So there's there's a bunch of stuff that will mean that this will make more sense over time as we start running more DC around the house.  But this is a it's a transition technology as well.  It's not my light.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Apparently, I've just been informed that a visitor to our studio has brought me an entire pepperoni pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's good I didn't want on Twitter.  I would have been the pepperoni industry would have been calling me.  But thank you.  That's very nice.  Actually, it would have been the ham and pineapple industry.  Google the day after we did the show last week, Google announced its second quarter results.  A great quarter revenue up 22 percent year over year.  Sixteen billion dollars.  They talked about the Lenovo transition for Motorola mobile and that was included as part of that.  Let's see.  Let me just look at some highlights here.  Net income three point four two billion dollars.  That's up a few hundred million from last year.  I'll take it.  Take it.  That's more than a billion a month.  That's good.  Discontinued operations did hit that a little bit.  Our sites generated revenues of ten point nine four billion.  Partner networks or partner sites three point four two billion.  They don't mention how much they made on Chromebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The interesting to know is that is that always out at the beginning of a smart ass line there.  Yeah, it was.  It was.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One thing they do point out and no, actually, I like Chromebooks and I've come around to your way of thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they sold a million of them to schools last quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of them I bought for our sixth grader, Michael.  And and it's really nice, you know, for 200 bucks.  The ace was the Acer C720.  Very nice.  That's a nice machine, right?  Yeah, for 200 bucks.  It's amazing.  The school give you a choice of what to buy or the school gives.  Well, this is the school gives the students one.  It's a is it a one to one program list or do they have a pool that this kids share?  It's a one to one program.  So the school does have the budget, I think, partly through nonprofits like the Petrolosia two to one.  Oh, that's interesting.  Two kids, one Chromebook.  That's got to work well.  That's got to work.  And then so we thought, well, they're so inexpensive.  Michael should have his own.  So we just we just got him one.  But I think that's great.  I think that's a really great program.  And they laughed at the Chromebook.  They get money from the Petaluma Educational Foundation, which is a nonprofit which we support for that.  So that's cool.  Income tax rate.  This is the this is I don't know how long this has been going on, but both Google and Apple are great pains to point out.  They pay a lot of income tax despite the Dutch turnaround in the Indonesian Polynesian upside down cake or whatever.  They use 21 percent the effective tax rate.  That's no less than I pay, but it's it's good.  I think I once had an accountant who said that's about where you want to shoot for 20 percent.  Same guy said, oh, I wish I would take more deductions.  Plan for a third.  Yeah, plan for a third, but pay a fifth.  Twenty percent.  What do you think?  Yeah, we're in California.  We're in a high tax state.  So this is you know what they say?  They don't say federal income tax rate.  They say our effective tax rate.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what they're counting across all countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that averaging between the tax they don't pay in Ireland and the tax they do pay in America?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Next time I want you on that analyst called Kevin Marks.  Thank you for the pizza, my friend.  This looks like good.  Where did this come from?  Mary's.  Mary's.  Now, if anybody wants to send me a Pepe's pizza, just fly out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you ever heard don't look a gift horse in the mouth?  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's delicious.  I love it.  Wherever it came from.  Head count, 52,069 full time employees of that 3,485 were Motorola.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember we did numbers on this show for Google employees when it was heading over  like 20,000 as I remember.  Yeah, 52,000.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, you know, everybody, all the tech companies actually reported pretty good results this  quarter.  I don't think anybody had a bad quarter except Blackberry.  I don't even know if Blackberry had a bad quarter.  According to the big charge, but Microsoft had to take a charge for the layoffs over

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a billion dollar charge for the layoffs, but also a big charge for the for the tablet.  No, they're doing very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They did that this quarter or previous quarter.  They took a big one.  More.  Because they took more than a billion on the service a couple of quarters ago.  Recode Kara Swisher, the most powerful tech journalist in the world.  She can start a fire with her eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She has used her mutant powers to determine there have been no Google Spotify acquisition

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  talks, none.  There you go.  That said, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek did indeed meet with Google executives  about various and substantive commercial deals at YouTube, Google Play and Android.  But one source reflecting many, many others said, don't shoot me with your eyes.  And there have not been as there has not been a single conversation about Google's interest  between the two.  There was never a price, never a negotiation, never anything.  Please don't shoot me with your eyes.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You guys talked about the Swisher, the New York magazine profile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you think of that?  We also talked about the Elle magazine profile of debris.  Did you see that?  No, I didn't.  I have to bring that back because we wished you were here.  So tell us about what you thought of the picture of Kara on the beach.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I really enjoyed it.  I learned things that I didn't know.  I thought, of course, the things that stuck with me were the personal stuff.  Like I didn't realize that Mossberg had walked her down the aisle because her mother, you know,  was not supportive of her relationship.  That was interesting to me.  I didn't realize that they had that kind of close personal relationship.  It was a great piece.  I mean, Kara has such a personality.  She just makes great stories.  So many great quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Kara's quite a...  She's been on our shows, of course, many times.  In fact, as I pointed out last week, those dogs that she's holding in the ivy  pooped on our floor once.  I like that she tells various founders that they dress like Ellen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's apparently her line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You dress like a lesbian is her line.  Like she uses it on many people, apparently.  I aspire to dress like Ellen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Ellen dresses quite well.  I do too.  I'm going to search for a stylist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  However, having said that, I've got a little kudos to Google's top hacker, Parisa Tabriz,  who appears to wear black almost exclusively.  It's slimming, she says, shrugging.  Not that she needs to worry about that.  She has a simpatico face, always worn bare, that could easily lead from one ethnicity to another.  And a classic gap-in-its-a-day, sleek tomboy aesthetic, dark wash jeans, clean line crewnecks,  and Chuck Taylors with the occasional bomber jacket thrown on top.  We talked about this last week, Elle magazine's profile, of Parisa Tabriz,  whose official Google title is Security Princess.  Security Princess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Security Princess, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You didn't see this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't. This is going into my queue right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Get that Elle magazine out of the trash and read it.  Actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, I missed Elle. I always read Elle.  Do you?  No, I don't. Not even close.  Not even close. Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She just appears in the Kardashian game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do I look like I read Elle? I'm wearing a grey t-shirt.  Actually, but as Jeff and I concluded, in your absence, because we didn't have an actual woman,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that this actually is a surprisingly good piece, part of Elle's Women in Tech series,  that despite that one paragraph, which is a little bit much,  really does talk a lot about some real stuff, and does promote the idea that women can be successful in a tech environment.  She talks about the challenges of that, and it's a great piece of information.  She talks about the challenges of that, and it's pretty good.  Doesn't hurt that she looks good in black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can rock those Chuck Taylors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, those Chuck Taylors look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had no idea that Elle was doing a Women in Tech section.  I don't know how I feel about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello Elle, hello Elle.  Guess who you're missing.  Oops, over the way. Guess who you're missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess the L-word in this case stands for lovely.  There's a whole article here from December, Why We Need Women Who Code, featuring a movie star pretending to use a computer.  Copyright 20th Century Fox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's a photo gallery of women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a photo gallery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it always is, isn't it? Isn't the Women in Tech list always a photo gallery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're so good looking, you'd never know they were nerds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, can you believe it?  Can you believe?  Look at her glasses and let her hair down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Beautiful.  Why, Ms. Tabriz, you're beautiful.  Actually, there is a good article.  If you follow the links to Why We Need Women Who Code actually does profiles of female coders and founders.  And it talks about how they learn to code, being a woman in the field and so forth.  So it's kind of neat.  There's somebody from Code for America, some engineers at various companies.  Hey, it's Elle. What did you expect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's take a little break here.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just want to make sure we get the right to be forgotten from my rant of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff, we still have the changelog, which we've missed.  And Jeff's rant of the week coming up.  But first, let me show you my box.  This, my friends, is an amazing device.  We've talked about Lantronics before.  They have their Xprint server line, which takes any printer, even dumb old USB printer,  and puts it on the Wi-Fi network and makes it compatible.  Now, the first one we showed made it compatible with AirPrint, but this is the one you really want.  This makes any printer compatible, almost any printer, 4,000 different printers, compatible with Google Print.  And that is very cool. Google's Cloud Print means that you can print from your Android or cloud device.  But you can also, I could print to my home printer, because I use one of these, from here over the internet.  This allows your USB printers to be shared over the network.  It automatically discovers them, sets them up.  There's no software to install, nothing to download.  You literally open the box, plug it in, and voila, you are printing via Cloud Print.  The Cloud Print Edition is $149.95, supports up to 10 network printers and 8 USB printers simultaneously.  We've talked to people who've used these.  In fact, I talked to an administrator at a school who said, you know, we had printers all over the school.  We wanted to make it easy for people to print wirelessly.  I plugged this in and it was the I'd never seen anything so easy.  No configuration necessary. It just works.  It's really, really cool.  If you've been looking to get Cloud Print to work with your older USB printer, or you just want to turn a printer into a Wi-Fi printer, this is awesome.  It'll even work with the Chromebook.  The Chromebook.  It'll even work with the Chromebook.  Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, of course, because everything that works with a Chromebook.  Android.  Why would you even doubt something good would work with a Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Hold that rant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I will.  I will.  I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because I want to eat some pizza.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Play the trumpets.  The Google changelog.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Boom, boom, boom, boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And now, ladies and gentlemen, the latest from Google with Gina Trepene.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good news for Windows users who are also using Chrome.  And the latest beta version of the Chrome browser supports Microsoft's DirectWrite API.  What that means for you is that typography fonts look really good.  You can see there in the screenshot there on TechCrunch.  It's actually maybe not as easy to see.  Yeah, you can kind of see.  The top one is without the update and the bottom one is with.  You can see the fonts there are much, much clearer and better looking.  So you'll need a Windows.  You have to be a Windows user on a machine that runs at least Vista in order to see this.  And you need the Chrome beta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So fair enough.  And you want the Chrome beta because the old Chrome killed your battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ah, was that true?  The current stable version on Windows is a battery killer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We updated Chrome because frankly, it was, you know, yeah, it was killing people.  Windows batteries.  Wasn't it just on Windows machines?  Yeah, it wasn't Mac.  Anything else?  Who cares about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff doesn't care.  Windows is like the Kardashians of operating systems.  Jeff is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, Gina, Gina, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So you do need to be in the beta channel for not Canary, but beta channel for this.  You do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You do.  You need the beta to get the good looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know which version of Chrome is now fixed.  The battery life issue.  I don't know if you have to.  I'll find out.  Keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That just came out today, by the way, or this best week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is not Typekit.  This is a different thing.  This is for your desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is for your desktop.  This is Windows on desktop Chrome beta fonts look much better.  It uses the Microsoft's direct write API on the desktop.  Google Maps for Android is getting an update that's rolling out now.  A couple of few nice updates that are probably hooked into Android Auto.  So we've got some voice actions when you're in navigation mode.  So you can do how long until destination, show traffic.  Bicycle directions now display elevation, including elevation comparison for multiple routes.  So you can say, hey, show me which route involves less climbing.  Your places now appears in a slide out nav menu.  The voice icon replaces the person in the search bar that used to load places.  And the Uber card now shows in the car tab of navigation instead of just public transportation and walking.  So Uber in the cities where Uber is available will show up.  So a nice update to Google Maps there.  And I believe that that's just Android.  The Google Play app on Android is updating to a new version.  I haven't gotten it yet.  I keep tapping my settings icon.  You can download the APK.  But it's kind of the first introduction in material design that you're going to see in the Google Play store.  So basically when you first load the app, it looks pretty similar to what you've got now.  But when you navigate down to an app page, you'll see that those are redesigned.  So it's got the new material design animations and material design animations.  It's got a new white background.  Apps have, you can see on the, Chad's got that up on the screen there.  Apps out of a video trailer will have that prominently displayed at the top, bigger app screenshots.  As you scroll downward, the page begins to gradually cover up the space where the trailer was.  It's pushed off screen.  That's material design motion.  And when you select read more in the app change lock at the top, you can see full screen view with information about the app description and changes.  Just a much nicer app page in the new version of the Play store.  I haven't gotten it yet on my phone.  I don't see them on either.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Android police has an APK you can download or sideload.  But I'm waiting for it to hit my phone over the air as the kids say.  Google Drive has been updated with filter views for spreadsheets.  So this is for real spreadsheet nerds.  Pretty cool stuff, though.  There's a new filter views feature so you can sort and filter your data on view only spreadsheets.  And then you can share that filter view with a URL.  So you can turn on this temporary filter view from the toolbar or the data menu or the data menu, sorry, to make adjustments to filter your data and sort it.  And then you can share a link to that particular sort and view.  So nice update there for spreadsheets.  And finally, ahead of the Android one rollout, this is part of Google's reaching the next billion users on Android.  Google's launched maps in Hindi on both the web and Android.  So the Hindi version of maps is available to those using Google Maps on Android version 4.3 and up.  So you can set Hindi as your language preference in order to access it.  They've done translations that tried to stay true to the dialect, but also read correctly.  But they are taking suggestions and corrections from users.  So makes a lot of sense before Android one gets released that India would have maps in the native tongue.  So good for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what I do want to get is the Android one.  I want to get an Android one and just show people how you can do an amazing phone for so little money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is this is not available in the US, but available in India or will be will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it will be right.  It's not out yet. I'm actually I'm actually sure not when not sure when they're when the release date is.  But yeah, I'm interested to get my hands on the Android one, too, because it sounds like a really nice low end phone.  Stock Google, good updates.  Yeah, so it's India and other developing nations.  So maps will now support have support for India native speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that play the drums is the Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I've been doing research.  Couple of things. First, they do not show.  They do not show.  Pepperoni is good.  Good choice.  Love the pepperoni. Got to love the pepperoni.  Also, they do not show in-app purchases on the Google Play Store, even on the phone.  They do that on Apple.  I think that's something Google should do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because it shows it lower on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought it did and I don't see it.  What's this?  Well, I'm looking at sleep as Android that has in-app purchases, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's like right below the screenshot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I see top developer.  I see rate this app.  I see what's new description.  Maybe if I expand this to show you, you've installed it.  Oh, maybe it's because I installed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, right below the screenshot right there.  It says in-app purchases.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So maybe it's because I installed it.  Oh, yeah, there it is in-app purchases, but it doesn't show you what they are.  Oh, I see.  Oh, no, it says here in really fine print right above how big it is because everybody was looking at it.  It's 7.62 megabytes.  It says in-app purchases, but doesn't show you on the zoom in.  Will you on the on the Apple Store?  It will actually give you a list of in-app purchases and their costs, which is really nice.  I mean, that gives you a much better idea.  Well, we know what is this going to what is this?  Could this potentially cost me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'd be nice to see what is the average amount of money you spend on this app as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, wouldn't that be nice?  Oh, that's interesting.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, because that tell you how much you need to spend, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How much you could spend?  You expect to spend?  How much is a typical?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be a great line?  You can expect to spend three hundred dollars on this app over the lifetime of the purchase.  That would be that would really kill some of these freemium apps.  I think it's a blight on the app store, these freemium things.  I understand the developers make tons more money when they do it free plus in-app purchases,  but that's because they're tricking people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. Yeah.  I mean, it is sort of it's a little misleading.  Right. I mean, it was weird talking about all that Android last night.  I mean, the impact on developers.  If Google is going to categorize apps with in-app purchases separately from free apps,  then that does hurt developers.  Right. Because users are going to say, I want something that's free.  And so it's you're going to be taken off the top free lists.  You're not going to be listed as free.  So I mean, you're being I feel like you're being more honest that this isn't this isn't a free app.  But, you know, some in-app purchases apps, you really can do a lot for free and then they offer something extra.  I think I think I think it's going to make developers really think,  should this be in-app purchase or should I just charge someone up front to use it?  Right. Well, that's why I like your idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The average user has spent Instagram would be nice too, but that's a lot of real estate.  The average user has spent this much on this app is a really valuable statistic,  especially when you like launch the Kardashian app and it's $400.  That might tell you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I would love to see that.  And if my kid is trying to install an app, I'd like to see him.  You know, what's the average?  What could this cost me? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I also did research on the Chrome thing, and I don't think they fixed it.  This is from Tech Times.  Google has finally acknowledged a problem that has been reported to Google since 2010  that a flaw in Chrome accelerates battery usage in Windows laptops.  It has something to do with the tick rate.  When most browsers, including Chrome, are in active use,  they run the clock at a tick rate of about a millisecond.  Maybe some of you smart people can explain that to me.  But when browsers are open in the background but not active,  all of them except Chrome for Windows just ease up,  and they reduce that tick rate to 15 milliseconds.  That cuts consumption about 25%.  Chrome for Windows, one millisecond no matter what background or foreground.  A clock tick apparently is a measure of how often Windows wakes the processor.  The processor sleeps while inactive, waking at predetermined intervals.  In other words, having Chrome open on Windows will basically keep the processor going.  It won't be able to sleep.  And this is something that's not so hard to fix.  And they say we have prioritized working on an update to fix the issue.  So the stopgap, if you're using Chrome, close it.  If it's in the background, don't put it in the background, just close it.  Apparently Mozilla and IE do not suffer from these issues.  On Macs, Macs work differently, so Chrome for Mac is not affected by this problem.  So, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know that white watch band?  Ugly?  It looks like you're a retiree in Florida wearing white shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought it made me look like Euro trash.  Oh, well, maybe, yeah.  Would you like to see my monkey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like it. It's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  So here's the deal on this. You're probably wondering.  We're talking about my Android Wear watch.  I got the LG specifically because it has a white band.  No, there's two. There's a black and there's like a kind of a goldish metal.  But the goldish metal comes with this ugly white band.  But here's the good news. It's a standard 22-millimeter watch band.  So you can replace it with any watch band.  So I'm just going to I just haven't gotten around to going out and buying some other watch bands.  I kind of I wanted everybody to know I'm wearing wear.  No question.  Why is Leo wearing that weird white rubber wrist thing that says wear watch?  Yep.  You can strap it to your forehead like glass.  He'll be off his parole soon.  I kind of like by the way, I kind of like when her where it is definitely not anything anybody needs to run out and get.  But if you use Google a lot like Google now, like you know, see it's a birthday and shows full screen the person's picture from Google+.  It says it's Adam Marshall's birthday today.  And he doesn't have much of a picture.  But I could see the Giants beat the Phillies in 14 innings.  That was last night.  A game that ended at one in the morning.  I could see stocks.  See that my Fire Phone shipped.  Hey, that's exciting.  Nice.  Nice.  These are notifications for various apps.  When you slide this over, I can see, you know, what the high will be, what the forecast is for four days and that kind of thing.  I don't know.  It's got my calendar, my steps.  How long is good.  These are all Google now.  And then it's got a picture, which is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Craig Newmark put up the picture, my birthday message with on his watch.  They look frightened.  He said he was frightened.  Yours was great.  I loved it.  It looked kind of scary.  Yeah, because you were like peering over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  This is a whole time when birthdays were like a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The fence.  No, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Aren't birthdays a big deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you mean?  You don't celebrate.  I mean, no, I do celebrate birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm saying like in a time, once upon a time, before social media, before I had this like really huge list of friends on various like a friend having a birthday was was an unusual occurrence.  But now every day three or four times a year.  Every day three or four friends.  It's somebody's birthday.  Not to devalue your birthday, Jeff.  Happy birthday, by the way.  No, I hate birthday.  I hate it.  I hate it.  Sorry I brought it up.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We'll get that.  It's just not a big deal.  Like it used to be if a friend had a birthday like we were going out and celebrating, it was a big deal and it was unusual rare occurrence.  And now I feel like I'm just birthdayed out of my goats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The internet, it ruins everything.  Even birthdays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even birthdays.  Social media has really ruined birthdays.  That's what I'm saying.  Facebook specifically.  But Google Plus does it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kardashian makes it all better, doesn't she?  And.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Give me K-stars, my birthday people.  I didn't know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean it comes the intro where it comes with a variety of watch faces.  I just have a plain digital watch face as you probably saw if you were watching the video.  But apparently they're going to have a new API that will let you do custom watch faces.  And I like the idea of having.  I mean that this one on this side.  I put on one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You can download them from the Play Store.  I don't know how they're doing it.  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People reverse the API.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Developers are hacking around the API.  And Google is actually asking developers to wait until they ship the API.  So you can kind of do it the right way or the way that Google wants you to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is what Wayne Piakarski posts.  As we work on finalizing the API, would we suggest not posting your apps publicly to Google Play.  Until there's a stable published API.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I hear.  Where'd you get that one?  That's nice.  They got one called squares and they got one called circles for the wait for the new one.  And it's very nice online.  But from a company called Smart Watch Face Company.  The only thing is I could be wrong.  I could be absolutely wrong about this.  But in my imagination, I think it actually increased the battery wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it increased?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We made the battery.  Oh, I like that one, Kevin.  That's not a standard.  That's not a stock face.  That's the Matrix one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a developer one.  It does that like the Matrix display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Probably should not download these though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, you download them from the app store on your phone and then you get this.  They show up as an option in the watch.  They basically reverse engineered the watch face API and they don't do any particular harm.  I don't think.  But they want to release a proper version of the API soon.  Now, that one's open source, the Matrix one.  I'll find the URL for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, cool.  That's cool.  I look forward to a dribble being filled with watch faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's I'm waiting for the Moto 360.  I want a round one.  Oh, yeah, we all do.  Yeah, we can make a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then we're going to see, you know, can Apple top this and it's topable, but we'll see what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm I'm.  There are those and, you know, everybody on Mac Break Weekly, I think, is in the category of  believers who think that Apple will will do what they did with the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad, reinvent the category.  And then there then I'm in the other set camp that I feel like I don't know if Apple's got the mojo anymore.  And I don't know if there's this is reinventable.  I hope I'm proven wrong.  I'd love to have something that I mean, this is right now just kind of nice.  It's nice.  It's nice.  It's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple's got an aesthetic and a sense of style that no other company has.  And there's aesthetics and style involved here.  So, you know, I mean, Apple can change this from like this is this is pretty cool to like I absolutely must have that because it's part of my identity.  And it's a statement about who I am.  And, you know, it's a fashion statement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think Apple's will certainly be more jewelry like.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, have you lost it after an Apple product in the last year and a half?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean, I'm sitting here on my Mac and I, you know, my iPhone, my development iPhone is the is the old 4S.  I've definitely looked at the newer iPhones, I guess, is the 5S.  You develop on a 4S.  I do.  I just I just never bought a new, you know, whatever.  And I have an iPad, too.  And there are times when I thought I should probably upgrade.  But there's such incremental upgrades.  No, it's never been like I have to have this.  Not in a long time.  I think the iPad maybe was the last time.  On Windows Weekly when you were complaining about your Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was on the Mac that I use for the show and I was going into the chat room to make fun of you and tell you to get a Chromebook.  Yeah.  But of course, my Mac crashed.  Macs are perfectly fine and I can do things on the Mac that I can't do on the Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I but I have I still have my Pixel and I was using it this morning.  I like my Pixel.  I like my Pixel.  I think a Chromebook is a specific is a tool for a very specific situation.  I don't think it's a universally appropriate computer.  All right.  We're going to get ready for our rants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just just one.  Just one.  But it's not what we've done often.  But I might have one, too.  But OK, you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's rant time.  Let's get ready to rant.  I'll get sued if I say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm thinking of replacing the number with the techno panic of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's quickly let me take a break and we'll get our rants of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  I didn't know that was a tease.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't telegraph it.  Yeah.  Telegraph it well enough.  You know, in just a moment, we'll have Jeff Chavez's Rant of the Week.  But first, this word from Full Sail University.  Full Sail offers both online and campus degree programs.  We've given you real world experience in the areas that I think people are really interested in.  Yes, social media marketing, but also search engine optimization, web metrics analytics,  online consumer behavior.  That's their marketing degree.  They have a online master's degree for people who want to keep up with modern marketing skills.  But they also have programs on entertainment, media, technology.  Full Sail University's online and campus degree programs center on real world education  and experience with industry, technology and workflow.  Through their innovative curriculum, you'll get your master's degree in a year.  That's nice.  They have a LaunchBox program.  That's the project LaunchBox that gives you a MacBook Pro preloaded with Apple's complete line of creative software tools,  as well as degree specific sets of pro level applications.  That's kind of nice.  In addition to internet marketing, Full Sail offers a variety of master's degrees in related fields, business intelligence.  You know, if you knew business intelligence, big data, you would be in big demand these days.  This is an area that is just about to explode.  Innovation, entrepreneurship.  Henry should do that.  Henry wants to become an entrepreneur.  And new media journalism.  Sorry, Jeff.  To learn more about Full Sail's master program in internet marketing or any of their related programs,  go to fullsail.edu slash twig, fullsail.edu slash T W I G.  We thank you so much for their support of this week in Google.  The right to be forgotten.  You know, there's the jury still out on whether this is I mean, at first, I completely dismissed it as as stupid.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy.  I'm winding you up, Jeff.  Oh, you're like a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what you are?  You're a human slate magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But now that I think about it, don't you think some people should be there needs to be some mechanism for people to kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, like like the guy who's based in the Netherlands who wanted the Wall Street Journal to take out the fact that it did a feature on a tantric workshop that he attended 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's not.  It was in the Wall Street Journal.  By the way, my theory is he knew the Sinatra effect would come into effect.  He wanted people to know he was a tantric expert.  He's certified ladies.  So the EU is now going farther.  They've invited in Google Bing and Yahoo who are going to come in to have a discussion about this.  And according to the Wall Street Journal, two even more important things are happening with this.  One is that now EU regulators are pressuring Google to stop telling the media properties and others whose links are taken down that they've been taken down.  So there's no opportunity to appeal.  The free speech right of these organizations is clearly affected.  Obviously, they're upset that newspapers when a story is taken down, as in the case of the Wall Street Journal tantric story, do a story about it because they have something called free speech.  They're allowed to EU get with it.  The second problem is the EU regulators are also, according to the journal, upset that Google is restricting the deletions to the country domains that the EU country domains so that not across Google dot com.  So here's the EU as far as I read that saying, no, we want to erase things for the whole friggin world.  Great precedent.  Put that in the hands of China and Iran.  Aren't you people thinking this is about about rights that I have operate in transactions.  And there's when you when you when you go so too far with your howitzer to kill the fly, you're affecting other rights.  And this is just dangerous and stupid.  And it's not going to live forever because it's it's affecting media companies and it's affecting journalism.  I said from the beginning it would.  And I just want to say one more time, it's stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I, you know, to me, I always focused on just the impracticability of it.  It's one. Obviously, it's stupid, but also it's impracticable for a lot of reasons.  I mean, they've already picked one, which is that this stuff is global.  But also, how's Google to know?  I mean, what's the process?  Is Google supposed to set up a tribunal?  Are they have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have. Oh, there's a whole large committee now to do this ridiculous.  They didn't ask me.  And they have they have paralegals doing it.  And now what's going to happen to is Bing is just catching up.  Bing hasn't been doing this. So now Bing is going to do it.  Have they been required to have?  Oh, yeah, they've been required to.  Google was the first.  So what you're going to see is uneven enforcement of this.  So Google takes this down.  You know, Google has has has rejected some.  There was one example in the journal story of something that said to some kind of service company.  No, this this link may be of interest to people who were considering using your services, you know, as in that this guy sucks.  There was a whole separate case having nothing to do with this in France where a woman was a blogger,  wrote about a restaurant, complained about the restaurant and was fined something like 4000 euros, some some fair sizeable amount of money.  Oh, this is ridiculous.  Because it was fine more was it was held more liable because she was more popular and her file, her post raised higher in Google search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So she was liable for being popular on Google and her and her post was really that she didn't think the service was very good.  Although admittedly, she was a little over the top the way she described it.  But she's welcome to welcome to the land of free speech.  Reviews. I mean, imagine if you as a reviewer for many years were subject to this kind of thing.  We don't like what you said about our movie, our TV show.  So we're going to have you pull it down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are still people, Leo, who want to find you for not liking Babylon five.  Well, and and well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But and Bill, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to show you something.  How do they square this with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, how do they square this with the legitimate reviewers in the press?  They don't she was fine.  Thirty four hundred dollars.  She was forced to pull down the negative review on her blog, which only a few thousand people see.  It's just bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It seems a societal issue, though, right?  And what's really sad is she now says I will never say bad things about a restaurant again.  It's too dangerous.  That's sad.  She's a French blogger, Caroline or Caroline Dude.  She wrote the place to avoid in Cap Ferre, Il Giardino.  Even and even, you know, she talked about the bad service and so forth.  And even the guy who owns a restaurant said, yeah, we were having a bad day.  I admit it.  But this is harming my business.  Yeah, that's the idea.  She she has three thousand followers.  The court, a Bordeaux judge said that's a significant number.  So we're going to find you.  You bad person.  You how dare you review that poorly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't people see the implications of these decisions?  Can't they see the the well, you know, unintended?  I mean, it would be generous to call them unintended consequences.  They're just idiocies, but they have an impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And incidentally, if you go to the way back machine, you can read the review.  She took it down, but it's still here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now it's a it's an article of note.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, now it should be available because it's part of this story.  Right. Yeah.  But of course, it should be available either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I could tell you, if I ever go to cap for a wherever the hell that is, I'm not eating at Ile Giardino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're convinced I'm convinced she was silenced.  So it must have been true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Must be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it makes it more true, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It just does seem like I don't know.  How do you solve this, though?  Jeff courts will do these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You you you you you rule to principle.  This is a problem with legislating and and and doing court decisions to technologies.  Gee, the Internet's made this worse.  If I mean, look at this way, would we tolerate what would the would Europe tolerate the idea that you go into every library and take out the the library catalog cards for books that people don't want you to find because they didn't like it.  We would never tolerate that.  So what makes the Internet OK to censor but books not because we think books are holy.  OK, well, the principle would say speech is speech no matter what the medium.  If you won't do it in books, don't do it on the Internet.  Right. And again, one more time, Europe of any place on Earth should see the danger and damage of rewriting history and restricting knowledge.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What World War Two?  There was no World War Two.  What are you talking about?  Jeff wrote a eulogy for for Forbes, which is now quite a eulogy.  And you actually got sold.  You talk about Louis of work and who kind of you said performed a miracle with Forbes by rescuing the dying brand, but he rescued it by killing the patient.  A bit a bit.  Good article.  Good blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, a little media wonky for the show.  Well, I'm a media wonk.  So naturally, the long and the short of it is that the brand was dying.  Dvorak is a really smart editor and he came in and he used as a candy for contributors to come in fifteen hundred, I think, contributors.  And again, I'm all in favor of being open, but the quality was not of the high quality that Forbes journalists had had.  And then they also opened it up to advertisers under what we now see going all over the world in native advertising, so-called under what they call brand voice.  So when I see a link to Forbes on Twitter, I hesitate three beats.  It could be a good journalist, could be a good contributor, could be a stupid bad contributor, and it could be just a really wordy ad for an advertiser.  I don't know which and that affects the brand.  It devalued.  And so, yeah, I did.  And they've still managed to get I'm, you know, I don't know how much money supposedly valued a force of money, but they were going to try to sell the whole thing.  They couldn't do that.  They maintain a lot of stock.  I'm guessing they probably got less than 200 million cash.  Forty five percent or more of that went to elevation partners.  So, you know, the thing's still alive.  He rescued it to that extent.  But, yeah, I think the baby in the bath water are out the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I, of course, always admiring your sagacity and your intuition and insight, like the line where you say, and I can't wait to read this white paper you're writing that we have to shift to businesses based on known relationships with people as individuals.  And as communities rather than as a mass.  And that's what we do at Twit.  And I think this white paper will put you to sleep.  Guaranteed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm trying to finish and finish the editing this or do my first run of editing this week.  And it's I have to do it because what I do, you know, I'm in university.  But now you don't want to.  But no, but this is what we kind of do instead of mass media use the title of the medium post is no mass mass media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which I like.  But it's what we do.  We don't do mass media.  We do.  I think of us as artisanal media handcrafted for an intelligent audience all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I met the new president of Guardian US today and I was just telling him about the wonders of Twig today.  Oh, good.  It's a great example of how you can focus exactly.  You can focus on a you can be entrepreneurial at a low cost and B you focus on communities and understand what the community is doing.  You focus on communities and understand what the communities want and keep your ear open to the communities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Well, you have to now.  You really have to.  And Kevin Marks, you said you had something to rant about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this was partly because I was listening to the show last week and you were talking about the Google plus names thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why you're on the show.  All right.  I forgot about that.  So I screwed this up royally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and the ramp was my the round that I did it.  Google I.O. ignite if which you can play if you want.  But I can give you a recap of it instead.  And it comes down to the way programmers tend to simplify the world and then get grumpy when the world doesn't fit their simplification.  And that Google real names is a huge example of that because it wasn't it wasn't ever you have to have a real name.  It was you have to have a name that our algorithm thinks is a name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I accidentally started playing it, but we'll we'll play it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perfect. Perfect. Like it's just five minutes.  It's that's one of the beauties of ignite talks.  Yes, they don't take that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want to take five minutes.  I bought you know, we'll play it at the end of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so the so the so the thing you were saying is you were referring to it as real names and verify names.  That was not that was only for the appeals procedure.  The point was that if you put up a thing that they thought wasn't a name, then they would get into an argument with you over whether that was really your real name or not.  And then you'd have to send government documents to the to Google and things like that.  Whereas what they what they had said consistently was you just have to have something that looks like a name to us because we want things that look like names because then we'll have a better community because people will think they're the other people are real people.  So all it did was incent the spammers to use American looking names.  So it was it was you know, it was disaster from beginning to end.  I'm glad they finally stopped doing that.  And that's good. But in the sort of the presumption that it ever did anything to make a better conversation, I think is is wholly unproven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, that's fair. Yeah, that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I understand why they felt it would help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But but you know, they're supposed to measure these things.  It's saying, well, maybe that's what happened.  Maybe they did in the face of face of everything.  Well, yeah, but for three years, it's a long time.  There was a there was an internal political fire.  I've heard like when I started writing about it on Twitter, I got stuff from people who Google at the time saying, well, the best thing is we don't have to argue about it internally at TGAF anymore.  Well, it demonstrably didn't do what it because as you point out, spammers just made up real looking names.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's all. Yeah. So really, the policy wasn't to have real names, the policy to have real looking names.  That's not a very good policy. That's doomed to failure.  Right. And the point is, you need to look at behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've got a chat room here that anyone can be any name they like.  And half of them are like Web XYZ.  But they get kicked out if they do something dubious.  Yeah, we base it on behavior.  And the problem with that is that that's the that actually involves takes work.  And that's why Google is wary of it.  They don't like doing things that require humans.  We can do it only because we have a fabulous crew of volunteers, as many as 15 or 20 volunteers who spend a lot of time in the chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what we learned, of course, is that you have to make it on behavior because bad behavior, whether it's in a real name or not, is a very bad behavior.  Bad behavior, whether it's in a real name or not, just degrades the place to the point where nobody wants to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. And names. I've long said that as long as we can, I can I can name a holes by name ergo name doesn't stop you from being an a hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Let us it's time, I think. Thank you, Kevin, for correcting that.  It's time, I think, to talk about our tip tool number of the week, Kevin.  I'll let you do the honors because you don't have an official role in all of this.  If you'd like to give us something you're excited about every time you've done this, by the way, it's been something addictive that I'm mad about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The link I've just I've put it is just a silly thing that I thought was wonderful.  And I think you'd like to see. So just look at my first Lincoln.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Perfect for geeks. Yes, this is Ali Spaniola, Spaniola, who discovered that she needs to be wearing one of these at all times.  This is some sort of Steadicam for your beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a steady can, but you say it can for beers so you can dance and you'll be able to stay stable.  Because you were talking about beer as we were waiting for the show.  Yes, I thought this is something is this fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't. How does this work? How does this work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is how Steadicam do work. They isolate the they isolate the movement of the gyroscopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all with gyroscopes. I don't know, Kevin. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm not buying it. If they were to make this, I think it would be very, very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm you know, I've seen I've seen Steadicams that do do that, but I thought may well be not that well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that looks. He's he's being careful not to go too near it. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of mesmerized. This guy's like the dancing baby.  The poor man. He's doing this forever. I can't stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually a really good question. I've been meaning to ask when you stop watching an animated GIF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did they stop moving?  The tree fall in the forest. Does the light stay on in the refrigerator?  I mean, I'm really puzzled like like, is there a universe of animated cat gifts right now?  They're just frozen doing stuff or they all just go or they just all say, well, I have a smoke.  What happens to the animated GIF when no one's watching?  GIF like no one's watching GIF like just call me Bishop Leo.  Only Kevin will get that joke. And it's a very long way to go to get it.  Yes, you got it though, didn't you? It took him a little while.  The Kevin's Ignite talk is at the official Google Developers blog or YouTube channel.  And is it is it all of it on here or no, just your talk?  Oh, no, you're in a portion of it. So you're forty six twenty six in.  I put the link with my timestamp. Aren't you a smart man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. I love it. I did a talk once and I think I'm going to be able to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, I love it. I did a talk once and I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is I that's the thing I would actually recommend to people is that Ignite talks are both fun to watch and fun to do.  They're fun to watch because you get ten of them.  They're five minutes long. So even if one's bad, you can just zone out for a bit.  They usually come with beer and audience participation, but they're actually fun to do.  So the pattern is you get 20 slides that also advance every 15 seconds.  Period. That's it.  So this means that you have to practice.  You can't just sit there and stand there and waffle and go on for an hour.  You have to make sure what you say will fit with, which means that the talks get better, too.  But then when you're actually doing one, you can never like lose your place for more than 15 seconds.  Next slide will come up. So it can be comedic.  It's kind of like a slam. And then it comes back.  It comes back later. And yeah. And they and Brady Forest runs these all over the place.  They're often at conferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they were invented by O'Reilly, weren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brady Forest runs it for O'Reilly.  There was a thing called Pecha Kucha, which was the same idea with slightly different timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which, by the way, is not pronounced Pecha Kucha, but I cannot pronounce how it's supposed to be pronounced.  OK, if you go look up the audio, there's an audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's because it's a Japanese word. It was designed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's something else. It's like Indonesian or something.  Finnish. Finnish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  OK, it says it was devised in Tokyo in February 2003.  But maybe it's a Finnish name. 20 images in 20 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  20 slides for 20 seconds each. So by 20 seconds.  It's 20 slides in 15 seconds. It makes it short. It makes it fun.  I like Ignite better.  It is a Japanese term, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you search on Pecha Kucha, the first YouTube video...  Hiya!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hiya!  Hiya!  Hiya!  Hiya!  Hiya!

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  P-E-C-H-A-K-U-C-H-A. I'll leave as an exercise for the viewer. Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know why this joke is so funny, but you got me with that one, Lino.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You have to watch our video of... What is it called? Pronunciation Book? The YouTube channel?  I forget that it was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, the one that just pronounced everything wrong.  They pronounced everything wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pronunciation Guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Pronunciation Guide. YouTube.com slash Pronunciation Guide.  You can't stop laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have, I think, a 10-minute video that I have shown everyone in the office.  And not one time has not... Every single time I show it to them, everyone busts out laughing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of them is real. So somebody did it real, for real, and then somebody said, that's bad.  Then they did a fake one. And I think it's pronunciation manual?  I wonder if they have Pecha Kucha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Propolio? The Hilaki-Tac.  Propolio? Canolio-Nanolio.  Canolio? Nananolio.  I wonder if Pecha Kucha's on here.  E-s-ma. E-f-s-s-d-ma. E-f-s-s-ma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's good for...  Man-jam-ma. Man-jam-ma. Man-jam-ma.  Man-jam-ma. Man-jam-ma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Whoever did this was truly inspired.  Gina, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually, before I do my tip, I just got an email, the subject line from Amazon.  Congrats! Here's a list of your apps that have been approved for the Fire Phone.  Yay!  Yes, my app got approved for the Fire Phone, and I guess the Fire Phone's coming out,  because you've got a shipping notification and I've got an app approval notification.  So, we'll be seeing the Fire Phone soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will get mine tomorrow. They announced it'll come out, it's going to come a day early.  And I'll be reviewing it both on the radio show this weekend, I'll show it on Twitter,  and then I'll do a full review on Before You Buy on Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see the... Pogue has now hit the depths of desperation.  The absolute depths of... you've got to watch this Pogue thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, now everybody, as usual, with a new phone, Walt Mossberg got it,  The Verge got it, Gizmodo got it. Did Pogue get one?  Oh, where is it? Oh, are you guys...  It's on his tech channel, I'm sure.  It's the word...  David Pogue, no longer with the New York Times, maybe he doesn't get these things.  A spark of potential, is it that one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  J-Rogue, was that... he plays an old professor or something?  David really is a character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, it's really just...  This is the ad, we're going to have to skip the ad, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Desperate thing you've ever seen. J-Rosen tweeted me tweeting it today,  let me see if I can find it.  If you mute your video, I can play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, go ahead.  This is not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In the touchscreen phone era, gestures have taken on a new meaning.  No, this is not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, this is beyond, beyond, beyond belief how awful it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I got a review unit too, by the way, on the list.  A box came, I was so excited, I opened it on Saturday,  I was very excited, UPS box from AT&T, Dallas.  Inside, I opened it, I didn't know what to expect,  because I didn't know what was going to come, they didn't tell me ahead of time.  I opened it up, oh, there's a fire phone inside.  I opened it up, there was no phone in the box.  What?  What?  It's an empty box.  They, we contacted the people, the PR company, they said,  what? No, we sent you a phone, UPS must have stolen it.  I don't think so.  I don't think so, I looked at it, and it was nicely sealed.  Anyway, we sent it all back to them and said, you figure it out,  there was no phone in here.  Fortunately, I videoed the opening of it, so they, that I have proof that I did not, no sleazy fans.  Oh, you did an unboxing, that's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, all right, all right, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here it is, I got it, I got the link here in the chat room.  Thank you, ScooterX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a smart watch, I'm sorry, it's a smart watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, smart watch, this is not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Smart watch OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was the, the Walt Mossberg review of the Fire Phone.  He thought it was, I would pretty much agree with him, he thought it was nothing to get excited about.  All right, keep going, Gina, what else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, let me do my tip, my tip, and you know what, and I realized that we haven't talked a lot about Bitcoin here on this show.  I'm not sure why.  I'm sort of fascinated by Bitcoin mostly because of the technology versus the sort of, you know, the gold digging community.  I feel like they're the technologists and they're the gold diggers.  I'm more on the technology side of it, because it is a fascinating technology.  But Google now supports Bitcoin conversions from the search box.  I'm not sure if you covered this in last week's show, and I wasn't here.  But you can, you can go, so you can go to the Google search box, probably already know you can do currency conversion for all different kinds of currencies.  So you can say, you know, 10 US dollars in euro, and it'll tell you how many euros.  Well, now you can do 10 USD to BTC or in BTC.  So BTC is the abbreviation for Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  BTC is for Bitcoin, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you can see how much Bitcoin converts to US dollars.  And this is a graph of how you're losing money in Bitcoin.  And a graph of how you're losing money in Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, that's actually vice versa, how you're gaining money now.  How you're gaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One Bitcoin, six hundred twenty bucks.  It's kind of stabilized around that number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's kind of stabilized around six hundred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And this is courtesy of Coinbase, which is which is a kind of which is a pretty good Bitcoin wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the one I use, I think.  I can't remember.  But they don't translate Dogecoin.  They don't. Nobody translates Dogecoin.  That's why we use Dogecoin.  We don't want to be part of the corporate oligarchical structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Once once Google started doing this, I tried to add BTC to my stocks on Google now.  And it was it was an option.  But it now it but it just never shows up.  So I can go in my stock settings and put BTC.  So it's I mean, it's not it's not a stock, right.  It's a virtual currency.  But it's kind of interesting to see Google.  It feels like a moment of mainstream.  Yes. Bitcoin.  Bitcoin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's the what do you call them?  The the twins.  Oh, the Winklevi.  The Winklevi Twins.  A launching exchange traded Bitcoin fund whose symbol will be coin.  COIN really?  On the on the on.  Yes. So you can buy Bitcoin over the over the counter.  Oh Lord.  From E-Trade or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh from E-Trade or whatever.  Yeah.  I'm figuring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Same way you've got dollar tracking ones.  They've been going through the regulatory nonsense to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And he's going to be he's going to make money in Bitcoin.  It'll be the Winklevoss twins.  Jeff, you have a number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I want to mention this first that the God bless you America.  One million sixty seven thousand seven hundred seventy nine people sent comments to the FCC about net neutrality.  If you want to feel a little bad about democracy, that's less than the one point four million that went to the FCC over Janet Jackson's nipple.  But let's remember that was mainly about angry bots sending the message.  So really, is it true that the wardrobe malfunction at the Super Bowl?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The complaints were coming from bots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in essence, parents television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, they were. Yeah, they were people, but they were people with.  So this week I give you a choice, Leo.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The 10 questions that are now banned from Google interviews because they were too stupid or 15 top Eric Schmidt isms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, God, those are both great.  How can I pick?  Can you do one from each?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just go, why don't you go to the Schmidt isms and pick?  You're going to put this on me here.  A lot of what he says he's right about and it's wrong.  And he says he said to me once it's death by Twitter.  It's out of context.  Nonetheless, they're pretty funny.  I don't know. I think some of them are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Some of them are very.  I complain so much about crappy CEO interviews that I really should support this.  I do, too.  Here's a guy who speaks his mind, however crazy it is.  One day we had a conversation where we figured out we could just try and predict the stock market.  And then we decided it was illegal.  So we stopped doing that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The pictures help.  Google's staggering collection of personal info.  Would you prefer someone else?  Is there a government you would prefer to be in charge of this?  Which I actually agree with.  I see why people are getting caught on Google Street View.  With Street View, we drive by exactly once.  So you could just move.  We come. You see us come and get out of the way.  On chance, serendipity can be calculated now.  We can actually produce it electronically.  What does that even mean?  All right, let's do it.  Okay, those are the Schmidtisms.  And let's just try.  Give me one interview question banned from Google interviews.  Go ahead and pick your way through.  Oh, it's a slideshow.  Round manhole covers, because everybody knows why manhole covers are round to look like the nest thermostat.  Piano tuners.  How many piano tuners are there in the world?  Well, the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  We'd answer however many the market dictates.  If pianos need tuning once a week, and it takes an hour to tune a piano,  and a piano tuner works eight hours a day for five days a week,  40 pianos need tuning each week, we'd answer one for every 40 pianos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And then you're supposed to show that work,  and then show maybe some calculations about roughly how many pianos there might be.  It doesn't matter if you get the answer right on these.  Dead beef.  People don't do these anymore, do they?  They don't do this anymore.  I think it's deprecated.  These are the banned ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are the bad ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, what's a good one, Kevin Marks?  If you were going to hire me tomorrow for British Telecom, what would you like to know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the thing is that these brain teaser things were very popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But they don't actually tell you anything useful,  because they just tell you whether you've seen that kind of question before.  It's like any of these assessment things.  They're too well known now.  My son's teaching SAT prep this week,  and he's helping students get their SAT scores up a lot.  Which you're not supposed to do in theory, it's supposed to be an objective assessment,  but actually if you sit down and do 10 tests in a week,  and look at what you got wrong, you can get better at this stuff.  And it's like any of these things.  Any of these assessment things don't actually make sense.  There was a really good article on model view culture,  which I'll stick in the chat,  about how we do engineering recruitment,  and how it ends up being a are you like me question,  rather than a is this useful.  It referred to Joe Spolsky's Gorilla Guide to Interviewing,  which Joe then took off the internet because he was ashamed of the old version of it.  But the original version of that, of his guide,  is very much sort of gleefully saying the arm wash masses are stupid,  and I need to find the bright ones,  and the bright ones will understand these things that I'm saying to them.  And they are, literally it was the piano tuner in Chicago question,  and it's those kinds of things.  And what it comes down to is, are you,  and the other thing he says, he said in the original piece was,  take something that they say that you know is true,  and say well that can't be true,  and get them to defend it.  So basically troll them in the interview to see how they respond to it.  Which is, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why troll your interviewees?  Let's just have a civil conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's put someone in a terrible power relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're selecting people who are in crappy chat rooms.  Sorry, so it's you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, I was going to say,  let's put someone who's totally not in a,  someone in a power position,  someone who's disempowered,  and then have the person in power say you're wrong,  then see how the disempowered person reacts.  It's like ridiculous.  You know, I haven't done a developer and engineer interview in years and years,  because I've been lucky enough to freelance,  and to start my own business and all that.  But I just, I really want to be in one of these interviews where they ask,  what was it in the internship,  if you were shrunk down a half an inch and stuck at the bottom of the blender,  how would you get out?  Because I would like to just look at the interviewer in the face and be like,  is this the question that you're deciding whether or not to hire?  Because if this is the question,  then this is not the right place for me to work,  and get up and walk out.  Because it's true, it's just so indicative of stupidity.  I mean, it's fun to look in this article now,  what questions have been banned,  but it's so crazy that Google fell into this trap.  It's hard, you know what, it's very hard to hire people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's extremely difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's extremely difficult.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Getting people to actually write some code, it can be a good thing.  Getting them to write, you know, that's not necessarily a bad idea.  Getting them to do it on a whiteboard may not be ideal.  And Google itself has backed away from this.  Now, when I was interviewing for Google, there was a list of banned questions.  There was also a sort of pool of these are fairly good questions,  what you think in an internal discussion, or to try and make them better.  But it was still very hard to not get people to play gotcha when they're interviewing.

Transcript:  I've got to wrap this up because this is the party for the third anniversary of the Brickhouse,  and there's a lot of people gathering.  It was three years ago tomorrow, but we're not going to be here tomorrow,  so three years ago tomorrow that we opened the Brickhouse for the first time, July 24th, 2011.  Three years!  I know, is that hard to believe?  Easy!  We had a big parade and everything.  So we've got pizza, thank you.  And we've got a pretty good audience, so thank you all for being here.  We're going to celebrate in just a bit.  Coming up tech news tonight, I've got to end though with David Pogue's review of wearable watches.  I think this is the one.  This is the depth, yes.

Transcript:  Welcome back, students.  In this virtual class, we examine the desperately primitive early efforts of your ancient ancestors  to develop technologies for the...  What is he wearing, a sleep mask?  ...learning about these crude devices is useful for context.  Without knowing where we've been, how can we know where we're going?  In previous virtual meetings, we've looked at the Univac One,  one of the earliest computers,  the Apple II showing the computer shrinking to desktop size,  and of course the Newton, representing the further shrinking to the size...  Alright, I can't bear this, so thank you very much.  It's just desperate.
