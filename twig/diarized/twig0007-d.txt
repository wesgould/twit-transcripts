Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Howdy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  With a tip of the hat to Jake who got your sound working.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Without him, I'm nothing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is Jake, Jake's a junior or a senior?  He's a senior now.  So this is the big, this is, I know my senior.  This is the big push right now for college stuff.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We're through the midst of all that.  He's about to go out and see more colleges.  He spent the summer at Carnegie Mellon.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I'm going to look at a few more.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think CMU is in his future?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's a good shot.  It's a great computer science.  It's that thing I'm sure you're going through now too of early decision and where do you put all your eggs?  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Abby wants to do early decision at Brown.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's, ooh, that's a great one.  Yeah, if she can get in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  GQ just named it the douchiest campus in America.  Which if you ask me is really a recommendation.  Yeah, that's a good thing.  GQ hates you.  You're set.  Also with us for the first time and we're really glad to have him.  Gina is taking the week off because I think she's got a move.  She's involved in moving right now, but she's nominated an excellent replacement.  Somebody who's already replaced her once, the editor in chief of Lifehacker, Adam Pash is with us.  Hi, Adam.  Hey, how's it going?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Great to have you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How long ago did you take over the reins at Lifehacker?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Well, I've been working at Lifehacker since November of 2005, kind of side by side with Gina.  Obviously, she was always in the driver's seat.  I took over for her in January of this year.  Great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And how's that been?  It's been great.  Lifehacker's maintained its excellent quality.  In fact, if anything, you've added more content and it's really grown nicely.  I really love it.  Thank you.  In fact, we find ourselves frequently linking to Lifehacker in all of our shows, but especially in this week in Google.  Awesome.  So is Google 10 years old or 11 years old or what?  I guess we should resolve this before we go any further.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's 11 if you look at their formal business filing, but they don't count that as an anniversary.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They did that on September 7th, 11 years ago.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. That's what I understand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they're saying that, no, really it's the 27th when Google went online.  That's when, well, but they were online before they're, I don't know.  It's all very confusing.  Well, anyway, they're still young.  Happy birthday month to Google.  And in honor, they celebrated by doing something very important, very significant.  You know what I'm talking about.  They increased the size of the search box.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, as you get older, your eyesight goes.  So, of course, you have to make all the type bigger.  I also saw immediately there was a Grease Monkey script to make it smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Inevitably.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bigger, wider, bigger, taller, bigger what?  It doesn't look different to me, but I guess I'm not just not that sophisticated.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  The text inside, I believe, is larger.  And I think the text box itself is a touch larger.  But I actually went to it this morning and tried typing in it and it didn't look bigger.  So I don't know if this is one of those slow Google rollouts or I'm just crazy  because I'm not seeing any difference on my Google.com search.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It just shows you how psychological it is because it's looking bigger to me.  But now I thinking, well, I don't know. Is it really bigger? I don't know.  I can't even.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Plus they also increase the type size when you type in it and when it gives you presumptive links back.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, actually, I'm seeing larger now. I just went and it's definitely bigger.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It feels bigger. It's bigger than certainly the type in the upper left hand corner that gives you the other choices.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Yeah. And they've actually the buttons have changed in look and size a little bit to the Google search in the app.  I'm feeling lucky. This very exciting stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Marissa Meyer wrote a whole blog post about it. Of course, this is her job.  How excited they are.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I guess things are getting pretty quiet at Google these days.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, look, everybody. Now, quick, don't look. Everybody look away from the Google site.  Don't look at it. Don't look at the search box and see if you can answer this question from who wants to be a millionaire.  Did you see this? There was it was a question on who wants to be a millionaire.  And it was about the colors in the Google logo.  And let me see if I can find the exact question so I can see how smart you are.  I actually got this right, but I think it was mostly because I guessed.  Um, here's the question.  This was on August 17th. Which of the following is a true statement about the letters in the standard Google logo?  A. Both O's are yellow. Don't look. Both O's are yellow.  B. Both G's are blue.  C. The L is red.  Or D. The E is green.  Now, since I haven't I don't usually visit the Google front page, I think I'm at a disadvantage. Adam, do you know?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  I'm going to say C. The L is red.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And C. Final answer. Final answer. C. The L is red.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, it's not. It's I don't think it's. No, it's not.  Now they're looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's it's no. Both G's are blue. I guess that makes sense with their. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If yeah, but that's a tough. I hope they I hope the woman won a million bucks if she got it right.  Isn't that funny how you could stare at something day in day out for years, 11 years and not know.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you know, it's blog a scoped also put up a link.  I put it up on the friend feed of the changes in the search results page over the last five years.  And they have images side by side. And you've really got to be anal to figure it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what are the changes? How is it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Hold on. The ad box changes background color from blue to yellow.  One assumes that made them about a billion dollars.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Probably did, though, right? I mean, it probably did.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's exactly that's the only reason they'll do things right.  Yeah. The logo there got smaller. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The logo is smaller. Look at that search box search button.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  On the other hand, got bigger. The blue bar changes color and is brighter now.  I remember Marissa has written about that, about how they will look at 40 blues and test every single blue and A, B tests.  And so this is the perfect blue.  The result with is restricted to a maximum.  The phrase similar pages has been shortened to similar.  Google does not show the file size anymore for every page.  I think it's a tribute to bandwidth in America. Yeah.  The text sponsored links at the right hand is left align not centered at other billion dollars.  Let's see the link to the definitions of your search words is pointing to answers.com instead of dictionary.com.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's probably a business deal. That is. Yeah.  Isn't that interesting that when you're this big and there are this many, I don't know how many billions of searches a day,  something so, so, so tiny could probably make a huge difference in revenue.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Google is ruled by metrics. Right. And testing and data wins and they think data is not political.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that data. That's a very good point. Data has no, no, no agenda.  That is data. There's no spin in the data. Wow.  I feel I feel manipulated.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or you should feel served. Yeah, maybe that's it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Also, another story. Google is is is built is going solar.  The Google has always been focused on how much energy they use. They're very clear about how much energy they use.  They want to do. They want to be green. Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. Google converted its to to plug in hybrids plugging into their own solar panels on campus.  This latest story is that they want to invent mirrors for solar farms that are, I think, four times more efficient because that would reduce the cost to them.  Now, I think solar power solar power to them, I think the story said was like 18 cents a kilowatt hour.  And they want to get everything cheaper than coal, which I think was about eight cents a kilowatt hour.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  We're going to talk. Go ahead, Dan. Yeah, sorry. You guys know and Google.  They've got goats mowing their lawns, right? Yeah, I had goats mowing my lawn.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I actually did this first. I did it before Google did it. We had two acres and I didn't want to mow it.  It wasn't a green thing. I just didn't want to have to sit on my riding mower all day every day.  So we got goats. But I'm sure Google has learned this because goats, you know, in fact, there are people in my neck of the woods who will rent a herd of goats to eat your poison oak and other weeds that you don't want.  You can't get rid of the goats.  I'll eat anything. But I didn't. Here's the key. And I hope that this is just a tip for Sergey and and the gang.  Don't feed the goats. The goats need to be hungry for this to work.  My wife would buy bales of alfalfa and the goats said, what do you mean? We're not eating grass.  We got alfalfa. They never ate any grass at all. Did you own them? Were they goats?  And the problem with goats. Yeah, we named them. What were they? It was a daisy. And I can't remember their names.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I was hoping one would be John Deere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I had a John Deere. I had a John Deere. So we ended up because the goats are too smart.  The goats, goats get out. They get in problems. They come in the house. They climb on top of your car.  They like to be. Well, they like to be in the highest spot. They're mountain goats, you know, they're mountain dwellers.  So we ended up trading them in for sheep. The sheep didn't eat the grass either, by the way.  I could see Larry and Sergey going through this exact thing.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  You goats! Data test. You just go. Get off building 43.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want to talk about actually something a little more serious, which is the controversy over Google and 911 in just a second.  Yes, it's time for a commercial. This show now has commercials.  Yay. Yay. Two of them. First of all, we want to welcome Squarespace.  We thank them for supporting the show and audible.com. They've been on before.  They're back on a regular basis. And they said, you'll like this, Jeff. You can recommend any book you want.  Just don't recommend Jeff's book. Hey, I don't think you should take it personally.  I think they just figure everybody knows about what would Google do. And I've got to plug it, darn it.  You can plug it all you want. And we'll mention it. We'll say we'll say that it's in there.  But it's just that can't be our book pick of the week, I guess. I don't know.  But I do actually want to talk about Squarespace. First of all, either of you ever use Squarespace or know about Squarespace?  Very cool. I keep hearing about it. I haven't used it yet. Yeah.  They've been a sponsor on a number of our shows for some time.  And we actually we tried them out by moving all of our our blogs over to Squarespace.  If you want to take a look at inside dot twit dot tv, that's our in-house blog. What a great move this was.  It is it is not just blogging software, though.  It's hosting and it's software that makes it possible to do a variety of really remarkable things.  You can host a blog, of course, but you can also it's got photo galleries, forums, amazing stats, stat pages.  The templates are gorgeous.  Anytime you're thinking about setting up a page, and I think this is kind of the trend these days, you might want to I host my own stuff and I'm starting to think what a mistake this has been.  You let the pros do the hosting. Squarespace dot com.  Very affordable, but you can try it absolutely free if you go to Squarespace dot com slash twig Squarespace dot com slash twig.  You can give it a try and take a look at all they have to offer.  Very easy to try it too because they have seamless blog importing from movable type WordPress, type pad and blogger.  Incredible templates that will get you up and running very quickly.  But then customization couldn't be simpler.  In fact, it's it's using Ajax, so it's drag and drop so you can very quickly change how how you do it.  Squarespace is just is just really a remarkable solution.  They've always been able to import WordPress blogger type pad and movable type, but they've even improved their blogging tool they just announced.  I just saw this on TechCrunch.  A new blog importing tool that will get almost you know just everybody just enter the credentials and it all gets sucked in.  They have submitted an iPhone application which will make it very easy to post that should be up there very soon.  This is just an incredible solution for you if you're looking to set up your first website or if you've got a website and you want to move it somewhere where it will always be up, always be running.  This is the way to do it. Squarespace dot com slash twig try it absolutely free.  The trial version will win you over though. I gotta warn you. Squarespace dot com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.  So 9-11 was yesterday and you know Google with these doodles has been pretty clear that they're going to do they're going to say things about kind of lightweight things not necessarily about national holidays religious holidays and in this case they didn't do anything about 9-11.  But a lot of people were offended by that.  Adam do you think that that's something.  Fox News.  Yeah Fox News maybe not a lot of people but I've seen some blog stuff in the blogosphere.  Do you think Google should be doing some sort of commemoration of a 9-11 or is that just too narrow?  You know I guess I personally don't feel.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Google has set up this expectation that for everything that comes around there's going to be some sort of a custom Google homepage image.  But Google's also become such a giant corporation that they're so careful I think or a lot more careful now than they used to be.  I feel like have they done it. They've done it.  That's a good question. Have they done it in the past. I don't know.  No I don't think they have.  Have they not?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They never have.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't think they have and I think that when they use that space for serendipitous things like Halloween and Aliens of Ducky Nose then to me to have thrown in 9-11 would have been I think even in poor taste.  Yeah.  And it's a kind of reverse political correctness test that anybody can be offended by anything in this country anymore.  And so they just yell that Google should be doing what I think they should do.  But most days of the year they don't do crap with that.  At the same time however they bragged on their official blog that they were the heart of.  I'm trying to look it up here right now.  A 9-11 history feature put out by I think the official library of the 9-11 library memorial that allows people to put up their stories against Google Maps.  And it's really quite good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's more serious and certainly that's a more valuable application.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Far more value.  Then what are they going to do?  You know change the L into one of two towers.  Right.  The doodle is so lightweight.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And yet I look at what Microsoft did with Bing and I think it's actually quite beautiful and appropriate.  It's a different thing.  But they have that whole picture on Bing.  They showed the memorial which is the lights where the tower was shining up into the sky.  It's just gorgeous.  And then they have well it's now maybe this does trivialize it because then below they have some New York related searches but it's check the weather in New York and find events in New York.  So it does in some way trivialize it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh algorithms will get you every time.  Yeah they will.  I just found the references to something called Make History at the National September 11th Memorial and Museum.  And it uses the Google Maps API and you just wander around there.  And I was there that day at the World Trade Center and was a block away from the South Tower when it came down.  So I have visions seared in my brain and I found a whole new video there I'd never seen before that just brought back the real feeling of being there that day after the towers came down.  And so that's a far more powerful statement.  I think that Microsoft is in a more difficult position because they couldn't put a cute cat picture on that day.  Google is just Google every day.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well and also these these both these companies are international companies.  And so I see that they might not want to do something that's so specifically American and yet 9-1-1 I think everybody worldwide is very aware of it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well Adam Leo do you know when they change the American logo does that change internationally?  Do they do specific things for Germany or France?  You know do they do cheese logos on French Cheese Day or whatever?  I don't know.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  I would imagine they do have localization don't you?  Bing or Google?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well both actually.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Either but I think Google's doodles are worldwide.  Well but we have like they have a Thanksgiving they always do a Thanksgiving logo and is that worldwide?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's very that's no that's very US effective.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Well no I mean do they do it does it show worldwide?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I guess the chat we have web 131 saying no it's international and then we have Dom R say no Google doesn't do that.  Google's different in each country says no one so we have no agreement in chat that's new.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Dom R who lives in the UK says we see the US logos in the UK.  On the other hand Steve H who lives in Canada says you know Canada has Thanksgiving Day but it's a month earlier and he says we see the Thanksgiving logo in October in Canada and of course we see it in November in the US.  So I don't know that's very you know that's kind of interesting but they just it's something new that nobody ever had to think about before.  It's true for us too as shows on the internet we're global and we you know for a long time I was doing audible recommendations that were US only and stuff and don't worry your audience will make you aware of that.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Yeah we always get all kinds of complaints when we post about something on Lifehacker and it turns out to be US only.  Yeah.  It's always tough to know you have to like to make that check I don't know like proxying from another country to test everything because a lot of things just don't tell you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I but I think that's a lesson that we're learning that's a that I'm glad to learn.  I think that's a great lesson and I love it that we're international and I know that Google's very aware of this and come to think of it if you saw it maybe these people are looking at Google.com and if they go to Google.ca or Google.co.il as one of our Israeli listeners.  One of our Israeli listeners says they're going to see localized stuff at that site I'm sure because they certainly get localized languages.  So I'm sure they would get localized stuff.  So a tempest in a teapot the 911.  I agree a doodle isn't really the right way to do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know and I'm not I'm not a necessarily a religious Fox News basher but it was it was a fairly obvious stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah they're going to they're going to say something about it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah yeah to say this is a patriotic test and you failed.  Yeah you know what can you do.  It's the state everybody wants to shoot at Google these days.  They're the biggest target around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the state of journalism in the in the US right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've seen these articles bring back the small search box just cracks me up.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not just bring it back but create a script for that's going to be the Adam can do.  I couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Love it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Article in the Washington Post Google economist sees good signs in searches.  I didn't even know Google had a chief economist but it does.  How very in.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He's brilliant.  You know I haven't met him but but he's pretty amazing and really is I think critical to Google strategic success because he does see these big trends.  He said in this article that that he sees financial recovery because they already know that Google is a good predictor of the job numbers by people looking for jobs.  They're seeing an uptick in housing.  So I went into Google trends myself and I started looking upwards like unemployment and housing a little bit off.  But what what what interested me was the Google you know the bottom half of Google trends is news media references.  And every single one I looked at was coming up.  It looks like they haven't.  I guess it looks like down there.  They they haven't.  I wonder whether they've added more sources and they haven't regularize that or something.  But anyway if you look at things like jobs in Google and stock in trends it's quite amazing to see.  But if you look at the long term trends in 2004 you really get a different picture.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is the amazing thing about search.  And it's one of the things that people talk a lot about with Twitter.  Friend feed and others is the metadata or the additional data that you can extrapolate by collecting a lot of content and looking at it.  Is Twitter better situated to do that than Google?  It seems like Google's got everything including all the Twitter data.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Well I mean I think the thing about Twitter that always I guess makes it pits them against Google and makes Google probably a little nervous is how.  Whatever. It's what everyone always talks about the real time search.  But you know yesterday afternoon I don't know if you guys read about it but there was the space shuttle was going to land in Florida and there was weather or something.  And they ended up landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.  And the space shuttle I think re-entered the atmosphere above Los Angeles somewhere.  And two like loud sonic booms that scared the crap out of everyone.  Because it was unexpected.  Yeah. No one knew what was happening.  And the first place that I looked to see what was going on is Twitter because I know it's going to be the first place that like it's going to be I can search that and it'll be published and it'll be indexed and I can find it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think Google is certainly aware of that.  Adding Google News into the universal search was the first attempt to do that.  But they're not good at live.  They're just simply not.  And you're right Adam.  It's about Twitter has what's happening from the witnesses.  This morning I saw that a whole bunch of San Franciscans were cowering under their beds saying that they were hearing lightning and thunder.  They're hearing thunder.  We're not used to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're not used to it in California.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I accuse them of having sissy weather there.  Sun and fog and sun and fog.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was really funny to see that because we had it up here in Northern.  But I grew up in back East.  So lightning, big deal.  But these guys, they don't know.  My kids heard the booming.  They had no idea what was going on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It was bombs and all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was really loud.  I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It usually is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe I'm getting to be a wussy Northern California.  So but that's two different kinds of search.  There's real time search, which is searching on stuff that happened right now.  You wouldn't use Twitter to judge the economic vitality of the U.S.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  That's interesting.  That's a really interesting video.  Jonathan Harris, who's a really brilliant artist, is looking at mood things on Twitter.  And he has various.  He was the original designer for Daylight, former partner.  And I'm forgetting the name of the service, unfortunately.  But I wonder if you tracked mood words on Twitter over a longer period of time, if you could put that against stock prices and joblessness.  That's interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  And actually, I think there's already some Twitter applications that that are tracking things in that direction.  There's one that I looked at once where you can you give them your username and it analyzes your tweets and says like what kind of like how many percent of them are like negative tweets or like positive or what's like your tweeting attitude?  I don't want to know either.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My attitude sucks.  But that's it.  But I think you're the nicest guy on the Internet.  You haven't seen my new stickers.  We just we just ordered these Leo Laporte.  Remember kids, Uncle Leo's got a picture of me.  Remember kids, Uncle Leo says, screw you.  This is we're going to we're going to make a million dollars.  They're going to sell like I'll buy.  So can Google do real time?  Is it is it impossible?  Well, as they're presently constructed, yeah.  But I think that, as I mentioned last week, I heard Marissa Meyer talk about the

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  hyper personal news streams.  And if she's talking about it, they're thinking about it.  Well, they're thinking about it.  Of course, they have to look and say, look at all this value that's being created by real time search.  The question is, do they have the data?  Adam, what do you think?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, Google has I mean, I feel like I've heard at least maybe it's just speculation that Google has talked to Twitter and trying to get like their real time data.  And I think that's the thing.  So they have the data.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  And Google.  Well, Google has I mean, I feel like I've heard at least maybe it's just speculation that Google has talked to Twitter and trying to get like their real time feed basically.  So they can index it like instantly.  The fire hose we call it.  Right.  But but at the same time, you know, obviously they have the potential for that.  Maybe even in something like Google Wave at some point, because there can be waves that are public.  And if people were to start using Wave on mass and it was a popular thing and you could have the option to make like certain types of discussions like public part of the searchable Google database, I mean, it could be another source of that sort of information.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's it's in that's where it's very intriguing.  Is real time search a fad or a long term viable solution?  And is it just something that goes in parallel with the traditional Google style search?  Or does it replace Google style search?  Adam?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  I don't think it replaces Google style search.  I think I think that it's a it's a specific sort of need for specific types of searches.  But at the same time, if you're if if if when I search Twitter to I search Los Angeles, boom or something, because I want to know what happened that felt like something hit my house.  But weirdly, in a not normal way, I have to weed through a lot of a lot of crap that doesn't give me the story.  And I have to like and I have to sort of still judge.  I have to use some discrimination about what is real and what's not because some people were saying Los Angeles.  Oh, my God, there was an earthquake.  And if if if Google I mean, ideally with with real time search, the the engine would would be making those decisions for me and sort of aggregating the the results and creating like the most likely answer or things like that that are actually useful to me.  Because as is, it's it's great that you can do that with Twitter, but it's not it's not perfect.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you're right. We've got to find ways to add value on top of Twitter.  And that's where there's going to be a lot of success.  There's Tinker dot com, which comes from Glam dot com, the largest women's network online.  And and it's really pretty impressive about how they're trying to find curated streams from Twitter.  I didn't experiment last week. I went to Twitter and I sort of had surgery on Monday.  I searched the word prostate and I got nothing but spam.  Oh, interesting.  But but by the way, one of which is for a little aside here, one alternative therapies like, you know, take my my vitamin therapy.  Don't have your surgery.  One of them was for men who were certain age will understand why this is weird.  Suggested massage therapy.  If you know how you get to the prostate, that's what part are they going to massage?  Oh, you don't want to know.  But that's the atoms were right.  I got that junk by pure Twitter search.  You have to it's a clay shirky rule.  Too much stuff is not too much stuff.  It's a case of filter failure.  And you need to add value.  But the other way I look at it these days, where I talk to media folks is that they're getting their audience,  some of their audience, probably the smallest bit from people who are loyal to them and go to them directly.  They're getting a hell of a lot from search.  They're getting a lot now from aggregation.  And they're also getting a lot from human links.  We talked, I think, in the first show about bitly causing as many links a month clicks a month as Google News, a billion a month.  Right.  And so you have to all add all that up together, I think, to a new ecosystem.  And when you add in things like insinuating yourself in streams with RSS and other means and widgets and APIs,  I think the API you Pender Chardon on my partner, Daylife, has said that that's really the next frontier of distribution.  And so you add it all in together and it becomes a new whole.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's a synergized all of the above with some with some judgment involved, because you're right.  I'm just searching Twitter for prostate and it's universally worthless.  There's nothing good in here.  Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So but where you see a problem, there's always an opportunity.  So Adam's right.  I mean, he's thinking like the developer that he is in terms of saying, well, how do I fix that?  I see the problem. How do we fix it?  Right.  And those who fix it will have businesses, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did you see what Facebook did with Facebook Lite?  Talk about going after Twitter.  And now they've added at sign stuff.  I mean, they're looking they look almost like Twitter.  And I have to say, with the failures that Twitter's had, the inability it has had to keep up with the volume, the spamming,  it really seems like their platform is unable to handle a lot of the problems that they're facing.  It seems like there's an opening for somebody like Facebook if they can execute to come along and steal that.  Now, Facebook has a lot more metadata than Twitter does.  And it doesn't have the spam issue, right?  Because it's hard to spam Facebook, I think.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  I think it's easier now than it once was.  Never say never.  It used to be difficult to get a Facebook account if you weren't a student, you know?  Right.  But and then I think it went to corporations or something.  And then it opened up much more wide.  But yeah, you know, my problem with Twitter and I had this conversation with Gene a lot of times and Facebook both is that when you've got they become these platforms in themselves,  but they're not a platform.  You know, it's a company who owns all this data.  It's not right.  And so Twitter, you know, people always talk about Twitter.  RSS is dead.  Email is dead.  Twitter is everything.  But it's always so disheartening when you think about it in the terms where it's like, well, because it's dysfunctional.  It's not merely.  Well, and it's and if someone owns it like no one owns like SMTP or like RSS, their protocols.  Anyone can implement them and anyone can use them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And if and if Av says Google, you can't have the fire hose.  Yeah.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Google's out of luck.  Yeah.  And I think that's one of the cool things again, given the Google way to do because it's installable anywhere, presumably with enough time and enough people being able to learn the technology and everything.  It's open source and it can be and it can be installed on anyone's server.  So potentially it could do the same sorts of real time stuff that that Twitter does, but it wouldn't belong necessarily to Google.  That's really interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And as you know, we talk about Google Wave.  I think every show we should have called the Google Wave show.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, until wave comes until wave comes out and then we find out.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But I think you're right there and you add in these various elements that make up a more rich hole, more valuable hole.  You have the identity that Facebook has, which I think is incredibly valuable to this.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Forget that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sorry that that happened.  Keep continue on.  It really scares me to hear me.  I clicked a link and all of a sudden I'm hearing you twice.  That is frightening.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's even me.  But you have a greater hole.  So the identity of Facebook matters and the functionality of wave enabling you to add in new relationships of people and the content and publishing in new ways.  I think it becomes something bigger than what we have now.  Yeah.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Yeah. And I'm not like I'm not a total wave.  I'm not won over by wave at this point.  I think last week you guys were talking about you and Leo haven't tried.  Neither of you have tried it.  You've tried it right now at this point.  I haven't gotten the invite.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Somebody at Google sent me an email saying you you're on the media list, but you'll get it at the end of this month.  So and I think I think I know.  I think you're on the media list too.  I would be willing to guess as the author of a fine book called What Would Google Do?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  But I think I think that I think that at this point what you guys talked about last week was right where it's like as long as wave when wave is still limited to a small group of people,  it's actually just like it's confusing.  Yeah.  And you don't know what the point would be.  I'm hoping honestly like it's not no one who I know has tried it as a user like from that perspective.  A developer perspective is maybe something entirely different.  But from a user perspective, anyone I know who's tried it has been a little bit confused or disappointed with what they've seen.  But I don't think that's I don't think that's like Google Wave will never work.  I just think at this point, it's not really a user platform.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and I've said this before, too.  As soon as we can run a wave server, I plan to and I can imagine using using wave for this show, for instance, to incorporate listeners comments in and and one hopes more.  So maybe maybe that'll happen as soon as September.  They're going to add 100,000 users in September.  That might be when it really when we can all see what what what wave will do.  You know, I'm I'm I remain excited but but hesitant.  Hey, I do want to mention somebody from I think it was from Google sent me an email saying you really ought to take calls and comments and suggestions on the show.  And I'd like to say that we're going to start doing this.  I was able to get a Google Voice invite from I said, yeah, I'd be glad to do it if I could only get another Google Voice account.  So he sent me an invite.  So we now have a call twig number.  It's 9795 twig VM 9790.  It's a Google Voice mail box.  So call leave a message if you have a comment or a suggestion.  If you'd like to say, Leo, you're crazy or Jeff really understands what he's talking about or perhaps make a recommendation for a prostate massage.  9795 twig VM TWIG VM.  That's 979589 4486 toll charges will apply.  None of the Google Voice numbers are toll free.  I don't even know where 979 is.  I think it's North Carolina 979589 4486.  If you can keep it to under a minute, remember that when you leave a message, you're giving us permission to use it on the show.  And I hope starting next week, we'll be getting some callers voicemail messages on the show through Google or text.  If you text, it'll also it'll also come in through a Google Voice.  So that is a way to respond back.  Not exactly real time as Google Google Wave will be.  So you do you think that given what you just said, Adam, about Twitter being proprietary, it's really hopeless or futile or stupid to say, well, Facebook might be doing it first.  I mean, that's just another proprietary platform, right?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know.  This is this is my opinion as someone who doesn't like the idea of having all of his information locked in to someone who can change their terms of service at any time and leave you kind of stuck.  But I'm just not like I'm not big on the idea of either of I think they're both great services.  Don't get me wrong. I like Twitter and I actually have grown to like Facebook and over time.  I just I get uncomfortable about the idea that that everything belongs to them and everyone is everyone supporting.  There's there's Twitter links and Twitter movies, movie trailers have Twitter handles on them.  Everyone is amazing.  It was it's it's the new like, you know, it used to be at the end of the trailer.  It was novel when they started adding websites that would be like, you know, right.  What is the matrix dot com or whatever?  And it's like, whoa, look at these guys, the future movies and the Internet.  And now it's all at what is the matrix?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is amazing, isn't it?  But that's trendy.  And, you know, maybe that'll catch.  Yeah.  Or maybe it's just this this week's flavor of the month.  So I yeah, I like Facebook light only because it's lighter.  But I am with you 100 percent, Adam, that I feel like I think this became real to me when when FriendFeed was sold to Facebook.  But I've always worried a little bit about how much value that we're pouring into companies like Twitter and and why should we be?  But but there hasn't been an open choice.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  And I think that they're all aware of this.  And I think that's why they struggle so hard.  They work so hard to to try and appear open.  You know, Twitter has a great API and and that's great.  And everyone uses it.  And in our links this week, FriendFeed slash Facebook now open sourced the tornado.  Yeah, tornado.  The real time messaging and whatnot that that FriendFeed the technology of FriendFeed is built on.  So I think they're all aware of it and trying their best to appear as open as possible.  But ultimately, you know, they're never going to be totally open.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's an interesting question whether FriendFeed did that or Facebook did that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. But Adam, I think I think you're right that we need to compare back to earlier players.  Twitter is one hell of a lot more open than Facebook ever was or still is.  And, you know, we complain about that, too.  But I think that's quite important.  Or, you know, as I remember back to the various early days, earliest days of blogger, if I'm right,  it took a while before you had a means to export your stuff to other platforms.  You know, Google, you are right. It's an important issue.  Google now has its I forget what they call it.  You know, their their initiative to make sure that they just did more things this week to make sure that your stuff is portable.  And that's an important philosophical piece there.  So, you know, I I tend to want to give Twitter some time and they held are developing something that's wholly new to us.  And people just beat them up when they're down.  It's free and and they do keep adding things.  So I want to be a little forgiving.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They know I agree. They did the right thing this week by putting out a new terms of service that opened it up,  said that you own your own tweets, but also said and we might be adding advertising.  But that was actually in stark contrast to Facebook's stumble on on their terms of service.  Twitter was very clear. You own your own tweets. We don't own them.  So you're right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, we're thinking about that, though, if they learn from Facebook, they would have put out a beta version of the.  Do you have to have some comment first?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right. And had people be upset and then they could fix it.  Disaster. Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, actually, what they are, me, perhaps that's what Google would do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, in fact, you're exactly right.  And if they had put out what they put out and ask people for comment, even that would have been fine.  They don't have to play around with a with a draconian choice that we then get them to back off on.  No, I think you're right. I think that that this lesson still not quite learned.  Not quite learned.  Hey, again, a reminder, our listener feedback line is is now online listener feedback via Google Voice at 97 95 twig VM.  You know, I love it. The Google Voice lets you spell out stuff, but you can never really spell out anything you want.  So that's the closest I could get 97.  I love Leo or something. I tried everything.  I actually have 2525.  Hey, Leo, but I'm going to keep that for myself.  Ninety seven ninety five twig VM.  That's outside the U.S. plus one nine seven nine five eight nine four four eight six, which is not a bad number,  which you can call and leave a message there and we will use your messages on the show next week.  If we get any.  Meanwhile, I want to talk to you about audible dot com.  We're take a little break, Adam.  If you want to run out and go to the bathroom or anything, this is the time when the rest of the hosts just start to ignore me.  And you can do so as well.  We'll be back in a minute.  You get your free book right now by joining audible dot com, joining them and getting that great gold account.  That's one book a month.  And your first book is absolutely free.  So we've got a URL just for the show.  Brand new one. Audible podcast dot com.  I'm typing it in just to make sure it works slash twig audible podcast dot com slash twig.  And audible is a wonderful resource for those of you who aren't familiar with it for audio entertainment.  So if you're listening to podcasts, you probably already know a little bit about listening to spoken word stuff.  Audible just is going to expand your repertoire considerably, whether it's serious books like Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique out for the first time in audio.  Thanks to audible for recording that to the latest pot boiler from Dan Brown, The Lost Symbol.  Yes, they've got that.  Audible has 60000 titles on all sorts of topics, including business, including Jeff's book.  What would Google do?  Which I'm not supposed to plug, but I'm going to anyway.  No, they didn't say don't plug it.  They just say have another have another pick in addition to what would Google do.  Audible.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Leo, I'm listening to Chris Anderson's free right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it on audible?  I think so.  Awesome.  I'm going to order it right now.  Yeah.  The future of a radical price.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is also put it out for free, but I paid for it.  Worth paying for.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, look at this.  It looks like audible selling it for free.  The price on free is zero dollars on audible.com.  So run on over there.  That's really cool.  Good for you, audible.  They have an abridged version.  I wonder if the abridged version costs more.  Fewer words.  Yeah.  So get the unabridged.  You pay for the fewer words.  Get the unabridged version.  That can't be right.  Let me add that to my cart and see.  Is that an error?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I think that Chris Anderson did that with them.  Isn't that wonderful?  And they put it up free on Kindle too, I think, but then he still went out in the bestseller  list to damn him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that proves his point.  You can give stuff away and still make a good living.  There's a good one.  Get that one for free.  The future of a radical price.  Tell me, do you like it?  Do you agree with him or do you disagree?  You think it's...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I do agree with him.  And kind of preemptively quoted him in my book.  Not that I want to plug that again.  No, I think that he's...  The problem in this new world is that people just think that we're slightly adapting the  old models and the old structures.  We're not.  And what Chris sees in both his books and I tried to make sure he does is try to explain  that, no, folks, it's bigger than you think.  And Chris is very good at doing that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, he really is.  The author of The Long Tail, of course.  And this is his latest and much recommended.  Free, The Future of a Radical Price at an amazing price, thanks to Audible and Chris.  Free.  So I don't know if I should even make...  Get that and get another book free.  Get that and what would Google do?  Now you're...  You're doing wonders for Audible's bottom line.  Now you're doing good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audiblepodcast.com slash twig.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank them so much for their support.  If you like the shows that we do on This Week in Tech, you can thank Audible for making  them possible.  When he talks about free, is a podcast an example of free?  I mean, is advertising supported media an example of free?  Sure.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's really where the model in media was invented was TV and radio.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's...  So even...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Those who screamed today about, you know, that people should pay.  Well, no, there's an economy out here that just doesn't have that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and I think it's part of the problem with...  For the record companies and others is that if people are used to getting stuff for free,  free music on the radio, they're already preconditioned to free content.  So it's going to get very hard to make them pay for content if they haven't paid for it  in the past.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or Chris's point, or the economics changed.  They pay a lot more now for concert tickets than they used to.  Oh, very good point.  You know, it's Fred Wilson's line about freemium.  Music becomes almost a freemium model.  People are, yeah, some number are getting the music for free.  Not all, but some.  But it pumps the record sales, the record sales pump the concerts now.  Yeah.  That's what...  You know, part of the news we have this week is that Google added into the Newspaper Association  of America taking Google Checkout and offering it up to those who want paywalls as a means  to bring micro payments to newspapers, which I don't like because I don't think it's going  to work.  I think it's actually going to kill papers faster.  I tweeted that I thought it was a cynical act that Google was using its unused checkout  to try to curry favor with newspapers in their useless quest for a new revenue stream.  And then somebody else said in Twitter that, well, no, it was also it was a masterful stroke.  And I said, oh, cynicism and masterful strokes are not at all mutually exclusive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So I think Google Payment is a great system, by the way.  I use it whenever I can.  The problem is I can rarely use it because most people, most vendors...  I've never used it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Adam, have you ever used it?  Never.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Adam?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Oh, Adam?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm sorry, can you hear me?  Hello?  Oh, wait a minute.  I potted him down.  I'm sorry, Adam.  OK, no, I have not.  I'm the only one who hears used it.  I can't remember where I've used it, but I've used it a number of times and I would love  to use it instead of PayPal.  I wish more people would take it.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Oh, I have used it one time, I guess.  Like charity donation.  Twistable or something.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is Microsoft's payment structure still out there?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't even I didn't know they had one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, when they bought you Pender Chardonnay's prior company.  Oh, this is horrible of me.  Oh, I should know this.  Huh.  It was the only one for so long.  But I always argued that the reason it didn't work is because no one's going to trust Microsoft  for their money.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But no, I mean, we trust PayPal.  I mean, I don't know about that.  I'm looking for Microsoft micro payment.  Live points.  Is that it?  No, that's Windows.  No, no, no, no, no.  Then by the way, that's a terrible system.  I do.  I do use that.  Let me see here.  Microsoft is working on a micro payment system for the Web.  This was something Bill Gates was always pushing.  Remember, I remember in his Comdex speeches where you'd wave a wallet that the Starbucks  cart and you'd get paid.  What is Google proposing with the online news payment system?  How would that work?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're proposing micro payments, which Clay Shirky, who will get on this podcast one day  or another, is eloquent about that that's nickel and dining people.  Nobody wants to be nickel and diamond.  It's not going to work.  It's just simply not going to work.  The cost of doing it is very high.  That's why I think it's a cynical act.  I think Google knows that.  Even though Sergey has talked about, well, maybe we should help do this for newspapers.  The economics just don't make sense.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not convinced.  I'll wait till Clay's on before we really debate this.  But, boy, if I could charge a buck every time you downloaded a show, what would be wrong  with that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What would Audible say about that?  Where are you going to make more money in the long run?  I think it's really the question.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It is a question, and it's an unanswered question.  If I could get the same number of people paying a buck a show, I'd make a lot more money.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think you might make more money by just getting donations.  Well, we've done that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, isn't that interesting?  Because the first thing, my first goal five years ago when I started doing all of this  was I said I will never take ads.  Never say never.  Learn my lesson.  I said I will never take ads because I really love the idea of the direct drive between  your listeners and the content.  Listeners pay for the content.  If they like it, they pay for it.  If they don't, they don't.  But the problem was only about 1% of everybody who listened, maybe even less, paid.  So it wasn't enough to do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Just for NPR and other places like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think NPR gets to 4%, but they do it by needling you every five minutes.  I wasn't willing to do that.  Adam, do you pay for content anywhere?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I would say virtually no.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Not at all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what I just did, and I did it more out of Altruism than anything else.  Ars Technica has decided to do a premium version for 50 bucks a year, which it's Condé Nast.  Guaranteed flop.  I mean, it's guaranteed.  And they have some stuff.  You get chats with the editors.  You get a special forum.  The only thing that I thought was in the least bit of value to me was you get the full RSS  feeds and you don't get ads on the site.  And I thought, well, getting the full RSS feeds in my Google reader, now that would be nice.  But really, the truth is it was an act of charity to send them 50 bucks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And how many people are going to pay for this?  Nobody's going to do it.  Nobody's going to do it.  The effort is just not worth it, it seems to me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think that we quickly learned that people considered the shows of great value.  They love the show.  We have huge audience numbers, but nobody's going to send me.  I've asked two bucks a month.  Nobody's going to send.  Very, very few people will do that.  One in 100 will do it.  And I thank those one in 100.  But we had to take advertising or we couldn't grow.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I got it.  Microsoft Passport.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, passport.  Oh, I knew about passport.  Did that happen?  I thought it was a single sign-on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  But I think it was the structure there.  And it was actually, Microsoft bought Firefly, the original collaborative filtering company,  which you, Pender Chardon, started at MIT Media Lab with others.  But they really, all they wanted out of it was this payment structure.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I should have known the answer because I am one of the last passport users in the world.  I still log on to Windows Live with my passport account and Expedia.  I know.  I hold on.  So you think it's cynical of Google.  I'm not sure I would jump on that.  I think it might be that Google really wants to give micropayments a chance.  We've never really given that a chance.  We don't know it would fail.  If I could set up a system to charge a buck just to see what would happen.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I would use it to make a buck bet with you right now that it won't work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're with Chris Anderson on the free side, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not that I'm against charging.  I just don't think it's where the economics are.  And I think it's too soon to shut media down behind paywalls.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There are, I mean, obviously, you know, as Rupert Murdoch has pointed out, their Wall Street Journal makes money behind a paywall.  But it's one of very few things that make money behind a paywall.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, this weekend, The Times of London is going behind the wall.  Right.  So we'll see how that works.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This will be the test, maybe.  This is the test we've waited for.  And you'll have to buy a year's subscription.  What if, you know, I would love to see somebody do that and say, pay 25 cents an article.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it'll be that too.  And the rumors are The New York Times is looking at membership or at metering.  Oh, you've read too much.  Got to pay now.  Which seems silly to me because it's because you're most you're punishing your most loyal readers.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I love you.  Oh, well, you better pay us then.  If you love us that much, we want some money out of you.  Would Lifehacker ever consider such a thing, Adam?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  No, I don't think so.  I can't imagine.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You're making too much money without it.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Well, you'll have to ask Nick Denton.  It's a Gawker property.  A lot of money.  I think Nick's doing all right.  I think we can assume that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Nick's doing all right with display ads, essentially.  Yeah.  The old newspaper model.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Highly targeted, good audiences, well sold, well positioned.  Yeah, Nick's brilliant at that.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The only reason I would love to go, it's purely political.  I'd love to go micro payments is because then it disintermediates me.  You know, right now it's I have two audiences.  I have a bifurcated audience.  I have the advertisers and I have my audience.  And it feels like I, it feels a little bit like I'm selling my audience to the advertisers.  And what I'd love to do is, as much as we love our advertisers, and we're very, you know, we try to, we try to handle that by picking advertisers I use and, you know, being very limited in the number of ads and the quality of ads we do.  But wouldn't it be nice to just say, hey, if you like the show, give me a buck, like a street busker.  And, and, and, and we'll have a direct conversation.  If you like what you hear, pay for it.  Isn't that seem like a cleaner transaction?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  I mean, it's definitely a cleaner transaction, but I just don't see the consumer willingness to jump on something like that.  It's really limited to whether or not anyone will do it, as you obviously know.  And I just, I don't see it happening, at least not the way things are now.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And a good micro payment system, which has been lacking all along, wouldn't fix that problem.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, it's, it's, we've got to look at the bottom line of a total P&L.  And I think what's happening in the industry right now, because they're in such a panic, is they're trying to preserve one old revenue line because we used to have it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I'm with you on that, that that's the wrong reason to do it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. I mean, if you, if you could, you know, the other way people look at it is, is there a premium version of Twit?  What does premium really mean?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know why I don't do that? Because then you get in the police business.  And I have a very clear example of this.  My syndicator for the radio show, Premier Radio Networks, does sell streams of Rush Limbaugh.  You can't listen to Rush Limbaugh on the Internet unless you pay for it.  You can't listen to Coast to Coast unless you pay for it.  And I've talked to the guy who manages this and he says, I spend most of my day finding pirate streams and squishing them.  Yeah.  Because you're exactly right. The people who love Rush the most are the most incented to steal it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And in their view, distribute it.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And market it and promote it.  Right. And so why are you stopping them?  Why not let them do that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then find a way to take advantage of that.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  At the same time, once you're getting pirated, you probably do have a large audience still that's not going there.  Because a lot of times, to me, the reason why something like Hulu is such a success is that it's easier than finding it and downloading it on BitTorrent.  Point of access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  And people are completely willing to watch an ad if they don't have to hunt it down somewhere else.  Like if you have a single point of access that's the easiest.  And sometimes I feel like that is the only way where you could pay a little bit.  I think, you know, price pricing schemes or pricing is a lot of the problem.  I think, you know, in the software world for so long, applications would cost like 10 to 20 to like several hundred dollars depending on it.  And now the iPhone app stores come out and applications are a dollar or two dollars and people like will pay for them like crazy, even though no one wants to pay like 10 dollars or 20 dollars for an application.  And I think those sorts of like changes, I guess, those shifts, if they could happen in some way in the publishing world, I guess there's potential.  I mean, I don't see the straight road from one point to another, but it happens in other things, I guess.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that software is exact opposite model where there are some software guys trying to make money in advertising.  But for the most part, I don't know how well that works.  I suspect it doesn't work well because you don't see it kind of ubiquitous.  Although it may be on the iPhone.  I just saw an article by somebody who said if you're not if you're charging for your iPhone app and not putting ads, you know, why aren't you putting ads in it?  If you make much more money, if you get that many more impressions than you would for a buck ninety nine on an app.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Yeah, I did read something. I think it was probably published by one of the iPhone ad provider people.  Probably you plug into your app. Right.  And it was something I mean, and claiming that people were making a lot of money that way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know. My chat room suggest red troll in the chat room suggests the premium edition.  I would wear a tie necktie.  You know, we give you the premium edition of this show for free.  There is that there is that's true. And I don't want to police it.  I don't want to be playing whack-a-mole with people who dig, try to do that.  Remember Dignation, they said if you pay us a little money, you get a little sooner.  And they stopped doing it because so many people would just our audience is technologically sophisticated enough that they just get around it.  You know, maybe Russia's audience isn't. But our audience is digs audience.  Just Dignation's audience just took it and put it out.  And they finally gave up and said, I guess this isn't going to work.  All right, we'll keep running ads. Just a few. Not a lot.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I also see here in the chat that they are there.  They're clamoring for twit on Hulu or play on or places like that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Working on it. That's just a matter of time.  Working on it. Very close to something that's going to make that possible.  Let's let's wrap her up because I know it's pizza night in the Jarvis household.  And we're going to we usually end up the show with Gina's tip of the week.  Jeff's stat of the week and my tool of the week.  But since Gina's not here, Adam Pash from Lifehacker with his tip of the week.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  All right. Well, I'm actually going to give you because we didn't talk about one of the couple of the things that happen in Google Voice this week.  So I'm going to give you sort of a three pronged twig tip.  The first two are related. They're Google Voice ones.  But since a lot of people don't have Google Voice, I'll throw in a third for Gmail that everyone has.  So earlier this week, Google Voice enabled SMS forwarding to your to your email.  And then you can then you can now reply to SMS is that you get through Google Voice and from your email.  So you never have to open your phone if you don't want to.  Very handy if you're just sitting at your desk.  They also go Gmail Labs added a new feature called I'm not sure.  But basically what it does is embeds a little flash player that you can when you get a voicemail from Google Voice sent to your Gmail inbox, it'll have the transcription.  And below that, you get a little flash player that you can play back the voicemail.  Isn't that cool? Look at that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so that lightening is I'm playing it.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  So and that will be inside Gmail.  If you go into Gmail Labs and turn on the feature, which is called it doesn't Google Voice right now.  Right. You can do it in Google Voice, but now I'll be able to do in your Gmail account as well.  Yeah. And and actually when you listen to the message in your Gmail account in that same little inline playback, it will market as read in Google Voice.  So you don't have to go to Google Voice and all tied together.  Yeah, it's all tied together.  So those are the two Google Voice tips, both things that happened this week.  So my Gmail tip is for anyone who doesn't like the ads in the sidebar of Gmail.  Yes.  So this was in August when we ran across this at Lifehacker.  A blogger by the name of Joe McKay discovered that Gmail will get rid of their contextual ads if your if your email contains tragic enough words.  I remember this. Yeah.  So so we put together a sentence that you could put in your signature if you so.  Oh, let me let me have that. Yes.  OK, our sentence and you can tweak this in many different ways.  Whatever you put our sentences.  I enjoy the massacre of ads.  This sentence will slaughter ads without a messy bloodbath.  And so when when Gmail reads the message for the contextual ads and it sees massacre and slaughter and bloodbath, it assumes that you don't want probably rightly assume that you don't look at ads related to that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I enjoy the slaughter of ads.  This sentence will.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  I enjoy the massacre of ads.  The slaughter ads without a messy bloodbath.  And actually, there's even I don't know if you can do this by default or you have to turn on a Gmail Labs feature, but someone recommended you could take that and make the text of the signature white so no one would even see it.  I'm all for ad supported services, so I don't you know, I don't send.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, isn't this ironic how we're talking about free stuff and yet we're also talking about how to kill the ads that makes the free stuff possible.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  But it's a fun little trick.  Make that your signature then.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I enjoy the massacre of ads.  This sentence will slaughter ads with them without a messy bloodbath.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  If you send someone it won't have ads.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Adam, there's got to be somebody at Google right now who's trying to pick the exact right ad to go with that.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  You got to be careful though to be a jerk to us.  Yeah, you got it.  You got to be careful though.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, that's chicken soup for the geek.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, something about how free is the future of the Internet.

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  Maybe it'll all be the benefit to bad websites.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A link to a link to Chris's book perhaps on audible.com.  Hey, great.  Thanks for three tips in one and I've already enabled the playback in here in my Gmail for my Google Voice, which is fantastic.  That's very exciting.  In fact, I can do it now.  It's got exactly the same player, which is really slick in the Gmail that it has in Google Voice.  I love that.  So thank you.  Yeah, very handy tip.  Once again, Google does it again.  And now it's time for Jeff Jarvis and our number of the night.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The number of the night is five million.  That according to the Google official blog is how many students are going back to school this fall using Google Apps and Google Apps Education Edition as part of what they're doing.  That's in one hundred forty five countries up four hundred percent, which is pretty amazing.  I think it's more than just bragging.  I think it's more important as an indicator of kind of the disaggregation of education that can come if if students and educators are all on Google in this way, they can do amazing things.  My my students in my entrepreneurial journalism class at City University of New York, where I teach, are creating a service called a notebook, a K.N.O.W.  notebook as a platform for science and technology students and teachers to share news and curriculum.  Zeffra Teach Out has a column in tomorrow's Washington Post that I linked to my blog Buzz Machine about a disaggregated future of education.  I then linked to my chapter in what would Google do and the whole idea.  So I think that part of the argument we're seeing is that what's happened to media in disaggregation is next going to come to education.  And I think the fact that there are five million students using Google Apps is in itself not very important, but it shows the infrastructure for education itself is going to change radically and fast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And five million, I don't know what the total number of students in college is, something like fifteen point nine million.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is of course across one hundred forty five countries.  Ah, OK.  They also even put up a map showing which schools have already gone over to Google Apps as their primary means of collaboration.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  According to facts for features from the census, seventy four point six million students starting through from nursery school through college.  So it's quite a few fifty three point eight million elementary and high school.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And what's that leave twenty twenty five million?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, let me see. High school students.  I think it said the number of projected number of students enrolled in the nation's colleges and universities this fall.  Fifteen point nine million. So five million, even if it's global, that's a significant number.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. And infrastructurely now.  What the hell? One more Google Wave mentioned because we haven't had enough.  But if you go to what Adam was saying earlier, you now look at collaboration.  If you think of Google Wave, I've been thinking about it as media.  If you think of Google Wave in the classroom. Yes.  And the classroom is now disaggregated across the world where the best students and best teachers find each other and collaborate on work.  That's new. That's that's big.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, that was one of the changes that I thought was under reported,  but most important about the changes Apple made to iTunes this week and to the iPhone with the three point one software,  they surfaced iTunes you on both, which is a great resource.  I mean, and if you look at if you start browsing iTunes, you the same way you browse the iTunes store,  there's amazing stuff there, lectures from the best universities in the world.  You could get a full college education on your iPod.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I talked to the president of the New School in New York.  I don't think I mentioned this before, but but he he was saying, what do I do when there's all these great lectures at MIT, Harvard and Stanford?  And as we talked about it brainstorming, we thought you may consider kind of the UK version of the lecturer and tutor.  So maybe New School in New York has a tutor who helps take the individual students through the work of the lecturers at MIT and Stanford and Harvard and Cambridge and Oxford.  And everybody gets a higher quality education in terms of getting the very best of the breed.  It's more efficient. You don't have everybody teaching the same course, but you also then have the resource more targeted to more individual work.  Yes. And the business of the university.  Well, it's screwed just like media has been.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's good for the commonweal. And that's what we really care about in the long run.  They don't pay me much anyway. So what the hell?  Devlin is saying in the chat room that Google Wave works brilliantly for use at university.  I use it with some of my fellow students to collaborate about notes from lectures.  Isn't that interesting?

Speaker: Adam Pash
Transcript:  I think collaboration is clearly like it's the most obvious thing the first time you use it where you can see a lot of potential.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I think that's that's the media application to Jeff.  We're going to use it to collaborate with our audience.  Right. In effect. Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. That's the future of news. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, I do want to give you a plug, Adam.  Actually, Gina wrote this article.  Gina Trapani gets the plug, really.  She wrote an article, Seven Easy Ways to Integrate Your Google Apps.  It's at Lifehacker.com. Yep.  So for those 15 million students now using Google Apps in school, integrate them all together.  And she's got some great tips in there.  As always, even when Gina's not here, she's the best.  Yes.  My Google tool of the week is something you both alluded to, I think, already.  It's something that's out of Google UK.  And it kind of talks a little bit about toward what we were talking about with Google having a lot of interesting information.  If you could but extract it or find a way to get that information out of it.  It's a Google Internet stats.  I don't know why it's only Google.co.uk, but maybe they're going to maybe they're going to make it worldwide.  But if you Google Google Internet stats, you'll find find it quickly.  Every time you refresh the page, you get a new stat.  For instance, this one search made up 40 percent of online advertising in Western Europe in 2008.  Some of it's more interesting than that.  But you can keep clicking.  Ninety five point one percent of users connected to the Internet in the UK are on broadband connections.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I tweeted this today and somebody came back and said, oh, good.  A new time suck.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It really is.  I mean, you got consumer trends, macroeconomic trends, media consumption, media language.  It's consumption, media landscape and technology.  And it's just, you know, it's factoids.  It's random.  It's just a ton of factoids.  I probably could have searched here for university students and found that information much more quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me see.  Just out of curiosity.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Google Internet stats.  I can give you the link.  It's a long one.  No, it's not in there.  But there are a lot of maybe it is.  It's doing a search right now.  It's just a really you're right.  Another Internet time sync.  Just browse around and find cool stuff.  A reminder to you all that you can call us.  We have a listener feedback line.  Thanks to Google Voice.  Ninety seven ninety five twig VM.  If you're outside the US, that's plus one nine seven nine five eight nine four four eight six.  We've already got a number of messages from people listening to the show live.  We do do that show live every Saturday at two fifteen Pacific time.

So nice to have you on the show today, Adam.  Thanks for joining us.  Thanks a lot for having me.  We really appreciate it.  Jeff Jarvis is at Buzz Machine dot com, the author of The Fantastic.  What would Google do available on Audible dot com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to see a big hit on Audible dot com and say he did it, didn't he?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He recommended the book.  Damn him.  But also we wish you the best.  Jeff is going into surgery now.  I'm not telling tales out of school when I say that because he's blogging about it for the last couple of months.  He lives in public.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, tweet out of the operating room.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, really?  Do you think so?  I want to see.  You know what I want is the recovery tweet.  Yeah, that's going to be a new meme.  Wow.  I see stars.  I see stars.  So tomorrow you go in tomorrow morning.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Monday morning.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Monday morning.  OK.  All the best to you, Jeff.  And here's the amazing thing.  This man is going to be back on the show next week.  He doesn't take time off for nothing.  Thank you.  I'll show you my scars.  No, I don't want to see your scars.  Where did I?  No, I'll ask you after.  No, you don't want to know.  I won't tell you anything.  I'll ask you after.  We're roughly the same age.  I'm sure it's on my docket as well sometime down the road.  Get your PSA checked.  Yeah, I do.  I'm going in on Monday actually to get a PSA checked.  I'm going to say I want the Jeff Jarvis tests right there.  Thank you all for joining us.  We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.  Bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.
