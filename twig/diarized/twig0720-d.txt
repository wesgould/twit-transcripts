Transcript:  I was dressed. I was fully dressed. The EU has filed new antitrust charges against Google  saying its online advertising practices violate antitrust laws. Basically, they're saying,  you know, your monetization strategy, Google, it's illegal. Google was charged on Wednesday  with violating EU antitrust laws by using its dominance in online advertising to undercut  rivals. The case brought by the European Commission, according to the New York Times,  the executive branch of the 27 nation EU, the fourth time Google has been charged  with violating European antitrust laws in recent years. At some point they're going to stop.

Transcript:  You know what's amazing Leo? Is it took them this long to get to the nub of it.  The real issue. Antitrust wasn't about the browser.  It wasn't about search. It wasn't about shopping. It was about advertising.  I've always said that.

Start time: 295.40
End time: 313.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Justice Department brought similar charges in January. It's the online advertising,  which I have to say where Google really does kind of push it with that by be both the seller and  the buyer, you know, the controlling both ends. It's kind of a classic antitrust case if you ask me.

Start time: 315.78
End time: 319.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's where they've always been vulnerable because they also have the power of God over it.

Start time: 319.20
End time: 356.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And I should point out that Google's dominance and success in this field  comes at the expense of everybody else who's advertising base yesterday or actually earlier  today, Paul Theron on Windows Weekly saying, yeah, he can't survive his website, can't survive on  ads alone. He needs a club. And frankly, we're kind of in the same boat where our advertising.  Well, but you don't use Google advertising, Leo.  No, we don't. No, what I'm saying is all our advertisers come to us. Let's say Athletic Greens.  Woohoo.  They're the car. Our competition is Google ads.  Yeah.  Not whether we use it. We do use Google ads, by the way. Of course we do. Everybody does.  Everybody does.

Start time: 356.98
End time: 358.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We buy Google ads to promote the shows.

Start time: 358.76
End time: 411.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even my domain.  Oh, that way. Yeah.  Yeah. But our sponsors are saying, well, should I buy Google ads where I know exactly who I'm  getting? It's extremely efficient by I know, you know, click fraud aside, which I suppose  is still a little bit of a problem. But I mean, you could every medium has that, you know, you  don't, I can't prove to you that whoever listens to the show heard your ad, they might have gotten  up and got a sandwich. Fast forward. We don't know that.  How dare they?  How dare they? But that's been the problem with advertising forever.  Of course. Absolutely forever.  Magazines which assert that well, every the pass around is seven to one for every, you know,  or with TV advertising, we know they don't know. So, but I think lately agencies and  ad buyers are more believe in the digital because it's digital, right? The accuracy of

Start time: 411.64
End time: 416.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google's click rates. They get metrics. They can target. They can be more efficient.

Start time: 417.22
End time: 427.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dude, metrics are so useful from a marketing standpoint. It's so powerful when you know  where everything is coming from, even down to the hours of the day.

Transcript:  If you were going to split up Google, how would you split it up?

Start time: 461.96
End time: 489.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's a good question. I think the first thing you got to do,  but you know, the biggest problem to me is that Google both makes the market, you know,  and, and sells the ads. So, you know, when they bought, was it Overture? When they bought,  started buying up all the ad tech companies, that's when the problem began.  Double click.  Double click. That's the one.  Double click. Yeah.  And so, you know, I've always.  Overture was Bill Gross's company at Yahoo.  And that went to Microsoft, right? Eventually.

Start time: 489.16
End time: 495.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which caused the big, you know, a huge settlement because Google basically stole the model from Bill.

Start time: 495.76
End time: 535.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Oh, really? So they gave him some money.  Did they give him $60 billion?  Not quite.  Then he got ripped off.  Because that's what they made last year.  With that technology. So, you know, I mean, they're really eating up the world.  And, and it's tough for everybody else. I, I think that I've always said Google should be a  search engine and just a search engine. I guess they could do ad sales on that,  but they shouldn't have YouTube. They shouldn't have content at all.  Cause that's also a conflict of interest because when the search results, their content.

Start time: 535.94
End time: 547.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you're going to take that away from, well,  you're kind of getting down to the, to the marrow.  So what about something a little less radical, like get rid of either the buy side or the sell side?  Yeah. Yeah. That'd be fine.

Start time: 549.24
End time: 564.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Marguerite de Vestager, the EVP of the European commission said Google is present at almost all  levels of the so-called ad tech supply chain. That's exactly what you were saying, right?  They, they do buy and sell.

Start time: 567.02
End time: 570.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm with Mr. Jarvis. What took so long for this to come out? Why?

Start time: 571.66
End time: 602.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now they wanted to go after big, bad Google. And the things that were right in front of their eyes  were search and browser. The shopping thing was European stupidity. It was, it was,  it was, what's his name? What's the other service that always gets mad at Google?  I can't remember the name. But that's, they went after that silly stuff.  The question long ago should have been advertising. I don't think Google should  have to get rid of it all, but they clearly do have a iron grip.

Start time: 603.02
End time: 614.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's bad. Not it's bad for everybody. I mean, it's bad for advertisers too, because  there's not a market, you know, free market. It's bad for everybody who's ad supported like us and

Start time: 614.56
End time: 619.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Paul Therop, because- Stacey, do you use any Google ad products, even from analytics or whatever?

Start time: 621.30
End time: 623.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we use analytics.

Start time: 623.78
End time: 642.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we use analytics too. Yeah.  I don't know what the answer is. It's hard to, it's hard to split companies up after,  you know, the, you know, you really, the best place to stop them is before they  make the acquisitions. Like stop, don't buy double click, but too late.

Start time: 642.90
End time: 644.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I guess double click you might have known.

Start time: 645.69
End time: 646.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it fair though?

Start time: 646.50
End time: 687.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there were people there. Yeah. I mean, Microsoft, I'm sure we're going to talk about  the FTC suing to stop Microsoft from buying Activision. It's totally fair to be like,  Hey, this looks like anti- and people actually argued this when Google made some of these  acquisitions who were like, wait a second. And the thing that Google argued that the search market  was not a big deal and there was still competition. This is very common across all of these industries.  They argue that it's, it's such a small industry. There's still competition in all these other  industries. So we don't need to worry about that here. And then voila, it gets big.

Start time: 689.12
End time: 697.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. When, when, when Facebook bought Instagram, Instagram was tiny with like  three employees and nobody could really see what it was going to be.  I think there were 12.

Start time: 698.06
End time: 702.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. It wasn't very many. No, he's right. It was a handful. It was very small.

Start time: 702.92
End time: 717.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But double click was an important established, and I would say with YouTube, YouTube was,  why are you crazy buying this thing? It's going to cost you a fortune in,  in data communication. You're foolish. But double click was the one I think that could  have been seen. I think you're right.

Start time: 719.40
End time: 749.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cy, anyway, the EU and the US department of justice, both investigating Google.  Well, I, you know, I just, I can't imagine anything, anything that will significantly  change the world will happen. But, uh, I guess, you know, I feel a little vindicated,  you know, the truth is it hurts Google too. Cause honestly, Google is not as good as search  engine. Am I wrong? But I feel like Google is not as good as search engine as it was.

Start time: 751.08
End time: 760.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As it was, but in comparison to what now, I mean, why did they need to be any better if,  if the competition isn't necessarily.  Let me look for ant.

Transcript:  You find me it's going to, you're going to get some pretty interesting stuff.

Start time: 766.62
End time: 799.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Almost always what will happen with Google is the top is above the fold will not be search  results. Search results will end up below the fold. It's the knowledge box, the YouTube videos,  all the other experiences above the fold and Google's argument. Let's,  let's search for something more reasonable, like a used cars  in California, in San Francisco.  Yeah.  Now I get search results. Look at that.  Yep. Well, that's, that's interesting.

Start time: 799.72
End time: 802.14

Start time: 876.46
End time: 883.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true. Well, let's think about this from the  standpoint of the quote unquote normals. Someone's searching for rock and roll music.

Start time: 884.58
End time: 891.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're probably more apt to click on. Google says we want to give you the  answers that you're looking for. Yeah.

Start time: 891.28
End time: 893.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is what people want. They know it for the data.

Start time: 895.04
End time: 905.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, but I honestly, I feel like the, let me see more likely. I'm going to say,  I'm more likely searches. How do I replace the battery in my phone?

Start time: 906.72
End time: 917.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that should bring up a video because nobody wants to read that. I don't want to watch a video.  I never want a video. I hate it.  I hate it. But again, you all are not the normal group.

Start time: 918.48
End time: 925.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel like I'm pretty normal in this. I just, I, I'm like, Oh God, a fricking video.  It's going to take longer. How do I find a new lot on the keyboard?

Start time: 925.58
End time: 928.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a five minute video. Yeah.  I'm talking to us. There's a reason.

Start time: 931.08
End time: 934.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was like, here's how to change the battery in your phone. It'd be fine. But I got to dig

Start time: 935.02
End time: 945.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  through this guy selling me something. But there's a reason those videos do really  well on TikTok too is because nobody wants to read about stuff like that.  TikTok's a video platform. You couldn't read about it.

Start time: 945.94
End time: 947.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, exactly.  No, but I'm just, but we're not.

Start time: 948.12
End time: 958.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm fine if it gives me, if I knew videos, I could get it in like 60 seconds or less.  Great. Cause that's about how long it takes me to click, load and read through to get the information.

Start time: 958.22
End time: 967.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I just searched for a UFC ultimate fighting championship. This is why publishers are kind  of mad, right? I'm getting everything I need from Google. I don't need to dig down.

Start time: 968.06
End time: 974.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's commodity. Well, cause the pub,  cause every publisher is going to give you the exact same information as everybody,  other publisher and in an enlightened society, you can't own information.

Start time: 975.92
End time: 979.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. So because information is commoditized now that,

Start time: 981.08
End time: 984.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's always been the case. The information only the treatment of it. And so if you don't do

Start time: 984.30
End time: 989.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  something special publisher, then, well, even if you did something special, Google would not put it

Start time: 990.04
End time: 1004.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  above the fold. If you want to really, really read what the athletic has to say about some  sporting thing, then you would go to the athletic record there directly. You wouldn't go through  Google. There's so little of that in news and media because everybody just wants to use commodity

Start time: 1005.08
End time: 1014.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  information to get more SEO and clicks. But it was kind of Google that got us there,  right? We do that because the only way you could get traffic to your site was through Google. So

Start time: 1014.44
End time: 1023.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we game Google. Yeah. Yeah. And Google always said starts a company with that.  You're not going to win that way in the long run because everybody else came to the same thing.  Yeah. To be at the front.

Start time: 1025.90
End time: 1030.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Well, Danny Sullivan said, I don't think people, so people used to also just,

Start time: 1031.98
End time: 1050.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we would repeat information because we knew our audience needed it and we didn't know if they  were getting it elsewhere. Like most normal people don't visit 30 news sites a day. So  I'm just saying that like, it's not just all about SEO. Cause I used to argue, I'd be like, dude,  I've already seen this story in three other places. And I'd be like, it'd be like, write it.

Start time: 1051.88
End time: 1062.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our people don't necessarily read those places. The reason you see it in all those other places  is because it drives a lot of traffic. So write it. And that's what God made AI for.

Start time: 1062.42
End time: 1077.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ben Smith wrote about it in traffic is that it was the, it's the pursuit of everybody having  the same thing. And the great example of the two color dress story, everybody wrote that story.  Right. I did nothing. So it became a commodity. Okay. I'm thinking less about the two color dress

Start time: 1077.38
End time: 1162.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and more about actual news. Well, like should I buy mutual funds? That's, you know, CNET realized  all its personal finance stories should be written by robots because that worked well. Yeah.  So one way people have been fixing Google search for some time, I've been doing this is by  adding site colon Reddit.com and saying search Reddit. Well, yeah. So how's that working out  for you this week? This is a story from Jay Peters and the Verge. Google's getting a lot worse  because of the Reddit blackouts. That's a funny headline. Reddit's community filtered posts are  a great way to beat search engine ads and spam. But what happens in parts of the internet's biggest  forum turn out the lights. So this battle, as we reported on this last week, it all started because  I think honestly Reddit, which is facing an IPO decided we should get rid of these third party  clients. They decided, but we're not going to do it dumb like Elon Musk did and just turn off the  lights. We're going to pretend that we actually like third party clients, but we're going to just  say, yo, look, you guys, you're taking a lot of traffic from us. It's costing us money. So we're  going to charge you 24 cents for every thousand impressions, which ends up being an untenable  amount of money. In other words, I think the board said, okay, so this is how we do it. Instead of  saying, no, we don't want third party apps. We just charge them so much that they go out of

Transcript:  So I understand from both sides. So Steve and Huffman, as usual, Leo, as usual. I'm on both  sides, guy in a guy. Yes, you are. And I know I've interviewed Steve on triangulation and Alexis  Ohanian. You know, I mean, Google was a Reddit was a copy of dig and Kevin Rose was a good friend.  So I've been there since the very beginning. I love Reddit. I use it every day. I think it's  the greatest thing ever, but let's not forget Reddit is not the content. Reddit is the platform. The  content is created by community and let's not forget very important, the moderators who are  all volunteer who put in a huge amount of time and effort to create those communities and maintain  them. It's a big, big effort. So moderators are saying, well, wait a minute. We use AP, the API  for some of our tools. So Reddit says, Oh, no, no, no, don't worry. We'll make that work. But it's  really clear now that Reddit just said what they really said was we want to get rid of these third  party tools. And the reason is, and the reason they're going to do it for the same reason  Twitter did, because if you're using Apollo, which is my favorite Reddit client, I'm not seeing the  ads because the ads don't serve, the API doesn't serve ads. That's not what the advertisers want.  So suddenly you're losing a lot of revenue. These guys are sucking bandwidth. So I understand. And  it's certainly their right to do so. Is there a middle ground? Well, the other thing they did,  which really tells you what they were after they said, Oh, and by the way, no adult content will be  served by the API. If you want adult content, you got to come to Reddit directly. Now I don't know,  they know how much that drives traffic. It's a significant amount of traffic. And once again,  you could make the case that the adult content posted on Reddit is really just stolen from adult

Transcript:  film studio. It's stolen itself. That is copyright theft. Yeah. Not that I've ever seen any of it  personally, but what I'm told is I put it in the rundown. EFF had a really good piece about what  Reddit has done right and what Reddit did wrong in this case. I would say it's within their rights

Start time: 1299.24
End time: 1434.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to do what they're doing. Yeah, but their mistake is in misunderstanding how deeply  Redditors would feel about this. In fact, because they're the ones who create the value.  Yeah. Right. In fact, there was a memo that Steve Hoffman circulated with Reddit employees saying,  look, look, look, look, look. He said a couple of things. One, don't wear your Reddit gear outside  because people are mad. Two, don't worry. It's going to blow over. And then of course, somebody  leaked it to the verge and that really incensed. Famous last words. Yeah. So the original boycott  was supposed to be Monday through Wednesday, supposed to be over today. But a number of big  sites, r slash r music, r slash iPhone said, no, no, we're dark forever. We're going to move  or we're going to something. We're just going to, you know, Oh, thanks a lot, Steve. We're going to  go dark now. So now Reddit is a shadow of its former self. I have to think it's IPO is jeopardized.  Let me, let's see here's what Reddit got wrong. This is from Rory Murr writing yesterday  at the electronic frontier foundation. After weeks of burning through users, goodwill. Yes.  Reddit is facing a moderator strike. That's what's really going on. Because, because we users  aren't necessarily boycotting Reddit, but the moderators are the ones who keep the content up  there and an exodus of its most important users. It's the latest example of a social media site  making a critical mistake. Users aren't there for the services. They're there for the community.  We're not there for the platform that Reddit provides. We're there for the content that we  provide. Amen. The conversation that's, that's everything. Yep. Building barriers to access  as a war of attrition says the EFF. I don't, you know, I'm sympathetic. I understand they want,  they need the revenue. It's expensive. They've never made a profit. And one of the things Steve  Hoffman said, Hoffman said, it's really yet to Christian Selig is you make money on Apollo.  You make a lot of money on Apollo. We make no money. Is that fair? Yeah. He, I get it. Business

Start time: 1434.70
End time: 1446.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is business. But again, I still wonder if there's some type of middle ground that could be put in  place for the community because charging that amount of money and just sort of putting people

Start time: 1452.32
End time: 1499.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh boy. Oh boy. And I think, you know, one thing the EFF piece says, which I think is so important  is that we know that content moderation at scale is impossible. Mike Masnick. Yep. And so what  Reddit did that's so important is to de scale conversation down from Twitter and Facebook,  put it in the hands of each community, make that work. But it only works if you respect the labor  mostly free of the moderators and the contributors. When you act like you have the value and they don't,  they needed to find a way to share that value with the moderators and with the contributors,  then they would have had aligned interests. Okay, fine. Charge of fortune to other people  because we're going to get, we're going to, we're going to benefit along the way. I'm no developer,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what I thought. So why couldn't there be some type of middle ground in place where only this subset  of keys is the quote unquote allowed group for this rate. And this group of keys is the allowed  group for the other ridiculous gazillion dollar rate. Well, who are you going to choose for the  cheap rate? Well, I mean, well, your moderators, the ones that's- Oh no, the moderators will be

Start time: 1534.70
End time: 1596.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  able to use their tools for free. They're not the moderators. I thought they said that they're still  going to get charged. Not the moderators. I think it's all aimed at the third party apps.  Cause they say some of the moderators were using tools. Yeah. And initially the moderators were  very upset because their tools, uh, they thought were going to be charged by the API. Okay.  Updates from rhetoric, moderator supports and resources. This is the Reddit post on this. And  it's my understanding that they're going to, you know, the, the theory is that moderators,  I mean, moderators are volunteers. They should be paying zero. They're giving free work.  Uh, and I think that that's, that's essentially what Reddit's saying is,  Oh no, we don't mean to charge you. It's really all about the third party. Okay.  Clients, Christian Selig, who created Apollo will be on tech news weekly tomorrow. So watch tomorrow.  That'll be very interesting. Go ahead, Stacey. We just keep building community or decentralized

Start time: 1596.96
End time: 1672.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or kind of mutual aid models for the internet because it's so easy to do that here because  you can build such large communities and tailor them for people cheaply, but we're building it in  a capitalistic society. So those are absolutely in conflict. So what happens is when you  build your decentralized, your, your cooperative community up to a certain point,  you get, you attract investors. And if you take those investors, you get to get bigger,  but then you also have that fiduciary responsibility. And we, we see this play  out again and again, and some people actually game it. Like, I mean, if you look at like  Facebook's growth strategy, it was all about building this kind of cooperative community  and then monetizing it. But I think there's genuine cases where this happens. And I,  I don't know how we get around this or if we just keep, you know, building up new cooperative  communities. And then, I mean, because eventually someone is going to take the money because it's  too good. So we just might always be running here. That's why people propose federation and

Start time: 1672.46
End time: 1676.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  decentralized networks, because then there is no central place to monetize.

Start time: 1678.06
End time: 1693.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, but those are still too complicated. And that's, that's where it like,  this is where this kind of breaks down. And, and I know, you know, yes, I'm all,  I'm a huge fan of decentralization, but decentralization can only go so far. It can

Start time: 1693.90

Transcript:  only attract so many. Yeah. I mean, there is, as we talked about last week, there's Lemmy,  which is a decentralized, a Fediverse version of Reddit, which I, you know, doesn't even have a  mobile platform at all. So it's not, but it does have an API activity pub. So I guess you could  write mobile apps. Somebody may be doing that right now as we speak. I don't know where people  are going. I think some people, our iPhone is going to Discord. We talked about that last week.  Uh, it's just gotten worse since last week. Um, and, and frankly, uh, the users are,  are really incensed that Reddit has been so insensitive, uh, to them and are leaving.

Start time: 1734.78
End time: 1760.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And well, yeah, I mean, but I get it. It sucks, but I'm also like, y'all, this, this is this,  we're just going to replay this until we decide that capitalism isn't how we want to operate  either in this area or other areas. And that's a, that sounds radical, but I think it's becoming  less and less radical, especially as people grow up on the web. So, well, I mean, it's like,

Start time: 1760.44
End time: 1804.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  people are suddenly realizing, oh, wait a minute, Twitter's made of my posts. YouTube's my stuff.  Right. Reddit's my stuff. Oh, you know, um, it isn't exactly a fair trade. I mean,  look, Mr. Beast made $54 million last year. Somebody's, somebody's doing all right. Some,  some contributors are doing all right. Uh, I don't know, but this is the second issue,  which is the secondary collateral damage that Google is getting worse. And, and you know,  who else is going to get worse? And you're right, Jeff, you brought up AI, uh, all that Reddit  content is among other things. I mean, all of these large language models are training on  our content. So they're doing the same thing. They're riding on our content.

Start time: 1805.58
End time: 1844.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but, but, but also, but Leo, all writing rides on previous content, all creation. This  is what Larry Lassig would say about copyright, right? Rides on previous. And so this is why I,  you know, I've talked about the show years past. I want a system of ongoing credit to creation and  different business models. So there's still business Stacey, I think, but there's still  capitalism of a different sort, but it's not based on huge capital.  It's based on a link, a link tax.  Structures. No, no, no, no, no, no. Um, the, the, my idea of credit, right.  Is that each, um, contribution to a string of creativity should be, you should be able to have

Start time: 1845.16
End time: 1869.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  credit for it. And then you can reward that. Yes, it is. Yes. Yeah. And by the way, I pay for Reddit.  I don't see, I wouldn't, I don't see ads on the web either. I paid whatever the,  I can't even remember what it costs. I wonder what that percentage of, of, of,  I must be a small, all about his climbing small percentage. I don't even know.  Let's see Reddit premium help support Reddit and get VIP treatment, exclusive access and monthly

Transcript:  Oh dude. Uh, after you're okay, you're going to get this from me because it is, the book is almost  out. So from the Gutenberg parenthesis, um, it was not until, I mean, printing comes out in 1450,  the business model doesn't come until 1710 with copyright. And that idea of content as property  was not to protect the creator at all. It was to create a tradable asset. So the writer could sell  their work to someone who could in turn be secure by trading it on. And that created the metaphor  that we have. It's not a forever thing. This idea of copyright, this idea of property,  right? The value lies somewhere else. Just like you just said from the EFF, the value was not  in the platform. The value was not in the content. The value was in the community.

Tomorrow, Christian Selig, the, the guy who single developer who created Apollo,  which is easily the best Reddit client, really wonderful, much better than Reddit's own clients.  We'll be on tech news. Somebody said, you know, Reddit should just buy Apollo. And then that  solved the whole thing. Another person said, what are you talking about?

Right. Cause you're going to make more. We'll call it a day.  And that, and Steve Huffman thought that was insulting. He was pissed. He said, well,  we can't do business with this guy. Yeah. Yeah.

I have been saying for a long time, if email is  important to you, pay a little bit for email so you get good service. Cause if you're not paying  for your email service, if you're not the customer, you're the product. Make email work for  you with Fast Mail. It's what I use. I've been using for more than 10 years. It is my email  provider. I love Fast Mail. I use it and I am a power user. I use it to host my websites. I have  a whole bunch of domains. The email goes through Fast Mail. I go on and on and on. Fast Mail is  amazing. You can, and the fast, by the way, set up a new Mac, didn't install an email client.  I thought to myself, why am I doing that? I'll just use the Fast Mail web interface. It's great.  It has, it has colors and custom swipes and, and yes, night mode, Jeff or not, you know,  go either way. Fast Mail now has quick settings from the quick settings menu. You can easily  choose a new theme switch between light and dark, or should I say between dark and light,  change your text size without leaving the Fast Mail screen. Quick settings will also offer options  related to the Fast Mail screen you're viewing. You can create a new masked email address. Oh,  let me tell you, that's so cool. If you're using one of the big password managers like our sponsor,  Bitwarden or OnePassword, you can actually create an email address that's unique for every website.  So not only is the password unique, the email addresses, it all goes into your Fast Mail inbox,  but it kind of hides who you are and it gives you another layer of security. That's a nice feature.  Um, you can also in the new Fast Mail interface, choose to auto save contacts,  which I do choose to show public images of centers from external services like Gravatar,  which I do. I love seeing those little, those little avatars next to your email. So I know  who it's from. Honestly, the web client has gotten so good. I it's, it's as good as any desktop client  better set default reminders for events. I love Fast Mail so much. I use it not just for email.  It's my calendar and contact service. I don't use iCloud. I use OneDrive. I don't use Outlook.  I don't use Microsoft. I use Fast Mail because it's private. It's secure. There's somebody on the  other end of the line. It's great support and it, and it works just like all of these to synchronize  with all of my systems. So my calendars live on Fast Mail. My contacts are on Fast Mail and I have  some great Fast Mail settings. For instance, if you're in my contact list, I set up Fast Mail so  that your mail goes to a special mailbox because I know you, you're sending it to somebody I know.  I love this. You can add or buy a domain through Fast Mail. They'll set up all the records for you  so it works immediately. I have a lot of legacy domains. It's pretty easy. It was very easy to  move them over to Fast Mail. And so that means I get DKIM and SPF and all the authentication protocols  at my email addresses. I don't use it for hosting, but I use it for my DNS. It's fantastic.  It's fantastic. Fast Mail lets you send and receive emails from your own custom domain,  unlimited domains, unlimited email addresses, all in one space. For over 20 years, Fast Mail has been  a leader in email privacy. That's why if you care about email, go to Fast Mail for as little as $3 a month.  And better spam filters, of course, no ads and real support from real people.  Better productivity. I can go on and on. I usually I do because I'm love it. I really like,  I want you to get Fast Mail. It's very easy to move to Fast Mail, export your old data, import it  into your new Fast Mail inbox, but you can also continue to receive email from those other accounts  if you want as long as you want. Just have Fast Mail collect it. Fast Mail, by the way,  these that's open source, it uses the Cyrus server. They contribute back with new internet  standards and open source innovations that many other email services use. Fast Mail is kind of a  leader in this field. Reclaim your privacy. Boost productivity with the best email service in the  world. Ask around. Geeks will tell you. Fast Mail. Try it now free for 30 days at  fastmail.com slash twit.

Do I think this is the  right framework? Absolutely not. But I can see why this is happening and I could also see them  thinking, well, I mean, it's content on the internet.

Transcript:  wheel bearings takeover. We had the host of a wheel bearing, Samable Samad, Nicole Wakelin,  Roberta Baldwin. These are all people who report on cars. They were all in agreement that eventually  the law will reflect the actual state, which is, and it's already this way in Europe,  the manufacturer of the self-driving is liable if a car is under self-driving and plows into a wall.  Right now in the U S if you're conducting a vehicle, you're responsible. Whatever that  vehicle does, you're responsible for. But ultimately they, I think I hope I'm not  misquoting them. I understood them to say, no, no, it's software. The software is,  this is a problem generally. The software liability is, you know, you open that shrink  wrap license, it almost always says, Hey, we didn't say this would do anything good or right.  And we are not responsible for it at all. And then in Europe, at least they're pushing back and  saying, no, no, no, if you write software, they get to, Stacey, can I answer you? No, actually in

Start time: 2956.46
End time: 3041.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it means. So it's not exactly what you might, my next line is misusing the word as chat GPT.  Yeah, it sounds good. It's German.  So as we go along the whole case, the, the, the judge said, again, it was the lawyer who used  chat GPT, the lawyer who filed the papers and the law firm. And after they filed the first thing,  the opposing counsel said, we can't find these cases. The judge said, show me these cases.  And then they went off and they had chat GPT make up the cases. The cases were gibberish  in the words of the judge and they put it all in. So the judge said at the end,  he said, it's not fair to pick apart people's words, but he said that I've heard the word  repeatedly, this is repeatedly described as a mistake. He said the mistake may have been  the first submission, but that's the beginning of the narrative. Not the end is again and again  and again, the human beings, the attorneys failed to do their work. They didn't Google the cases.  They could have used Google to say, does this case exist? They didn't do that. They didn't read  the cases to see that it was gibberish. They had a responsibility to their client and the, and,  and Schwartz, the main lawyer apologized to everybody and left out his client. The judge  for that too. And so in the end it was, it was a failure of humanity, not of the machine.  And that's what's interesting about this case to me is that yeah, you can have a tool, the tool can  lie and you know it can lie. And then if you go ahead and spread that lie, whose fault is that?  It ain't the machines. Chat GPT is the wrong party in this suit.

And we all know that it is a  word probability machine. And so it does, we know that it doesn't deal with fact, irresponsible  Microsoft to put it in a search engine, irresponsible the lawyer to have used it, irresponsible open AI.  And in fact, there's a story in the rundown somewhere today that open AI tried to warn  Microsoft early on said it can't do facts. Oh yeah, yeah. They were kind of mad at Microsoft

Transcript:  for rushing ahead with Bing chat. Exactly. Wow. Exactly. Wow. Hey, when you talk to the FTC,  FCC, did you ask them about Comcast? Comcast is complaining. So you know, the FCC has this new  broadband facts nutrition label. They want all broadband companies to provide with clearly  labeled pricing, monthly fees, one time fees, term, early termination fees, speeds provided,  you know, this, the kind of stuff you would want to know as a customer. Yep. Comcast is not happy.  It filed last week with the FCC saying, well, we're working diligently to put in place the  systems and processes necessary, but this is hard. Two aspects of the order can pose significant  administrative burdens and unnecessary complexity in complying with the broadband label requirements.  They don't like the rules. Now we know why they don't like the rules. They know how much they  charge. It can't be that hard. They send you a bill. They know what it costs, but apparently-

Transcript:  It's the same argument the carriers made about broadband mapping when it was first proposed in  2008, 2010. They were like, oh, this data is too onerous and we don't have it and blah, blah,  blah. And then they were like, oh, it'll be competitive information. Yeah, this is the same

Start time: 3171.86
End time: 3203.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  BS thing that they always do. The FTC was required to implement this  rule by Congress in 2021. FCC approved label rules last November, but didn't set a date for  them to take effect. They're subject to a federal OMB review because of the requirements of the US  Paperwork Reduction Act. Medium and large ISPs would require to comply six months after the OMB  review completes. Small providers would have a year to comply. I wonder if we'll ever see these

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  broadband nutrition laws. We will. It'll just be so in, and by then,  I don't know how they'll change it. So they'll probably change their fee structure.  I'm not even devious enough. They'll basically change their fee structure to not have to-

Transcript:  There's two issues. ... advertising is a low price.  Right. But that's not what you're going to pay on your bill because when you look at it,  they'll be the low price plus all of these little fees.  Yeah. Cells phones.  Made up fees. Resort fees.

Start time: 3241.32
End time: 3325.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they do it also. They charge different rates depending on what market they're in,  because some markets are more competitive than others. So if Comcast is going up against  municipal fiber in Chattanooga, it charges lower rates. So there's a lot happening here. And yeah,  you're right. They have billing software. They can totally send it.  They know exactly what it's going to cost. They can send it programmatically to the FCC. This is  one area where I feel like our government needs to just change the way it does. I think these labels  and transparency are important. And it's clear that the government is looking at them more  closely. If you look at the FTC's resort fee issues and that sort of thing, businesses have  programmatic pricing already because they have billing software. Most of them do.  So if you can give access to that via API to a government entity, it's A, pretty relatively  simple. And B, when you change the prices and things change, it could automatically be reflected.  Why the government doesn't demand something like this as part of these rules is beyond me,  because what happens is these sorts of databases get outdated and, oh, it's a FTC's issue.

Transcript:  was trying to- Yeah, but it was kind of an uphill battle. Music companies are now suing Twitter for  copyright violations. I think they're protected by 230 again, but we'll see. The National Music  Publishers Association alleges Twitter violates the copyright of songwriters by using their music  on its platform without permission. The other social media platforms, TikTok, Facebook, Snap,  YouTube, all have agreements that pay the music industry a lot of money.  This company is just seeking $150,000 for every piece of work infringed.  Yeah. Good luck getting that out of Elon. I feel like in this case, I'm kind of on Elon's side.  He's not responsible. If somebody posts a song on Twitter, Section 230 protects him.  And they need to be able to take it down. And they do, I'm sure. Even if they don't,

Start time: 3457.84

Transcript:  over, those conversations ended. I had breakfast this morning with Adam Kobacevich, who's from the  Chamber of Progress, which is a trade association on the left side of things. And it was an interesting  conversation about the whole process of creating, of YouTube creating the identity structure  for a song, whereas it could have just been as simple as take it down, take it down, take it down.  But by giving the monetization opportunity, oh, you can leave it up, but make some money,  and you're going to share the money, it created a whole new business model for music and a whole  new opportunity for creators. And it's a better way to think rather than just go to a pure  copyright structure and say, okay, there's copyright, it enables this, now what can we do about that  that's going to help everybody? And then we need more of that kind of thinking. Well, it also was

I've tried many of the faux meats and I tend to  only use them like if I'm totally like, oh, I need the feel of a sausage in a vegetarian dish.  But the idea here is to help people who only eat meat or meat is an essential part of their diet,  bring in plant and not use as much meat. And I think they have been successful in that way.  So some people have switched from eating meat seven days a week to maybe only doing it five  days a week. Did anyone really think big meat was going to go away? Yeah. No. Well, no. The investors

Transcript:  So you may remember we had the story a few years ago that Google researchers said they had achieved  something called quantum supremacy, which was they were able to do a task more quickly on a  quantum computer than a conventional computer could do. The Google researchers said they did  in two and a half minutes something it would take a regular computer 10,000 years to do.  That's been somewhat debunked. They found a computer that could do it in five minutes.  So I don't know if it was in an Osborne. I don't know what they were talking about.  So they don't want to use that phrase quantum supremacy. They're talking about quantum utility.  We are entering this phase of quantum computing I called utility, said Jay Gambetta, vice president  of IBM quantum, the era of utility. Like it's actually useful. It does something you want.

He didn't buy it. He said, God does not play dice with the universe.  But-  He was wrong.  He was wrong. So apparently this problem is actually cannot be solved,  even in the largest, fastest supercomputers. It's just too complex.  On the quantum computer, get ready. This calculation that a supercomputer can't even do.  The quantum computer solved it in less than a thousandth of a second.  How do you know it's right or wrong?

Start time: 4677.16
End time: 4714.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. That's actually significant. Well, cause like to keep things in quantum state,  you have to, like, if you're going to isolate things in a quantum state, you need to pack it.  It needs to be vacuum packed or it needs to be kept really cold. There's like lots of things  because they're, they want to not, they want to fluctuate and we've got to keep them stable  and make them fluctuate in constrained circumstances. So it takes a lot of physical,  like actual power, like power consumption to keep things cold, but it takes a lot of energy  to keep something that wants to change stable and then change it only when you want it to.

According to Scientific American. But the guy who wrote this,  or I guess he's quoting Andy Blumenfeld, an analyst who tracks the industry at McCloskey.  You might be curious what Andy's thoughts about this are.  From a coal perspective, it has been a disaster.  The decline is happening faster than anyone anticipated.  He says, that's my West Virginia accent.  That's so good.  It's not good.  It's not good. Coal is in deep trouble.  Power markets have witnessed a precipitous drop in coal fire generation this year,  driven by low natural gas prices, a mild winter, and a wave of coal plant retirements.  But I think renewable energy is a good thing.  A lot of jobs. It doesn't pollute as much.  Everything pollutes. I'm polluting right now.

Whenever there's a discussion of trying to get rid of all of this stuff going on with  coal, the first argument was all the jobs that are going to be lost.  There aren't that many coal miners.

We're still generating an awful lot of power with coal, but good.  Coal generated almost half the country's electricity as recently as 2008.  And fortunately, it's been in a steady decline ever since.  It's a wave of older coal facilities retired,  replaced by a combination of natural gas and renewables.  Natural gas has its own issues.

They created a new product, Google showcase.  They have 150 publishers in the US who are up there.  They're going to pay them some buckets of money to go away.  But at the same exact time, the news media association, news leaders association,  is once again lobbying to get the JCPA, the journalism something protection act,  passed California is about to pass their version of this in which they're going to.  So the publishers on the one hand are saying, thank you, Google.  I'll take your money and put it in my pocket.  On the other hand, they're saying, kill Google and make them give us even more money.

That uses generative AI to predict how clothes will drape, fold, cling, stretch,  and form wrinkles and shadows on a diverse set of real models in various poses.  Sure.  I have to say, in all honesty, in my 66 years, I have never considered how  any article of clothing will drape, fold, cling, stretch, or form wrinkles on my body.  What?  Neither have I.

Oh, well then maybe that's a little too tight.  Or does it, I don't know, do something like this, then maybe it's too big on my shoulders.  It's hard because I wear clothes that mostly fit me.  But that's the drape.  And then how it falls, is it going to skim the fat parts of your body or is it going to fall in a  flattering way? Is it more structured?

Their website is adding advanced editing tools  that you might have seen before in Google One including  portrait light, portrait blur, dynamic, color pop, HDR, and sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, perfect.  There you go.  Sir Paul McCartney says AI has enabled a final Beatles song.  The song has cleaned up John Lennon vocals.  They think it comes from a 1978 Lennon composition called Now and Then.  But Sir Paul has not said they were considering it as a reunion song for the Beatles in 1995  when they were working on anthology.  Sir Paul had received the demo according to the BBC a year earlier from Lennon's widow  Yoko Ono.  It was on a cassette labeled for Paul that Lennon made just before he was assassinated in 1980.  Oh, geez.  But it's lo-fi.  The tracks were recorded onto a boombox as a musician set at a piano in the New York apartment.  So the band had attempted to clean up Now and Then.  Which was apparently a kind of an apology to Paul.  But they couldn't really clean it up.  Sir Paul said Jeff Lynn tried it of the Electric Light Orchestra.  He wasn't able to.  We spent a day, an afternoon really messing with it, but they couldn't make it work.  George Harrison refused to work on the song saying the sound quality of Lennon's vocal was rubbish.  It needed a lot of reworking.  It had a beautiful verse.  It had John singing.  Because George didn't like it, we didn't do it.  But AI has no opinion.  And so they're going to work on it.  And apparently will be released soon.  We haven't had a new Beatles song in a long, long time.  It'll be released sometime this year according to the Beeb.  Yeah, that's cool.  I mean there was a lot of computer, I guess you could call it AI,  processing done to make the Peter Jackson film Get Back.  Which was an incredible footage shot of the Beatles rehearsing and preparing for a live performance  from the Let It Be album.  And you actually saw them writing the album stuff.  But it was originally recorded.  They didn't want the vocal dialogue, the conversations.  They just wanted the music.  So it was mic'd for the music and you couldn't hear the voices.  Peter Jackson used all sorts of AI techniques to bring the voices up.  If you've not seen it, Get Back is on the Disney Plus channel.  It's amazing watching Paul McCartney write Get Back and Let It Be.  Working at stuff with John and George.  It's really, Ringo, it's really amazing.

I can't remember where that is.  But that's also Paul talking about their process.  I'm interested in the creative process.  I'm a huge Beatles fan.  Watching Get Back is watching...  Probably the greatest musicians of that time  at their peak of ability, working together.  It was shortly before the band broke up, though.  So there's some tensions.  But working together to create,  and watching them write Get Back  and make it up is brilliant.  It's amazing.  Did you get Rick Rubin back?  You haven't steered me wrong yet.  I did get Rick Rubin's.  I gave it to Lisa for her birthday.  Oh.  We haven't worked through it yet,  but I want to work through it,  because it's all about creativity.  Nice.

I think it's a document of something  that was going on in 1969.  It's fascinating.  Yeah.  Researchers have discovered  that chat GPT isn't really that funny.  Oh.  When tested, over 90% of the 1008 generated jokes  were the same 25 jokes.  The irony is this is from a German researchers.  We're not known for their sense of humor.  They released a paper.  This was with chat GPT 3.5, not the latest,  but they asked to tell a joke,  tell a joke, tell a joke,  and basically it came down to about 25.  As an example,  why did the scarecrow win an award?

Google is postponing Bard's EU launch  because the EU is worried about privacy.  The Irish privacy watchdog said,  Google hasn't given us...  Sorry.  Google hasn't given us sufficient information  about how to respect the EU's data privacy rules.  I don't...  Irish?  It's Irish and I like it too.  I think that's the problem.  They just don't know.  Anyway, Bard's not going to launch this week  and you can thank the leprechaun for that.  Doctors, however, are using chat GPT.  What do you think they're using it for?  Diagnosing strange rashes?  No.  They're using it to improve their bedside manner.  Apparently, some doctors are so poor at relating to humans,  they're going to a computer for help.

If you're compassionate, you wouldn't charge me  a thousand dollars to tell me I have a KP rash.  In another survey, nearly three quarters of respondents  said they had gone to doctors who were not compassionate.  Who hasn't, right?  And a study of doctors' conversations  with the family of dying patients found  many were not very empathetic.  It's hard.  So here's a way-

Start time: 6507.50
End time: 6519.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because there, I mean,  doctors are trained to keep you alive,  so coming to tell someone they can't keep it,  it's basically like, hey, I can't do my job.  I failed.  Right.  Yeah. That's hard for anyone.

Transcript:  How can doctors better help patients  who are drinking too much alcohol  but have not stopped after talking to a therapist?  Dr. Pignoni asked his team to write a script  for how to talk to these patients compassionately.  A week later, no one had done it.  All he had was a text, his research coordinator  and his social worker on the team had put together,  and that was not a true script.  So he went to, this is Dr. Michael Pignoni,  chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine at UT Austin.

Social workers, though, said the script needed to be revised  for patients with little medical knowledge  and translated into Spanish.  The ultimate result, which this is all from the New York Times,  which Chat GPT produced when asked to rewrite it  at a fifth grade reading level  began with a reassuring introduction.  Oh, nice.  This is for you, Ant.  Okay.  If you think you drink too much alcohol,  you're not alone.  Many people have this problem,  but there are medicines that can help you feel better  and have a healthier, happier life.

No, she said, the problem with Ozempic is  you have to take it for the rest of your life.  Because if you stop, you gain more weight back  and start drinking.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Melissa, the data quality experts,  e-commerce, get this, this number is scary, e-commerce losses to online payment fraud, right?  In 2022, $41 billion with a B.  Wow, that's one reason fraud takes a big bite out of you.  But Melissa can solve it, helping organization tackle  identity fraud with an end to end process to safely track customer data.  They have a whole suite of tools to do this.  For example, the biometrics verification step has an algorithm that recognizes a matchup  between the user's selfie and their ID image.  This works really well.  And it's nice for the users.  It's not intrusive.  It's fast.  It's easy.  Biometrics verification identifies a set of over 60 different facial features,  distinguishes changes between the selfie and the ID image.  So even if you grew a beard, right, it still knows it's you.  Facial hair, makeup, age difference, it's an old picture, doesn't matter.  Hairstyle, skin imperfections, got a little rash, no problem.  Positions in head pose.  This technology gives businesses an added layer of security and confidence knowing,  yeah, this customer is who they say they are.  Payment fraud, $41 billion in 2022.  The financial industry and e-commerce retailers are already using AI powered fraud  detection systems to safeguard their customers from fraud.  Thanks to Melissa.  For example, bank and credit card companies use machine learning algorithms to scrutinize  customer data.  You can actually tell from the things like the purchase history and the location  to spot suspicious transactions.  Retailers leverage AI powered fraud detection systems to prevent fraudulent orders  and charge backs.  With Melissa, you can reduce risk, ensure compliance and keep customers happy.  Melissa's ID tools give you all kinds of nice features.  I'll give you a couple.  Proof of life scans.  So it checks the face and eye movement to make sure that that's a real person.  It's not a cardboard cutout.  They do document verification that captures ID and document data  using a machine readable zone and optical character recognition document scanning.  So the critical information can be extracted easily from passports, utility bills,  drivers, licenses, and so forth.  Biometrics, of course, uses smart facial recognition and facial comparison algorithms  to recognize a match between a selfie and the ID.  Melissa has been doing this since 1985, long before these technologies were there.  They've been there for you to help you keep your address and contact information up to  enrich it and now to guarantee that your customer is who they say they are.  Melissa continually undergoes independent security audits so your data is safe.  Melissa is fully compliant, SOC 2, HIPAA, GDPR compliant.  Your data is protected and compliant.  Make sure your customer contact data is up to date.  Avoid fraud.  It can cost you an awful lot.  Bad data can cost you a lot.  Get started today with Melissa and 1000 records clean for free.

Transcript:  So that was my thing of the week.  Oh, yeah.  So yeah, you set it up really nicely for me.  Thank you.  But do you really, I will tell you very briefly what the FCC said today if you want.  Sure.  Yes, we do want to.  Okay.  The Federal Communications Commission has created a data privacy task force and  enforcement bureau.  It's going to be part of their enforcement bureau.  They announced this today and the goal is to figure out a way to stop wireless  carriers from selling your data.  And they explained their legal ideas and how to do this.  So the laws that would allow them to do this.  There's a couple and they also said that they are going to create standards for  helping standards that carriers need to follow when not doing SIM swaps, but  changing out a customer's phone number so people can't use SIM swapping as a way to  hack someone's account.  So that's also like a nice thing.  And they did one other thing that I can't remember right off the top of my head.  So these are good steps.

Start time: 7151.48
End time: 7174.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We care.  Honestly, this is the thing every regulator should be focusing on.  We had a story this week.  I should actually should have had it in our rundown that the United States.  Was it from Wired?  Yes.  You know what I'm talking about.  It was the United States intelligence agencies buying data from data brokers illegally  and using it data about all of us.  That's okay.

Start time: 7175.20
End time: 7195.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  We talked about that in March on our show because that's actually when the director  of the FBI talked about it.  What they released was a report that shows how deep this is and it's really freaking  deep, y'all.  You could do Stacy on privacy if you want to create that section.  No, I think this is the US is openly stockpiling dirt on all its citizens,

Start time: 7195.48
End time: 7206.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  writes Del Cameron and Wired.  This is the newly declassified report from the Office of the Director of the National  Intelligence.  They're buying a ton of data and it's not even legal, right?  They're not supposed to be spying on Americans.

Start time: 7206.20
End time: 7251.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's what they're well, it's the FBI.  It's kind of a loophole.  The FBI is doing it and they're in charge of national law enforcement.  What they're loopholing is the Fourth Amendment because it's when they're not getting a  warrant for this information.  They're basically using a data broker instead of going to a wireless carrier.  If you go to a wireless carrier and say, I'm interested in information about this phone.  You need a warrant.  Now, to avoid that, they just say, oh, well, I'll just call up a data broker and they get  the same information from the data broker without having to go through a warrant.  They can also get credit card information, not from the credit card company, just from  a data broker.  That's the stuff that they've been buying as outlined in this report.

Start time: 7251.86
End time: 7261.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The report states the government believes it can persistently track the phones of millions  of Americans without a warrant as long as it pays for the information.

Start time: 7261.74
End time: 7262.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it illegal?  Right.

Start time: 7265.32
End time: 7289.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, there's no.  That's the thing.  So the FTC tried to regulate.  The FTC came down against a data broker.  They tried to sue a data broker.  The data broker fought the suit and the settlement.  Basically, a federal court said, you know what, FTC, you got to prove harm to show that  these data brokers are nefarious.  The FTC couldn't quite prove harm.

Start time: 7289.94
End time: 7298.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They may go back, by the way.  I think the judge was in effect instructing them.  Look, if you want this case to win, you've got to come back with some harm.

Start time: 7299.35
End time: 7312.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  So if you could actually find out somebody who was picked up by the FBI without a warrant,  I mean, that's harm.  Not saying that the person's innocent, but we do have due process for a reason.

Start time: 7314.18
End time: 7321.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The government's position is that this is publicly available data.  Anybody can buy it.  So I don't need a warrant.  It's public.

Start time: 7323.12
End time: 7359.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So the FCC, by classifying, there's a couple things.  Okay.  We're going to put it in the newsletter because there's a lot there.  They're going to have to classify certain class.  Geolocation data right now isn't considered proprietary.  I don't believe it's considered CNPI, which is what the FCC consumer  protected network data, which is data about  what phone number, where it is, who is attached to it.  I'm sorry, where it is.

Start time: 7359.42
End time: 7394.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's really happened is, and the ODNI says this in the report,  if the government said you and you and you and you, in fact, all of you have to carry  a tracking device and we should be able to log and track all your social interactions,  know where you are, see everything you do, that would be clearly wrong.  We voluntarily carry these devices in our pockets.  That information is then sold by carriers and others, app makers, and the government says,  oh, thank you.  Thanks very much.  I didn't have to make you do it.

Start time: 7394.40
End time: 7405.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, the government ended up mandating this because we had to have access to E911,  which meant every phone has to have GPS.  Not that anyone would buy a phone without GPS, but anyway.

Start time: 7407.65
End time: 7424.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Yeah.  I think there's a big issue.  Yeah, no, that's a huge story.  And it's really an issue.  And I think that's the, I mean, when you say let's ban TikTok, ban TikTok, the Chinese  government can also buy this information.  This information is widely available.  That's what we've got to solve.

Start time: 7431.40
End time: 7467.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is a lot better.  And also when law enforcement says, oh, we're going dark, you know, this end to end encryption,  we know it's going to be a very big problem.  We won't be able to arrest bad guys.  They're not going dark.  They have more information than they've ever had before.  Technology has enabled them to follow us around and we're going along with it.  So I think this is a big, I think this might be the biggest story, frankly, of privacy.  And really supersedes a lot of these other trivial things that people are worried about.  You think?  Thank you, Stacey.  I will look forward to that report on Friday.

Google Home, if you're in the preview of the new Google Home, which if you're a smart home person,  I say go do it, man.  It's awesome.  Or at least it's much better.  It puts Google on par with more comparable systems.  But it also gives you the script editor, which is the only way you're going to be able to do  some of the cool stuff that you can do with like smart things and others when you're doing  an automation.  It also is the only thing that's going to allow you to trigger,  to create trigger events from sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, not...  Maybe not.  I mean, I'm going to figure it out,  which is...  And I don't really code.  I don't code at all.  You can figure out...

So I can respond to a doorbell press here.  When the doorbell press happens from the front door,  and that was all auto filled, then...  And there's certain conditions here,  and I can see what those are.  Like when sunsets.  Yeah, and the sun's down.  If my doorbell rings after midnight,  then release the hounds, that kind of thing.

Well, they're not going to freaking love it,  because they don't freaking love anything.  But it gives you a lot more power.  This is very powerful.  It reminds me of Ruby.  Are they a grumpy bunch?  Well, they have opinion.  Like anybody who gets really deep into something,  they have opinions about what their favorite things are,  and Google is never on that list from a home automation standpoint.

So there's something, there's some differences going on here.  But I have, we have Google Home devices around here.  That's cool.  So you can even write a Google Assistant script  that's triggered by your voice.  It's pretty slick.  I think that's really neat.  All right.  Thank you, Stacey.  That's your thing.  I don't know what it is, but that's what it is.  It's scripting.  Automations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've done it earlier, but they're actually moving forward.  They're actually moving forward.  Oh, that's awesome.

Start time: 7917.52
End time: 7932.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just for the record.  Well, I have a silly little photo thing, but we were also going to discuss beforehand Spotify,  which was going to take over podcasts, getting rid of 200 people and kind of ruining podcasting  and then say, nevermind.

Start time: 7934.53
End time: 8095.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's a little pivot from them to be a creator of content to supporting other podcast creators.  Do you trust them?  Well, they bought Anchor FM, which actually is how I created my...  I mentioned Leo on the line, my little podcast that I did 10 years ago.  Anyway.  Anchor makes it really easy.  In case I got fired.  Yeah, I love Anchor.  Well, that's no longer Anchor.  It's like the Spotify podcast studio.  They've rebranded everything.  I think it's an interesting thing.  They kind of want to be more like YouTube, like support creators than like Gimlet,  like creating... and they bought Gimlet.  Will they respect RSS?  No, of course not.  What?  Yes, they will.  No, they will.  Anchor FM's podcasts are RSS compliant.  So I imagine they'll continue to do that.  I think they've really learned a lesson, right?  They spent a lot of money.  They spent at least half a billion dollars.  So they regret Joe Rogan?  They regret Joe Rogan.  Yeah.  Caller Daddy was $60 million over three years.  They bought The Ringer.  Must have cost at least $100 million.  Gimlet Media.  Gimlet, Parcast.  So it's interesting.  I think to some degree they're seeing that the podcast  industry isn't as lucrative as they might have thought it is.  On the other hand, they were doing it because they were under the thumb of the music industry  and they wanted to create content.  So I think almost this story is a pivot of Spotify from being initially a place where  you would stream music, then added other audio content where you'd stream audio content to  being a facilitator because they need creators to create a lot of content so that they don't have to  worry about the music side of things.  Yeah.  So I don't think it's a bad thing for podcasting necessarily.  I'm not ready to cry wolf yet.  We'll see.  I mean, I certainly will if it turns out.  We get one immediate benefit.  We've been paying for a service that Spotify called Podsites.  They've rolled it now into Spotify Ad Tech and it's free.  So we were paying.  It was expensive.  But some advertisers did demand it.  So we were using it and now we can get it for free.  So that's huge.  We've been talking to Libsyn about direct ad insertion.  We use Megaphone, which is a Spotify company right now.  Also expensive.  We're very interested to see what they do with Megaphone.  If they drop the price of Megaphone, that will be a huge deal for us.  So it could be very good for us in the long run.  We'll see.

Transcript:  Ant, do you have something you want to pick?  My pick is for those of you using Lightroom mobile, there was a recent  update that's been rolling out.  I haven't gotten an update yet, but they've made some changes as far as how you can import  your images on your phone into Lightroom to do your post-processing.  Now there's really no import.  They're just sort of there.  So that sort of speeds up workflow.  And then they also added this little cool feature that basically records your editing  process so you can share out your editing process, how you did that, how you created your image.

Start time: 8207.20
End time: 8217.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As you know, I like my Leica Q2 camera.  Lobby doll.  Leica has a Photos app, which imports your photos to your computer or your phone.  Now supports direct support for darkroom.  So kind of like Lightroom, darkroom is built in now to do all your photo editing.  So they've streamlined that as well.  That makes sense.  This is a smart thing to do because most photos are now done on the phone.

Transcript:  Because we've got to get rid of that crap.  Jesus, stuff is awful.  If you are not yet a member of Club Twit, it's not too late.  You can join.  It is very affordable.  Seven bucks a month gets you ad free versions of all of our shows,  gets you access to the discord where lots of stuff happens.  It's kind of, you know, like behind the velvet rope.  You get all those events.  We've got shows we don't put out.  Otherwise, we only put them out for the club.  Hands on Macintosh with Micah Sargent, hands on Windows with Paul Thurati.  I think the biggest newest launch is Scott Wilkinson's Home Theater Geeks.  This week at Space started in the club.  It's one way we can develop new shows and bring them out  because your seven bucks a month pays for all of that.  Podcasting is struggling, but the future, I think, of what we do is with you.  If you like what we produce and you want us to keep producing it,  it's not a lot of money, a latte or two a month, seven dollars a month.  But it makes a huge difference to us.  Twitter.tv slash club Twitter.  There's also an annual plan, family plan, corporate plans as well.
