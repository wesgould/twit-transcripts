Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason go ahead go ahead tell the truth you change the locks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so going forward  No, I have not changed anything. I would not dare do that to mr. Laporte  Obviously Jeff Jarvis is here creator of buzz machine comm professor at the CUNY school of journalism. How you doing Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, good to be here. Good. You've been doing a great job. Jason. Glad to have you here. Thanks Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I appreciate that. It's always a lot of fun. Also joining us is Stacy Higginbotham  Creator of the IOT podcast at IOT podcast comm Internet of Things newsletter at Stacy on IOT comm. How are you Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So well, and as you guys notice I am traveling today. There's a drum kit a microphone and bookshelf  So enjoy the oh, please pay the drum Stacy, please please  Oh, I can't and I'm not allowed to touch them unless I get like basic instruction first, so  Yeah, no, you're saying that I am sitting at a piano too now that I can go ahead and play a tune go ahead  Oh, hey, let's see. Hold on. I think this is essential  This this is this is way. Okay. Hold on you guys  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Didn't do the chords

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't worry those amazing  But I really want to see you on the drum set before the end of the show  Maybe that can be your thing at the end of the episode is a drum fill

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll hold. Oh, it's like I caused you you we unplugged Stacy. We can't hear you. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? Oh now we can there we go. Now you're back. Oh, oh, that's cool  Everyone else missed my my rendition of we heard

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We made fun of it already. It's alright

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We heard the Saints go marching in and I probably couldn't play it nearly as well as you did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but I'm hoping that every time Jason makes a joke you can do a rim shot of the drums

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would be that your laptop would have to be set up on like a Tom or something in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, pull that. Yes. I'm like I'm like sitting here thinking how can I make that happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The drumstick behind you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The first time like  There we go. All right, that works that works  Joining us here. So we kind of have a surprise guest here at the table  Duncan Jaffrey is a senior associate at Oz droid Oz droid net  First of all, it's great to get you on the show Duncan. Thank you very much Jason. Thank you for having us  Yeah, absolutely. You reached out to me a couple of weeks ago  On Twitter saying that you were gonna be in the area  I just did not put two and two together the fact that you were coming to the area for Oz droid to cover  Google's big hardware event yesterday and that you were gonna be in here at the same time that I'm you know  Helping to host this week in Google. It's like all things suddenly came together  So my apologies to you because you literally found out like 10 minutes ago that you're doing the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that's perfectly fine. We kept the purpose of my visit a little under wraps until all the nda's are dropped. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfectly fine. Thanks for having me. Yeah, absolutely and Oz droid dot net. I'm no stranger  That's no stranger to me. Anyways, Daniel Tyson's been on  All about android a  Decent amount of times he always brings Australian  goodies with him and you also did  Tim tams tim tams tim tams tim tams the big pack the value pack. So if you like tim tams  Oh, I do  Not one, but two  Apparently, this is like super value  Um, and yeah, these are really delicious. They're not bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you. They sell them at target during the holidays  Just in case I came back from australia with a craving for tim tams  And I was like, oh this is the worst and then target over christmas tim tams

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You also, you know, uh, have you ever had fantails?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fantails I I have not last time dan was here. He brought minties which I think are reminiscent of toothpaste  And so it's a toothpaste based lolly  Whereas uh, these are a far more chocolatey caramely thing and the little hook with these is the rappers have trivia  About different movie stars and so forth on them. So you get a meal on a show as it were

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get a little smarter while you're getting that cavity in your tooth another traditional australian  Confectionary excellent. Well chewy caramel with a rich chocolate coating if it's got chocolate in the name and it doesn't have any nougat  Doesn't have any nougat. All right, so  Jeff stacy nougat nougat. How do you pronounce? I'm from texas. I'm going to say nougat. Yeah nougat  I think we just all do  Hey, there you go. That's a good mashup. So does it sound just strange when we end up saying nougat nougat

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, I mean speaking to david burke yesterday. He was very strongly in the nougat camp  So I think if mr android himself says nougat i'm going to go with android well with nougat

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the creator of gifts says jeff and I refuse to go along so no, he's wrong. You got me on that one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stand I mean, you know, I think the probably the right authority on this would be google now  Uh, so i'm gonna go ahead and do this. I did this on all about android. This might drive the point home  What is nougat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hopefully got that hold on  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah  Mm-hmm nougat  There you go  It's been decided. It's totally the jiff gif argument all over again

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so so the hillary clinton campaign when it put out a press release after the the  New york times did the donald trump attack story?  They said the gig is up  And so I was one among many who tweeted and said no, it's it's jig unless you're trying to do a gift jiff thing here

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really not gig because if you have a job, it's a gig. Yeah, that's true  That's why the gig economy is a play on work jig is up jig

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, and see now that you say it. I feel like i've heard both and i've just never

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is a jig like the sailors dance? Where did this word come from? I guess so i'm not even sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, let's see here talk about anything on this show. Yeah exactly etymology or pixels

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where do we want to begin? Why don't we start with? Um, oh, I don't know google  Which is kind of why we're all here  I know I like to keep pretty close to the google stuff when I end up coming on to this week in google  It is after all in the name, but I mean honestly as far as like days  Weeks important weeks in the year that that google has, you know, I mean they have lots of important  memorable moments throughout the course of the year this kind of  Every year this kind of hardware announcement event is probably right at the top of the list of some of the most most important announcements  Uh that google unveils so I think it's probably safe to say we should talk about this  And a lot because there's a lot to talk about. Uh, first of all, you were at the event duncan you were in the  audience  Um, did you hear? Okay google setting off millions of phones simultaneously throughout the course of the entire event

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't say that I did and that might be because most people had their devices away or they had them on silent  But I wasn't aware of anyone in my little area I was sitting in that had any sort of  interaction with the  Hey google, which is our way of avoiding the phrase

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's a good way around so I get a lot of requests from people telling us that we should be respectful  Of their phones and their time on this sort of thing and use something that isn't the trigger word  I just want to throw that out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know  It's really hard to remember to do that though when you're talking about it, but I guess that's you know  That's it's our job to talk about it. So I guess we should be more respectful about that  I just forget it's not that i'm like trying to play a practical joke on people  I just forget until it's too late. Yeah, same here. Yeah, but when we start adding, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Control of your home with things that's gonna get dicey dicey

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It will absolutely

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what I still understand if you is this we're on this topic  If you have your phone with you and you have your your home thing there, uh, and you say the magic words  How will google know which one right they said that only the one will respond but how do I know which one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what they said at the event is they gave an example of a house that had three different units in it  And you had your phone on you and it will use the machine learning to detect  What the the input is how you know how loud it is in each speaker and then it will just choose to use that input device  Um, the question I had on that is how much lag will that be?  I already experienced some lag when using that phrase  It will still trigger my phone surely because the phone has to be triggered in order to send the signal  So I still had some questions, but I think at least in the home itself  All of your lights might go off, but only one of them is going to talk back to you  But I think it was a little unclear still jeff as you said how that's going to work with the phone the multi-device makes complete sense  But their explanation explanation on how the phone worked just didn't seem to make logical sense with how the platform works now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, so we'll find out in the middle of november when all of our homes arrive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so would you okay?  So obviously they announced pretty much everything that they announced hardware wise we already knew

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leading not to it and and no we just mentioned this more in full moment because I always have to complain  No new pixel  Laptop and the pixel laptop is gone and this is this is worrying me greatly  But I just wanted to get that on the record google google. Are you listening google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what do you love my pixel? What do you do in the meantime then?  So you've got your pixel two if it dies if it dies unworked. Yeah, they aren't really selling the pixel two anymore. So  You'd have to hop over to one of the outside of not made by google devices

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Risky. Yeah. Anyway, I just want to get that on the record. We're now let's go out of the happy news

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't we don't have a pixel three yet  Of course that news was kind of bundled with the idea of this andromeda, you know  Some sort of a tease some sort of a demonstration or at least mention of the future of android possibly converging with chrome os  Called andromeda didn't hear about it in the event yesterday  I guess we're starting with what we didn't hear about  And in retrospect it actually makes a whole lot of sense  like it really did kind of seem strange that a product announcement event would also be  A like a keynote event that you might find at a conference like google io or whatever  So in hindsight, it makes a lot of sense that we didn't hear about that  But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's not happening. It also doesn't mean that a pixel three is not happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just you want to you want a crazy theory? Yes go  Yeah, so you remember idf intel got up on stage and even in their last earnings call actually mostly at idf  They didn't talk about pcs at all because this is like the end of the pc world. It's all about mobile  It's all about internet of things. It's all about cloud  So what if you think like a pixel is kind of like a input old school kind of pc like device, right?  And you think about the merging of chrome and ios not ios chrome and ios  chrome and android  What if what if they're like, eh, let's really focus on where we're innovating what's new  And that's why we got the ai focus and all the kind of homey stuff and then the phones  Just thought because the phones are more about like a showcase for google assistant if you think about it that way

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Crazy idea. I don't think that's very crazy at all. I really think like big time  And they they led the event around ai like it was pretty much  What the the impression that i've gotten at since the event, you know  Kind of concluded and everything is that google really sees its ai as its killer feature  It's its killer feature of all of its hardware kind of saw this, you know leading up to it  But the phones that they've announced which we'll talk about in a second premium price and a lot of people are like  Why are they so darn expensive?  Google believes that its version of ai the new assistant  Replacing google now at least in the pixel phones at launch and exclusively in the pixel phones at launch  Is one of the key marquee features that would move a true google, you know person who lives in the google universe  To you know understand that there's value in that higher price

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so here's my key question for the entire announcement and one of you perhaps can answer it  How is it hardware dependent I would think that all ai is occurring up at big computers somewhere and then it's about  communications  and  connectivity to  Uh ai based servers and how they do all the work. How is this at all dependent upon the hardware of the phone?  I don't understand that in the least

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I can answer this go unless you don't want me to  Okay, this is this is how I used to think about ai  I was like, oh you train it and executions all in the cloud and you send it back down  But there are lots of things that require less latency  Two there are things especially in the home where you want to train stuff  For individual homes and you want to do it independent of an internet connection  Things like computer vision if you can adjust those models like over time  So what's going to happen is the training will still happen in the cloud for the most part still and then the execution happens on the device  But execution's still really intensive. So  I guess does that answer your question? I kind of got a little sidetracked

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No  Leading on from that though, um in the one-on-ones following the event they did make it clear  There's nothing unique about the pixel and the pixel xl. That would necessarily mean it's the only phone capable  Of using the new google assistant what they did say is that they're still you know, they use the term learning the assistant's still learning  they're still teaching it and one of the reasons why it's only on that one product is that  As a feature from the search team, it's still developing. It's still building  um  Up until the latest release of alope it was still preview review now that hasn't been updated yet  I don't know if that'll change but they made it quite clear that it's not that they're not going to partner in future or that  It won't be open to others  It's that no one has approached them and at the moment they're very much taking a a walk before they can run approach with that  It doesn't help that it does differentiate their hardware  Amongst any others

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so let me try a conspiracy theory here, which is that there really isn't any hardware dependency at all  That they're just using this as a rollout and a feature and it's a marketing thing  and  If there's no hardware dependency, then do I really need to spend?  900 to buy a phone  I don't if i'm just willing to wait longer. I don't feel like that's conspiracy theory at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's exactly what you have here. I mean google  What i've realized in thinking about the event and the announcement, uh, you know in the past 24 hours  Talking about it at length yesterday all over twitter and then taking a break from it  Is that what google really wanted to do with this event?  I think is google wants to be seen on the same playing field  As apple or as samsung about having a premium device that everybody really wants and the way that they differentiate is kind of the same way  That samsung has tried to differentiate itself for a long time well-designed hardware check  Also software that's unique to itself and I think building assistant  Into that hardware specifically right now  Maybe that'll open up to other hardware down the line and I don't see why it wouldn't it actually makes a whole lot of sense  Why would google want to keep that to just these phones because they're all about collecting, you know and aggregating all this information  So down the line, yes, it would open up but for right now the differentiating software feature for google  Is assistant. I mean there are other features there, but that is I think  That is the the special service that sundar bachai  Mentioned, you know months ago when when he said that you know google's taking a much more focused  Look at how they're creating hardware and they're going to be more opinionated about what they led on their hardware  It's not it's going to be stock android plus  More and this is part of the plus more that that kind of differentiates it from everyone else  That makes sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you look at the uh, the very opening of the keynote when sundar bachai came out and he spoke about the evolution  Of computing and the paradigm changes  um  You know the the two messages I took out of the event is exactly what jason just said  Is that google is here? They are a premium hardware company and they want to be seen that way  Um one of the reasons for the pixel name was to completely separate themselves from nexus what nexus was  One of the quotes they gave was nexus was the best of android pixel is the best of google  And so they made that very clear that you know pixel is premium pixel is the best pixel is google  And we'll discuss it later in the phones  But you know, that's the reasoning they gave for a lot of the differences to the nexus  Uh sort of uh program we've seen in the past  The other thing they're focusing in on was very clear is ai ai as a platform  They see that transcending the computer being omnipresent and they've had this line for a while  But it it came through very clearly that they actually see ai as the next iteration of computing  It's not mobile first anymore. It's ai first. That was that was the words he used  And you know, they're always trying to make sure they stay relevant in the next phase and I think by  Taking ownership of ai  And then extending that to others so everyone else is on their ai platform is the only way they can play that so it definitely will open

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that also struck me as interesting because that was very much a geek presentation of the idea no consumer  very few consumers rather  would  Understand the impact of ai on why I should buy this phone  Except you know wheels looking at and saying oh ai it's cool  Oh gotta have that I don't know what it means, but I gotta have that gotta have that right. That's us  But real people would say what?  Whereas the real impact here is that it's google's and i've always argued always always always that google is a personal services company versus  Mass media we treat everybody the same we give you all the same product  Google treats you as an individual knows you as an individual serves you as an individual  So now they can do that ever more and they can anticipate your needs  There's all kinds of ways to say that but saying your ai first means nothing to consumers I would think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, google has historically been a little too nerdy in their messaging because google's a bunch of dirty. I mean bless their hearts  And they're right that ai is the future and  They have one of the best platforms apple is terrible  And well, it's parable. Maybe apple is not great at ai  And google and facebook are really dominating microsoft has some stuff  And so  I think what we're going to see here in google's been aware for ages  That with mobile and with computing everywhere, they're going to lose their primary revenue stream of ads presented on a screen  After a search, right? So they knew this was coming. So the answer is how do you get ahead of it and they  Even years ago talking to people when talking about ai they talked about it as a way to deliver better products to people better services  Possibly better hardware, but mostly better google products. So and that's that's what we've been seeing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and how do they do that to connect with the general consumer? Maybe  ai as a buzzword isn't something that's going to pull the general consumer in but personal assistant on your phone  Definitely does at least that's what they've all been trying, you know trying for the last few years  This is this now with assistant is an extension of that  So it might not be marketed as as ai, but it's definitely ai driving this super handy, you know  Key feature of these devices. This is why you need it because it's going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's just say that there's nothing hardware dependent for ai and super duper resistant on the new phone  I mean if you're wrong, but let's just say that for the sake of argument if that's the case  What else and and the camera is supposed to be a wonderful camera?  All right, so those are the two things that I heard yesterday that make this phone stand out  Other than that, why should I replace my 6p?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what do you think duncan

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's a really  Tough sell if i'm trying to sell you on  Outlaying your own money. So yeah having had a quite a considerable amount of time  I stayed back a little bit longer yesterday to do a lot of mucking around where I could with both of the devices  Um, look the the overall build quality of the phone is amazing  I think partnering with htc who are known to be exceptional at manufacturing great devices when they want to  Their prowess from the you know m7 onwards was very evident  In the construction of the device the antenna lines the zero gap  You can run your finger over that and you know, you'll need younger hands in mind to detect anything other than a completely smooth interface  A little bit of glass at the top really did offset it  So, you know overall you can see that someone has obsessively designed  I was very worried with the early renders that it would have an angular feel an angular back  And now look the front does have a bit of an angular bezel. You don't touch that  Um, if I had any complaint, it would be the button stuck out a little bit too much  But then i've complained that other phones they didn't stick out enough. So i'm not really going to complain about that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's criticism of  Of how well this phone has done  In terms of going to the market and saying you're gonna spend right 650 to 800. It wasn't 900 on the phone  Uh, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Convincing argument is yeah convincing a gent the general consumer that this is on par with the top of the line phones out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I reviewed the note 7 and i'd put them as equal you survived. I did mine never had any issues. Um,  Except the fact that they took it off me that was an issue I had with it. Um  The camera launched just as fast the the images shot just as fast  um in  Wildly whipping the phone around the room to different  Um focal deaths different lighting situations. I was rarely able to get the camera to fault and create a less than acceptable  On the pixel phones on the pixel phones, which is the kind of test we did with the note as well  Um, it was a great camera. This is the camera that google hardware fans nexus fans have been waiting for it is delivered  It was fast. It was slick  I can't fault it. Will it work every single time on every photo? No  But what camera will

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Round so stacy you have an order. Are you going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, i'm not gonna like i am actually not a huge mobile phone adapter  Uh, so i'm content to wait another year because you never leave your home because you're always iot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you have to be at home. So you're just not mobile

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly. No, um, what are you talking? I'm outside of my home right now. I'm in someone else's home

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't believe it. I don't believe it. I think you just brought in some sets from ikea just to make this just another room  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  um  So so yeah, i'm not going to order this phone  Just because it's expensive. I'm content with what I have it  I mean I judge a device based on can I this is sad is i'm so lame. Can I text with it?  Can I  You know open the apps I need to do to test my home gadgets and does it offer geofencing? I mean it's it's so lame

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is stacy. I know you guys are like god. Why do we even have you on the show? I don't even know what to say now  Um, so i'm i'm your normal person when it comes to phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean do you place high value on things like a camera in the phone that you have?  Because I mean, you know, they say the best camera you have is the one you have on you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right and i'm totally that person. Yeah, I mean god you guys would hate me  I was actually looking at the so I had a theory for you jeff  Um, this is the first phone to have the qualcomm 821  uh snapdragon 821 chip  And so I was looking at the specs on that chip to see if there was anything specific to machine learning or kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why we love you stacy. That's why we love you. You look for the specs on the chip

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's that's great. It's I would never think to do that and I wouldn't know what I was looking at  So thank you. So so what'd you find?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I found nothing related to machine learning. That's that's the downside. I mean, it's a 64-bit cpu, but that's not new  It's a little bit faster  Um, it's got a nice graphics core for image processing but nothing that made me go holy cow. This is what it is  So sorry, I failed you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then the other thing from from yesterday when you guys were talking about it as I was watching you  Uh you jason particularly had concern about the verizon as you could you could probably channel me that at verizon. Yeah  But the one I ordered online is as I understand it is just an unlocked phone that also does phi right  So it's not really an issue. It's only going to be sold through verizon, but I can use it on atnt, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's my concern with with verizon  This is definitely something that I want to make sure we talk about because there's a few different levels on this  My main concern is if google's intention if their ambition with this is to come out with this new lineup of phones  That's that you know, uh, hiroshi lockheimer said on twitter alluded to something about this being  At least looked back upon in the future as a historic moment much in the same way that the launch of android was eight years ago  I don't know if I necessarily buy that but I think part of part of his reason for saying that  Is that this is the point in google's history where google takes control over its hardware?  And puts a stamp, you know puts hardware out there that they hope can be seen on the same level as something like apple's iphone or  Samsung's galaxy devices if their goal is to do that if what they want is market penetration  They want people every you know, not just enthusiasts who are fans of google and nexus and all that  They want everybody to suddenly consider this a real player in in the field  then  They need to position their devices in the places that consumers are going and if you've got a verizon exclusive  That's not going to reach everybody that's going that totally limits their reach  Selling it through the store is fine through their online presence is fine selling it through best buy  That's great people can go into best buy  But so many people get these phones through the carriers that if you're only showing it at a verizon  Then I mean you're you're going to lose in your ambitions of making this a fully penetrated, you know device that everybody wants  It's just not going to happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they don't want to do that the first one out the gate maybe that could be the case. Yeah  although I did see so I think the verge was reporting that the  Verizon version of this will not have verizon crop wear on it. Good. So that was  Hopeful although you won't be able to get it until tuesday. I believe when you can order it. Oh, we say yesterday was tuesday  Can you order it on verizon now? I don't know. I don't know  Is it this tuesday or last yesterday tuesday?  When I travel I forget all days

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah understood duncan you and I were talking about this a little bit prior to the show  And you were you were kind of positing that maybe part of the verizon exclusive  Exclusivity, you know  Maybe there's something in that deal that dictated the fact that they that you would be able to get instant updates on these devices  And that maybe there wouldn't be bloatware on there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we we were discussing that with them. It seems to be in all the launch markets  They've partnered with just one carrier and a lot of instances it seems to be in inverted commons the premium carrier  Certainly in australia  They've partnered with telstra which has a love hat relate love hate relationship very similar to verizon with many of their customers  And so I wonder if by making those exclusive deals  You're the only ones to have the best android phone the google phone if they leverage that to say but  You don't touch it you sell it  But there is no carrier branding there is no bloatware there is no contacts apps it is as it comes you let the  Updates go straight through to us to the customers  And just like you know apple does they launched their first phone with a single provider  Maybe it's a similar program. Maybe their hope is to get it right this first time and then say to everyone else right?  If you want this same deal you can have it  Have an exclusive one year and then the following years perhaps everyone else will comply

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's the hope I mean that's certainly been one of the challenges for android in general kind of the deal that made with  the devil years and years ago  Where you get these android devices on all the platforms and you don't get the fast updates, you know, who's at fault there, you know  That can be debated but in this case  It's google behind the scenes and they are touting this from a promotional standpoint as being updates  As fast as they come from google google direct from google  So if they've got it on the verizon platform, I have to imagine if that's their marketing that they're going to put  That's going to ring true for verizon and then the other complaint is of course, you know kind of that bloatware  Also verizon is really good about making sure that their verizon logo is somewhere on the phone  It's usually very very big and kind of an eyesore any images that we've seen here do not show that  So maybe that's part of the deal  Maybe the fact is this time google did what it needed to do to work out those that relationship in the same way that apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was able to do years ago and and with the same announcement of where they'd be retailed where they'd be through carrier stores  They said you will be getting the update straight from us monthly updates. So you can't that is key  You can't say that  And so and then but that's only for these devices if that's the case they needed to make that clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not google branded then you know stacey you can order it on verizon and interestingly jason  The blue is still available there. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did read somewhere that there was some sort of a blue exclusivity through verizon even though I was able to order it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your story yesterday in could you order the bigger one the 128 gigabytes? No, so they know as far as I can tell you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's only 32 in the blue same at verizon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, well I can I can um rush over to verizon store or I could actually sacrifice myself and order it because i'm a verizon customer  but  God, that's so expensive. I'll think about it  I'm like, oh i'm buying it  I'm buying an an or an iphone  um for device testing so i'm like, oh man

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, here you go. So 649 for 32 gig model of the regular pixel 749 for 128 gigs pixel xl costs  769 for 32 gigs  869 for 128 gigs and then you have the three colors quite black  Uh very silver and really blue which is a limited edition  Thankfully, I was able to get the really blue one before it sold out yesterday. I got the I I was nervous about 32

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because my current one has 64  So I went with the 128 and spent another hundred bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, right  but you know they're they're saying there's a little bit of this kind of like next bit theory going on here or  ethos going on here where they're saying if you get these pixel devices  You're not going to run out of space because as soon as you get low  The device has smarts to automatically get rid of your older stuff. That's already backed up to the cloud just photos, right photos

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, photos and videos they said and it'll do it dynamically  So the way they explained it is let's say you've got a photo from eight months ago  You're always going back to the favorite photo of your wife and child for instance  That one will stay because you keep accessing it  But everything around it everything since it will just get siphoned off the phone  And if that's not enough they said in the one-on-one briefings afterwards that  On the pixel device that secret source goes a little bit deeper. They didn't give us a demo  It's not quite to the next bit level where it just automatically handles these things and offloads app and offloads this  Um, and when you wanted it magically appears, but there it's going to have a new wizard that will prompt you and say hey  You're running out of space. There's not enough photos to get rid of  You haven't used this app in some time  They they didn't go into a lot of detail  But they're certainly putting a little bit more intelligent into the smarts around memory management beyond just automatically dynamically  Offloading your photos and videos which when are offloaded will be an original content now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, including the 4k videos. So here's here's guess what i've been complaining about now  What jeff well so  Well, that's exactly the problem so because  I uh the various things came out on regular google accounts before apps accounts. All my photos are under my regular google account  And so I guess I need to move them over to my apps account  But who ordered pardon me now g suite account g suite. Yes  Or pardon me for this, but I can't help thinking it's the g spot account

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's okay because whenever they say youtube red, you know what I think of okay, right exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  so, um  What was it g what were they the ipad came out there was a lot of jean it was talking about that as well that it was an  Odd reference, but anyway, uh enough of that  Uh, so I don't know what's gonna happen with all of the assistant stuff and all that on the account  So i'm having this nervousness that i'm gonna start setting it up and it's gonna get all  McGill again. Yeah  We'll see why need to come  Me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's something to deal with with google home too. So  We can complain again complain and do about which account it's going to learn from that's what you think it won't handle apps accounts  I don't know  I don't know what it's going

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If history has told us anything we probably already know the answer  Uh, let's talk about home next but before we do that  We have to thank the sponsor of today's episode then we'll get into all that of course jeff jarvis  Talking all about yesterday's event stacy higgumbotham and then joined here at the table by duncan jaffrey  Really appreciate you dropping in giving us your insight from the event.

I placed the order yesterday during the live coverage stacy. Did you also order during?  During our coverage

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just ordered one though. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah, I held back. Okay, this restraint. I appreciate that jeff. Did you get one?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never mind. Never mind. Well, i'll ask you in a second. Jeff. What about you duncan? They're not available in australia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Australia that whole thing that whole thing that whole thing of us only probably yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe limited to us and maybe in a few other places. I actually didn't notice who who is getting home initially

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it is just us only I don't think even canada

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Canada did not get it. I had some canucks who were like, ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  however, sorry  unofficially  They did hint several of the google as they hinted that  There will be expansion plans unlike on hub that never really grew or went anywhere  the google home  They have definite expansion plans and they have expansion plans this market cycle  Um even hinted that maybe for people in first tier pixel markets who didn't get it this time around  So if you got a pixel and you didn't get a home  Maybe you should keep watching the news until closer to the end of this year  And start looking for items closer to the beginning of next year  The the hinting they were saying is that perhaps if all goes well and the assistant works and it's all hinging on the assistant  That's the reason they don't want to take it wider if assistant works. Well  Um, they will open up the news later this year that it's going to go wider sales will become available for early  2017 all unofficially

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One whole would would it work or would they would they geofence it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let you know echo is geofenced only some things can work in other countries where it's not supported  I don't know what google will do it could be training around accents or languages with the pixel you think they said that was one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of the issues, um both with training it to hear and training it to speak. Um picking up dialects and co-ocular  Expressions and being able to respond in a conversation conversational way  But if I know my editor in chief daniel tyson he will  Uh, if he can't import one he will get on a plane come over here buy it from best buy get back on the plane  And come back so we should be able to test one in australia relatively soon

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean you could throw it off the path with like a vpn though, right?  With the I mean that that works for the most part with with tech like this. It does um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Coming from the land down under we have a lot of uh,  Vpn requirements depending on what we're doing right? So, yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh jeff did you order a google home when you when you were able to yep, I did I did

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I put myself on the waiting list for um, the the uh, whatever they're calling the goggles and the wi-fi

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know the goggles actually are included come free with the phone if you pre-order the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so I didn't realize that so you get it you get a code like a month before the phone arrives it said

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, is that how it how it worked? I didn't see exactly how it worked. I just knew that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you can't order the goggles yet, right? I don't believe you can't no and so yeah, you'll get it  You'll get a promo code  For a big 79 after we spent 900 bucks. They should throw in the 79 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, let's see here I did yeah, it's a join the wait list for uh daydream view  um  So let's see here  But before we talk about view maybe that made more sense with the phone  But let's talk about home because that's really super exciting  Home voice assistant obvious and I think it's very interesting that it sounds like  What they're doing in in some ways is limiting based on the fact that they want to see how assistant  Does before pushing it out? That's a great way to kind of control your your live beta test  Although they probably don't want to call it a beta test, even though to some degree it kind of sounds like maybe it is  Growing pains, yeah growing pains. It's probably better. Uh  I mean there isn't a whole lot that we didn't already know about home voice assistant a set of microphones  They've done a lot of work on the fear far field voice recognition machine learning that will actively filter background noise  Minimize error rates. They say it's the best in class voice recognition  All sorts of controls obviously you can control all chromecast devices with it nest smart things  Music services like spotify google play music pandora iheart radio youtube if this than that  Netflix, I think by extension through chromecast phillips hue  And I think that's about it. But stacey you are you've got your head  Firmly kind of you're always thinking about the internet of things  Are you happy with what you saw with google home? Are there obvious downsides to what you saw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are so the biggest pro will be  Talking to google as opposed to bing which is what happens when you talk to the echo  There you go, I i'm totally serious, um, yes, I know you are  Multicasting is probably great for a lot of people  and  Because it will talk to chromecast  The if you stick a chromecast audio in the auxiliary port auxiliary port of your sonos speaker  That should also allow you to control it  So in a way, that's like a kind of hacky way to get around to your sonos without having to run a raspberry pi all the time  So that's a pro  Um, the things that I didn't hear that I want to hear  I want to hear how it actually sounds these demos like you brought up yesterday. They all have a different voice. So i'm like  Is this just pre-recorded how how what's the latency like on that? How effective is it when I say the wake words?  How many times will it wake up on its own and be like creeping me out?  So those are some things the others are there's not a lot of partners so far  I think we're going to see a lot more. I hope we're going to see a lot more but  Right now only if this and that smart things philips hue and nest

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is there one more did I miss one? That's pretty much it. I mean outside

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know outside of chromecast and yeah, so I want to see logitech harmony. I really want to see wink. I want to see  a  I want to see ecobee. I mean so many devices I want to see and you could  Sorry, I was gonna say you could do them with if this and that but that's that's got so much latency  I mean, it's just ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so what does that depend upon stacey for the for those brands?  You just mentioned to write to the api or for google to invite them in what's what's the gating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's unclear. Um you to do any of these integrations you have to have both parties decide to work together  So there's going to be an api kind of issue or an sdk issue depending on how they're going to link them  So  That's one but the other thing may be that google's just not ready to bring in all this other stuff  Because they don't know how well home is going to work  Oh in logitech harmony might actually be competitive with chromecast tv  like the chromecast stuff on the television because you could be like  google play stranger things on netflix as the demo they showed and your tv just was like  stranger things  If that happens, then why would they want logitech harmony?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ease of use for consumer but I was going to say except for the consumers, but clearly we don't  Oh them  Oh, those bothersome people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so  You're going to end up with this with this clutter around the house. So one question is  Should google have designed a home that had the wi-fi router in it?  Should that be an option? You know a super duper one they should they should

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Offer in the future. Yeah, I wondered about that too. That costs a lot of money kevin and I talked about that on the show  so  I would have loved it  But a lot of people still stick their routers in like in the mesh networks  You stick your your little access points that are mesh network routers all around the house  But in a traditional setup your router is usually in a closet. So  That's one thing  Two things two things  I don't I don't know what the second thing is. Oh, it would be super expensive because yes, that's true  all the computing power that all these things need although  I think these routers actually have some decent computing power in them. So I did see that the good news is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That the the last google router is compatible with the mesh network

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and I don't know why google didn't talk about that the on hub  You could actually if you have an on hub, you can add a google wi-fi mesh network router to your on hub, right and just  Go to town

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good and good for all those people who bought an on hub and expected some sort of promised software updates including you jeff  So all you need to get is a google wi-fi. They're they're uh, just announced router and  29 mesh that together with uh  With your on hub and you've got solid wi-fi throughout your home if you don't already

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So stacy my other question is I think that I saw yesterday. We talked about this a couple weeks ago  after i.o  google wants  Home to be built into other devices. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That isn't clear  That's well  What this is actually something I was in san francisco last week and I talked about with a lot of the people there but  google's natural language processing  Api or api or yeah api. They don't really make that  Available it's some some companies have access to it  But most companies don't they're not pushing it like amazon is with their elect the she who shall not be named program  they even just launched a two point is it a 2.5 million dollar prize for  Making things more conversational. So  amazon's clearly pushing that  Google so far doesn't have anything but it's it's really early the device isn't even out yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So yeah, and they did they did mention so they talked a little bit about this  Stk towards the end basically the stk where they're saying, you know  You can bring assistant to third-party hardware due next year and leading up to that they had what was it the uh,  Actions on google  Which is direct actions for things like home automation media requests communication  And then conversational actions that people can record it can program in for example  You know the the example I was able to find was I need an uber. Where would you like to go to work?  Would you like an uber x again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that is not to be built into other devices, which is kind of what jeff's talking about  Right. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is just an expansion of it in general assistant on the software side that developers can do and then starting next year  Some sort of stk access for developers to kind of do their third-party hardware thing. So isn't there a war that occurs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  between  among  Google and amazon and I would guess at some point apple is going to have to compete with siri in this world, right?  oops

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  oops

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, what do I say? I don't  I'm trying to figure that out though. You said you said the name he says s i r i

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry the other she who must not be named. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So many things we can't say on this show. Dang it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, oh dang it. That's a that's a that's a yeah, that's a bad word. Um  Uh, so so but but you know google's android strategy was to get android built into everything and of course now they're  Trying a different tack but for home an assistant  I would think that they'd want to build it into everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could just be the strategy that they'd do they did say during the keynote that it would be available on everything from a raspberry  Pi all the way through to third party  um  consumer devices  So, you know if if you want to tinker the sdk will be available and you can build assistant into a raspberry pi  um home sorry into it the raspberry how well that works we'll wait and see but you know  I think they are serious and again, I think it's a walk before they can run the um  They're really wanting to learn rapidly. They want to teach this assistant the ai how things work  Um, I think it is their next ecosystem play. So I you know, I think it will be opened

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it would have to be I mean google's an open company that makes sense that it would be open i've talked to companies like  Smart home companies who are already talking to google about it and have been before the announcement  So I don't think they're going to be shut out  The only company right now that shuts people out is like  Is is apple so like if you have a home kit certified device, you know  It can't run like the thread protocol of radios. Sorry the thread radio  um  And so there's some some rules and stuff associated with apple that closes things out, but both amazon and google  are  Seemingly going open

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's talk business model here for a second  Let's imagine let's imagine just for the sake of it that there's a wonderfully open world and you can buy a generic device  You know like it's also a cable box and a wi-fi router and a garage door opener  And let's say you could get both  um google home assistant and which by the way are really dull names and  Uh amazon's what's her name?  On the same device right and that you can call upon either  Amazon makes money here by delivering you  goods and content google makes money how

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sucking your information on and  Delivering it to  I don't know advertisers or it could be on you buying more services from them right now. They're really I mean think about  YouTube red and they're charging people for the ad free version of that  There's the hardware efforts, I think we're going to see a lot more services from google  and then the other thing is they might be  outsourcing some of this to other companies so like  What we haven't seen yet in the smart home space and i'm not saying google will do this  But it certainly is in the running if it wants to be  we don't have a a model that  Installs and manages and secures everything associated with the smart home for example  And that's a big need if we actually want this to become a viable business right so comcast is like hey, we'll do it all  Um adt is the same way google could actually come in and do that  either itself which is less likely or through  Ways it governs its third party ecosystem players  So if you're imagining that you want to connect something to google assistant or you want to use like weave or brillo  If you have to in order to enable those things on your device if you have to like come in through the google cloud  That's a way for them to guarantee security for example and maybe some basic levels of functionality  That's what apple does with home kit and that's a little far out there, but it's worth thinking about and  There they may make money  Either charging consumers a service fee on top of it or maybe just by shoving people to their cloud

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't take any money when you say to one of these devices get me an uber nobody's taking a cut of that  now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but they do get to train their ai  I mean if they really do think ai is first  um  And the next big thing every single time you do a voice search every single time  You correct a voice search it it learns it gets better  It goes into the data pool every single data point is useless a million data points less  So uh and yet back to what stacey said it'll it'll build a better advertising profile  You're still going to have a screen  You're still going to be accessing the web on whatever screen we have in the future whether it's a glass a phone a hologram your tv  You know as long as this screen model exists and google exists in it the more data they get on you the richer the ads the more  targeted  Content that they can serve on behalf of other people and they sell that service they never sell your details  They sell the ability to access demographics  But the ability to train an ai  with crowd source data  In a real live data and then maybe they can sell ai  As a service to business or to other people because it's okay stay on that. That's that's interesting, right? So so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In my in my business in news  We're not going to know how to be conversational. We're going to do a bad job of that. We're not going to know how to  Uh have user profiles. We're not going to know lots of things  That's so so play with that a little bit more if you were to sell ai as service, which would be ai as

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like one thing that's what i mean ai as

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a ai as i'm right ai as  If you were to sell eyes  What would that look like what would the services be that's really interesting so if we will use your example then so you're a media outlet

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um, you're you're big enough to afford these sorts of things and you're wanting to have  um  Perhaps automatic articles written. We know they're not just doing um speech  They're doing text perhaps it lets that to be auto generated and they can sell you the ability to you know  Spin up a tensorflow and you know have whatever the other plug-in name, whatever it is  Have this massive conversational database be able to pass information then to be able to to bring that out in a different way  Um, you could be in customer service, you know all of these chat bots that we we see in customer service bots  They're horrible. I haven't used any bot that I like  um, and I saw  The glimmer yesterday of being able to I don't need to know about I just say to my phone  I want something so I say I need to talk to atnt with atnt is paid for  The bot the bot I interact there is rich. It talks to me. It's like a real person  I have a conversation now. Hopefully it's a little bit better than I want an uber  Where are you going?  Because I just pull out google maps tap the destination and tap travel by uber and that takes me about 10 seconds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Um, you're right. You're right. But the dread is we're going to be talking to a voice. That's just like  phone mail jail

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think what people in our excitement over voice what we're neglecting is  That voice isn't good for everything and I think a lot of people like developers know that  so  they're like  We talked about this yesterday, but in some of the google home examples, it was like, uh,  Give me directions or where can I buy winter clothing and something about like here are the three stores?  Give me directions to one of those and if google just if the google home just says that to you that sucks  But if it sends that type of information to your phone, that's really interesting  um  So I think we'll see more of that and I I was going to throw out some data because a company called, you know me  That does smart home?  Uh software that brings everything together in your many of your devices together and kind of an intelligent thing  That was a terrible thing for your home  They said that only about 30 percent of their interactions are via voice  and about 50 percent 55 or 60 percent are through traditional automations and then the like 12 are from your  uh  Phone widgets. So I think voice is going to become a greater than that, but it won't ever become everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The same ai should be  I think you're muted suddenly. Oh, there we go. The same ai should be able to power any engine in time  So however you choose to interface  That learning set the more they know the more they see the more they they do just their ability to mimic  conversational human style reactions

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um  I  I just want one  I don't know. I've been following this conversation. I don't have anything to add to it. That's pretty fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I still can't believe you don't have an echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I yeah, well, I mean I I was waiting. I don't have one either. I was waiting  Yeah, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of got to the point where I was like, you know what?  I need to get an echo and then I went to google i.o and they showed up google home and I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, I guess I don't i'm gonna wait. Oh, well google did its job by pre-announcing the home. Good lord. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  true  Mn7 in the chat room gave an interesting example using ai to replace human court reporters or perhaps reporters in  recorders in um  political situations once it gets  Beyond that, you know  our candidates  Spoke about the getting from 87 efficiency to 92 and how difficult it was  But you know when they train it on a hundred thousand a million people saying all of these things every day  Does that data set get them to 96 97 98 99?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the big leap in voice recognition was actually on the computing side in the back end as opposed to training sets  um, but it's possible that  greater  greater  Sources of training data will boost us the rest of the way and although I think it'll be merged. Won't it?  Yes, but there's also like body language  Like I think they say people only under actually understand like 96 92 or 96 percent of the words and the rest we just make  Up with body language  So for what that's worth

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, let's see here. We should probably take a break  We haven't even talked about everything from the event at this point. Uh, we still have vr  I don't know if vr is super exciting to everybody on this panel  I know i'm excited about vr at least I seem to be getting more and more excited as the  Year of vr progresses.

We talked a little bit about the wi-fi the the mesh network  Which i'm definitely excited about we haven't talked at all about  Daydream we wondered if we were going to hear a little bit about vr obviously under the hood on on nougat nouga is  Vr support in the form of something google calls daydream  We got more details on that the version of android that's shipping with these phones is 7.1  And that includes support for daydream officially under the hood  These are the first devices to be to follow the daydream spec and along with that  If you pre-order like we mentioned earlier you get a free daydream view headset, which is essentially google's  Own version of this headset  To get you started and it's very different because it's it's like covered in cloth  Now you were at the event duncan did they have these for hands-ons? And if so, what did you think they did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I booked in for a demo and I got to spend something about 10 minutes  Inside daydream  And it's the best mobile vr experience i've had so far i've got cardboard i've got  I've i've played with the gear vr  I've even tried oculus  It's not quite on that level but nor would you expect it to be  But one thing that it does that none of the others do is fit over these glasses

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, yes, that's okay. That's that was my main question duck and that sounded like like heaven to us for now these bits here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You put them on and they get jigged

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, no more bent in or they press against your temple or whatever the case

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was no they just went straight in I didn't even have to force the headset on. Um, the material is soft  It did breathe. I quite often  Sort of sweat up or fog up the screen when i'm using vr, especially in the muggy queensland weather

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mentioned this yesterday morning on the live coverage and it kind of freaks stacey out a little bit  It looks like it's freaking her out again  The harsh reality of vr stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not so with the um the time I spent now  They they did have several very very large air conditioning trucks. So perhaps the temperature was well controlled, right?  But I I didn't fog up in the 10 minutes in there using their new daydream controller  Which is a pivotal part of the standard and something that must be approved by google before any third-party hardware can be daydream certified  It really made a big difference. Um  I've you know using all the other controllers interacting with your face like this isn't good using a  A d-pad that doesn't allow you to point isn't good using a game pad is all right. This thing was just intuitive  I mean you just move your hand around and it shoots a beam out  Um, you know a very simple button layout it they certainly got the control interface, right?  Or now the latency was great. I do get a bit of motion sickness with some vr games  Um, I didn't with any of these now  They weren't the type that twist and turn and throw you around with a multi-axis spin  So that could very well be why but it was really comfortable. It was really great. I got to try a tiltable game  you know where you're racing against the computer and  Um a 3d dinosaur experience. I tried to boot up the harry potter one and he took the control off me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was gonna ask you about that  That was the that was kind of the marquee one that they really showed off

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To get everybody excited. Um, it was there it was installed  They would let you play with it. They had a lot of people and small timelines. Um, I see  it's  It's second gen as hell. I would put it having played with the first gen. It's definitely second gen mobile vr

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, okay. I see what you mean not second gen as in cardboard was first gen. Is that is that what you mean?  Okay, well that's a big step up although it wouldn't take a whole lot to best it would board

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When we spoke to the vr team though, they said, you know the subtle hints the fact it's got a head strap  That means that they're confident you can wear it without getting sick. You don't have to hold it up. You're not limited  Um, I think it was 25 milliseconds now the card the previous  Was 110 milliseconds and they've got the frequency response down to 25 and it really shows it was it was really good  I've always been interested slash excited about vr. Although i've never found a great use for it apart from fun, right but  you know  How heavy is it?  It was like it was it was like it wasn't there because it's it really is a small amount of plastic obviously for the molding  Um, one thing for you stacey is the bit that does touch your face is replaceable washable so you can have your own  Um, it just pulls pulls out and another one drops in so you don't need to worry  You can share one device and not have to worry too much about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I love it. Okay, because yeah, like how gross would it be to like see it like, you know, the brims of your hats, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, here try my vr viewer, this is a really cool game. No, don't do it. Don't do it  Yeah, um  I really like that the controller docks inside the visor. I think that was a super like  Yep, uh  Touch  You know, I mean it seems like a small thing  But I think it's it's actually a really really big thing and other small things like having nfc

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Inside the visor so when the phone goes in it automatically pairs with cardboard you have to get it exactly lined up  This has two um little touchpads that basically tell the phone within a reasonable  Um error that okay here and then it it zeros the screen  So where you're looking is perfectly centered you don't have to get that lined up just perfectly  Yeah, so they've done the little things if they really want, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If the goal is to kind of take vr to the next level  You got to make it easy for the general consumer and having to like reposition it and slide it all around once you get it in  the visor  Uh, no one enjoys that and that just kind of being able to drop it in the way  They showed it off and i'm happy that it does that kind of smart  Alignment, uh, so you can bring question time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my specialty  um  uh  Will it work with all the other vr stuff I have?  In what respect jeff?  Uh, I mean any other stuff that i've downloaded onto my nexus phone that has worked  in um  Cardboard or whatever  There's no compatibility issue with with earlier vr stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't imagine so because they spoke about the catalog  But you know, they never mentioned that and I never thought to ask

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I never I didn't think about that aspect either the fact that we have almost two years now of a cardboard ecosystem  I have to imagine because I mean, I feel like cardboard vr is is  Like like you said, it's a step down  Yeah in dimension versus what you get here which adds a whole layer of extra dimension with the control aspect

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is it would actually be simpler than that. Yeah, actually thinking about what i have to imagine  So thinking about what the head of vr said is I don't think they will be compatible. There is a very rigorous  Compatibility process if you submit an app for daydream certification it is more than the standard google play store  Approval process it is actually tested for latency because their hardware is working  They've got the integrations there the platform works fine  They don't want someone to code an experience for vr that just breaks all that  I mean if I went home tonight figured out a code put something together and checked it on the play store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would be terrible. So this could be an issue. I mean, we don't know yet. We don't know this backward compatible  It's with if it downward compatible with other things  But that'd be an issue if you're if you're a vr maker and you've made stuff  There's people in my business that have made a lot of vr news stuff  I hope for their sake that that it's usable. I just don't know yet. They will have to resubmit it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They will wow or it's automatic. But yeah, it'll have to be it will have to be compatibility tested

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They might I saw like the new york times they were a partner in the vr stuff, right?  I saw their list or their name up on the list. I swear  um of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vr daydream partner people they definitely are I just I wonder if that's because  I mean if what you're saying here  You know, yes, they had a cardboard app, but they are also a partner on daydream  So maybe they've done the work to make that happen. I would find it really strange if google just said all right  Two years of cardboard stuff. Sorry, you're gonna have to start from scratch, but I understand  They really do want daydream to be a very tightly

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh kind of honed in experience. It's very aptly about controlling that experience  You know not everything's going to get through only things that are good now  Perhaps the new york times had to do no work. Perhaps their app worked and was acceptable for daydream. So it may be k no difference  There's you know, the things that will come out in the coming days weeks months  But yeah, the it's not an instant that free dinosaur app that you downloaded that already made you sick  On cardboard I can almost guarantee that one won't be in daydream unless the developer really does something to it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting or unless there's some sort of like cardboard wrapper app that allows you to run cardboard  I mean, I don't know hardboard compiler. Yeah car. Yes, exactly. Exactly. That'd be a  Roundabout way to do it. I don't think google would have I would be too thrilled about that. But um, I saw my side load  Did we miss anything from the event yesterday anything? Oh, well, actually we didn't we didn't talk about the chromecast ultra  Does anyone have a 4k television set at home? No, no, no, I can't afford it after buying the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do new do do do young people buy? I mean like  I I visited people who are like 22. They don't even have tvs in their apartments  They just watch everything on their laptops or their tablet. Yeah, so i'm like, oh  Yeah, I think at some point in time you age up into a television, but I could be wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what they always said about newspapers is when you get older, you'll buy newspapers wrong  My father always said when you get older, you'll vote republican  wrong  So, no, i'm not sure that that you will age up into a tv  um  But I don't know. I mean my my my son does like having a big tv  And he casts up to it, but he also watches a heck of a lot of stuff on his laptop

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yeah, my daughter actually prefers her tablet versus like an ipad as opposed to it's a personal space  I think it's that and it's a lot faster and easier because like you've got to go  Maybe the set top box rules will change all this but for now it's kind of like  Open the television it checks for the internet access load the app the app loads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then also presume stacy you're actually going to watch a whole thing where a whole thing might just be you know  Two minutes 30 now on youtube  And the pain of going into other stuff is just not worth it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, is this the pc all over again? PCs aren't dead, but they've diminished tvs aren't dead. Are they diminishing?  You know, I don't think they're getting bigger  Indeed  um, I mean  As ownership numbers drop, I don't think they'll go away  There's there's all you know, there are more options in the market than there were five ten years ago  And so some people have replaced  Uh some people have got both and so I just think it's a rebalancing and will that continue to shift? Yes  Will will vr replace someone's tv you can sit there and get a full movie experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right that is like the loneliest thing I can imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not if not if it's a room full of people with vr on in the same movie theater virtually

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but stacy with daydream you can lay in bed and use the controller to move  The screen wherever you want it to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is not a selling point for me place it on the ceiling no big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, it seemed like I mean obviously with the with the chromecast  I think that was kind of the lightest of the announcements obviously and that's just really if chromecast is a is a  product  For the living room space we have to have one that supports the latest, you know biggest technology  So we'll double the price throw an ethernet port on it. And there you go  That was a good reach out  Yeah, for sure having the ethernet port on there  I always kind of wanted to do that with my chromecast and apparently they they have a way that you can do that with  Uh normal chromecast too. So if that's the part of it that you liked you can do that. There's an adapter for that  I suppose  um, so that is that in in uh  Kind of as as part of this google has removed the 5x and the 6p from the play store  As well as some other hardware  basically  And uh, you know, hiroshi lockheimer and others have confirmed this the nexus  brand as it were is uh now you know, you can  We can pour pour one out for nexus because apparently they have no more plans for any nexus devices going forward  That's it. You can't even find them in the play store anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could create my own hardware product and call it nexus and use the domain name. Oh, yeah, no problem whatsoever

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd have no problem the lawyers will give you no problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know any uh, any anyone super bummed about that that kind of fact  Especially because we've I mean at least some of us have obsessed over the nexus brand for years

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the fanboy in me is sad to see an end of an era  Yeah, I think the equal opportunist in me was hoping that maybe the nexus brand would continue  We've got android one. We've got pixel and there's this big gap in between  We haven't really discussed the elephant in the room at the price of the phone. But you know deep down in my semi-socialist heart  uh, I was  Hoping that there would be a more accessible device that would come with guaranteed security updates  So that everyone on android from android one to this mid class to the top tier would have equal access  To a safe and secure and updated operating system  But I knew that was a dream at the time because that's confusing branding. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but duck and talk about that for a second  So if if you're right if you're apple you have basically two phones, you know, you have one phone in different sizes. That's it  Is that what google's going to do or does google with android one and other things need to have a range of phones?  If you you know, motorola was a range of different phones with different features  Uh with neat stuff like things that you know click on and all kinds of other things is in the long run  Do we think that google's going to need to have?  A range or is it apple like going to have one official phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so I  Pose that exact question to one of the vps at the one-on-one session yesterday  Um, I don't want to attribute to anyone in particular  But basically when I asked the question they said, um, there's already great hardware on the market. For example the one plus three  Uh, we do monthly security updates and make that available at the first of every month and you know, we work with our partners  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't want to compete too much they want to have a model and be google  But they don't want to compete with samsung and company too much

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't see it as competition my question to them was actually do you feel you have a moral imperative to ensure there is at least  one safe and secure  Version of the phone for everyone at every price point. I even use the be together not the same  Um pixel has become an exclusive device an inclusive operating system, which is a bit of an oxymoron  um  I could choose to afford a pixel  I don't know if I will but many people can't and there's many people with phones that are stranded on  I don't care about the desert version as they called it. I care about the security updates, you know  If you're on 4.4. So what as long as the phone is safe, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good good point. Um, that's an awesome point. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean that's and now i'm angry now i'm angry that there's not a cheap budget  I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so I mean I mean you mentioned elephant in the room with the price I will say that  You know shortly  After the event concluded yesterday  Filtering through comments of the many articles that were written about it  I you know  I posed a question on twitter in ahead of last night's all about android to have people tell me what they thought of the announcement  And I mean, I don't know exactly how many but i'd say  the  Exhilaratingly majority opinion is that these phones are overpriced for what you get  um  so when you're talking about google's kind of ambitions of you know  Entering this with this world where their devices can stand toe-to-toe with some of the most premium devices out there  Um when there's this sensitivity to price point  I mean did google kind of do this to themselves based on its own history or did it under deliver on features?  Did it misread how important the consumer would?  Um would consider things like the assistant ai and build quality and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The time will tell is that the vocal minority or it and will this phone sell just fine?  Um, you know, there's two there's two ways to make money  You make a little bit of money a lot of time or you make a lot of money a little bit of time  Um, you know this just in 50.38 percent of osdroid readers will not be getting a pixel in any way shape or form

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, I mean that I would imagine that number would be far  Like far less if it were a lower price if it were a nexus device the way it has been for years

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All the comments are basically pricing and last year it was something like 80 saying they want one or would get one  But this is people just categorically saying no, we've never seen that kind of result. Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason if you weren't the god of android  Please don't call me that he's not  no, um  Would you would king android then?  uh would you uh  Feel compelled to buy the pixel. It's a really great question

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  um, I mean obviously I I get it because  We do what we do and we play with all these devices and and it's you know, it's it's part of what I do  Would I be compelled if I had the 6p?  Going into this announcement would I be compelled to to pony up for that device? I don't think that I would

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I might I might cancel I might cancel  I mean, I I know I go through this neurosis every single time with every single device. Sorry folks. It's what I do  Um, I so I ordered right away so I can make sure I had it in  But yeah, you know, so if I don't have it how how much am I going to grip my teeth?  There'll be ai things I can't play with which which will bug me a lot. That's that's an issue  But but again, I just sense that's not hardware dependent in any way. So i'm getting we're getting gamed on that  Uh the camera yeah, it'd be nice to have a much better camera  But you know the the 6p camera is a miracle itself. All of them are miracles are amazing. Yeah  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm. I mean I feel like the the real big challenge that google has to kind of overdo right now is  The past and his history and not to mention is the fact that right now  We are in the middle of kind of like a new era of mid-tier devices  This is the huawei honor 8 made entirely of glass front and back, of course because of that  I dropped it and it's cracked but they have a great replacement policy  I'm so bad with this stuff. Don't you drop phones, dude?  It never used to be a thing and now totally it is I have the note 7 here and i'm  Definitely afraid that i'm going to drop this thing and crack it  Anyways, my point being for 400 dollars  You can get a lot of phone nowadays and you're not you're not making the same sacrifices you used to make  You know the one plus three has a snapdragon 820 processor which up until a month ago was cutting edge processor  So it's still great, you know, six gigs of ram, I believe on the one plus three  That's a 400 dollar phone designed well like fit finished all that kind of stuff  Really great phone for half the price of what you're getting here  So the challenge that google has is kind of erasing or at least convincing people that it's okay to spend double what they would spend  On this newly emerged mid-tier device. That's super strong

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're really right in the other issue. The other issue is that is that nougat is nice  But am I dying to have it versus marshmallow if I if I got a 400 phone that still have marshmallow  That's not so bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I and I think most of the 400 dollar phones if they are on marshmallow are going to have nougat very soon  You know what? I mean, they're all very current modern. There's there's  At least you know with huawei and with one plus like they they still have an emphasis on making sure that  They don't just release a device and then run away in the other direction, you know and never updated whatsoever  It might not be as fast as google, but their plan is to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  400 maybe that's good enough. Maybe what google's done is actually create a vacuum the problem with samsung who make  Fantastic devices is they strand so many of their devices on older versions while they focus on their top tier ones  Which means if you do get a mid-tier device  It might probably won't get security updates and they're not quite as good  Enter the one plus one enter things like the axon seven if they can deliver  Constant security updates even if it's not monthly even if it's three monthly  I mean and they keep that raise of focus on just the one or two phones. They're putting into market  That is an opportunity for someone to step up and go. Hey, we're not google, but this hardware is top tier  It's well priced and we're going to keep it safe

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um the you can fund me on nexus at kickstarter

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no denying it that that if I had the 6p it would be hard for me to um  Convince myself that I had to have this phone that there was like a no-brainer. Oh now you're making me so so you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you wouldn't order it stacy. You're not ordering it duncan  Are you kind of in the twit problem that you have to have it? Uh  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm still waiting in australia. The phone I want would be  1,470 that is a lot of money even even in our australian money  Which by the way makes more sense because it's different size and different colors just saying  The  It's a you know, how do I justify that?  How do I justify that purchase?  um, you know, do I justify it with a pixel launcher that lets me do a couple of unique things with  Google photo storage of a resolution and quality i'll probably never access the support is cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, hey 24 7 support. We didn't mention that gesture  Controls on the fingerprint sensor like there's little things. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean there are there now there is one thing that the google hardware team said yesterday in the one-on-ones and that's that  This 24 7 support goes beyond just that  Screen in the settings app that they are building in every launch market at least the original launch markets a logistics  Replacement network. So at the moment in australia  If you break a google phone you get on the phone to google and you put it in a box or do whatever  They're talking about walk-in  opportunities  so they didn't say where those partners were but  Think samsung store more than a google store, but the ability to actually get  They're getting logistic networks of all the spare parts into those countries partners to actually do warranty repairs locally in that country  Um, you know that that is a big deal. That is another thing that they're bringing to these markets  Um, I questioned them on the financing deals and 100% it's coming to other markets just not anytime soon  um  But maybe next year maybe the year after that so this is a this isn't just a phone for google. This is a massive  Ecosystem play and I think maybe those buying a pixel this year are funding it  Like a kickstarter sure feels like it. Yeah, kickstarting google because they're broke

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, google is hurting right now needs your money and it's all in it's all in ireland  But possibly true at least to a certain degree  um any final thoughts on this before we  Thank the final sponsor and get into our picks and stuff because apparently this episode is nothing but yesterday's event  But I think i'm okay with that  If you guys yeah, I think so, too  Uh lots of fun though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. So I I I have to struggle for this one  I admit but I let me try to be counterintuitive  Not for the first time. Okay  so pew survey says that 61 percent of millennials get their political news on facebook and and trigger the  Oh my god, they're all ignorant. This is horrible in the echo chamber  but you know  Comparative some percentage percentage getting their political news on tv. I'm not so sure this is so bad  Uh, I you know, I get it on facebook  No two people in the world see facebook  It depends on how smart or stupid your friends are as to what you see, but I think that that is not necessarily  A bad sign for the democracy now  They also said that four in ten  Quote consistent liberals say they have blocked or unfriended someone over political disagreements. Well in this current  uh race  Um, I wouldn't say that's probably surprising either  So I constantly hear this argument about how the internet is is an echo chamber and all you over here is what is what?  satisfies your  informational cravings  Well, yeah, okay, but the fact that you see arguments all over means that you know, there is another side  If you have stupid friends, you probably see stupid stuff  If you have smart friends, you probably see smart stuff and if you have stupid friends, you probably weren't going to be interested anyway  So I just wanted to put in a word for saying that I think what we have to do in my world in media  Is make more things that are compatible with conversations so that people will pass it around and that has facts and has  Actual smart arguments inside those memes and that is possible  So here here I was I was at an event last night nick denton founder of gawker  Of course was interviewed by kevin delaney the editor in chief of courts  nick is a long long old friend from ages back and  uh  Delaney said to denton something about how well you still believe even after all this you still believe the internet is going to improve  Things and nick said yeah, and kevin turned to the room and said well who else believes the internet is still going to improve things  Only jay rosen of nyu and I raised our hands  Um, so I think there's a lot of pessimism going around especially given the current climate current political view  Uh, and and I think we in media have messed things up and we haven't shown enough empathy to people and we're not  uh  understanding different communities needs  Uh, but nonetheless nonetheless i'm still an optimist

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Excellent I like to think i'm an optimist too. I mean six out of ten millennials getting their political news on facebook  At least I don't know. Maybe it's irresponsible to say but at least they're getting it from somewhere somewhere or at least they're  Trying to you know, at least there's intention and there's there's a there are worse sources lord knows for sure there are  At least there's intention and this is this is one of those uh, well any political season. It's important for there to be  Intention and for people to feel like they have somewhat of an educated voice. That's a little bit more than  Than just I don't know that guy or that girl or whatever the case may be  Um, so if that helps them get more educated and have a firm understanding of their belief, then i'm all for it  Sure, why not?  Uh, let's see here stacey. What about you? You got a recipe today or anything like that?  Uh-oh can't hear you. Oh  Uh-oh, there we go. There we go. Oh i'm back. Yep. Okay, I have

Transcript:  Thank you stacy so duncan  Uh, I realized we pulled the end of the show last minute. Um, thank you for doing this. Thank you by the way  Uh fantastic support material for sure for sure. Um, you got a thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do so I had a quick look through my phone for my most used most useful tools  and  I ship devices all around the country have packages coming and going personal and both for os droid  And i've always had troubles keeping track of them, you know, i'll  Have an app here, but then I won't have that device and so I went searching and what I found was  deliveries  Which is a multi device android only for now  um package tracking app

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That done where the camera's set up its might be  Um, I don't know if we're in  Oh, we have oh, okay now and down and yes and almost there we go  This is like a hydrostopic surgery. I know it's a little weird. It's like backwards. It's been a while since i've held a camera

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um  So what it allows you to do is just to add in  Um a delivery from most shippers. It's got most shippers around the world  So when i'm bringing things in from the states from china from england from anywhere in australia  Um, it just lets you add them but then this syncs up to the cloud so you can get it  Just on a web interface or you can get it across all your devices  Um, and one of the things that I really love is you can actually just go in touch  And it'll take you to a map and so you can see exactly where it is where it's gone  um  And so you can you know, a lot of apps have this but oh  writer's chat  And I just find that's one of my most useful tools  So it's deliveries on the google play store to get all of the features and customizations. It was a couple of dollars, but  Um, you know save yourself from drinking one of your horrible american coffees and  Give the money to an app developer. In fact save yourself from drinking any coffee  I don't know if I can do that  I found a couple of good ones big shout out to blue bottle in san francisco. That was pretty good  Uh, and the turnaround I think it was which was just near there. It's just near where the uh trolley

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay turns around this this from this from a man from a country where they eat  Basically petroleum jelly that's like from the oil well black goo on things

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was this close to bringing jason some vegemite, but uh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Daniel has brought me vegemite in the past. He's also brought me  Cadbury chocolates filled with vegemite. Oh, they were horrible. They were even australians didn't like they were not good  No, I I think when I saw it I was like, okay, maybe I guess but then when I tried it it was like no  I think that's a that's just a trolling tourist. I'm pretty sure yeah, that was my indication that he doesn't like me very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could give them out at halloween to small children and they would hate me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what you do that's that's what you do stacey you have a devil streak in you I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a terrible person. That's a great idea last year at halloween when we were done trick-or-treating  And we well when we wanted to go out trick-or-treating  We left the rest of our candy out on the front doorstep and then later actually, you know  One of our sponsors is ring full disclosure  but I and  Later realized that some kids had come along and dumped the whole thing of candy  Uh in their bag and ran off and of course I had video of it  So maybe next time what i'll do is i'll put those cadberries in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They'll steal it and I will have the last laugh. The bad news is it was a chocolate so horrible. It's no longer available. Oh  So I should have kept it it would be  Collectors autumn

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My tip is really quick. I it could have been done on this show already before but it's something that i've been using a lot  Lately just because it's so darn handy and it's in google drive  It's in the drive app  If you didn't know already you can scan documents with google drive for android  And I know, you know  Sometimes when I see that when I first saw this I was like what's the difference between scanning a document and taking a picture?  Of something they're kind of the same but a little bit different. So i'll go ahead and tap the plus  Tap scan it'll give me uh, once I give it permission, it'll give me my camera overlay  So let's say this is a business card. It's actually a uh, frequent zazzler's reward card for a restaurant  But see how it's all angled and everything. I'll go ahead and take a picture of that and boom it automatically crops it  It scans it to a pdf. You've got different color options if you want it to just be black and white you can do that  Uh, you could do color drawing which is going to make it look a little bit more realistic if I can get that to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, but anyways scan it into a google sheets because that would be amazing for business cards. Let's see here. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, oh, I don't know if it goes scan it into contacts either one or yeah, so i'll go ahead and save it  There it is. Basically it scans into a pdf and is stored on your drive account

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which yeah, those other features would be nice too, but there you go. I would pay for those other features. All right, come on google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do something useful. We've given them some some ideas. Yeah, make something useful. Why don't you google? Yeah, she's for a chain  And over the pdf world's knowledge thing. Use ocr  Ah, no, that's nerdy bring that pdf into keep use ocr and there you go. I wonder how well that would work  That's it for this week in google.
