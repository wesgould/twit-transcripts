Yes, it's once again that time of year where we give everybody the week off  and we let you watch reruns.  But these are special reruns, the best moments of 2014 from this Week in Google.  I love doing this Week in Google.  Jeff Jarvis, he's such a brainiac, an expert on media, a deep thinker on Google,  a deep thinker on issues like privacy and the right to be forgotten and all of that.  And Leichsung Zuchrecht and all that stuff.  Of course, Gina Trapani, who doesn't love Gina.  We're all in love with Gina.  A developer, a brilliant mind, a Google expert.  You couldn't find two better people to anchor this Week in Google.  And we have some great clips from this week's, sorry, this year's shows.  Let's start off with a little rant.  Jeff Jarvis, apparently he doesn't like local TV news.  In particular, one thing that local TV news does, let's watch.  All journalism is telling a story about something that happens  so that people understand it better, right?  Well, that's one form of it.  I think the other forms include data.  I shouldn't say that to the professors here.  They probably will spank me for saying that.  But it strikes me that that's what we need is we need the story.  We need, we understand things in terms of story, humans do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Many of my professors would say the same thing.  I argue that stories are only one tool we have and we're not primarily storytellers.  What's the other story? What's the other way to do it?  Data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Raw data is not as valuable as, in fact, that's what we're looking for.  If you give me the raw data, that's one thing.  If you explain the raw data, i.e. tell a story about it.  I'll give you an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  After Hurricane Sandy or tomorrow, after whatever weather channel  is calling the next storm to hit Gina, we'll get stories.  You know what the stories will say?  I could write them right now.  Gosh, a lot of snow fell, city digging out.  On TV, they're going to put rulers in the snow and say, guess what?  It adds up over time.  They're going to tell us all this crap that we know.  So what would you like?  I want a tool that says what streets are open, what streets are closed,  and I want that data to come from.  Is that journalism?  Yes, you bet it is.  It enables a community to share what it knows.  That's journalism.  Would you agree, boss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's sort of some of the thinking that we're doing right now is,  should we be teaching our students how to be community organizers?  Basically, to engage individual communities and help provide information  that helps them organize themselves.  That's very interesting.  That's sort of a new…

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's a broader definition than the tradition.  It is.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With nothing wrong with that.  Nothing wrong with that.  No, no, no, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I mean, I've been writing this…  That's a librarian.  No, it's a platform maker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That stopped us in our tracks.  Who are you calling librarians?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Librarians, miss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Meanwhile, we want to destroy some things.  Part of the reason that I wanted to bring, especially Sarah here,  was to look at the wonders that are twit and reinventing TV news.  Which I think is vital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I'm never doing another stand-up.  I can tell you that after reading your blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's a very funny Fox 5 video on there of a guy who…  I think it's the top one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because you got interviewed by Fox…

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Fox 5 New York about the stupid things they do and whether…  Stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm surprised that they wanted to do that story, to be honest with you.  But that seems self-defeating.  Chad will have to play it.  I don't have the capability of playing videos back in.  What happened to your laptop?  My daughter has it.  She's using it for work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  This is an ad, unfortunately.  Oh, sorry about that.  I should have warned you, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's all right.  I like Dwight David Eisenhower.  I particularly liked Robin Williams' rendition of Dwight David Eisenhower in The Butler.  Did you see that?  No.  Very weird.  That's not the first person I'd have Robin Williams play.  No.  …get sick of hearing their own voices sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Local news really can be a bit much.  We know that.  What?  This is a local news guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what we are talking about, obviously.  There are silly stories, pointless live shots, endless clichés, and then there's Joel Waldman.  Joining us from outside our building.  Perfect.  I couldn't resist.  You're perfect for the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Putting the hand to the earpiece so we can hear the anger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I like the lower third.  Joel, can you hear us?  That's all right.  I didn't see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In case you weren't there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love putting my hand up to my earpiece here, otherwise known as an IFP for all of you at home who didn't know this.  Look behind me over here at Fox 5 News.  There's absolutely nothing going on right now.  So we decided to turn it all around.  Forgo Snowmageddon and tell all you concerned citizens at home exactly what annoys you and us most about this job.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We never have enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A shocking revelation.  Thanks, local news.  If you think it isn't, think again.  Time is valuable.  Honestly, who has time to waste?  Maybe you do if you're watching this right now.  For the first time ever in this exclusive local news story, we ask the tough questions.  Does news ever annoy you?  We put CUNY professor Jeff Jarvis on the hot seat to give this story at least an ounce of legitimacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Doing a story about local TV news is a bit navel-gazing, but it's a good start because it shows me that you're willing to ask the tough questions about what's annoying about TV news.  Like sticking rulers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Almost an inch and a half.  Not an inch and a half.  And please, no more.  Wicked winter weather gimmicks.  Thanks for that cliche, reporter man.  And please stop, reporter woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I've got this wind meter right here.  The winds are literally ripping across.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you think this station had enough reporters covering its city's severe weather its first night, this was the second.  At Times and News, we come across another chilling reality.  Reporters stretching the truth.  Are these holy men walking on top of water?  Holy smokes, a canoe, and just a few inches of water.  I've never wanted to knee anchors as badly as during these recent blasts of cold arctic air.  Alright, we get the idea. We don't have to keep going.  Give me a little feral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's good. I like that. Yeah, that's funny.  I don't think they're going to stop doing stand-ups.  I would defend the stand-up.  Oh, well, okay. I try. I try.  Well, again, this comes back.  See, I understand now why you guys don't want to accept the fact that really what we are are storytellers.  Because that allows some subjectivity to creep into it.  No! Subjectivity is great.  You want facts.  But the fact is the human brain wants people.  They want faces. They want pictures.  This is one of the reasons why I was reluctant to do video.  Video is, it's very clear to me.  The audio is intellectual. It's abstract. It's ideas.  Video is all about emotions.  Video wants pictures.  So for television news to abandon the stand-up would be, what do you get?  You get the McNeil-Larrer news report, news hour.  You get the PBS news hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But you also get more information. You get more value.  Well, but people don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I hate to have bad news for you. People don't want that.  The example...  What is the job of the journalist? Are we the Brussels sprouts of media?  Or are we here to help people understand stuff in a way that is palatable?  I would rather be an egg McMuffin with some broccoli in there  than to be just the broccoli on the plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't think of any food analogy here.  But, I mean, it's not...  Again, it's sort of not one thing or the other.  You know, I mean...  No, I have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You go right ahead and be deep data. I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I mean, it's a mix of things.  There's sometimes when I want to analyze data.  There's sometimes when I want to have a story that moves me.  There's sometimes when I want some deep complex analysis.  There's sometimes when I want breaking news.  I mean, those are all forms of journalism. They're all critical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm just saying you understand why local news has a ruler in the snow.  That's real.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It tells people what's going on.  Here's the wind meeting.  Here's the example.  Here's the example.  They shouldn't lie about a rowboat in three inches of water.  That's stupid.  That is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But there's also stupid...  I have pictures on the blog of people standing up in front of the George Washington Bridge  and the Christie scandal we have in New Jersey.  There's no journalism to be had there.  There's no officials there.  There's no mixed images.  There's no sources there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If you do TV, I'm sorry.  You have to have pretty pictures.  You don't think Chris Christie is pretty?  Yeah, he's pretty.  I would have a picture of Chris Christie.  In fact, I'd have him on there.  Of course you want TV.  Do another example.  As soon as you go to video, you have a responsible to fill the screen with something  and you might as well make it pretty.  So there's a jury out in the trial.  Doesn't mean you can't have solid information.  So what I think is very important, and I know you guys teach this,  is that there'll be this very solid foundation of journalistic ethics  where you don't make up stories, you don't fudge things,  you don't attempt to prove a point by editing.  You care most and most deeply about communicating to your audience  the truth about a story to give them the information they need to make the judgment  that they need to make as good citizens.  All of that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You do the things that are in the service of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes.  All of that we agree and that is the foundation of what you teach.  So all we're disagreeing about is how you present it.  And I would say that sometimes you want to present it with a little bit of...  But here's another example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So the jury's out in a trial.  I use this example in the blog.  And what do they do?  The anchor says the trial's going on.  This is what happened in the trial.  Now we're going to go to Gina Tripani in the paneled courtroom.  Gina Tripani is going to say in that closed door behind me,  there's a jury.  We don't know what the F they're doing.  I actually have nothing to say to you.  You have the trial's going on.  It's about this and that and that.  Now back to you.  The anchor comes back and says,  we'll tell you as soon as we hear anything.  All of which can be summarized in,  jury's still out.  For more go to the web.  And then they could get another story in to get more value in.  It's a waste of precious journalistic resource.  The reporters don't report.  They are cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I would question whether how precious that resource is.  There's a lot of people that you could put out there with a camera operator.  That stuff's not precious.  That's what TV news does.  I would just say that if you did this imaginary TV news station that you would like to do,  no one would freaking watch it.  And part of your mandate is not merely to tell the truth and get the story out,  but to get somebody to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody's watching it now.  The numbers...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, that's only because there's other places you can have people standing in front of a door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  You have kids.  I have kids.  They don't watch.  They watch YouTube.  They watch any news that they're getting, they're getting on the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's stuff on YouTube that is any less...  YouTube's full of stuff as stupid as the guy's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's not trying to be news.  It's not trying to inform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If you look at the presentation on YouTube,  there's a lot of attention to presentation.  Otherwise, nobody watches it.  Watch Epic Meal Time, which has no content.  My son loves it because of what they're seeing and doing.  He loves.  They're mushing the hamburgers into a giant lasagna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think the conflation of informing and entertaining is the issue.  That's usually said in terms of, oh, it's crappy TV.  What I'm trying to say is something different.  If I want to read a long novel, that's entertainment.  If I want to read a long New Yorker story, that's often entertainment.  Snowfall, the Times did, that everybody loved, was really, to me, entertainment.  That was a waste of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  As much as everybody loved it, that was a waste of time.  And money.  And a lot of money.  And this is very not politically correct.  I would complain far more about that than some idiot anchor with nice hair standing out in the rain.  To me, that is a bigger waste of money and resources that added nothing to the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And I think there's ways that we could probably inform you.  When I had my coffee with Katie Couric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Did you mention this to Katie?  I'm curious what she thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wanted to know how long it was going to take you to get that in.  I know.  It's been a while.  It was a little bit longer than I thought.  Here we are.  The show's almost over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's been too long this week.  And so one thing I said was the one difference I see in going to Yahoo is you don't have to  fill a clock anymore.  Right?  We overfill the clock here at Twit.  But you don't have to...  Never had any problem filling a clock.  No.  You don't have to fill the clock anymore.  And if you want to say what's new in a story, you can do that in a minute 30 and then not  have to say anything more until something actually happens.  So part of what TV does is think we have to have video, video, video, video because we  have to fill an hour.  Well, if instead your job is to inform people, maybe you can do that in a minute 30 and you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  My experience of television is very different from that.  In fact, my experience of television was that we never had enough time, that there was always  the urgency to get stuff done in less time and that hurt TV more than anything else.  That's where you edit out the pieces of him downloading the malware.  Not because you don't want that information because it takes too much time.  There is never enough time in mainstream media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Why do they waste so much of it on idiots standing up where nothing happened in the last few hours?  I don't think they consider that wasted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think they consider that the way that they make a palatable product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's my problem is that's the orthodoxy of old TV.  This is the way we make TV.  It's got to be the only way because it's the way we've always done it.  I'm saying, you know what you're going to do?  What?  I'm bringing you to New York.  We're having an event at CUNY in reinventing TV news.  We should have a debate.  Then I'm going to have you in a hacking TV event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I feel like I want to argue the case for the average Joe who sits down in front of the TV.  I understand what you need to do on television, which we don't do here, but you need to make  pretty pictures.  I think you're the proof that you don't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You physically are the proof that you don't need pretty pictures.  That's why we have Gina, ladies and gentlemen.  Gina Trippini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, I really liked that.  I thought that you were bringing up Circa was really at Circa is that news app.  I love it.  I love it.  I barely look at it, but it notifies me when I need like so you can follow a story and  it notifies me when there's something new, right?  And when there's an update to the story and I really, I really like that.  And I like that your point that, you know, the way the TV news works now is that it's  just people explaining the same, you know, thing, the same story.  If you have all the background, you're just hearing the same thing repeated over and over  and over again.  But what you really want is just to know has did the jury come back?  What was the verdict?  I'm glad you raised that.  Don't tell me whether or not only tell me if they have, right?  I don't want to hear anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We went to visit Circa this week as well, and they make a big point of that saying that  once you already know enough in the story, then all you want is the update that you want  to follow the story.  That's a new opportunity we didn't have in big old news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, Circa came out of Ben Ha of I Can Has Cheeseburger actually saying,  I think we need to rethink how we deliver journalism.  In fact, I remember going to food camp.  He was there.  Were you at that food camp, Jean?  I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we went back to the cottage and did the show with him afterwards.  And I remember him.  He had demoed it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Before he did Circa, he said, let's I want to talk with you about what's wrong with  journalism, what's wrong with news and how we can do a better job.  And then and Circa, I think is quite successful, but it's a different thing.  I mean, yeah, I think connected devices are a little different.  They are more goal oriented than sitting down in front of a television  or watching YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Leo, you question the orthodoxy of television.  You blew up the orthodoxy of television.  Yet here you are defending it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I am defending it because it works really well.  I hate to tell you.  Here's the bad news.  It's working.  The audience is dying.  By what measure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By what measure is it working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, okay.  You would say TV news is that thing that's on the box that comes through the air.  I would merely say video news and I would say YouTube counts.  In other words, consuming...  No, Circa is very different.  So there are ways of getting information via web browser and so forth.  But I think what succeeds is people like to...  This is why we spent a million and a half dollars to do this.  People like to watch video.  They like to...  The lean back experience is not a dead experience by any means.  And in fact, I will give you the measure.  People watch more television now than they did 10 years ago.  That's the bad news.  The number of hours...  Look it up.  Look at the TV news portion.  And the age thereof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the age of the people who are watching TV news.  And the portion of the TV news segments that is actually news as opposed to weather or sports.  Yeah.  It's really different.  It's really declining.  That I agree with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But that is the failure of local news.  That is the failure of local news.  Local news has always been horrific.  Well, that's really what we're focusing on.  I would agree with you, but I don't think the standup is the problem there.  It's the first of many.  I think the biggest problem with that is underestimating the intelligence of your audience.  And this comes again for many years.  I have worked for all the networks and I know they don't want you to think of the audience  as intelligent.  And that's kind of a mistake if you ask me.  Because guess what you get?  Stupidity.  Stupid people.  But that's...  Anyway, this has nothing to do with Google.  Hi, Gina.  How are you?  How's think up going?  I find it annoying.  My car's always saying, you're out of gas.  You're out of gas.  Where do you...  You want to see gas stations?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I want to keep driving.  Are you one of those horrible people that drives down to fumes?  You're also one of those horrible people that also appears two minutes before the flight takes off?  If possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Sometimes that's not always easy to do.  But I try.  I like to walk in that plane as they're closing the door.  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Do you like to cut it close?  I'm there two hours ahead.  My mother made me neurotic as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like this has a lot.  I'm learning a lot about you.  Five years later, I feel like this is indicative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  What about you, Gina?  Are you the...  I'm trying to think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I aspire to be Jeff, but in reality, I'm Leo.  I come late, but I'm like harried and freaked out.  I'm late because, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm always late for everything.  I just show up late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You're the only TV network on Earth that doesn't give a crap about the clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And I'm proud of that, even though it drives our audience crazy.  Oh, I don't know why.  It drives them crazy.  And I don't want to drive our audience crazy.  I should do a Mark Zuckerberg.  We built this station on the notion that no show should start on time, but now  we want to take care of you, our audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm pretty much never ready to start right at four, so I'm really glad.  Like, so it was built for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, see, you and I.  This is actually the week after next when I'm going out to Google to do a privacy talk, right?  The next Wednesday morning, I either fly back,  and I think I would land at 2 30 at Newark and I live 20 minutes away from Newark Airport.  So I'm now the Leo would say, no sweat, right?  Jeff would say, hmm, I'm usually home at least an hour before the show.  Something could go wrong.  They'll be really nervous.  And I can't tell anybody because I'm in the air.  Maybe I'll stay two more days just so I can be on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They should have on Google now like a setting for that.  What kind of person are you a Jeff or a Jeff or a it's a neurosis slide?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's 15 minutes past showtime and Skype's like, hey, do you want to install updates?  I'm like, what could go wrong?  Sure.  Oh, I did that too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes.  Guys, let me just update Mac, the Mac right now.  I just want to know.  I do it in shows.  Big.  Actually, I was so proud because I flew to Colorado to see my son on Thursday last.  And I arrived just as the boarding began for my row.  Like I like walked in.  That's what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I am so proud that I am now here's how to run it.  I'm now global services on United.  Yeah.  We go on before the pilots.  We go on the first.  Right.  And it's that horrible moment when I used to hate those people.  They say, excuse me.  Excuse me.  I'm global services.  Let me through.  Oh, I hate those people.  Yeah.  I know I'm obnoxious.  Right.  But even so, even though I know I can be the first to board, I don't have to line up.  I don't have to do anything.  I still show up early.  Good man.  Because I'm neurotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remember that demo we saw at Google I.O. where they were running Android apps in Chrome OS?  That is happening for everybody.  So we got four Android apps now available to run on Chrome OS.  Duolingo, which is a great app.  Love it.  Evernote, SiteWords, and Vine are all available in the Chrome web store for Chrome OS users.  OK.  So have you installed these, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I installed the Evernote.  Yeah.  It's great.  I mean, it works now.  That was because I complained before I stopped using Evernote because it wasn't native on  Chrome.  And so when my computer died, which is very rare on my Chromebook,  when it did, I lost the material because it wasn't saved to the cloud.  Now it does save locally, which is very important.  And that means that other applications will do the same thing.  And that's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's the tablet optimized layout, right?  Because it's on your Pixel, your Pixel's touch screen.  So when you launch Evernote, it looks as if it's on a tablet, right?  And you can touch it to interact or that you use your keyboard, obviously, to type into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Let me call it up here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it just acts like it's on your Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, what's weird is that now I can't find it because I have the Evernote.  I have an Evernote web.  That's what I've been using.  So I do use Evernote on it.  Yeah.  I just know I can't save stuff.  In the web, you can.  Right.  But, you know, so that's still in my applications.  Now I can't find the Evernote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't get a chance to.  I have to steal it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Because you can't advertise the apps on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I know that really bothers me.  You can drag them around though, right?  Can't you?  Yeah.  You can drag them into any order you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I don't have time to drag stuff.  What do I have a computer for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's what the alphabet's for, to put stuff in order in some random order based on the  first letter of their name.  Please.  That's why we created the alphabet.  A, B, X, Y, Z, F, G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't care anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Speaking of crazy, a man and his wife in Columbus, Ohio,  subjected to hour-long interrogation by the FBI because employees at the AMC  movie theater saw him wearing Google Glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And I didn't believe this story at first, but it's been confirmed since.  It's just ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This poor guy.  This poor guy.  So he's been in this theater before.  This is Columbus, Ohio.  He's been in this theater before.  He's an hour into watching the movie with his, I think with his wife or his partner.  He's got glass on.  These guys come and grab him and grab glass off of his face and take him into an  interrogation room.  I'm laughing.  It's not funny, but I just can't imagine getting like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He blogs on the Gadgeteer.  It was quite embarrassing.  Outside of the theater, there were five to 10 cops and mall cops.  It was like major bust.  First of all, of course, because it's glass, he could have been recording the movie, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, he could have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Or he could have been recording it on his phone.  Right.  But people do that and you will get...  I mean, that is a crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  He's going to buy that world's worst video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's what's so absurd about this.  But they do.  There's camcorders.  People are getting up and down.  The sound is terrible, but people do it and people sell it.  But is this really a commensurate response?  Somebody who's horrors taping a movie, even if he was taping the movie,  it takes five to 10 police officers to take this man down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Searched.  This theater had trouble with bootleg, with people recording movies in the past.  So I guess when they were interrogating him, they were saying like,  hey man, just give up your bot, like who you working for?  Just give up the guy up the chain and we'll let you go.  And he was saying, hey, just plug in my glass to a computer and you'll see,  there's pictures of my wife and my dog on there.  I didn't record the movie.  And it was an hour or quite a bit of time passed before they actually looked at glass  and tried to see whether or not, ascertain whether or not he was actually recording.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He says, he writes, I insisted they connect to the glass and see that there was nothing on it.  I also insisted they look at my phone and clear things out.  But they wanted to talk first.  They want to know who I am, where I live, where I work, how much I'm making,  how many computers I have at home, why I'm recording the movie,  who I'm going to give the recording to.  Why don't I just give the guy up the chain?  Because they're not interested in me over and over.  There is something really wrong when federal law enforcement officials  are doing the bidding of the Motion Picture Association of America like this.  When there's real crimes going on, this is ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  If you're going to question him, there's so much I found disturbing about it.  Like, are you going to be ripped out of your seat?  OK, but you're going to be questioned without being written your rights,  but you're not actually under arrest, but you're clearly being detained.  Technically, he should have been able to walk out at any time he wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They said that. They said you're not under arrest,  but if you choose not to cooperate, bad things may happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  At that point, you can say, well, then bring on the bad things  because I'm leaving unless you want to arrest me or whatever.  So there are all these things.  But what was disturbing to me was that there's no technical expertise.  If you're going to go after somebody and these people, some of them when they're  seen to have some knowledge of the bootlegging, how it's going on or whatever,  and you see that someone has these Google Glass,  you think you would at least Google a little bit of information about them?  Or at least.  In short order, you'd understand things like, well, you're going to get maybe 45 minutes of the  movie recorded, you know, or if he is telling you, well, you can take a look at the one or  whatever with it from there, then do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right. He said they released him five minutes after they checked.  Once they went through my phone and five minutes later,  they concluded I had nothing wrong and offered him four passes to another movie at the theater.  There is a lesson to be learned here, though.  Don't wear your glass into a movie theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, there's a lesson to be learned for not for that guy,  but for stupid movie theater owners and stupid cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, I disagree because I think that if you did the same thing,  if you held up your phone and did this, or if you had a even camcorder,  they would go in and arrest you and they would be within their rights.  That's against the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Is his he had prescription lintges attached to his class.  Those are his classes.  Ah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  And he's I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, it's funny, Leo, I don't get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's even the recording device.  It's like the battery.  Last five minutes.  It's a recording device.  It is also your phone.  If I'm wearing my smartwatch to the thing, I don't get arrested because it has a recording.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No, but you would if you held it, pointed at it and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The problem with glasses is if I hold my watch, you get shot.  If you bring it out and I go to look at it, my things up or whatever,  I could be having glass on because I want to sit in the movie theater for whatever reason.  I want to get a notification on email.  I want to get a text message showing up so that I know if I'm having a problem with my babysitter  or whatever, just because it has a recording device doesn't mean that it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But I think this is the fundamental problem with glass is that it does have a recording device  that is pointed at you and you don't always know if it's recording.  It's the same societal problem of going into a bathroom with glass.  And people, if you want to have glass take off, you better be very sensitive to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, Leo, I felt the same way that you did before last night's episode of all that  Android, which I'm going to plug right now because we had a guest on Cecilia who was the woman who  was pulled out, was stopped and given a speeding ticket on the road in the San Diego area.  But she had glass on while she was driving and the cop also find her or tried to find her for  wearing glass. And you know, to me, she had to fight it in court and won, by the way,  she had to fight it in court and she won. Right. Because they couldn't prove that she was  watching a video on glass. Right. Which is what the law prohibits is that you're looking at the  second screen. And, you know, my attitude was like, why would you wear glass while driving?  Or why would you wear glass to the movie theater? That's just dumb. And, you know,  especially driving. Right. Because when you open the package, the first things it says is like,  hey, this is not lawful to wear while you drive. Like, don't wear it. I mean, Google basically  says don't wear it while you're driving. But Cecilia explained like, first of all,  she's a CTO of a company that develops glassware. She wears glass all day long. She wakes up in the  morning, puts them on and she's a very dedicated explorer. They're just her glasses. She doesn't  think about it anymore. She puts them on and wears them. And it sounds like this is the situation  with this guy in the movie theater. And it didn't occur to her to take them off while she was  driving. And she wasn't, you know, she wasn't watching Netflix on her glass or whatever. She  was just driving. And particularly with driving, it's like navigation is a totally legitimate use  case for wearing glass while driving. So I mean, look, I think that the Explorer program, and I  said this on the show last night, the Explorer program is very much this sort of like canary  in the coal mine thing. I mean, I think that Google is figuring out like, where's glass? Where  does glass create these issues or these problems? And I think that, you know, movie theater officials  and cops on the highway are figuring out what is glass? What is, you know, when they're on,  does that mean that they're recording or not? I mean, I think it's just a misunderstanding of  the technology. But unfortunately, you have people like Cecilia and this guy in Ohio who have to,  you know, be the ones to deal with these sort of legal. I think there's some onus,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  there's some onus though on glass owners to be aware of the sensitive nature of this.  And while I don't care if he's in a movie theater, I do think that glass owners need to put the glass  up in their head when they're in a men's room. I mean, I just, I feel like it's kind of a little  tone deaf on the part of glass owners to say, hey man, these are my prescription glasses. What's  your problem? You're wearing a recording device in your head. So you'd be aware of that. And some  people are going to take umbrage. Some of them will be federal law officials. So it might be  behoove you just to avoid the problem. Like if that's his only pair of glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, he explained quite a bit actually, there's some other things I was reading on how he has a  spare pair, but he's actually been using them as his ordinary pair of glasses.  Well, he needs to kind of wise up.  Yeah, but you know, he'd also said that he's been to the theater before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So he got away with it before. That doesn't mean it's not.  Oh, it's not cutting away with anything.  It's not getting away with anything.  You and I know.  Yes, it is. Wearing a recording device in your head carries a higher responsibility  than not wearing a recording device in your head. Will you not agree to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  A recording device, I want to repeat this, a recording device that has like five minutes  of battery power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't care. You're wearing a recording device in your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You know, I would agree with you in general. For example, I, if I go into a restroom and I  am actually wearing glass, I will put them on my head when I walk in.  Oh, okay.  But I need to slide them up. It's no big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's just living in the world, Jeff. You got people.  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Let's go to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Hey, Jeff, at the very least, I don't have to worry. I'm going to go and then they're  going to go and then, you know, but it's, you know, it's not that big a deal. It's like a,  it's like a consideration to do for anybody.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Let me write back. Let me write back. If you really think that is that is that every man on  earth wants to shoot other men's junk. The only thing stopping them is they don't have  a camera on their head.  No, that's not what we're saying.  Really?  No, no, no, that's not what we're saying. You have to be where it's highly sensitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If you look, if you go around with a tape recorder like this,  people are going to take Umbridge and write,

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  you're wearing glasses that have technology on it. Jesus. I mean, is this this week of  Luddite is what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'm just saying that, yeah, I can see Leo's point that you might want to think about a bit more  when you're using technology that you are not as familiar with and might be a bit freaked about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You know, I'm asking you to give credit to people that they're not going to suddenly be bad because  they have technology attached to their head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I understand that. I'm not saying that they are. I'm not even saying this. I'm not saying  this guy did anything wrong. I'm saying if you're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  have to act, you're saying he should act as if people should assume that he does.  He should be sensitive to the fact that people.  I'm saying he should act as if he is virtuous until he does something wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You are making him guilty before he's proven guilty.  Like if I'm like if I'm wearing glass on occasions and I'm sitting at a table with  someone or I'm talking with somebody or interacting with somebody, I may move it to the top of my head  just so they don't think I'm going to be suddenly being distracted. It's the same way that if I'm  talking to somebody and I look at my phone while I'm talking to them, that can be interpreted as

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  rude. Jeff, are there any? Let me ask you this, Jeff. Are there no places you can envision where

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  it would be inappropriate to wear glass? That's the issue of wearing it. I don't think  it's a matter of inappropriateness. No, I don't think so. There's nowhere you could imagine

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  somebody wearing glass where it would be appropriate to put them away or to take it off.  That's just- I think it's appropriate. I think it's appropriate to say to someone. In every

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  circumstance. I think it's appropriate to say to someone, are you recording? It's  appropriate to say I'm not recording. That's fine. If I'm going into a locker room where

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  there are children changing and I'm wearing glass, I should say, hey, I have a right to wear this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm not saying it's about right. I'm saying that you are presuming that because someone is using  a technology- No, I'm not.  ...the use of it is bad. Yeah, you are. That's an issue because the kneejerk of the techno panic  crowd is that any use of technology, if it could be done bad, it will be done bad by everyone and  none of us should use it. I'm objecting to that logic. Jeff, if I carry an axe around

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  and I have no intent to chop anybody, this is for wood. If I carry a gun around, I have no  intent to shoot anybody. I use this to shoot deer. Are there not things that are just- I mean,  maybe legal, but society, Lee, it might be nice if people showed some consideration for other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Leo, it ain't far away from you that people drive around with gun racks in the back of their pickups.  If you went up to them and said, I object to you doing that, you shouldn't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I want to dash cam on that scene. No, but I can assure you if they came in here carrying weapons,  in fact, you go to Texas, every bar has a sign that says, please don't bring your gun in here.  Yeah. Is that wrong?  Are they in some way- Glass is not a gun.  I'm just saying there are behaviors, there are things you can have, whether you intend to do  anything wrong or not, that would just be polite to take them off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's the same discussion. No, the guy's glasses. When I get the new glasses and I get prescription  lenses on them, I'm not carrying around an extra pair of glasses and changing them all the time.  That's my glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I just think this is going to be an issue going forward and it can be very-

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We have the same issue, it was the same argument when cameras went onto cell phones and it was,  oh my God, we can't allow them anywhere in our gyms. How many stories have you seen of sickos  taking pictures of gyms? We didn't see it because we're not sicko as a society.  Yeah, but I have to say, if I go in a locker room, I don't go in a locker room like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hey, everybody. But if you're wearing it on your head, it's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Okay, Leo, if they got their phone out and they're texting like this,  and the camera could be pointed at your junk, but they're doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I think that's rude. I don't think you should do that. I think that's extraordinarily rude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  When I was at CES, I was in a restroom and like I said, if I had had glass, when I walked in,  I probably would have moved it to the top of my head. Just not because I'm worried that some  guy standing next to me thinks I'm taking a picture of him, but just because the entire  bathroom area tends to have some degree of privacy expected into it. So I'm like,  for whatever reason, I'll put it there. But as I was in this restroom, the urinals in this  restroom, sorry to get too graphic, but- Last week we talked about-  This particular hotel thought it was funny that above all the urinals was pictures of women  making funny faces and pointing down at you. Looking at your junk, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's in Vegas. Yeah, I've seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But I wanted to share that, so I took a picture of it with my regular phone. But before I did that,  I was really, really careful to make sure no one was around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If somebody's standing at the urinal, you do not take that picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I'm not saying you would take a picture then. And I'm not saying that just because I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  a camera with me- But Jeff, we can't tell with glass. Let me just say as somebody who's-  You can't. Yes, you can.  I can tell you're taking a picture?  Okay, glass.  But you don't have to do okay glass. You can wink.  No, no, no, no, no.  You can. You can go like this and wink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think you're playing in a techno panic. And so there was no justification for the treatment of  this guy in this theater for wearing his glasses that happened to have a camera attached that he

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  was not using. No, the right thing for the theater to do was to say, I'm sorry, you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  wear your glass into the theater. No, the right thing to do is to say,  remember, sir, please don't use that camera. Oh, yeah, that'll work.  Once again, what faith you have in mankind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the reality is if he had actually been recording the movie with glass, it would have  been a worse recording if he had been had a giant camcorder on his shoulder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But that doesn't stop people from doing it and selling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, but then he also would have had 45 minutes of the movie.  OK, I mean, it's not it's just it can't you can't do two hours of video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So that's like saying, well, you know, you know, I have this camera phone and I'm holding it like  this, but you don't have to worry because it only can record 720p. I mean, I don't think that that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  really what I mean. Are the issue again? This is this is a precursor of what's going to come.  We I think we are going to have glasses that have recording device.  Because they make a lot of sense. So the issue is not going to go away.  And it's going to become even more complicated because, yeah, if you are having glasses where  everything can fit into an ordinary frame, those would be your main glasses.  The reason I don't wear glass to when I go to the movie theater, by the way, is because  well, aside from the fact I don't need them, I like to wear my regular glasses to let me see  at distance. Right. So I've, you know, I'm not going to double stack them or whatever.  I don't need them for most things. But, you know, if I had a pair of glasses or especially  around here, sunglasses, I'm desperate for a pair of sunglasses. I use glass here in Newport  as my sunglasses. You know, if I'm going out on the paddleboard or something like that,  the sunglasses are great. I can take pictures of stuff and I don't really give it a second thought  because, you know, there's a great use case. And so when they become just this ordinary device  that you're wearing, it's going to be everywhere. And so then, you know, I don't know what you're  going to do at that point. Do you stop everybody who walks into a theater?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Because I'm telling you, this is a rerun. This is a rerun of 1890 and the Kodak camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You're not allowed to carry a camcorder into the theater either. I mean, I don't think that that's  so that's an unreasonable restriction. Admittedly, they overreacted and what they did was wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But I think so to go both ways, I think to what Jeff is saying, when you eventually get to everybody  has these recording devices, you get to the point where people start to relax about them and freak  out. And we have our norms. You'll probably become pretty clear that a movie recorded from  someone's head is not going to be as great, you know, even as things improve. But I think  do you think that we have a legal right to wear glass? Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Right to wear glass. I have a legal right to carry around a pencil and paper when  Glenn Greenwald's husband was prevented from writing down the name of the agents interrogating  him at the border of the UK. I was offended by that that you couldn't record something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What if I go to a theater with a GoPro step trapped to my chest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, I mean, a restaurant that says like shirts and shoes, please, you know, you can't,  I mean, that's a different thing. I mean, I think the bar said, you know, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I don't use the GoPro to see the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's where the private business has the so do you have a legal right to go into a private  business wearing glass? Probably not. The theater has every right to say you may not  wear glass in this theater. Unless you can prove some maybe there's like an American

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  the handicapped. Yeah, yeah, yeah. ADA says I can wear glass. Yeah, I actually have the right to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  it. But you know, in most cases, no, a private business probably could prevent you to do it.  Oh, I know they can. Do you have the right to be detained because you're wearing something by law

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  enforcement without being arrested? Well, no, that's but that's recent law that says you cannot  record a movie and that that is a law. I mean, I mean, I think they overreacted, but they have  the right to do that. They did not act illegally. Otherwise, there would be a lawsuit going on right

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  now. They did not act illegally. I'm about to ask my Dvorak moment and ask, did nothing happen this

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  week? We're moving on. Let's see in Google land. There is some big news. Europe has said you have  the right to be forgotten. A European court said Google must edit sensitive search results.  And people can ask Google to take stuff off of their index. There are 180 similar cases right  now in Spain. This is a very popular thing. We've in fact, I think the was the EU's privacy czar who  first proposed this. Nellie Crows. Well, actually, it was the other one. It's the other one.  So what is first of all, what is as you understand it, you are our reporter from Europe.  You've been there, right? I'm closer. Yeah, you've actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Jean is closer than I am. She's about two miles east. What is the right to be forgotten?  The argument is that when something bad about you is online, you should have the right to get rid of  this. But clearly, clearly that has an impact on the other party's free speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, what you could do is go to the place where it is. Oh, I guess if like you were,  I don't know, there are pictures of you in an orgy that were distributed widely.  Or the only place you could get it kind of turned off is Google. Well, the original site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But if it's if it's like 100 sites, right all over, then then you can try to cut access to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But it's still on those sites. Google's defense would be I imagine, well, we're merely the Google  search index merely indexes the state of the internet as it is. But the argument that comes

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  back then is, well, what's your algorithm? And you know, they always risk this danger of the demand  to reveal the algorithm. And how did that end up on top? But this is a really, really... Can't Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  defend that by saying, well, we have PageRank and this is how we use it? Here's the problem. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  don't have a First Amendment. There's no right to free speech in Europe. Well, right. There's not  the same guarantee in the same kind of absolute way. We had at CUNY on Monday, we gave an award to  Alan Rusberger, the editor of The Guardian, and Floyd Abrams of the New York Times, who defended  the New York Times and the Pentagon Papers case both spoke. And Alan keeps on going on about the  need for a First Amendment in the rest of the world. We're the only ones who have one. It seems

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  like an absolute right to speech. Even more to, in my opinion, seems to reflect a misunderstanding  of technology, a deep misunderstanding of technology. I think the right to be forgotten is a wonderful  thing. And I wish it existed, but it doesn't. Because you're not eliminating these websites at

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  all. Well, but it's worse than that, Leo, because what you're really saying is that you're going to  control knowledge. It's a men in black pen moment, right? And you forget. So you're telling the world  to forget something the world already knows. Right. That is offensive to the notion of knowledge.  Right. That says that we're trying to control knowledge. It's mind control, it's propaganda,  it's tyranny. All these things leave that you would think if anyone in the world has learned

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  this lesson, it's Europe. All right, but let me put a let me put a counter example. So you're a  you're a person who doesn't have a lot of a presence on the internet, doesn't participate  in the internet. You just you know, you don't it's not part of your life. You don't have a Facebook  page or Twitter page. You've in fact never put anything online attached to your name. But somebody,  a bad person, decides to write something bad about you. That bad person has a popular website or  whatever and that bad thing gets spread everywhere. That is the entire Google search result for your  name is that bad stuff may even be a lie may be in libel. What do you do then? Well, we have we

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  have a cure for that. That's libel. Go libel law. We already have that legal mechanism. And in fact,  in the UK, it's it's so wacky people from around the world go to sue on libel there. So there's  plenty of mechanism to say something says about you. But the other case is, what if you got arrested  for drunk driving 10 years ago, and that's online somewhere, and you say, well, really,  it's been 10 years, you know, can't you just forget? Right. But it's public record. Not not

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  not in the internet, you can't. Right. Yeah. And I think that blaming Google is what's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  puzzling. That's that's the anti tech part. That's that's that's the the the the Luddite moment here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  because this is just an index of what already exists on the net. And they're saying, well,  since we can't delete what already exists, what if we just delete, you know, control your ability to

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  find it? But that's not Google's fault. No, it's not at all. And again, I still want to come back  to this notion of free speech, because in any transaction of information, there are two parties.  Right. And and if you say something bad about me, and I go on and say, well, I just didn't like that,  or in the words of this, it's irrelevant. And I make Google take it down, and you want to you have  the right to be able to say no, no, no, what I call Jarvis a jerk, it's because he is a jerk.  It's because I mean it. And I have a right to call him a jerk. And and now you that right has

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  been impinged. So the ruling which was in Luxembourg, because it's the European Union  Court of Justice, was in a case where a Spanish man complained to the Spanish data protection  agency. It's interesting they even have some groups. Yeah, that an auction, this is the same  country that brought you the Inquisition, just in case you're wondering, that the auction notice of  his repossessed home showing up on Google, that infringed his privacy. Now, the company,  well, this is a quote from the judges, if following a search made on the basis of a person's name,  the list of results displays a link to a web page, which contains information on the person  in question, that data subject may approach the operator directly. And where the operator does  not grant his request to bring the matter before the competent authorities in order to obtain under  certain circumstances, the removal of that link from the list of results, the judge is conflating  the listing of the this of the repossession, which is presumably not just was the Google's  pointing to a page somewhere. But he's conflating that with the Google search results saying that  Google is in fact, presenting that information, they have this idea that Google is the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And Google, this is what Eric Schmidt always says that that because Google is the largest entity on  the internet, anything people don't like about the internet, they're going to go after Google for

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  this is the biggest issue, the judges said an internet search engine operator is responsible  for the processing that it carries out of personal data which appear on web pages published by third  parties that is all abhorrent. But what if Google took out any extract that said what that content

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  was but merely a link to the page? Look at Google's perspective. Now, they have to become  the court of what's right and wrong. So I come to you and I say, you should take down that foreclosure  notice. And then Google says, well, well, were you foreclosed? Was it true? Is this libelous?  Is this wrong? Google can't be the court of hurt feelings. Well, it's not even practical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, this is hard. I'm going to try and take it from the other perspective. I mean,  I think in these situations, I try not to think about it necessarily from the perspective of  Google, but maybe from the perspective of someone who has a genuine issue. I mean, I don't know what  if when Etta grows up, she doesn't like the things that I wrote about her, the pictures that I  published of her when she was a child, she wants to be defined, you know, other than how I defined  her or worse, you know, you have those sites where like ex-boyfriends publish, you know,  private photos of their girlfriends. That's a better example because that's so obviously  harmful. Yeah, yeah. I mean, of course, I don't think that Google can, you know, decide what's  right and wrong and decide what's fact and what's not. But the truth is, I mean, it is kind of  privacy through obscurity. If it's not listed in the first page of your Google search results,  so the first few pages, it might as well not exist. People can't find it. Or if someone's been  doxed and their address and social security number has been published somewhere for some reason.  It feels like there are so many instances where an individual who can't necessarily, you know,  practically reach out to all these third party websites and ask them to remove, you know,  private, you know, embarrassing, potentially harmful information, like doesn't have any recourse.  I'm trying to figure out, you know, what's wrong. I'm reaching back into my two elderly memory right

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  now. Wasn't there a feature on some search engine or some such somewhere once that allowed  you to annotate things and say that there was a response, there was more of a right to response

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  than a right to erase. You remember that? There should be a right to put, do anything to the Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  index. What do you mean, like, like, like trackbacks, that kind of thing? No, it wasn't that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It was, it was that there was some kind of a kind of chat room. Am I crazy? Wasn't there a moment  where there was an effort to be able to add on to church results? I guess my question is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is the solution for an individual, what Schmidt suggested that we'd have to change our names?  If we want to reinvent ourselves. No, I know it was a joke, but like, but if I'm an individual who  has a history of, you know, of, you know, whatever well documented online, I'm trying to reinvent  myself and trying to be a better person. I'm trying to be a different person. And I can't  get that information out. I mean, the solution is a more tolerant society. The solution, sorry,

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  it's this big, the solution is a more tolerant society that recognizes that we all do things  that we were mistakes. We all do things that we're ashamed of. At some point, we all learn lessons  and learn life as we go on and our one attempt at it. And this idea that off with your head,  if you do one thing wrong at one point, or if somebody doesn't like that you're gay,  um, that's the larger issue is tolerance. We can't solve that through trying to sanitize Google of  things some people don't like. Or for even so fine, Gina, take Google out of it and now just say  the internet. Okay. So now say that you said something about me that I didn't like at some  point. I said something stupid, like I like wave. And as a technology genius on this show,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Gina wishes I would never mention that book again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So just because I don't like it, can you come to me and say that you have to take down what I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like? I mean, so there's the internet and there's most people's lens into the internet. I think  Google search results are most people's lens in the internet. You know, it does the book,  if you can't find the book in the library, you know, if it's not in the, you know, organ in the  do decimal system, if it's not in the catalogs, like no, no one can find it. Sure it exists,  but it's, you know, look, the reality is that employers and clients and mothers and siblings,  all Google people, right? That's what you do. You Google people to find out something about them.  And there might be a time when, you know, you, I mean, I get it. I get, I get it's a tough issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I just, but the next step of this is that if Google can be forced to take it down, then any  and every site, including us will be forced to take things down and we'll be held liable in Europe.  If we say something, if I say something, you know, hair Schmidt is a dork and now hair Schmidt can  go to the EU court and say, you must take that down. Mr. Travis. And I said, no, he's a dark.  And this just proved it. Cause you went to the court to ask me to take it down. No,  I don't like this. It is irrelevant to me. You must take it down. That impinges upon my speech.  I just can't get past that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is something's verifiably untrue? Someone says something verifiably untrue about, about Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  you know, but what happens all the time? It happens all the time. Right. So I'm just,  I mean, I understand both sides, but I think that it's like saying, well, let's just not have an  internet because then this is a problem. And I think that unfortunately, punishing Google for this  first of all, is ineffective. It seems misdirected. I understand what you're saying,  Gina, that it's the card catalog. And if you, if you take the book out of the card catalog,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  doesn't matter if it's in the stacks. But even if you look at things like the knowledge graph,  I mean, Google has taken upon itself, you know, the idea that it's this repository of facts that  you can ask it questions and it will give you answers. What if something is the wrong answer?  If something is untrue, I mean, do they become the arbiter of truth at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Truth is a very hard standard.  And that's a problem is that this puts them in a position to do that. Right. They, they,  they now have to be a judge. I mean, this is a tough one. I don't know what the answer is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's tough. It's tough. And I actually, I tend to agree with both of you. I'm just trying to,  I like to try to speak the perspective of kind of the, you know, the person who's less empowered.  I think this is less about, you know, someone calling someone a name and more about someone  who's in a position where information about them, which is either untrue or which is truly private  or should be private, you know. But that's what Leo's point is, I think, Gina, is that, is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  the horse is out of the barn, the cat out of the bag. We're in a world now where knowledge passes  around quickly, information passes around quickly. And all in all, I want that. And it comes with a  price. So we also have to teach people to check things first. We have to teach people to, they do  have to go online and say something in response. We have to recognize that people make mistakes  early in life. These are, these are new realities and trying to hold back the technology  isn't going to work. And so we have to deal with that reality, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And meanwhile, you have the freedom to annoy in New York. Did you know about that?  Ah, the right to be forgotten.

It's the notion  that while the internet brings us so many wonderful benefits, it also can give rise to some unhealthy

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and undesirable behavior. I'm talking about trolls. Watch. What is a troll? All right. I love that  question because when I've been writing about trolling this week, and by the way, I have to  say that the reason I wrote that column, the reason I've been writing about trolls is because  of last week's This Week in Google got me thinking about it and that sort of thing. So that was a  really great conversation last week. But a lot of people don't know what a troll is. And essentially,  people think that somebody who sort of pesters somebody is a troll, which I don't believe it is,  or somebody who's one troll. I get into a big argument with them on Google+. They were saying  a troll is anybody who wants to be an influencer. And that's absolutely not true to me. And let's  see if you guys agree or disagree with this definition. A troll is somebody who either  deliberately creates emotions in the minds of other people in a conversation to either hijack  the conversation and get attention on themselves, or to get a sort of sociopath kind of thrill out  of upsetting and disrupting a constructive conversation. That's my definition of what a  troll is. And I think people use the word troll very broadly and unnecessarily. I think the  trolling phenomenon is something very specific and very real. Mike, I think that's good. I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  put a link to a piece I wrote in Medium. And Leo, am I allowed to say out loud the spelled out  a whole word? Yes. Okay. So because it's a book title. So An Asshole's a Theory, which by the way,  I assigned in a curriculum for our new degree. That was one of my favorite moments was to assign  that book. Aaron James defines that person, right? And he talks about the motive. So then what I did  was then I argued what the distinguishes a troll from a mere asshole. And I believe that he, and  as I pointed out, it's usually men, one, has a target, two, seeks to get a response, a rise out  of the target, and three, believes he is acting out of some ordained moral principle to destroy  or to bring down his target. Okay. That's my definition of a troll. I'm going to read one

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  from 1999 from alt.troll. This has been going on for so long on Usenet that they actually have alt.troll.  And this is a definition. What is trolling? The use of the word trolling comes from the fishing  technique where a baited hook, this actually might be useful to understanding this, is dragged  through the water in an attempt to attract a catcher fish. Usenet trolling is the act of posting an  article or troll a Usenet news group with the intention of attracting the native inhabitants  and provoking an emotional response, at which point they're caught as a fish would be caught.  The phrase was originally coined as trolling for flames. That's the historic origination. The  poster's intention was to incite a flame war, which I think is actually really more to the point.  We don't want to impute an intent on a troll except that they get off in some way  on the resulting carnage. They've made a difference.  And this, by the way, the kind of discussion we're having is exactly what a troll wants.  So here's the definition of troll from alt.troll. It's convenient that the world troll has multiple  meanings aside from the fishing example above. Troll is also the name, obviously, of a mythical  creature generally thought of as ugly, fat, cantankerous, wart-covered, smelly, and completely  unlikable. That's a troll. Since trolling is thought of as a detestable and unsavory activity  performed by loathsome, contemptible hooligans. I think that's another good way.  I like sociopaths.  Yeah, the name troll fits him quite well. They're two troll species. Those with overactive minds  constantly seek out new sources of mental stimuli. I say they want negative attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would even go further and say that there are some trolls who don't know that they're trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, many trolls do not know that. And then there are those who are permanently disgruntled or  physically shortchanged in some way and seek out ways to compensate for their shortcomings through  vicious personal attacks against others in order to achieve a mental erection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I was going to say there was a more something that's the most distinct I've heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  90s was a crazy time, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Remember?  This is not new to the internet. These kinds of flame wars and trolling started with used net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, I remember we talked about a study a couple months ago here, and I put up the link on the  rundown chat from February in which the most succinct definition of a troll you can possibly  find is a sadist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right. It came down to that, that ultimately they were sadists, which to wit, they got pleasure out  of causing others pain. And if you look at what happened to Zelda Williams, that's precisely what  happened.  That's precisely what happened.  It's somebody got pleasure out of knowing that they were causing extreme pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Their only interest in her was that she was vulnerable to having pain inflicted upon her.  Right.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's a really interesting problem. I don't know what the answer is.  Google+.  Your answer to everything is Google+.  Works for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And a pizza on me.  But again, I think Jeff is so prolific on Twitter, and yet where is the trolling on Google+. Jeff  has these amazing conversations on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's plenty of trolling on Google+.  Yeah, but it doesn't...  But you can get rid of it.  You can delete it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But the people who he's interacting with are not seeing that trolling. That's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And Mike's saying another point is that there are platforms where you don't bother.  That was Mike's real point.  I have a different experience. I had a troll on Google+, deleted and blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The person was able to make new accounts, to repost, to get others to repost.  It turns out even if you delete and block a post, the link is a permalink.  So he was able to recover that.  If you're persistent, you probably can.  Now, whether they get any traction is another matter.  I think you're right. It's difficult to get traction on Google+.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If someone on Google+, writes about you, Leo, not replies, but writes about you,  the way that someone on Twitter might mention you, you can't control that, right?  We're back to the same.  The main difference between Google+, and Twitter, correct me if I'm wrong,  is that you can delete comments on your posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's what Mike's talking about.  There are three or four differences.  One of them is you can delete comments, in which case if they check,  they can see that the comment was deleted.  You can flag comments, in which case the troll thinks that their message is still there,  but nobody can see it.  Oh, I like that.  And they have blocking and they have reporting.  Google tends to be more responsive to reporting than Twitter tends to be,  if you're not famous or a celebrity or if it's not something big in the news.  Here's another one that I never hear anybody talking about.  If I, let's say, for example, that Jeff Jarvis is not following me,  and I have a troll who's targeting me on Twitter,  and I want to contact Jeff, but he's not following me,  so I send a public Twitter message.  That's the only way for me to reach Jeff on Twitter.  The trolls can see that I'm interacting with Jeff,  and then they can go after Jeff, pretend to be me,  do all kinds of trouble like that.  On Google Plus...  Which just happened today.  Exactly happened today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I got five Mike Elgin trolls coming after me this afternoon.  Really?  Yeah, me too on Twitter.  Yeah.  I did.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I blocked them all.  Yeah.  On Google Plus...

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way, that's all the same person.  I'll point that out.  It's one person that does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But on Google Plus, you can contact anyone, including a stranger,  totally out of the eye of trolls.  You simply at mention them, they get the private message,  and it's a great way to contact people.  Unless, of course, they've set it up so that you can't be contacted.  So that's yet another way to do it.  But the sum total of all those things on Google Plus  lends itself to you cultivating a community  with zero trolling in that community, in your community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We are creating a society online,  and we're creating a couple things at once.  Code is law, says Larry Lessig,  and the code of Twitter is its law.  The code of Google Plus is its law.  We're also creating norms.  And my argument about this stuff is that every time you egg on a troll,  you are trolling.  You are an accessory to the crime.  You are just as bad.  You say, fight, fight!  You're just as bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's been our experience that the best thing to do is just go,  you know, give them nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I know, but then in essence, the trolls have won.  I disagree.  Because, well, that's what everybody said is,  don't go after this guy.  Don't do anything, don't ignore him.  No, in essence, then he keeps going and going and going.  Wow, I think you've created a stricter end effect here though, Jeff.  Well, I understood that.  I understood that.  But I finally just had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the norms argument can only be taken so far.  I mean, look at the Louis C.K. routine  where he talks about what a horrible person he is when he's driving  compared to when he's in an elevator.  The situation will always, always, you know,  for, you know, he's talking about how he's screaming  like horrible things at people when he's driving.  But, you know, when you're standing right next to somebody,  you'd never do that.  I think that affects lots of people.  We both have responsibilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.  We both have responsibilities.  I don't think it's sufficient.  I think that's, so you're right, Mike.  The code creates an environment that brings certain behaviors  and discourages others.  But then we within that environment can choose to behave well or badly.  And so what I'm really asking here and what, you know,  you guys are trying to answer and Gina is trying to answer here is,  can we create a better society that we're building?  And or do we give up or do we just say,  yeah, well, you know, the trolls are going to be there and that's that.  And people are going to be abused and that's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, one thing we don't want for sure is Internet community  where there are no women participating  because they can't participate safely.  And that would be a horrific effect.  No vulnerable people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No vulnerable people of any kind.  Yeah.  Right.  And that's that's that's Zainab's point about about Ferguson and Twitter  is the fact that it was open,  the fact that it could be controlled by an algorithm  or the fact that it could be controlled by other people  is what let Ferguson trend up to the point they got on media.  So I'm fully recognizing the value of Twitter being open.  And I it's a question I'm not answering.  Does that doom it to be is that is a social network?  Is it doomed to be antisocial?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  By the way, from the definitions we've heard here,  Upworthy could be considered a troll.  Most radio talk show hosts could be considered a troll.  I mean, I would disagree with that.  Is link baiting a form of trolling?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I don't think it is.  I don't think it is because the idea is to disrupt somebody else's conversation.  Not more targeted and vicious.  If you want to start your own annoying conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Look at me, look at me, look at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right.  It's it's disruption.  If you set up an entire radio station that's all about screaming political,  you know, then, you know, that's not you're not disrupting anything.  You're creating your own cesspool.  Right.  But if you go into somebody else's constructive conversation,  you wreck it deliberately.  That's trolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Internet trolls really are horrible people.  Okay.  Science says new research conducted by Aaron Buckles of the University of Manitoba  and two colleagues sought to investigate whether people who engage in internet trolling  are characterized by personality traits that fall in the so-called dark tetrad,  Machiavellianism, psychopathy, sadism and narcissism.  Turns out not so narcissistic, but really sadistic.  There was a that what they did is they polled, they surveyed these people  and asked if they enjoyed what they enjoyed most when online comment sites,  when on online comment sites, debating issues that are important to you,  chatting with others, making new friends, trolling others and other.  And among the people who said they enjoyed trolling,  it was a small number, only 5.6%.  They really had personality traits for sadism, particularly.  And you can read the study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why you don't feed the trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You don't feed the trolls.  Both trolls and sadists, they wrote, feel sadistic glee at the distress of others.  Sadists just want to have fun and the internet is their playground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So I'm working on some curriculum, which I'll not talk about today,  but talk about another time involved with engagement in journalism.  And I had the great delight of including in the required reading,  if I may use this word, assholes a theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's a scholarly paper.  It's a book.  It's a book.  It's a very good book.  It's a book.  Yeah, it's a book.  And what is the theory of assholes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Just kind of why they do what they do.  Yeah.  Well, this fits right in, I'm sure.  It does.  If you're going to deal with the public, you have to know this stuff now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because the behaviors are, this is the conclusion of the study,  because these behaviors are intrinsically motivating for sadists,  comment moderators will likely have a difficult time curbing trolling with punishments.  For example, banning users.  Ultimately, the allure of trolling may be too strong for sadists  who presumably have limited opportunities  to express their sadistic interests in a socially desirable manner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, is sadism ever socially desirable?  No.  It's more like socially acceptable.  You couldn't do in real life what you can do online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now you can do it.  And it's drawing them in.  Machiavellianism, a little bit Machiavellianism is the willingness  to manipulate and deceive others.  Narcissism, not so much egotism and self-obsession.  Psychopathy, the lack of remorse and empathy.  But the big one was the pleasure and the suffering of others.  That's really the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why if you are suffering at the hand of a troll,  you do not let the troll know that that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Because that's what they dig.  Exactly.  That's what they're going for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And it also says that if you...  And I was the big defender of comments early on in newspapers.  And I've said this on the show before,  where the first problem with comments is it's inherently insulting to the public to say,  we will allow you to comment after we're done with our work.  We should be more collaborative.  But the other problem with comments is that it is just an open space.  It was true of forums before.  It was true of Newsnet before.  An open space, you know, trolls will go and find it  and find the opportunity to have this behavior there.  And if it doesn't have a purpose, you're going to have this trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  See, and we've talked about this before is why I bring this up.  And I was of the opinion that these are people who were seeking negative attention  because they'd received this as children and this was...  They had misinterpreted his love.  I was giving them a lot of benefit of the doubt.  No, it turns out they're just cruel sons of bitches.  They're really...  No, no, they're not.  It's... They're just...  They're nasty people.  In their study, they found that only about 41% of internet users...  Actually, 41% of internet users don't comment, don't engage online at all.  Of the remaining, what is that, 59%, only 5.6% are trolls.  So it's a small...  It's a few percentage points.  It's maybe one or two or a hundred.  That's all you need.  That's all you need.  And we know this.  We know that part.  Yeah.  But, boy, those one or two percent are really effective  because they just push those buttons.  They have a test they call GATE,  the Global Assessment of Internet Trolling.  And then they ask things on a scale of one to five.  Do you agree or disagree with this statement?  I have sent people to shock well websites for the lulz.  Anybody ever?  Anybody in the chat room?  Have you ever sent people to shock websites for the lulz?  I'm not talking Rick Rowling.  I'm talking Goatsey, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I like to troll people.  Well, somebody we know and respect once famously did that.  Who's that?  Anil.  Anil?  Anil Dash?  He wore a Goatsey t-shirt that appeared  on the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the New York Times.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, and typical for Anil, anything he does,  even that turned into an intellectual discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, of course.  Of course.  Yes, but the New York Times photographed him  with the t-shirt on, not knowing what it was,  and published the photo.  I mean, that was the prank.  It was a stylized, it was not clear.  It was.  It was.  It was not the actual photo.  It was all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Some people typed in the URL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Right?  Boy, did that cause a discussion at the time.  It did.  Oh, my Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  First time I did a live twit, we did it at the Apple store,  and somebody sat down in the audience  and hijacked the Wi-Fi router so that all web searches went  to Goatse.  And it was really interesting.  And if you don't know what Goatse is, just ask your mom.  But it was really interesting because you could see  the waves of horror and disgust propagate  through the audience as people.  I shouldn't laugh.  And then, but we found him because he's sitting there  chortling.  It was very easy to figure out who it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, aren't their whole blogs dedicated  to like taking a photograph of the moment a person sees?  Yeah.  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I mean, I like to true or false.  I like to troll people in forums or the comment sections  of websites.  Trolls, it turns out, are pretty forthright.  They say, yeah, I'm a troll.  Yeah, I like to do that.  I enjoy griefing other players in multiplayer games.  Here's one.  This one.  This one.  The more beautiful and pure a thing is,  the more satisfying it is to corrupt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking about Weave.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Poor Weave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Now, he's self-declared troll, right?  He's off.  He got off, but on a technicality.  But he was the guy who was downloading email addresses  of iPad users by discovering a flaw in the AT&T database  website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's also the guy that trolled Cathy Sierra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, he is?  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was horrible.  He was horrible to her.  Horrible.  And that's what that last sentence made me think of.  The more beautiful and pure a thing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So no wonder there's such mixed feelings about him getting off.  Now I understand.  He's a self-proclaimed troll, and I guess he really, really is.  Let me show you this picture, because we were talking last week about Inbox,  which is the Google email program.  Gina very kindly did pull some strings to get both me and Jeff Inbox.  I love it.  I don't want to ask you how you love it.  But as soon as we talked about it, look at the tweet.  Because we were speculating, I bet these guys are watching as we talk about it.  Yep.  There is the Inbox team watching us talk about Inbox with beer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I had tweeted that, all right, I guess I'm missing the show.  When Leo was trying to find something, then he finally did find it,  I said I imagine there were Googlers saying, yeah, Leo, no, no, no, that's Leo, Leo.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's what came up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's great.  And I give credit for who put the picture there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Jason Cornwell.  Thank you.  And Jason, I presume is on the Inbox team because his Twitter icon has a giant Inbox  icon in his hands.  So and these and there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  The little name tags there, I think, I think that's him.  It's his desk too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, the bearded guy.  So pretty sweet.  I'd be really impressed if they took a picture of this on the screen.  Let's do inception.  Can you take a picture of this?  Keep going, keep going.  Of us looking at you, looking at us.  David Pogue, the Jerry Lewis of Technology Reporters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And welcome to What is That Thing?  The show where we ask you, what is that thing?  How do I go full screen?  What is that thing?  What is that thing?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  B.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  C.  Or D.  The answer is E, none of the above.  It's the new Apple Mac Pro, available now starting at the high, high price of $3,000  and going up to $9,500.  This computer is crazy fast.  Look at this.  In Final Cut Pro, it can munch this 4K video like butter.  That's four times the resolution of high depth TV.  And it's made in the USA.  It's portable, one-handable, expanding the memory is super easy.  The shell pops right off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, the music's going to make me shoot myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The jacks light up when you move it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's like Benny Hill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's super quiet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Da da da da da da da da da da da da.  No one who's watching this is going to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's not like the old Mac.  Oh, that's all right.  They still have to put drives and cards inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, I'm glad it looks like this.  This is good.  If there's a market for this, all the better.  It's not our market.  It's not your market at all.  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A gorgeous object of art.  I'd be surrounded by mismatched clutter and gadgets.  Apple Pro's different, real pros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You're going to drop it.  You're going to drop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, we're going to see you cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I love how he has a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is why I'll never be David Polk.  I just don't have the damn energy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  He had a lot of jump cards working before him there, Leo.  How does he do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Change log is coming up next.  Gina Trapani, put your change log hat on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Will do.  What do you call it?  With the lips?  The umbrature?  No, the umbrature?  No, do a trumpet.  What's that called?  Chat room.  What's that called?  Umbra-chur.  Umbra-chur.  Is that what it is?  Get your umbratures ready, people.  Well, no, that's your...  Yeah, because it's trumpets.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You know, really, I'm sorry, but when I hear a tuba, I just see a guy going...  into a big tube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But at least that catches the spit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is that in Twitter?  It's in the chat room.  It's in the chat room?  So this is... that's kind of interesting.  Ben did this.  I think Ben did a little illustration of what this show is reminding him of.  Ben, can you put glass on the old man on the left?  Yes, we are.  Oh yes, here it is.  Thank you, Ben, for an updated image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Ben.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Oh, we got complete with glass, too.  Very good.  Now that's Photoshop wizardry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I like it.  We used to make the joke, the paperless office.  That'll be here as soon as you get the paperless bathroom.  I have now a paperless bathroom.  Do I want to know this?  I really want to know this.  The Japanese toilet.  It works.  So maybe it is time for the paperless office.  Visuals.  I know, I shouldn't have bring it up.  Okay, changing the subject.  Changing the subject.  Somebody in the chat room said, next thing Google buys is this and that.  Yeah, I can see that.  Totally, right?  And then Hue lights.  And then Hue lights, I don't get it all.  Oh, I love the Hue lights.  Better than my Nest.  Hue's are pretty cool.  Okay, so here's an application, Jeff.  There's an application on the iPad and iPhone called Exoplanet  that notifies you whenever another planet outside our solar system is discovered.  You set it up, it has a little button that the Hue light then changes to the color  that it looks like on the surface of that planet depending on the sun that the planet's in.  The solar system.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's off the nerdometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how anybody ever existed without that.  Sorry, Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's beyond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's the geekiest thing I've ever heard.  Off the nerdometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Off the nerdometer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Nerdometer needle is like spiking in the red now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Hue lights are very nerdometer.  Very, very big on the nerdometer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I've heard of these.  These are just smart lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Philips makes them.  They're not that expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Huge amount of money out of you.  That what's makes smart about them is that they rip you off for how much money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  60 bucks a bulb.  Well, no way, they're LED lights.  Now, admittedly, LEDs have gone down.  You can get them for 10 bucks now.  And I'm sure these will go down at the same time.  Philips is rapidly reducing the price of LEDs.  But LEDs are expensive.  But they're 10,000 hour bulbs.  These are RGB LEDs, which means they can make any color at all from this light.  So much so that you could take a picture with your smartphone,  put it in the Hue app, click a part of that picture and say,  light bulb, you go to that color.  It can literally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Wait a second.  All right, maybe you'll tell me one thing.  Can it stop me from looking pink?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I guarantee you.  So for instance, for instance, I have a picture of a moonlit night.  I put it in my Hue thing and I said, OK, bulbs.  I want to be a moonlit night.  And you feel like you're literally in the moonlit night.  You can also use if this and that with it.  You can set alarms.  You can say, for instance, I want to slowly wake up.  I want the bulbs to ramp up starting at 6 a.m.  to give me a sunset or a sunrise in my bedroom.  You can have daylight.  You can have nightlight.  Now, admittedly, there's no this isn't that practical.  And there are some strong negatives, for instance, as I discovered,  if the power goes out and then comes back on, the Hue lights turn on full bright.  And so in the middle of the night, I'm lying in bed and suddenly.  Good morning.  Because I have a lot of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take me to the light.  And I'm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How many do you have?  Nine.  And then I reach for my phone because I know what's happened.  Although, God damn it, the Hue lights came on and I'm starting to open the app.  And Lisa just reaches over flips the switch, which was actually the right thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like you live in the in the kingdom of modern marbles.  Between your toilet and the light.  I'm looking in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  OK, so OK, the toilet.  Don't listen.  Cover your ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yes, you got to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Cover your ears.  So you get up, you go to the bathroom.  The toilet goes to welcome you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Does it play a song or no?  No, this one does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's the creepy line.  We have found the creepy line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And then it's the seat is warm.  It's heated warm.  Very nice.  Never sit on a cold toilet seat again.  And they're also the water is heated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  See, I stop there when I sit on a warm toilet seat is because somebody.  I know I know this is this is a clean warm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a clean warm.  A fresh warm.  So sanitized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  59 years of visceral response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You sit down.  The fan goes on because it has a carbon filtered  exhaust fan in the bowl so that everything is exhausted out.  And then when you're done, there's front and back washers.  They oscillator pulse or any combination thereof.  It's warm.  You set the temperature.  It bates you.  Wiper blade of any kind.  No, it's a bidet.  It's a modern bidet.  There's no touch, no touch.  And then it has a nice little blow dryer.  So after you're done washing, you press the blow dryer goes.  And it drives you off.  And then you stand up and then you walk out because the seat automatically.  The toilet automatically flushes.  The seat automatically goes down.  It sanitizes and it's ready for the next person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  All right.  All right.  We're going to have a Howard Stern moment here.  No, no, it's OK.  It's OK.  Does it does it deal with dingleberries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, all right.  It's a very powerful thruster.  Oh, oh, it's like it's I don't want to go too far.  Showtime.  All right.  It's very pleasure.  It's very pleasant.  So on the Howard Stern show.  Websites down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's no brushes though, right?  No, there's no physical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So I realize what it is.  I realized I suddenly understood this after doing this.  See, you have to use the Nest.  You have to use these things to get it.  Right.  And they get the pros and the cons.  And one of the things and you can't just and this is why reviewers sometimes miss the boat.  They try it for a week.  OK, I get it.  And they go, you got to live with it.  So what I realized is the Japanese don't care so much about butt cleanliness  as they do about not touching anything.  So what this really is, is a toilet where you could you could walk in like this and not touch anything.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's the point of it.  Well, because we've gotten the point, you know, you don't touch in public restrooms.  You no longer touch the water.  You no longer touch the paper towel.  That's what this is.  But of course, you use your hand on the damn door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right.  So the idea and I think that they're probably right is it doesn't really matter how clean your butt is.  It matters how clean your hands are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Is the blower like the ones in the airport where it's like eight thousand, you know?  No, no, it's not a Dyson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what I want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I want a Dyson in my shower.  I just want to go around and be dry.  Yeah, I hate getting out and being cold while I dry off.  It's a good idea, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  They have those, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I could stand the sight of the flapping flesh, though.  Like, it always freaks me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's going to come off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's just this is yes or no.  This is an acceptable level of cleanliness for you when you're done.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes, it's acceptable.  You don't want you don't go.  God, I wish I'd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And of course, while we're on technologies, two from the Howard Stern show, one is Poo Poo.  Would you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I have Poo Poo.  It's.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do not buy Poo Poo.  I didn't know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  OK, how about how about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is sounding like I am so anally fixated.  I am not.  What about the squatty?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, in Japan, you're just describing a normal.  I am normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  This is a Japanese toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a squatty potty.  Yeah, I've heard about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Poo Poo doesn't work.  So the whole theory is that it creates a barrier in the surface of the water.  It's just fragrance, very, very, very strong fragrance, and it does not have any magical  properties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Robin Quivers says she carries it with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, because she smells like flowers everywhere she goes.  All right, so that's that one.  The theory of it sealing out the order that's me, but it does.  It's a very strong deodorant because it smells like whatever flavor you got.  And it's very, very strong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So there's the squatty potty, which Howard now swears by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So this is an image I don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I reviewed it on Gizwiz.  I reviewed the squatty potty on Gizwiz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is that the one that where you're so it's not that you're like it's not a  it's not a hole in the ground that you squat over.  No, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It raises your legs up.  So your angle is better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It's a step stool for the can, which is supposed to be better, which is ridiculous  because all it's doing is bringing your knees to your chest to make your organs all fit together.  All you have to do instead of spending 30 bucks on a plastic stand or the toilet seat.  No, lean forward.  If you put your chest towards your knees, it works.  Just lean forward.  Don't buy a squatty potty.  What have we done?  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm really glad I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I did say at the beginning of the show, it's that we talk about Google and whatever the hell  else we want to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a word cover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We're talking now about a cloud of poop odor.  Oh, God, this is Mark Holmes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mark Holmes got to smell good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, Nest, thank you very much.  How is Think Up going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think Up is going great.  We demoed it last week at New York Tech Meetup, which is a  How'd that go?  It went really, really well.  I was worried.  I heard it was a really tough crowd.  It is.  And they were really good to us.  The demo went well.  The video's up?  The video, yeah.  I'm not sure if they chopped it up into individual demos, but the video of the entire meetup is up.  And we were up against a sex tech section.  A what?  A what?  Smart vibrators.  You were up against Mar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You were there.  I was there.  I didn't realize that was you.  Yeah, that was me.  There you go.  Yeah, no, it was really fun.  What do you mean up against smart vibrators?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What do you mean?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a really complicated concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Is it a competition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the Tech Meetup is a series of demos from various tech companies in New York.  And there happened to be, and it was actually the first ever, it was a sex tech section at  the end of the night where they asked for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was in honor of Valentine's Day?  Yeah, sort of a February event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So basically, you go up and you demo in groups of two or three.  The other company that we demoed with was Lendo, which is a micro payment loans company.  And they actually got a ton of questions as well.  But it's really fun.  It's a huge event.  It was really intimidating, but it went really well.  So I was happy with it.  Yes.  So thank you.  Thank you.  Yeah, think of me as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  We still got to hear more about the sex tech, Gina.  You got male geeks out here.  You're not satisfying their needs.  Let's hear one stupid sex tech item.  I am so biting my lip right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a demo of a smart vibrator and I forget what the name of it was.  Maybe, Sarah, you remember.  She's trying not to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to tell you that I don't remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Chat room, what would you name a smart vibrator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Telestosterone, says the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's just say it's remote controlled wearable tech.  And that's all I'll say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was designed by someone who was living in Boston, I think, and his wife was back in Singapore.  You mean over the internet?  And so she can help to, he can help her achieve an orgasm with the remote vibrator.  It was a riveting demonstration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's no meaning to the word latency, I got to tell you that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to say the demo, the guy who demoed came off, he was so earnest and really wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a devoted husband trying to help his long distance wife.  What are you going to not like about that story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, is this Vibes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's it.  Check it out.  Whoa.  All you girls out there.  I know there's two or three of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  There's a video, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know, are we there?  Wait a minute, so there's a, no, don't show that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite moment of the demo was a point at which he said, and we even talk to women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, well, it's a bad time.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And I thought, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Connect, select, play.  There was sort of a bit of an anticlimactic moment, if I may use that term, because they  announced at the beginning, at the beginning they said, okay, anyone with young people,  children under the age of X, you really need to leave the room now because we're going to  have this special sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Imagine listening to 50 Shades of Grey with a Hens Free Vibrator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That vibrates in perfect sync with the audio fantasy.  So there's an audio fantasy?  Yes, yes, yes.  So you don't need the husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's what I'm saying, you can be 3,000 miles away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, but you don't need the husband at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's talking, he's talking over his iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, but there's a video, there's a fantasy, there's audio fantasy.  Yeah, that's the fantasy.  You don't need the husband.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there were a few different options.  Yeah, you could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You've been replaced by a podcast, honey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could choose different paths, aren't you the one who's interested in paths?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's more than one way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not to in any way overshadow, think up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You see what she meant when she said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Even with this, you did well.  Yeah, this is great competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what I meant by being up against some tough, it was a tough night to demo, honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, that's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, it's wearable.  Oh no, no, no, no.  That's too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So it's wearable.  It's 100% hands-free experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is indeed wearable.  It's wearable tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think I'm just about to get fired for being in a  I wasn't working environment.  The dean is here.  It's okay.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't mean for this to go so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was the topic of my next faculty meeting.  Now you've blown it for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's an app for it.  That's what I think kind of interesting is it has an app, Android or iOS.  I'm surprised Apple approved that, to be honest.  Seems like that's something Apple wouldn't approve.  They don't believe in people having sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they had some problems with it actually.  And then yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was part of the discussion was like how to legitimate consumer products that are related  to sex deal with things like app store policies and even just getting payment processors and  different web services.  A lot of the companies just won't work with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I bet they only have problems in the US though.  I think in a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  She said globally they have a problem.  Really?  Not in Germany.  I think she was saying, I mean, there was a woman who I forget her name who came up  afterwards and was quite passionately annoyed about how the financial world which sort of  shied away.  Anti-sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cindy Gallup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  A lot of negativity about sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Especially by bankers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So it's all the more impressive that you did so well, Gina.  Yeah.  That's a tough act to be on stage with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So let me ask you, how's Think Up doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think is going really well, Leo.  Thank you.  We did one last week.  It went awesome.  We're going to open up and sign up to the public in the next couple of weeks.  It's going really well.  Thank you for asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you.  And damn you, Jarvis.  You couldn't let it slide, could you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, not only does it slide, well, no, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just today, Google released a new Android app called Device Assist.  It offers live tech support, troubleshooting, tips, and more.  The catch is it's only for Nexus, Google Play Edition, and Android One devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry about that.  I have it installed.  I can show it while you talk about it.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be great.  I have to have the overhead.  So in addition to offering quick access to Google support, the app detects issues with  the device's setup, makes suggestions on things like GPS, connectivity, and battery settings  to improve overall performance.  It's like proactive troubleshooting to help you sort of get the most out of your device.  This is like tips.  How's it looking to you?  This is kind of, how's it looking to you, Jason?  Do you get like a live Googler on the line?  Oh.  Is it like the Amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, so looking for help, send device information to Google for improved technical support,  see Google's, okay, sure.  I don't know what I'm about to do here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you about to like launch a help app for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Request a call back.  You can request a call back, provide a backup number if you can.  Phone issues will be easier to solve if we can call you on a different phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Is it illegal to like call them right now and see what they do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you're telling me to do it then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  See how long it takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's it.  Oh, really?  I haven't entered it for me.  Google, don't you know this about me already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an app on your phone, but it didn't ask for access to your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Cover it.  That's really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like we're putting you on the spot here, Jason.  Describe your issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's only optional, so I don't have to actually describe my issue, so I won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm live on a Google-related podcast, and I'd like for you to comment on Devicesys.  That's my issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Right now, someone's calling someone at Google saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  get it ready, here comes Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  We want to call really, really fast.  All right, we want everyone to know that this works right away.  So I guess I would just wait and see then,  and I'm sure at some point I'll get a phone call.  And it'll buzz on my wrist, by the way, so I'll really know when it comes to detected issues.  I don't have any issues on this Nexus 6, so apparently I'm good.  But it also has this tips column for, and I think this is actually a really good idea,  because so many times things inside Android are just kind of buried.  You just kind of have to discover them or know that they're there  or long press something randomly and, oh, hey, I didn't know it did that.  So this is good. This is really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Like having our little Gina Tripani there telling us what we can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Totally. Yeah, it should be called the Tripani tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  One of the things we do in the Academy is we observe our colleagues and write them a call.  By the way.  Oh, really? Oh, go, go, go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, this is Jason.  Here, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you for contacting Google. My name is Tom. Am I speaking with Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow. Yes, you are. How's it going, Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Jason, I'm doing well, thanks.  Looks like you set up a call with our new device assist app.  That's pretty awesome. What can I help you out with today, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to be completely honest. I called A to see how fast you would call because,  I'm very curious. I think this is a great, great feature.  B, I'm doing a show called This Week in Google where we talk all about Google things  and you're on the air right now. So you're famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi, Tom.  Hi, Tom.  Hey, Tom. I really appreciate that, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And we're in the house.  And that callback only took, man, what, 30 seconds? 45 seconds?  Super impressed. It's really cool. Great service you guys have. I just wanted to  call and see how it goes and appreciate your time. Sorry to bother you.  What are some of the first questions he's getting?  Is he got any questions yet?  Hey, hey, hey. So before I let you go, what are some of the kind of first questions you're  getting? Are you getting a lot of these kinds of questions or are you also getting actual  service support questions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, my shift just started about 10 minutes ago, so I haven't really gotten many calls yet.  You're actually my first call of the day. So, you know, I guess it's yet to be determined  what kind of questions we're going to be super fielding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So your first call ever doing this is live before thousands of people.  How much training did you have?  How much training did you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This poor guy.  Well, a few weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  All right.  Are you in a nice warm place or a cold place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Are you in a warm place or a cold place? That's Jeff Jarvis, one of the hosts on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm in a cold place right now. It's real windy and rainy today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, that's not fair. They should be moving you to California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You are in California, correct?  Yeah, Northern California.  All right. So then we're experiencing the same weather. We're up in Petaluma.  So we have it right out the window as well.  Hey, don't want to bother you, but I really appreciate your time.  And, you know, check out this. We can Google. You're on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, all right. Well, Jason, I'm real glad I was able to help you out with those questions today.  I just want to let you know at the end of the call here, there is going to be a real brief  customer support survey asking for any feedback you might have on the support you received.  I understand if you've got the time that you need to take for the show.  So go ahead and get you transferred over there.  And I want to thank you again for contacting Google and enjoy the rest of your day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right on. Thank you so much.  We got to get good grades now.  Bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right. I guess I'll give a good grade while you continue on with the change log.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure. Yeah, let's do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  OK, I enjoyed that. That was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to call it the her. I don't want to.  I do too. It's I'm going to say, let's just call it.  Oh, maybe just say hello, Scarlett.  What was her name? I forget now.  Samantha. Sam.  Samantha. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes. Yeah.  No, I don't know. My borderline a little creepy if you call the phone Samantha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I would like it because actually if it had Scarlett's voice, because the I don't know  how you feel Siri's voice I've gotten used to, but the Moto X Google Google voice is strident.  Let me I'll give you an example. Let's get out of this.  Let me think. What am I going to do here? Hello, Moto X. What's the weather in Petaluma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unlock your phone to continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's just a little I don't know, a little strident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's 78 degrees and overcast in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Siri just seems nicer. You disagree?  Yeah. Do you agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, I don't. I the voice is it's it's still a little robotic.  I think it's difficult to get it, you know, kind of softer, but I haven't used Siri in a really long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, you want to hear Siri these days? I think she's sounding a little bit a little bit better.  I forgot what I do to start. Oh, I have to press the button. By the way, the I have to be have to  be careful on the shows now, because if people have their iPhone hooked to the power and you say,  hey, Siri, it will actually wake her up and she'll start she'll start doing stuff.  How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Golden Gate Bridge is eight thousand nine hundred eighty one feet long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Long, long, long, long.  She seems friendlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, she does. Interesting. And our voice is a little lower.  Now we've got to get Cortana into the mix. But I actually like Cortana's voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So my my Windows phone is in the other room, so I can't. But I actually like you have it there.  There goes Danny. He's going to get his big board.  Can I update? I can upgrade the voice on this, right? I can download better sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So you need to have celebrity voices, right? Like you have to Tom Tom. I used to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I used to have great celebrity voices in my Tom Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I had my Tom Tom. One of the versions I was great because you could have all the  you could put your own voice and I had my kids do all the turns.  So they'd be like, go forward, make a U-turn.  Daddy, go forward, daddy.  Actually, whatever it was, when I would have to do the U-turn,  because that was usually a sign that I was lost, it would say my wife would go instead of saying,  make a U-turn, it would say, why don't you pull over and ask directions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's good. I like it. So let's hear Cortana. You got Cortana?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. What do you want her to say? I don't know if you'll be able to hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, it doesn't have a speaker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't know if you can hear it through my headset.  Oh, hold. Just put it right up there.  All right. Hang on. Hang on. Here we go.  How long is the Golden Gate Bridge?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like the musical tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It'll take six hours and 51 minutes to drive to Golden Gate Bridge.  Did you hear that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yes. It says it'll be six hours to drive there.  That's not too long. Let's go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It doesn't sound at all like Cortana in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's not too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's not too long.  It's not too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should have gotten Cortana from Halo to voice. I'm so disappointed because I love Cortana and  Halo. I know this is a different Cortana, but I wanted the voice to be the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Ask Cortana what she thinks of Siri. Does she say anything about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  She's got a whole series of things that she does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's one thing that both iPhone and Apple and Microsoft do is there's some personality.  What do you think about Siri?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hard to say. So far our conversations have been kind of one-sided.  She's great. I mean, there's inflection. Of course, that was pre-recorded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's another thing that Microsoft's doing, which is intelligent. These canned speeches,  and this is obviously one, are treated differently than synthesized speeches.  Yeah.  That sounded great. Morgan Freeman would be good.  Yeah.  Oh, well, someday. Ask who Bill Gates is married to.  Who is Bill Gates married to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Bill Gates is currently married to Melinda Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that curly part.  Curly?  Right now, this is the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'd fix that.  I would fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I'd fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I would fix that.  Holy cow.  Shimmity Christmas.  Well, we don't know what's going to happen in the future, but right now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now, things are good with Bill and Melinda.  Who is your father?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Technically speaking, that'd be Bill Gates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I love Danny Sullivan. He does such a great job.
