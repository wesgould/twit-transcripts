You guys should know  And of course the men's singles champion no vac dad jokes dad jokes  Justice department ramps up google probe  That sounds painful with heavy focus on ad tools. This is a wall street journal exclusive  The justice department has reached out to more than a dozen companies  Including all of the hereditary enemies of the google publishers advertising technology firms advertising agencies  Apparently according to the journal  Google's online ad tools are a major focus now of the justice department's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can we trust any justice department probe ever again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's you know, see this is a problem because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, maybe there maybe there should be some enforcement right, but maybe there should maybe there shouldn't we can't tell to tell the difference

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could be rupert murdoch is you know putting a little bug in uh, william bars here  We don't know in a couple thousand on the handshakes. Yeah  Many of the questions according to wsj center out two moves that google's made in recent years  That publishers and rivals  Should you be if you're going to investigate a company? Uh,  for anti-trust or whatever should you be talking to  Competitors and rivals. Yes. Yes, that's who you talk to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because our current our current anti-trust framework is built around  competition and the  Well consumer harm, but yes, yeah consumer harm. Well, is it consumer harm or is it business harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if it's if it's on unfair use of a market position or monopoly that obviously does affect your competitors  Yes, the competitors have the evidence and they would know they have the evidence. Yeah, see what here's the great thing about this  Here's the great thing about this timing right the same time this story comes out, right?  Google's finances come out and everybody's going after google because the ad business is slipping  Of course just like microsoft just like that right just at the time when yes, you're fighting yesterday's war and it literally was yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The first of the two  Moves google's made in recent years that people are worried about was google's integration of its ad server  Uh ad words and adsense with ad exchange the industry's largest digital ad marketplace  Secondly was google's decision to require advertisers to use the the google tools to buy ad space on youtube  I don't understand how else you would do. How else would you do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the first on the first, you know, i've always said that google's uh vulnerability  In its power is the ad side. They do have the power of god  I don't think that they were as clever as they should have been  In being more open about the processes and having appeals for places that are taken down  Google had too much power in advertising. I will acknowledge that  And I think it's just a nature of their size, but there could be stuff in the closet there that's going to hurt them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Were you surprised at how little money youtube makes for google?  Oh, I thought that was a lot. Was it a lot of money? It's like it's 15 billion, but people it was 15 billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So 18 billion total

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Sorry, but I I actually so I thought it should be more

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I only because of instagram

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Instagram compared to facebook. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah compared to facebook instagram  Is what was some huge portion of facebook's overall revenue? I have at the bottom 20 billion. I think was 23 billion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's down there under my stuff. Um  No, 20 billion 20 billion. Uh, so instagram was a 17  7 715 million dollar purchase  Now revenue of 20 billion youtube was a 1.65 billion dollar purchase now 18.1  Billion revenue 15 ad as stacy said plus three  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A billion for uh subscription revenue. Although how long was youtube purchased in 2006?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Something like that. Yes earlier. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I mean let's talk about time value money. Yeah, they yeah how long we've been 2006 they paid 1.65 billion instagram was a better investment

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  quicker returns cost more youtube  So i'm confused  Uh, oh I guess 15 billion a year  Because it had a five billion dollar quarter  In revenue, that's not profit. That's revenue revenue revenue. It's all revenue. That's ad revenue again

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not including subscription revenue, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, why why has google never revealed this before and why are they revealing it now sooner I guess

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that he's running alphabet or maybe it's regulatory pressure. Maybe they wanted to  If people thought youtube was all this maybe they were like, well, let's show although  At those price at that pricing it's been material for a while  So I don't understand how they could not have broken it out if that makes sense. Oh, so the other thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although my you know apple doesn't say

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, well, I guess they do they don't break out tablets make this much phones make that much. Yeah  Yeah, um, the other thing about google is that to the earlier point about advertising  As advertising is suffering because it is an abundant market with no end of inventory and prices are going to go down  The wall street has been on google's case to say show us you are not  100 vulnerable to an advertising only  So they've got to show that their cloud stuff and youtube though  It's advertising still but a different kind or search  Show us you're not completely vulnerable to search advertising because search advertising has been vulnerable as we talked about in the show many times

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does feel like google and facebook have become dominant in ad tech amazon you'd have to add amazon in on that  Uh now, but the three of them probably have what 80 percent or 90 percent of the digital ad market  I mean, it's a huge percentage. I don't know it's all of it. It's easily. Yeah, I mean so  I mean like but there's competition. It's not like google has a monopoly. They might have a  Triopoly if there's such a word

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  um looking for oligopoly oligopoly  Is that how you say it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, that's google's defense. They say the ad tech industry is competitive

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um google's market share contracted for the first contracted for the first time in 2016  Um because you have the likes of facebook  Here is a 50 google share e-marketer. This is as of uh, june 2019  The combined us market share of the two giants  Will fall for the first time in 2018 shrinking to 56.8. So no, it's not that bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and then throw in amazon though. It's gonna end up being amazon is is late to the party

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's gonna grow like crazy. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's it's advertising business. How much is it? We I mean, there's got to be trillions, right? It's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trillions is a lot of money  I don't know  It's a lot of billion here a billion there at all. It's gonna eventually be  I was talking in rubles. Excuse me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so amazon's ad residence grew by 40 percent in 2019  Its ad revenue surpassed this is quarterly  So surpassed four billion for the first time in the fourth quarter, so if you just quick 16 billion a year  So it's youtube

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's heading toward youtube sized. Yeah  The so it's it's a force but it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Worldwide global digital ads spend 333 billion a third of a trillion

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doesn't get you there that doesn't work. No, you're not off the hook  Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay, 33 billion though, it's a significant amount of money it is but 56 percent of that not bad i'd take it  But it's not dominant that's not monopoly size. Yeah, that's two of them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, don't you you also have to look though at its market power. So  Yeah, like in terms of reach  like  And I don't know like how they wanted how they want to do this. I mean there's i'm familiar with like the cellular the cellular carrier  Rubrics that they use but I have no idea for digital advertising because boring so boring. Here's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the argument the wall street journal puts forward google's ad tech business consists of software used to buy and  Sell ads on sites across the web the company owns the dominant tool  Dominance an interesting word here if they don't have you know more than half of the market the dominant tool at every link in the complex  Chain between online publishers and advertisers giving it unique power over the monetization of digital content

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that fair? Jeff? Is that a fair characterization? Yeah, I think I think that they have they have well the word dominant has very specific  legal  Language, I know from having worked for newspaper companies where we were instructed never to use that word  Never never never never in any context. You can't say that this team dominated that team. No, don't say dominant  Um because we used to be right long long back in the past. Yeah  Uh, so yeah dominant has a very specific legal meaning  So I don't know that I don't know what that legal meaning is and whether it meets that is it huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, just about to ask if it's only a third. It doesn't sound like it would be dominant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, maybe you can be dominant just by being the the number one in the market, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well remember that one of the classic antitrust prosecutions was  motion picture companies and who owned the theaters they owned both the production and the  the distribution distribution and the and  whether they had a hundred percent of that or not that was considered a  a monopolistic combination they were forced to divest the movie theaters because  If you own all the distribution, right if you want both sides of the equation  It's pretty hard to get a foot in there. And so in a way, uh, I mean it sounds like what the doj is most concerned about  Is the fact that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google owns both sides of the both buying and so i'll read you what google search gave me from a site  I've never heard of called but it's in their little box  So I think it's must be a building called getting the deal through definition of dominance  It can be proven either through direct evidence of actual price increases  Or the exclusion of competitors or more typically through indirect evidence of high market shares plus barriers to entry a share  Of below 50 percent generally is not enough to support the inference of monopoly power. Okay, there you go. Well, that's not so they're below 50

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  percent  Well, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Going down in plus you have to separate  Because let's look at the at the piece of the business right there's search advertising on google  There's there's google advertising on the sites  There's double click and other ad serving things  There's uh youtube advertising those are separate lines of business with different competitors in each

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not enough to be dominant. You have to abuse your dominant position  So it's okay to be dominant as long as you are not messing with pricing  Is kind of is actually right? But stacy here's the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not dominant. You're not dominant. Can you abuse the abuse? Isn't the abuse getting into new markets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is uh, I was always the abuses in setting prices in the market existing and keeping players out and right and keeping competitors

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey, can you can you be can you abuse without being dominant?  is dominance the  the  the maybe that's what they're being accused of if you can exclude

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even if you're not dominant, but you can exclude competitors. Yes, you can be that's what's interesting here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that might be what you have is what's that? What's that damn site? I hate that  um like  Restaurant reviews and all that the guy whines all the time about google yelp yelp is one of the worst sites there is  Yelp constantly complains that google keeps them out now google  Includes yelp with them. They don't want to be included and then go back and forth and there but yelp is the one who's yelping

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  About this all the time. Well, that's why at the very beginning I said  There are you know, of course you do ask the competitors because that's where the evidence comes from at the same time  You also have a lot of companies who would just love to be in google's position and they you know, you use  The journal is quoting these tiny little companies. I've never heard of said that do ad sales

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Saying yeah, plus the journal itself and the journal is a competitor here. Yeah, keep in mind something  The wall street journal and the new york times have essentially given up on the ad business  What they're milking it for what they can  Is it they've got advertising revenue subscription subscription revenue subscription is their primary business now  They've basically given up and that's been that way for a while though, right? Yeah, but they're blaming google  Well, no google offered a better deal different  Different situation. So now it's just our greats aside from

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  antitrust  aside from financial markets

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys what?  I am reading the sherman trust act the sherman antitrust act. It's about time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um  Because you are dominant in the u.s

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, this is this is a legal site discussing that it's got the law and then the  Discussion of the law. Uh, the u.s law does not recognize the concept of relative dominance  So we are not interested in who's dominant or not apparently according to this  so  That's shocking and I know I was just on the euro

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The purpose of the sherman act is not to protect competitors from harm from legitimately the successful businesses  Nor to prevent businesses from gaining honest profits from consumers  But rather to preserve a competitive marketplace to protect you protect consumers, which is different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it does say that attempted monopolization and conspiracy to monopolize claims do do not require a showing of monopoly power

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well conspiracy to  That that is that is true antitrust where you set that's that's six prices  With your competitors

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did always yeah  This is always enjoy this show because this is where we try to figure out what's going on in real time

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is where we get our law degrees in real time real time

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, we probably should get denise howell on here  Yeah, the purpose of the sherman the supreme court 1993 the purpose of the sherman act is not to protect businesses from the working of the market  It is to protect the public from the failure of the markets. Right? Right. That's well said. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unlike europe  Where  They are protecting other companies size alone gets you in trouble here. It has to be your impact

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They there it's against conduct which unfairly tends to destroy competition itself  bingo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, uh, yelp yelp will yelp about being yelped out of the yelping  um  by big big bad monster google, uh, but  I don't think so. Okay. So really then this hinges on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you have your monopoly or dominance but mostly monopoly?  Um through anti-competitive means right that's bad  But how did you get it? How did you use it?  Right. So but if you don't confusing if there's such a thing as an innocent monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure, you're just so good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyone buys you which really has been google the monopoly with a hard of hearing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The monopoly with a heart of gold

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a google that could be like a walmart. That could be a couple different things, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well walmart, I mean there's a lot of mom and pop shops. I'll argue that walmart unfairly and and hope depo kicks them out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is why it's hard though because it is hard. They kicked them out by beating them at their own game  I mean they did a better job to consumers benefit. Yeah, right  so I guess it would be more like and this may have also happened walmart saying to  You know peanut companies. Well, don't sell peanuts to anybody but me in this town or i'm not going to do business with you  And if they're so big that they can then  Control the market that way. Well, that's obviously wrong. Well, here's the argument is that is that ebay and amazon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once they get into that position, they're going to raise prices. Well, like, you know exactly but benedict evans  So, you know, he has this argument all the time on them people trying to say that amazon's a monopoly  He says by any number no way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is the concept of monopsony which is hot right now the idea that not that you are a monopoly buyer  That by by and that's apple's right now in front of the supreme court over this exact thing in the in the app store  If apple has a monopsony in the app store  That hurts everybody. So it's a it is complicated. I you know what?  You can't  Temptation is say well google's just too big and I think a lot of the complaint about big tech is just that they're well  They're too successful. They're just too big  I would say no, I would say demonstrate harm to to really make that case

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there is a challenge I think right now in demonstrating some of the harms inherent in this because  Like big tech  I think people say it's too big because it's really complicated to explain if you're a journalist you're like, ah, it's just too big  um, but there are  There are potential harms of these companies having all of this data on someone for example

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's pre-crime you can't I you can't prosecute something for potential harm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can see that coming and we can even see things happening today in terms of bias, but a lot of that is  So opaque we don't have the information like is google selling my data to my health insurance company  So they can make decisions on pricing. That's not something  That I can see that's not something the market can see yet  And we don't even know if it's happening, right?  so this is where the government's looking at this and saying there is a risk and I think there's a legitimate risk in things being

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Too big and in companies being too opaque but stacy that can come from small companies too. There was a  Clear view ai is it on the list? There was a company. Um  Uh that did like security stuff that was selling people's data. Yeah. Yes  A vast was it vast? Yeah, right a vast. Yeah a vast right so it's a tiny company by comparison  Pirates they are interesting name for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Antipiracy company antipiracy company

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, but but so so so you don't have to be big to do that, right?  What gets you mean with and you can still be stopped from doing it because it's wrong in other ways  So you don't need antitrust to protect bigness alone. I mean, that's the weird thing about america  We we're up for the little guy. We're up for growing. We're up for winning. Oh, no  Now you've won now you're too big. We're gonna cut you down to size. Uh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's well, and we do that. I mean that's human nature. We do it with hollywood celebrities, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's human nature look at regulation and deregulation  Yeah, and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you fair enough to quote shakira, uh, let's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly what she sounded

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's take a little break. I do want to talk about clear view ai. I want you to  Explain to me what's going on with that one  um, and then uh alphabets jigsaw has an interesting new program  That I think would be very useful if they let others use it  But first a word from our sponsor. Here's something very useful  I use and I encourage you all to use zappier. Do you know about zappier? Oh man  In iot, you know, we know this whole idea of boy  I would like my hue lights to come on when my when weather.com says it's sunset in the city  You need a little script to do that and really the way those scripts work is by connecting services, right?

You don't have to be a programmer  Uh, it it's really easy to do I should show you some of my zaps even I can figure it out  Do you use zappier? I do use zappier. I want in effect increasingly i'm looking for  Things that integrate with zappier because I realize the value of the automations  One of the things that makes zappier unique is they do multi-step zaps  So as an example, I use my news reader is inno reader  That's got an integration on zappier when I favorite an article in my news reader  That's all I have to do. I put a star in it  It automatically books marks the article on pin board and then because it's a multi-step zap. I'm not done it then  Posts it to twitter. I have a links for twitter account  So it tweets it out it then because i'm not done it has multi-step zaps it then  Takes uh and puts it in a google drive spreadsheet  For karsten so he could put the shows together and it formats it just right it works perfectly  I could choose which fields it's just an amazing tool. That's zappier at work. If you're in sales, imagine  You know you you make a you make a deal you can you can engage your leads instantly  You can automatically import new customers  You can notify your team about opportunities and because zappier integrates with all the crm programs  We we started using it because we use salesforce boom. It's so in fact  It's a real reason to use salesforce. That's what I say. I mean I look and I say oh good  It works with instagram. Okay, good. Oh good. It works with google sheets. Okay, good wordpress  Good when you look at all the things it works with that list is huge  Is you realize this is this is this is what i've been looking for build a solution you need in minutes  And the thing is if you know it can be automated  Take a couple of seconds. You see any do that's my to-do list. I love it that that integrates in it's so cool  I don't have to manually add something to the to-do list. I can add I can add it in a variety of different  ways using zappier  No more doing things over and over again just because it's too much trouble to figure it out  Zappier makes it easy if you go to zappier z-a-p-i-e-r.com slash twig  Connect the apps you use the most let zappier take it from there  No need for developers no coding you can do it four and a half million people use zappier. That's a huge number  And I love this stat  On average though each one of them saves 40 hours a month an entire work week  40 hours a month that zappier is doing it and you don't have to  Make more time to grow your business to have more fun to turn your lights off and on at sunset right now through the end  Of the month try zappier free  For two whole weeks go to zappier.com slash twig z-a-p-i-e-r.com  slash twig free 14 day trial such a great tool  I'm i'm really grateful zappier exists. I honestly am there's a free forever plan. There's a premium plan  I have like the I think they call it the starter plan that has that gives me enough zaps. Although I have to say  You should see the list of zaps. It's getting longer all the time  zappier.com slash  twig  So tell me about this this story keeps getting thicker and scarier all the time clearview  Dot ai it's a peter teal company  Sells face recognition. Yeah right there, right? That's all I have to say  It sells face recognition data  to  A lot of people including law enforcement  And it's a big story  Because they've been scraping  Data in fact youtube just said knock it off clearview  They've been scraping data from facebook from instagram  from clearview here's cashmere hills article this kind of  Broke the story open and it's just it's been getting deeper and deeper and deeper  They they claim their database is three billion images  Scraped from facebook youtube venmo  Millions of other websites. It is bigger than anything the government has isn't this what the linkedin decision enables  Yeah, that's interesting. Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did we talk about careful what you wish for you? We did we mentioned well, we mentioned that  Okay, yeah in in re the new york times story about this kind of scraping  But there's a lot of scraping going on and scraping, you know as a journalist could be so good. Yes as a journalist  Scraping we want scraping  Take data figure out what it means add it all up. It's good stuff, but well, this is okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's where jeff you and I are about to diverge. Yay scraping. Yay taking data

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey don't don't lose this magical moment  Right now in america, we need to come together more not diverge

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need to make laws for preventing you from doing crazy things with that data  So a good law would be to prevent the police from using  widespread non like fishing expeditions using facial recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We we've talked about

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that is something that jeff jeff is for jeff is for he's pulling an antsy pelosi

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just had to do it for the sake of doing it. I have the paper here ready for this stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for  Things that punish people who do things

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I agree but but but but but but but i'm saying the facial like rules around stopping facial recognition  Would be good here and that's gonna stop police from doing any facial recognition. I'm gonna stop them from doing bad facial recognition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna stop them from doing without a warrant a oh, okay. We agree then

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I put a camera up and i'm searching for a  Felon walking down the street what i'm gonna observe a warrant on everybody walk down the street. You're in the public  You have no you don't have a right to privacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm i'm  The data is sitting there  But you can't access the data unless you have a warrant to get to it. You can't just fish in the data  That's what stacey's saying. I think right you can search someone's apartment with a warrant without their permission

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you say it would be okay to turn like the metropolitan police are doing in london to turn on face recognition  On the cameras if you went to a judge and say judge we expect  A criminal to walk through this intersection or we know one did we weren't trying to find okay  We're trying to find you need to yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You need to define a time frame you needed to find a locale  And a goal and you need to get it and yes and the goal and you need to get a judge to say  Yeah, that's cool. And so to get a warrant too. You have to show probable cause

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what you don't like is the fishing expedition where you just go  Let's watch everybody going up and down the street and see if we could find anything, you know, get a bad guy  Right, right. We agree stacy's but wait a minute doesn't a police officer who's standing on the corner  Do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree, but that the argument is is that police officer? She doesn't scale the way data do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the the wait a minute now, let me get this straight because I want to get your logic straight  So the crime here is not the act. It's the fact that you scaled  Does the fear people have well fear is different than the crime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fear that people have is if you have well and facial recognition is different than are you talking about recognizing someone?  Digitally who's committing a crime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If a police officer is on a corner and happens to know maybe maybe she's read the mug book this in the morning and right  Sure, she knows and she's keeping an eye out and she recognizes you walk down the street. She said hey you stop  And arrest you because you're okay. If you're if you're someone who's an outstanding warrant

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You you are a person of interest you have but she didn't get a warrant first

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She didn't get a didn't get a warrant to search the database  No, she's just looking around the street because you're in public. So you're doing it. That's same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So leo you're trying to get discord here  I will agree with you and I do agree with you that the doctrine of what is public is public would stop the stacy doctrine  But stacy's been trying to get kind of a temporary until we know what we're doing argument here  And what i've objected to is this idea you turn off all facial recognition and don't allow it from police  I think that would be wrong  You put strictures on their use of it. I think that's you can do that with any police

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  training, but also  Limit the power of people that don't necessarily need all of that power. Yeah, you know, there's a there's a there's a fine line there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think because it scales so much and because our justice system is not exactly just I think there's a  big and important interest in saying  Let's make police work a little harder  And pick crimes that really matter  to find these people because it could be that you know  I saw somebody shoplifting or like somebody was shoplifting and I have a good image of them  I might go after that person simply because the image is  higher quality I might go after them because I  Think that they look like they're not able capable of defending themselves, so they'd be an easy grab  There's there's a lot of decisions when you have when you can apply things at scale that you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what about what do you think of the illinois biometric information privacy act?  facebook, uh  This couple of weeks ago got a half billion dollar  fine  For I was I was I liked it suggestions on facebook, you know when you  When you take a picture of facebook put up there and then you could say this looks like this is and and in illinois  That is apparently illegal

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's a public place. You know again, you don't put up things on facebook to hide them  That would be the worst thing on earth to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, but people take pictures of you without your consent in private places put them on facebook and then  they're tagged

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Person you have a problem with is the one who put the photo up there not necessarily in facebook under 230, but this doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This this I I actually agree with the settlement  I think the way that this is playing out and I think these are important debates we need to have  You know, I just think we should talk about them as opposed to having facebook unilaterally decide for us  but  I may have a problem with the person who took the picture and post and tagged it  But I also have a problem with facebook that makes it visible and findable in a way that hasn't been  Okay, but let me give you another one stacy i'm not well versed on facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it it seems like if you were to tag me in an image, I would get a notification  Should I have the ability to hit approve or not approve you do before it goes out now you do at beginnings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You didn't okay?  Here's another

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So ant is on a photo assignment for the for for the san francisco chronicle  He takes pictures of people in crowds puts the photos up for all the world to see we as journalists would not want anything to stop  that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right nbc though used to in their  standards and practices  Binder that they handed out to all of us say sure you studied religiously I did because I was very fascinated by what they wouldn't allow us  to do  They said, uh, you gotta get a release for every even in public for everybody you show in video  And and and by the way, yes, but no  Well, that's the funny thing. They said I said well, what if his back is turned? I can't they said if his mother would recognize him  You have to get a release

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that because you were entertainment not news? No, it's the news division

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, even for news like in the video you can't show videos of people without a release form when you don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can just very nervous lawyers, it's legal companies stop you from doing it but 20 even 20 years ago this is 20 years ago

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't want you to do that. That's nervous corporate lawyers, but I also

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I also think that the again we're gonna i'm gonna go back to scale. I think it's a lot more  Problematic to have facial recognition saying that this photo of someone in this crowd. That's stacey  In annotating that for everyone to see is very different than someone happening across that photo in the san francisco  Chronicle that's different and seeing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A huge audience one day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it doesn't have a global audience and that audience isn't going to have access to that picture for the next  New york times or life magazine? So new york times or life I would say  Still not going to have searchable access to that for the next 50 years  A much larger audience than any anything on facebook. It does but you can't find that by looking for me specifically

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Someone might happen across it. You're into an entirely new area here that the law I don't think addresses now  This is your point that we discussed this. That's why I think we need to talk about it out there now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, and I think there's there's big implications of having these searchable over the entire world forever  that we like  Facebook is taking advantage and lots of companies are taking advantage of the fact that the current  The current society doesn't really understand the implications. We're just starting to understand the implications of this  But you can never escape. I mean in some ways that's like what uh do not track  But that's a very clumsy way of doing it  And I think if we talked about it and figure this out for facial recognition  We have a better chance of crafting rules  That would not force us to do something clumsy like do not track  So illinois is the only state or do not search whatever, you know what i'm talking about right jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think so. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Texas has a biometrics law, too. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Um, oh illinois is the only law that allows  Uh you to sue  Oh, there you go  So, uh, that's what this was. This was a class action based on the illinois

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Uh law that release you're talking about from your former nbc days reminds me a lot of the stock photography  Sites that pretty much say the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trying to upload not legally required just prudent

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's also like a polite thing to do. Yeah  It's polite. I mean as it as a journalist I will say that sometimes  You know you have to say screw it  I'm gonna be a rude jerk because I am a journalist and I have a higher  You know, I have a duty a higher duty, right?  But for normal people and in cases where it's not a public interest. I think you should not be a jerk  No, I agree full stop. Is it also what about children?  What about the children? No, sorry. I'm like do we have rules and I don't know protecting like imagery of  Miners miners

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've always seen with well if you're  I don't think there's rules if you're in a school, you know, as you said you don't sign the releases but that's because um  That's a different purpose that's marketing purpose the school was take pictures and put them out there on the website  That is a marketing purpose whatever image if it's marketing  You may not use my image unless you have my permission  Right that's different from news

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My daughter was in the news

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what my my boys former school did and that's also again what the stock photography sites will tell you is once you have  People that are under 18  We urge you to get a form signed  By their you know guardian or what have you because this is still marketing material that you're trying to produce for  Whatever content creator out there with your art as I wrote in public parts

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A book no one bought because it was optimistic  Because I gave it to you  It started with a case of a woman's face being on a the side of a flower barrel  As an advertisement and she did not give her permission for that  And so this this doctrine of privacy starts from a marketing use of the right you have to your image  but that's superseded by the right to  Report on what's public and and and that's different depends upon the use

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It and and correct me if i'm wrong, but it is absolutely the case of the united states  You do not have any expectation of privacy in public somebody can take your picture. No, you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why upskirt photos were like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Legal in so many places and still the laws well like I do note that it says within legal community legal  community standards you can't  There are some restrictions on  How far you can go with that?  But anyway that will that may vary per by um, yeah

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Yeah  Or or things just don't match up right if you look at if you pixel peep you can kind of tell  Uh, and this can also be used for deep fakes  I assume that's what it's built for right? Well, there's deep fakes and then there's shallow fakes. I don't know there's  Deep fakes, I always think of deep fakes as video and and then but there's plenty of modified still images as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, we figured out photo. I mean photoshop from the I remember scaring editors to death at the daily news when I was doing  crude photoshop saying  This is what you can do  Uh, here's a question, but here's here's a reason so there was a picture of ben carson  Sitting on a plane. I guess back from from somewhere. Iowa  everybody with their red mega hats on and  Uh, i'll put it on the uh, was that a fake? I saw that picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That they would all be wearing those hats  No, no, no, it wasn't no

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But someone could easily craft that smart ass because someone could easily craft it just like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where's the you put the link where where'd you put it? I put it in the in the rundown chat  Oh the rundown chat so but he looks like he's photoshopped in there  So people were guessing that he was photoshopped just like we put an african-american on this plane  Um  See, I didn't that's totally phony looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That totally looks funny. He could just be sitting on someone's lap. She looks like he's in first class. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, he was in first class, of course

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, but again all of this stuff you have to look at it really really close and and yep  And not just jump on the bandwagon with whatever everybody's saying because in our christmas card

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We photoshopped two people in everybody says I was photoshopped and you were there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like did you get photoshopped in and I'm like no

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Literally the people who were photoshopped look real and the people who weren't didn't all right  So you gotta you can't always just look at it  This guy's neck doesn't match his collar, I mean the whole thing's made up

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's beautiful

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What no this guy right here does that look normal which one which this guy I don't know how to zoom  I need a photoshop zoom. Let's let's control plus  There we go, okay, it's not his head  That's somebody somebody else's head on a body  And this guy's hat that's clearly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is the wrong size hat. He does have a large head the girl behind him is wearing his hat. Oh, they should swap  Hats

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was clearly a bad I don't think ben carson is in this photo, I mean I really don't that does look very phony

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what we're doing looks like a bad photoshop people are asking this question now. Yeah now you do that's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right. I'm gonna wait a minute. Let me pull up the christmas card. The christmas card is pretty funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know how many times I got asked about that. They thought they thought you weren't uh, it was like did you get photoshopped in?  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's on a tablet or a computer screen. It's like take the photo. Is that why she had to be?  There were two people who weren't here. Uh, I think my son wasn't here either.

He runs  You did a good job, but but I swear to god bill  It definitely looks like it was photoshopped in and he was not. Mm-hmm. So anyway  Just it's a good card. It was a great you looked like you belong there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought so but you're the only yeah more people started looking at it and mentioning it to me  I'm like, well, maybe I do look giant size in this. I don't know. That's how big you are  You are that big

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how normal  Uh  Let's say what do you want to do next you want to talk about something you want to do a break  What do you want to do next? Um, let's do a break. Uh break says mr. Bondi  Let's do your director bondi wants to talk about  Yeah, well, let's do a few more stories and we'll do a break. I want to hear what you have to say  I know you've talked about we were gonna listen to carston. Go ahead. No, we're never gonna listen to carston  He's photoshopped in he doesn't even he's not even here  He's not even looking at the camera. How about this guy who put 99  android phones in a  Little red wagon so much and pulled it and pulled it around the street  Uh, i'm so proud of him to make google maps say there's a traffic jam here, even though there's nobody there  And in fact, that's awesome already started collecting  Phones. Yeah, you're gonna do it. My sons want to it's a great idea. These phones are all running google maps  That's awesome  Uh came in the system. He's a performance artist. It's not it wasn't you know, google said well  We haven't we have figured out how to tell a car from bicyclists, but not yet a little red wagon  There's a clever it was a clever idea it was very clever. Yeah, I know those streets too. Those are busy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know those streets. Well, I'm walking so that's the question  There's nobody on these streets

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it because people are avoiding them because they have one of the upper left in that picture that one right there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not a very busy street oddly. Yeah, it's behind ultra-demand  But but I think uh, but yeah that the one on the right is busy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the things that if a car went by  While he was pulling the wagon at normal speed the map would instantly revert to green saying oh, there's no traffic jam here  So they really were trying to you know figure out  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whether this basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, yeah, I I appreciate the thinking behind it  I mean it basically artists and hackers are the people you should look to to figure out how things can be gamed right to break stuff and  It's it's very fun. It's smart and  If you did this in a car, would it make much of a difference? That'd be kind of the next fun thing to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would try it because of mouth power versus walking

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said stacey that's interesting. Then you then you give yourself a a good commute  Uh, possibly I don't know that's oh  so  so so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ways cheaters, oh, but you would have to know because it would actually limit you to exactly how fast you're driving

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd have to take turns. So you need to hire somebody ahead if you're really rich  If you're michael bloomberg you hire someone five minutes ahead of you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe two minutes, but they wouldn't stay. Yeah  Yeah  Yeah, this is this is um, this is like one of those math problems  Make this happen. Well, the other problem i've wondered about so let's say that leave in pennsylvania exactly at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everyone uses ways. Let's say we reach that that nirvana  Everybody uses ways then ways can't direct everybody the same place because ways will create traffic jams

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just read a paper on this on mathematicians solving traffic jams in one of the things. Yeah, I know  Um one of the things they recommend they actually say that if everyone gets on the same  platform  then traffic people the  transportation engineers and cities can actually  Help people by directing them  properly

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In real time, I would assume google smart that ways and google maps are already doing this  They don't take 5 000 people say all all of you go down that side street

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They must distribute I thought if they were an evil company they would sell priority

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I thought in the google verse they were they were siloed  You know that that ways is one thing and google maps is another thing and oh no, I think ways data is no  I didn't know that no, I don't think race now maps uses base data now. Yeah. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought they were still siloed. I presume that they share back to ways. I don't you can you can report stuff now on google maps  Yeah, right. I like google maps. I like google maps. I've never

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Been on the way talk about a snafu go

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google photos send strangers videos to other people in uh,  Man, that's when they were if you're doing a takeout, uh of your data  They the only reason we know is google actually sent out emails  Saying we're notifying people about a bug that may have affected users who used google takeout  To import export their google photos between november 21st  And 25th these users may have received either an incomplete archive or videos. It's not photos that were not theirs  We recommend my bad you delete the prior export at this time  Yeah, that's not a that's not a good thing. It's a but it's a bug  It sounds like the streams got crossed

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Somebody you you got somebody somebody got yours when i'm thinking about it like from a relational database standpoint  Yeah, you can see how that would happen. Yeah. Yeah, but not a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, right when you realize the data behind it could be really anything. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't you yeah, but you know what this is a little wake-up call for people who are putting  Compromising photos on the internet. That's right. Yes. It's compromising photos in the cloud. No comment. No, nobody anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I stopped

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's a foolish thing to do anything  Nice work  Anything, uh you post on the internet you shouldn't you should what was the rule that you should?  Say you shouldn't post anything on the internet. Well, or you wouldn't want your grandma to see  Of course, I have a pretty hep grandma  But no, I mean that that's could always happen that's a you know, it's happened other in other cases remember  Private photos on facebook were made public by accident including those of mr. Mark Zuckerberg  the boss the boss  I wonder what most people think about the internet  I wonder what mobile world congress is going to be like this year already. Lg has said we're not going because of the coronavirus  Uh zte is going they're going but we won't have a press conference, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right and the steps they're taking they actually are quarantining anyone who is going who plans to go  They're quarantining for two weeks before the event. So they know they're not sick good for them. They're trying to protect proactive attendees

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, no, we could talk about we talked about yesterday break weekly. It's an interesting  Uh conundrum, it's a it's a little bit of politics, but it's really more about  kind of an interesting uh conjunction of technology  And politics in in this case the iowa democratic party which simultaneously  Uh celebrated technology and said this is the greatest thing  We're going to use an app to count the caucus this year  Which means we can make it even more complicated and have multiple numbers, but it'll be faster more reliable and then  Also a fear of technology  Which caused them to say but we aren't going to show anybody this app ahead of time  We're not going to vet it. We don't want anybody to hack it  So they released it, you know, they effectively  Gazed showed it to people only a few weeks before it was to be used  And didn't give training to the precinct captains until a few days and it never before the election  Didn't hard test it with data never tested it. It never worked  Um, and at the same time they had such faith in technology that they shut down the uh, the manual reporting system  They said oh, you know, we can use that phone number for something else the whole thing. Oh, I didn't know that well  What the keep your backup they use the same phone number for app tech support and reporting and because the app  Because the app didn't really work  Oh  There were people calling from both ends and not nearly enough people to answer it was chaotic  And and here we are two days later still or at least yeah two days later still counting the votes 86

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According about recruiting and football and the real and there's  You're probably smart  You're probably smart. You're certainly that's why he's so mellow butter statues. Um, there's a lot of evidence  That it wasn't so much the app as I think the iowa democratic committee  That didn't because of their fears and misunderstandings and also techno optimism didn't  Really do the right anybody who was putting out something like this would have in the normal course of vince did a lot of testing  And there was also data when they got the data into the main

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh into the back end as I as I heard  Somethings were anomalous there. So that's what that's what freaked them out  They didn't know how good the data was going to be. I will also add this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and ed felton who is a  brilliant  cryptographer and expert on election systems at princeton  Uh, he has done a lot too. He was one of the first people to break the the diebold systems  um, he uh said but  They did do something right. They had a paper trail every single vote in the iowa caucus was recorded on paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And why don't ever they faxed it in by now faxed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you pay but when you deal with paper, especially in such a whacked out, I mean, well there were 1600 plus  Yeah, you got to count all of that. Yeah, yeah and double count it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's the numbers we're getting I think come from the paper  So and that's good  That is an important lesson  Also, if you are going to use electronic voting systems of any kind you always have to make sure there's a paper backup

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To validate and in case they fail to probably a good thing this happened because I think it'll people who are ignoring this and I  Used to ignore it. I used to say oh come on. It's fine. We can figure this out  I i've long since gotten it, but I think this will scare people enough  To think yeah paper back out backups. Yeah, new york is new york times. Uh charlie wartsle

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know what it is because i'm a baker myself  Oh, that's what it is. She's gotta get the load the buns out of the oven. Oh, okay  um  Should we what should we do? You know what? I'll do uh, this is a good time to talk about last pass  All right, and then uh when stacy's buns get back  From last past studios from the beautiful  Yes  Last past studios. Yes in beautiful downtown pedal  Pedal actually we're really now kind of I know east side out of town  we're out by the  The railroad tracks run the we're next to the railroad tracks  Uh last pass is a must-have utility not just for individuals but for businesses as well. Did you know?  Man this uh, this just came out in a uh in a  Study the global password security report that on average employees reuse passwords  13 times  That's the average not surprised and of course, you know, it's a terrible password when you're reusing it. It's terrible  It's still gonna be your mother's maiden name your dog's  initials in your birthday or something a color a color  Monkey one two three and then to add insult to injury you reuse it  I don't have to tell you it's not a good idea to do that  Right, you don't when you use a password more than once that makes you vulnerable if if one of those 13 sites gets breached  All of them will end up getting hacked because now the password is is known  So 47 000 businesses use last pass one of the reasons I really love last pass. It has a little security score  You can run it on your password vault. One of the things it looks at is password reuse  Weak passwords things like that the average score of businesses using last pass  49 which is not good  Not good and that mostly is because of password reuse  Last pass is the solution. I think we can get that number up to 80 or 90 percent. I know I have  Simply by running it and then saying okay  Let me fix the bad passwords and last pass actually walks you through that process. It helps you do it  And the reason it works is because it generates long strong completely unmemorable passwords  You don't expect to remember it  You remember one password the password that gets you into your last pass vault  By the way, if you're in business you have over a hundred different  Customizable policies one of the policies, you know the same when you got took a job here  You get access to the vault but you have to use second two factor, right?  We required that we also have minimum requirements for your password. So it's a strong password  You still have to memorize that but after that everything else is stored in last pass. It's so secure  It's not unencrypted anywhere except on your device last pass doesn't have access to it. I don't have access to it  No one does just you mac windows ios android. I use it on linux too  It has plugins for every browser chrome extension. I love extension. Yep  And one of and those policies mean that you can as the it guy or gal at your company you can make sure  That people keep it secure  I use a ubiqui so you can have the two factor be an authenticator  It supports duo security. It supports ubiqui supports a lot of different two factors. I love having the ubiqui and last pass enterprise now has even more  Factors, they call it multi-factor mfa using things like your ip address and geolocation to make sure that that employee using that  Database your business accounts your what websites?  That's really the person they say they are authentication is what it's all about  and yet  They also make it easy. This is something that's normally very hard to do to be both secure and convenient  single sign-on they have over 1200 sso  Sammel apps and a single sign-on portal, which means it's for your employees  It's as easy as tapping a button on the phone and they're in no password at all  But it's more secure for you and that is kind of the holy grail  of  passwords  I love last pass. It's so secure. It's so safe. I keep my passport in there my driver's license my social security numbers everything's  That's if in my whole life  I have a variety of different solutions some encrypted some not  But where I the one I trust the most where I put my most valuable data  Like my passport isn't my last pass fault. That's my secure enclave everywhere. I go  and just to make sure you feel comfortable with this they  Continuously engage trusted world-class third-party security firms for routine audits  They're constantly being audited testing the service testing the infrastructure  Steve gibson even did that he got access to everything thanks to the creator of last pass joe segress  He did his own audit. He was satisfied. He uses last pass. That's good enough for me  But these third parties are making sure that last pass is the the gold standard for security  So many great features of last pass. Here's what you need to do both in business at home  Go to last pass.com slash twit  It's the first thing I put on any new device  If you look at my system setup scripts first thing last pass goes on there because that's how I get my stuff  That's how I secure my stuff. That's how you should secure your business. So easy. Even your kids can use it  Do you have your kids using last pass? Wow, that is good. I set my mom up with last pass.

That's a little louder than normal, right?  So those are some of the use cases. I've also seen it like in hospital settings for  you know, uh  Uh  Like where things are located in the body, um wayfinding is kind of a fun one anatomy.

Um, I can remember  being in a  manufacturing booth or something like that and it was just beautiful because you have  Different parts and you have a go and you have a no-go part far as the manufacturing chain  And it was just easy for that overlay to to let them differentiate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't this I I didn't put this up there. I didn't understand it fully  It sounds like it's a little bit different from sideloading things  Oh  But I didn't quite get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that mean they're gonna roll it out more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it was 2014 google was yeah google was paying twice as much for video rights  So this is one way to make fiber more profitable is stop buying content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes sense, I mean you don't really need to offer video con  I mean the people who are buying fiber are probably not like  Don't bundle my stuff man

There's so much information in these cards. It isn't captured in a digital  Really card catalog and I think it's probably the same as look at the look at the police officer's uh,  Log from 9 11.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know you know, no, you don't need to feel bad. I know I had one last week  I feel bad because like i've just been having it's not your fault, man  But i'm i'm just warning you that like in 10 minutes or so i'm done

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're done. We're done here  Stacey, what's your have we talked about yubi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened to you? Please talk about it the open sourcing of the yubi key. Oh finally

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I mean, I thought that was big for companies. It's huge

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're big fans of yubi key and uh  I actually went out and bought there's a german company sells an open source  Security key, it's not nearly as good as yubi key. It was like clunky. I don't like it  So I went back to my yubi key  But but that was always one of the complaints about yubi key is well, what are they really doing?  We don't know because they're not open source. So they're going to open source. That's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can buy them in bulk. I thought it was google was going to open source. It's not google is opening source  It's stuff and yubi key is going  Yes, and yubi key is going to  You put it on their stuff or on the yubi keys and then you can buy them in bulk

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's several things. I have 30 pounds of yubi keys  Well, no if you're a big company, so this is the uh, google launches an open source security key project open  Sk  Uh, this is absolutely something that needs to be done. It's oh, maybe there's two different stories. Yeah. This is fido  and utf  and  absolutely it is  I think maybe not a massive cause for concern, but it's certainly something to be aware of I don't like using closed source security software  I I strongly recommend it against using closed source crypto, right?  And so I would like the absolutely yubi keys to be open source. This does not  uh open source yubi key, but maybe  If there is a standard  Yubi key might adopt it. It looks like google has designed this to work on a nordic tangle  If I know many guys with a nordic tangle, but uh,  I don't know if this will work on an existing nordic tangle if you'll have to get a new tangle  so  Apparently a nordic tangle is a small uncased board with a usb connector on it  I'm i'm baffled by all of this  so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, it was two stories. It's two separate stories. Now. What's the yubi key story? So  You but ubico the company behind yubi key is doing a subscription service that lets you buy and manage them in bulk  So it puts it in competition with yeah rsa's  Things

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a big fan of yubi keys and that's what I use  It's not i'm not knocking the yubi key. In fact, there's an ask the tech guy where we talked about yubi key and of course I carry  a yubi key on my keychain and I have  One of the nice things about using a hardware dongle like this is you can use multiple ones  I have three authenticated one. I keep  On my keychain the other two I keep in a secure location a secure unrevealed location. Where is it my island?  Under the vice president of the volcano volcano the volcano island  Where there are no snafu's, uh, if you don't have a nordic dongle, this is the way to go  Uh, okay there we did both stories. You can buy yubi key in bulk  Uh, which you you know what we should you know what let's do that  Let's just let's get everybody in this building a yubi key. I think that would be a good idea. I'm I think  Hardware key are better. They're better can't hurt. Yeah, and the phone as um key

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your favorite? That's all right. Nothing wrong with that. It's better than nothing, but you know, it's not the best

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stacey Higginbotham your thing of the week  Of the week I have two two things

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm crazy. One is kamekt. I wrote about it. It's c-a-m-e-c-t. That's my favorite, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  ancient egyptian grain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it I don't know  This is this is a hub for  Connecting bringing in all of your old ip video cameras. Oh, yeah, I said, oh you're thinking okay  Yeah, no, it's a c not a k  Um, oh, there you go kamekt  So it works with all of your existing old ip video cameras  So like all the I can never even all of the chinese stuff that are  Dawas or whatever all of those it also works with nest arlo wise  Um, and it pulls everything into one  device  The idea is it gives you remote access without punching a hole in your firewall  So for the older cameras, that's important. It brings all the feeds into one place and then it's all stored locally  there is  I think they can recognize 20 different things right now an ai that can detect, you know  Motion for it detects people it detects vehicles it detects bicycles  So and then it sends you the notifications based on that. So this is actually a really compelling product. So it's a hub  It's a hub  But it'll bring these old school cameras that are a pain to work with and kind of insecure  It'll put them you can bring them online and add intelligence to those

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they you need an audio version of this for your sonos. Yeah. How do you connect these cameras to the kamekt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, I think if they're they're ip cameras, so you it's using like rt

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our I can never

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could hook it up to a hard drive at home it comes with a terabyte

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got a terabyte and I think you can even extend it to another terabyte if you need it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So instead of putting your stuff on the nest cloud or the wise cloud or the arlo cloud you can put it right on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You keep it level and the ai is really compelling. Um, it can recognize I I was looking at somebody's copy of it  And it recognized a ups truck versus a fedex truck. Oh, that's good  Which is kind of a fun notification if you're like a business and you're like, oh the fedex guy is here today

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like this
