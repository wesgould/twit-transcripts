Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but but and I don't want to get into like political stuff because that's like something I don't really discuss in general  Neither do I but it's like this whole normalization of just being a twitter troll now. I mean, it's ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, brand brand twitter has has very much followed wendy's examples and and has become  very interesting place  For a very interesting sub segment of twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They realize they don't need to be polite anymore. They get more attention when they exactly mr. Jarvis

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis in your in your day when  Being printed, you know regularly do you do you remember seeing ads like this where a company would call out?  You know Wendy's would call out of McDonald's. Oh, you know buying an ad space like that in our market  We would say they sub tweeted that was sub tweet. Well, where's the beef? Yeah, but  What about just example?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  specific right brand which is what ants ask it they wouldn't say hey McDonald's where's the beef?  right  right  I don't think they would ever say it like that anyway

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff or Joey talking to us

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Like picturing the Wendy's Wendy, yeah saying that hey McDonald's was a beef, huh?  Where's the beef yeah you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We are these trolls but you're right Kevin  Exactly what I was thinking too is that it has normalized it for everybody companies are departments  And last week we did we did the story of the the the New Jersey Twitter feed the official nj.gov  Twitter feed which since then the New York Times did a big feature on them  I'm sure because they heard about it on on twig, of course  And and it's not as bad as Wendy's but it still has  SAS yeah that one being the primary one someone says  Who let New Jersey have a Twitter and?  New Jersey official account responded your mom

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny though, but I get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is funny, but it's yeah. Yeah, I don't like where all this is heading

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I had not considered the whole normalization of Twitter trolling. I mean, that's yeah, it's a really good point  It's a very very fair point

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should I go back to kovat 19 just because I just got my King County health recommendations  The guidance so the public the King County Public  Health board issued a thing just now saying for workplaces of businesses all employees should work from home if they are able  Employers should take steps to make it more feasible for their employees to work in ways that minimize close contact with large numbers of people  They should maximize telecommunication options  urgent place to stay home when they are sick and maximize flexibility and sick leave and  Consider staggering start and end times to reduce large numbers of people coming together at the same time  For schools do not cancel them unless there's been a confirmed case in the school  And if you are a caregiver of a child with an underlying health condition  You should consult with your health care provider whether or not they should stay home if they stay home. That's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh  Okay  So that's so that's going to trigger a lot of businesses to you know  It's gonna for not force them but very  Seriously encourages them to take a look at how their business is running to make changes that may oh and it is saying that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For event and community gathering considerations if you could feasibly avoid bringing large groups of people together consider postponing events and gatherings  So that does comic-con right there if you can't avoid bringing groups of people  Urge people are sick not to attend  Encourage those who are at higher risk for coronavirus not to attend try to find ways to give people more physical space  So they're not in close contract  clean surfaces and  encourage attendees to wash their heads

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  When is comic-con?  It's the 14th

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's okay. Everybody's behind the mask. It'll be fine. Actually comment. Sorry. It's the 13th. It's the 12th. It starts the 12th  And that's in Seattle it's in Seattle it's Emerald City Comic Con, I'm so sad  I'm glad we didn't post play it because my daughter and I were originally gonna go as people from the Dragon Prince

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sigh what's interesting about that? Stacey too is that is that?  You know like in Japan they shut down the schools. They didn't do anything. What about the parents? What do you do?  So in this case, they're kind of saying that well the parents are sure to be home

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true there's I mean cuz yeah it is  It's hard there's a couple things to think about right sometimes kids only get lunch and breakfast at school  So when you shut down the schools, you're shutting down their access to nutrition  Parents don't necessarily have a way to keep their job and have it keep an eye on their kid  I mean, these are these are things  Again, I'm good. I'm not trying to be political but there is a decided lack of  Any sort of safety net in our country that really makes this whole thing  Extra fraught for people who start with sick days. Yep

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People who are sick will have to show up to work to earn the money. Yep, and I kind of don't blame them  But they can't be cautious, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Talk about the the restaurant industry just as one example, right? Like that's an hourly industry  If you don't show up  Usually and many of the restaurant and most of the restaurants that I ever worked in in my restaurant career  You don't get paid if you don't show up. Nope  And so then if that's your livelihood and that's how you make your money and not going there means you don't make a paycheck  Then I imagine a lot of people choose to ultimately go there because they have to  Still want food, but they're also serving food. Oh man. It's just a messy situation  Sorry to bring it back  Oh

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Their story

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Astrophysicist gets magnets stuck up nose while inventing coronavirus device caught my attention  Hey  Shall I read it to you? Oh  It is an excellent story please  An  Australian astrophysicist has been admitted to the hospital after getting four magnets stuck up his nose in an attempt to  Invent a device that stops people touching their faces during the coronavirus outbreak. Dr. Daniel Reardon a research fellow at a Melbourne University  Was building a necklace that sounds an alarm on facial contact when the mishap occurred last Thursday night  The 27 year old astrophysicist who studies pulsars and gravitational waves  Says he was trying to liven up the boredom of self isolation with the four powerful  neodymium magnets  Stacy how powerful are those neodymium magnets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very very powerful rip your intestines here to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're really fun to play with but boy when you put them close to each other they go BAM  He says I have some electric electronic equipment  But really no experience or expertise in building circuits or things. I had a part that detects magnetic fields  I thought if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field and we wore magnets on our wrists  Then it could set off an alarm if you brought it too close to your face a bit of boredom in isolation  Made me think of that  However, the Guardian goes on the academic realized the electronic part he had did the opposite  And would only complete a circuit when there was no magnetic field present. I  Accidentally invented a necklace that buzzes continuously unless you move your hand close to your face. He said  So after scrapping that idea, I was still a bit bored playing with the magnets  It's the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears clothespins to your ears  I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril and things went downhill pretty quickly  Clipped the magnets to my other nostril  He said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils and two on the outside. I  Was hoping I could get through this when he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose  The two inside  stuck together  Unfortunately  The researcher then attempted to use his remaining magnets to remove them

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At this at this point having research having like called somebody and said what do you do where this happens?  I'll you use a magnet to get a magnet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay at this point my partner who works at a hospital was laughing at me  He said I was trying to pull them out  But there is a ridge at the bottom of my nose that you can't get past  After struggling for 20 minutes, I decided to Google the problem  There is his mistake right there and found an article about an 11 year old boy who had the same problem the solution  In that was more magnets to put on the outside to offset the pull from the ones inside  As I was pulling downwards to try and remove the magnets they clipped onto each other and I lost my grip  And those two magnets ended up in my left nostril while the other one was in my right at this point  I ran out of magnets

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably a good thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before attending the hospital reared and attempted to use pliers to pull them out

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they became magnetized by the magnets inside his nose

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time I brought the pliers to my nose

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My entire nose would shift towards the pliers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a little bit painful at this point he reports  My partner took me to the hospital that she works in because she wanted all her colleagues to laugh at me  The doctors thought it was quite funny making comments like this is an injury due to self isolation and boredom  At the hospital a team of two doctors applied an anesthetic spray and manually removed the magnets from Reardon's nose

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When they got the three out from the left nostril the last one fell down my throat he said

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could have been a bit of a problem if I swallowed a breathe in but I was thankfully able to lean forward and cough it out  Needless to say I am NOT going to play with the magnets anymore

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Is the greatest story

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is the greatest story is that so just a word of warning

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Kids don't try this at home

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These are the same injuries that small children have oh yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, and they're very serious because again if they swallow it will rip through your intestines. Oh, yeah, but but for a grown astrophysicist

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you should never let kids play with these super magnets they are really  Problematic here's a picture just just to complete the the story. Here's a picture  of his full humiliation of dr. Daniel Reardon in the hospital  After removal of the magnets from his I give him a lot of points for confessing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is one of the funniest stories I've ever and then also they have the medical discharge

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Summary denies further magnets

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Two hours ago had two neo dimium seven millimeter in diameter strong magnets up bilateral nostrils

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stuck to each other via septum bilaterally attempted removal tried using two other magnets up left  With three magnets up left nostril one up right all stuck together via septum denies difficulty breathing denies further magnets  Together via septum denies difficulty breathing denies further magnets  We needed that hey Jeff had a great interview by the way  With the Unabomber Nathan Aliback who is also as it turns out little known the voice of Stacom  No, he just has a very aggressive beard here. He's a wonderful guy. He's a nerds nerd. He was hired as their  Well, so he was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, doesn't it look a little fake the beard oh no, it's he was pulling on it, okay  So he was calls himself a nerd. He's a nerd. Yeah, so so and he's good company alabach that had been doing  Food marketing stuff and like three years ago  Stacom's came and said, you know, we're for old people like Jarvis  it's been around since the 70s when you know people like that eats cheese steaks at home and  and so they they he said let me take over the twitter account and give it a  You know kind of a voice that says gee even stacom says that  And a voice of pre-sanity. This is pre-covid. It's three years ago. This is three years  Yeah, so it along comes covid while every other advertiser is running away  And to hell with them putting no covid content on their forbidden list  They ran toward it  And he you know has this voice of sanity and reason  And science from a frozen meat product. He's also extremely honest in this saying hey folks  Don't forget. I'm a marketer trying to sell you frozen meat product  It's funny. It's ironic

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's great. We've talked about it before it's really one of the best brands  Uh in in the face of covid of anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I talked to him about a bunch of stuff  But but what I found fascinating which you guys will like is that is that he really understands social community  He goes in and he figures out, you know, he looks at at at  Uh librarian twitter twitter and media twitter and weird twitter and stan tritters of you know, k-pop  And he and he listens to them and he reads them and he sees what's missing and he knows how to enter in  He knows how to have a conversation he listens first  the reason I talked to him exactly because it struck me as  Instructional for my journalism students in social journalism  Yeah, and he really kind of gets that gospel of listening to people understanding with them empathizing with them  One of the interesting things about him is that he also his name is out there  He's nathan alabach and his twitter account is out there  So he can't really be himself because people are going to say oh, that's the steak. He's now stacom's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just like the comcast guy  Comcast frank comcast frank. Yeah, he kind of kind of made it hard for him, but he okay  I got a question  So in the days of comcast frank frank really did very well for comcast by making them appear to be responsive  To customer issues and complaints something they've since given up  But it was it was a moment in time when it really worked. Well, he was he was brilliant at it fast forward though  So  Does it matter if a brand is on twitter these days?  There's some ancillary coverage you get but most people normal people aren't on twitter  And even if you are on twitter, no matter what tweet it goes by right? It's not you have to be there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't i'm gonna disagree look at look at another brand look at look at what?  um  Taco bell my favorite. Yeah, but i'm on twitter and I don't see taco bell because I don't but it doesn't matter because your friends  We'll talk about it or the cool. You're not the cool kids, but the cool kids will talk about it  There's now a taco bell literary  Magazine, did we tell you about that? I think it's irrelevant. No  I think taco bell wait, I think it's taco bell quarterly. I think you're interested

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because no, no, you're interested in taco bell, but they don't think it means new customers

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Taco bell quarterly go there's there's do we read this last week? No, did we do this? No, go there taco bell quarterly.org  It has nothing to do with taco bell. This is fan  Fiction, right? This is people came up. So volume two has taco bell poetry and fiction

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And oh my god, jeff, this is where we can write our queso like fake exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the quesadilla requiem  Eating you your voice rings my heart a language turned into light waves traveling at a pace to crack one's soul is pretty crappy  And spitting at times and swallowing and brushing my bristled chin the light now flamenco's mirror to mirror until it becomes noise again bending  And loud and rhythmless. Okay. Well, never mind. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of this stuff withstanding does it sell more tacos?  um  Yeah, it engages the people who like you. I mean brands love this stuff. That's pretty okay. That's pretty obvious because  If you're already a fan  Then you're following taco bell or stacom or whatever and so you can talk about this and blah blah blah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just don't think it's it's but when I come along out of nowhere and I retweet  Stacom and somebody says what the age i've never what is what's what's what's going on?  They discover stacom is too that they'll go to the store and buy stacom. Yes  I have tons of friends because they want to reward it because it's so good who are buying now the problem here  Is that I would kill for it  My wife like you doesn't like your wife doesn't let you go to the store and she doesn't want me to have stacoms  So I can't get me stacom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Javelina with an open mouth a bighorn a wolf  bobcat bison caribou  You could just have a cow  Stacey took a nap  Jeff and aunt watched as long as they could and gave up  I had to do windows weekly. So I only saw the opening statements. We're talking about of course testimony today in front of the  uh house judiciary subcommittee on antitrust  by four of the  I don't know five or six big  Tech ceos from amazon jeff bezos first time he's ever testified in congress, which is kind of interesting  Mark zuckerberg who's been there before many times  Uh sundar pachai who's always been kind of a favorite of congress. I think he's always done very well there from google our own  our own ceo  And uh, he's not really our own ceo, but this is this week in google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we'll we'll own him or or as a republican congressman called him. Mr peach eye  Each eye or pichai

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How can you not how can you not know who's sundar pachai and how to say his name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just rude. That's poor briefing on the part of the staff. If mr peach eye, mr peach eye  And then finally, of course, uh tim apple from uh cook no tim cook from apple  Uh, and actually I have to say  Uh, I was listening. I was getting ready to come to work  So because it was delayed by like an hour and 15 minutes, which is frustrating  But then after all I do the same thing so  I guess I can't expect  So now I know how you all feel  Uh, I finally said look i'm taking a shower and of course as soon as I started got in the shower  They started so I was listening to all of them speak then I quickly wrapped myself in a towel  Because I wanted to run out in the living room lisa was watching liverman. I wanted this is a visual  I don't really want but go ahead. I wanted to see because  part of the theatrics of this  all four, uh ceos were on uh video cameras, I think web x they're all using web x right is that the  congressional choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have um web x has some security features. I think that might be why they're there. That would make sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some members of congress were there some were not the chairman of the house judiciary committee. Jerry nadler was not  but jim jordan was uh, and so was chicholini the uh,  Jordan's the ranking member chicholini is the chairman of the committee and um  I wanted to see the backgrounds of all four ceos because I thought this is going to be kind of telling you how they were dressed  Zuckerberg kind of had a loose tie looked like he looked like he got in some sun  But as one would expect with mark zuckerberg, it wasn't a tan

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's just very freckly nose and it kind of looked burnt. Well, of course everybody made fun of him because he put the zinc on his face  Yeah, he was surfing. Yeah, and now we know why everybody made fun of him for protecting himself  From sudden. Oh, that's the right thing to do. Thank you. Yes it is and uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so uh  He looked like he was at his martha's vineyard house  I don't know. It was like on the porch of his house with the  And then I was a little disappointed. I expected the richest man in the world to have something a little better  But jeff bezos just kind of had an office  With a credenza. That's why you're the richest man in the world. Yeah, he saves money. Well very famous  for years made by skype room

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rated um bezos and oh they did them all okay. Yep. You need to go

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, very famously for years amazon had desks made out of doors  on uh, sawhorses  I don't know if they still do but that was that was actually the  The big thing at the time. So I you're right. That's why he's rich  So here's let's see what room raiders very good. Let's see what room raider has to say  There's jeff bezos  Um, and you see it's just a credenza  Looks like it could have come from ikea

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not well a little more expensive than that, but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's kind of not a lot of effort put in dressing and I don't think that's a real place. That's probably a  I don't know nice. Nice use of the rule of thirds back off the soft focus says room raider add books. Remember books  Order a couple of ring lights. Here's one you gave it 4.5 stars six out of ten

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I had a feel like but I like that he's just slightly off center  I like I like the rule of thirds and even the fact that this isn't straight behind him

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is all I think I may be wrong very conscious  That the idea is to make it look like an executive in the office

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not not a stage set so or maybe it's his lawyer's office, but go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know  And a black suit black tie white shirt very nondescript  Didn't want to look too rich probably mark zuckerberg  Uh, as I said choose a blue or red tie anymore because that's now politicized. It's not saying something zuck is wearing a checked  A blue tie with a white shirt both zuck and bezos affecting the rich man's spread collar  which of course is a britishism that I find particularly annoying because  Anyone with taste wears a good preppy button down collar. Anyway, uh, he does look like it's all about how your face is  I'm just kidding  He does look like he's got some freckles  So he's been in getting some sun  His tie is loose not exactly tight  But he'd remember we kept him waiting an hour and in the green room and I don't get the background here  But honestly, it looks like he's on the porch of his nantucket summer home. It doesn't  It's an odd kind of background  And it says it's shiplap by the way  He's well lit. In fact, if you look in his eyes, you can see it may not be a ring light  But he's got some good lighting going on there  Hostage video says room raider putin has not released him but has allowed him to loosen his tie  That's nice two out of ten. That is as simple a background as you can get  Tim cook. Oh even worse  This looks like uh, there's some dying plants. He's in the lobby. Yeah, this is awful  There's those partitions, you know those cloth partitions. They used a dead noise. He looks like he's in borrowed  Somebody's cubicle  It's terrible  Uh, and and you can see in front of him and i'm not sure why  You can see a um, it looks like an ipad. I don't know a macintosh  No, it's I think it's an well, it's obviously an apple device  For his ipad tim wearing gray gray suit light gray tie  Kind of gray light gray shirt the off off white shirt was nice  It's nice not doing the spread collar, but it's still a little more spread than americans wear tim apple needs some work  Plants help but that wall needs a patch of art depth would help too  I think the plants look dying my favorite was and i'll be curious what room raider thinks. Yeah sundar pichai loved him  Loved him this very textural sculpture or painting behind him another credenza. I wondered if that was sound baffling

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks kind of like you know, you could buy a texture baffling

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And probably expensive sound baffling also serious dark suit dark time almost matching but a little bit lighter gray  And the least spread of all the colors  Uh, well tied. I feel like this actually might be his office. What do you think? I I feel like it almost might be no  He also has a plant room raider, of course loved him loved the texture great composition  The vase and plant are perfect strong nine out of ten. It would be ten out of ten with more color

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He should have stuck a google product the little

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, a google home right there home mini or something. Yeah, I always set that off nicely  But you know what none of these guys  In fact, one of the things they all said is hey, what are you talking about? None of us are dominant tim cook was famous  He said  We we apple is not dominant in any of the markets we participate in  We're a small part of any market we participate in. However, that's not our goal. We don't want to be dominant  We just want to make the best products which actually I think is sincere  Well, he's not dominant even an iphone. He's dominant in mindshare  But even in the united states where the iphone is the strongest it's only 50 percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's the well  The app store not the phone the app store and that is that is what they talked to a little bit about they kept him

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mostly on the sideline. It was from what I read in the play-by-play mostly sundar pachai who did a lot of  talking  Uh as as we already mentioned and expected  The republican members of congress were more interested  Even though this is the anti-trust committee were more interested in bias  the anti-conservative bias than they were in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And any interest because governing is hard and they want to don't want to do that. They just want to get all  Aggravated and get their talking point. I mean  What is even

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is interesting. I know I think that the bezos is  Bezos's shot was carefully contrived. Remember he's got the best people, right?

Transcript:  Scottish

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently though he's not he's not he's not doing it for any mean reason  What he's doing is he'll write the article in english and then look up each word in a scottish english dictionary  And just stick it in if it kind of sort of matches  But this is the sad part. He's responsible for one third of the scott's wikipedia entries  And probably nobody noticed till now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. You end up with something exactly. Yeah, you get the smoosh jesus  Yeah  On the reddit post it says the damage  Done by this may be more severe than anyone anticipates as a result quote  This person has possibly done more damage to the scott's language than anyone in history  Because of this cultural vandalism it's possible many people think think scott's is a horribly mangled rendering of english  Rather than a language of its own and for which I take some responsibility  as you should  Uh, so now they're debating what do we do if we close it it will never be reopened  Um, the guy was just trying to preserve scottish wikipedia. Oh god

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The answer is to solicit more people get more scott to get more people to more scottish people to actually participate because that's  Is the downside of not having enough participants in an open ecosystem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Um, it was apparently he was a teenager when he started doing it.

The honorable mr. Ant  Pruitt has the floor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um  My pick of the week is I want to say  Thank you to chad  and  I mean chad bozeman  The whole chad wit bozeman still throws me off because I didn't know him by that name. I always knew him as chad  I um wanted to put this out there because I know a lot of listeners  Um are from my hometown of anderson, south carolina  And I felt that I should I owe it to them to bring this up and just to share just a few minutes of this of  What I know about chad  um  Where I grew up the house that my mother  Built the land that she built it on  was owned by  some a bozeman family  so my neighbors were bozeman's  and  There were two sisters that lived there that had another brother named chad that he didn't live with them  But he would come by from time to time and we would all hang out together play basketball and just be  Teenagers, you know and just be kids and had a good time taught a lot of junk  had a lot of fun and  Chad was special  He was a hell of an athlete that went to another high school in the area. Not the same one that I went to  um  And just taught a lot of trash heck of a competitor really really good at the sports, you know  But beyond that he was an interesting kid because he wasn't like the rest of the kids that  You know, we all had the dreams and aspirations of going pro in this sport and going pro in that and whatever  But chad was different chad was into debate chad was into theater  and  he had the visions of of  Being able to go to college to get into theater and most people in that area didn't think that way  and  He  You get ridiculed when you talk like that depending on the area that you're from if you know what I mean  And so he continued to go on and I wasn't in touch with him much  but I was in touch with his sister because again she they lived next door to us and during this time of his passing I really feel  for her because she  Kept us abreast of his progress and let us know that what was going on with him  And I never really saw any of his his movies until  with him portraying  Jackie rommerson  But I heard about some of his stories of just being in new york and struggling just like all actors do  But he kept pushing forward and he also had the mission of saying you know what?  I actually want to make the story. I want to be in directing. I want to be in the writing the acting stuff just  Happened you know that wasn't even his main vision his main vision was to just make the story  And when he got that opportunity to jump into marvel  And believe be the black panther  He just took that opportunity and just just absolutely crushed it considering all the things that he dealt with growing up  Considering all the things that he was dealing with at the time  And it really resonated with me I never go to the movie theaters  I hate the movie theater experience the only time i've gone is for star wars and that was because of the connection I have  with my late father  But I did go see black panther  because of chad  And when I went to see black panther  It warmed my heart to see that  This man was a superhero  And in our area  Superheroes didn't look like chad and it looked like me they looked like this guy with a pompadour or just  There were no black superheroes like that  and to see  That he was able to bring that to life and my kids could see  You know, there are superheroes out there that looks like us  We can still go out there and strive to to do things beyond the basketball court and beyond the football field  We can go and write stories  We can go and make the story that we want to present and entertain millions around the world  And he put his guts into this. He was so serious about his craft  And he also wanted to make sure other people  Could prosper from his efforts as well. And I just wish that more people would could understand the backstory  Behind chad growing up in that tiny little town of anderson, south carolina  Where there's not much going on there other than clemson football?  But he had a vision and he stuck with that vision through thick and thin getting more opportunities  Left and right that he had no control over it. There's the story of denzel washington  Helping him pay for his trip to go to oxford and study  acting  Denzel freaking washington  Then he gets back and he's been told no a gazillion times on set because he didn't fit this this role at that role  Then there's another time in the soul proper where he was portrayed as a black man  But he didn't like how that role was being portrayed  Negatively he spoke up about it and they took him off  But he said, you know what? It's okay. I still want to make the story. It's okay  I don't have to act I can just write and do my own stories  And then after that all of these other doors just continue to pop up for him and  Just keep pushing folks. Don't don't half-ass life. We we really do have a tremendous opportunity right now  Even though this is covet 19 and things are shutting down if you have a passion about something right now  Just keep going for it. Keep living it chad did it  better than anybody that I could ever realize considering everything that he dealt with with  with with cancer  And people are complaining about wearing a damn mask  Walk in his shoes do what he did  And just be better  And I just wanted to say chad. Thank you so much man for  Representing our city representing our state  And representing our people  Resilience brother. I love you  And to your sister, i'm not going to say your name.

Transcript:  He it's funny he had already been diagnosed with colon cancer when he was doing black panther

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we knew we knew chad was different from  From a lot of the kids that we hung out with  You know, he was likable and and you know could party and all of that stuff just like any other teenager, but there was something  different in that whole  Theater theater life and the debate life it was  He wasn't like the rest of us and it showed and he just kept pushing along and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Yeah, I I got the message from my mom  When it happened and  I was like, wait a minute. No, this this can't be real and then my son  They sent me a message because I was out  They sent me a message and it just just broke their hearts and then my phone started ringing from people from back east just  like this this can't be real and  Being able to hear everybody else's story it just just further proved how much that cat just just really  Meant to all of us from the area, you know, no, I didn't keep in touch with chad  There's no way I could keep in touch with chad. It's just it is what it is and I was never upset about that  but  I I really appreciated what he represented from the area because  Y'all know how it is in the south. You've heard the horror stories that i've told about the south  and  This being the so-called land of opportunity  It was great to see that he was able to take his opportunities and just really maximize it and then beyond that  give back  To everybody else and just say hey you can do this too  So get on out there do the work get slapped in the face a couple times  But just keep going at it and you know what you can be a freaking superhero  That we used to dream about and look at on the tv screens and movie screens when we were kids and I never  Ever would have assumed something like that would have happened  Until seeing that with my own eyes. It's kind of amazing. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what did I think he made?  42 Thurgood Marshall and black panther are three movies  That must mean so much to black  Yeah children and just black people in general about achievement  In a way and not just in sports, but but you know as a supreme court justice  And king of wakanda, which is pretty good  Yeah, if you can make it to king of wakanda, you can make it anywhere.
