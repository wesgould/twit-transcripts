I want to hasten to say sometimes people go, wait a minute, you're not talking about Google.  It's all the stuff in the cloud. Facebook, Twitter, whatever is going on.  And the reason is when you get a panel this good, you don't want to say, oh, no, you can't talk about George Takei.  Joining us right now, or that fly, joining us right now to my left, Gina Tripani.  Mommy Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm Takei Lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Takei Lover.  Yes, Gina is, of course, the founding editor of Lifehacker.  She blogs at SmarterWare.org and writes, think up.  A partner for Expert Labs with Anil Dash.  Good to see you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You look well rested once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not today.  It was a long night.  My daughter's five weeks and four AM.  The honeymoon is over.  I'm far to you, four AM.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aaron Newcomb is also here from Oracle in the Source show.  And you're a father, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. Three kids.  How old?  Let's see. And I got to remember, right?  Thirteen, ten and seven.  Oh, geez.  So we're out of diapers.  We're beyond the late night or early morning.  But you've been where Gina is.  I've been there many times.  Many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember doing laps with Abby when she was that age, just trying to jiggle her to sleep.  Right.  Yeah, pacing. Pacing works.  Pacing, motion.  Yeah, motion.  Also here, the father of us all, Jeff Jarvis.  I don't know why I said that.  Jeff is the author of What Would Google Do?  and his new book Public Parts.  Oh, my.  Also at George Takei Fannie, he blogs at BuzzMachine.com and teaches journalism to some very lucky kids at the City University of New York.  Hello, everybody.  You know, there's a lot of interest in this new Chromebook.  I don't, it's sold out already and I am kind of puzzled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what it is.  All right.  I'm going to go.  Can I start in here?  Please.  Because I ordered it on the 18th.  I am enraged today.  Never happens.  You know, I never get mad about anything.  And because it hasn't arrived from Best Buy, I ordered from Best Buy because you could order from there.  You couldn't order from Google Play at first.  Right.  So I went to Best Buy and ordered immediately.  It's now supposedly back ordered.  Somebody else who sold out, sold out, ordered it on Google Play two days ago, just got it today and bragged about it on Google Plus.  It's killing me.  Here's the deal.  Here's the deal.  I have gone to my Nexus phone.  I have gone to my Nexus 7 tablet.  I am going for the purposes of the show, for the benefit of the show.  I'm going to go 100 percent Google.  I'm going to live Google.  Oh, there's only one thing I can't do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If I live Google, Skype, Skype, because that Chromebook, you have to use a hangout.  We could use a hangout, right?  Can we try it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, the biggest problem at the moment is the drivers that we use for video back to you don't work.  You won't be able to see us.  You won't be able to see us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll solve that.  We'll just take them.  And we actually won't use a hangout.  We'll use Google Talk, right?  Google Talk will work perfect.  Oh, that's right.  You could use Google Talk on the Chromebook, right?  Yes.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.  So I realized for $249, right, I could pretty much do anything that I need to do.  And by the way, anything that a journalism student would need to do too, I think.  You can edit video.  You can edit photos.  You can publish.  You can do all kinds of things.  And I think it's potentially a breakthrough.  You know, you compare that to the new Chromebook.  I mean, Chromebook, but the new, I know, the PowerBook.  MacBook Pro.  Right.  Talking almost like you're an old timer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  Ten times the price.  Ten times.  You can get ten Chromebooks for the price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, we observed that yesterday during the announcement.  The 13-inch Retina MacBook Pro is, well, not ten.  It's $16.99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, by the time you add in all the other stuff, you're up to $22, $2300.  But then having to the high end of it.  Point being obvious still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you're not getting high end.  You're getting very low end.  That's what puzzles me.  Now, it looks like a MacBook Air and maybe that's what's deceiving people.  Did you get the 3G model or did you get a what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm so eager to get it.  I've ordered both.  I have people at Best Buy.  Buy five.  They're cheap.  Exactly.  I want to turn one.  You couldn't order the 3G at first and then Amazon quietly allowed you to do that.  So I'll get that if I need it.  So here's what you're getting for $250.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an Exynos processor, which is basically the same processor used in many Android phones.  Dual core.  They don't say a clock speed.  You're getting a 11.6 inch screen.  That's 1366 by 768, which means, and they have mentioned this, it'll playback HD.  720p, but HD video.  Low glare.  200 nits.  Everybody's talking nits all of a sudden.  Nits here, nits there.  I don't know why.  It's got a VGA webcam.  So you're going to look awful.  That's 640 by 480, right?  Two and a half pounds, 2.4 pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like I don't always look awful.  I'm either pink or pixelated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you won't be pixelated, but you'll be, you'll look like you're talking to us from Azerbaijan.  One.  Two gigs of RAM.  16 gig drive.  That would be the concern for some people.  There's no, it's all cloud storage, right?  Wi-Fi, A, B, G.  With 100 gigs of free Google Drive.  100 gigs of storage.  Bluetooth 3.  USB 3, which is interesting.  USB 2, HDMI, and SD card reader.  And they're claiming six and a half hours battery life on the Wi-Fi version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You may actually be able to plug in a webcam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I'll be able to plug in this webcam.  Because it's USB.  So maybe we'll...  That's a good point, Chad.  You are right on it.  So, but you're buying it because you're a journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why would you?  No, I'm buying it for another reason.  What do I do?  What do I do 99.9% of my time on my computer?  Browser.  Right.  That really is all I do.  And I'm trying to go to Google Docs anyway, rather than writing in Word, just so I have  the stuff available wherever I am on whatever machine and whatever device I can use this,  right?  With Docs, I can't use Word.  You know what?  Finally, I said on the show two weeks ago that what drove me to Android was Google's  services, drove me to the hardware.  When I finally made the switch to Calendar and Drive and all that stuff, I just said,  well, why not?  Now, yeah, the next step of this is if I can do everything I need to do for $249 in hardware,  then the students at my school, we require to buy a Mac laptop.  If they could buy this thing, and if we could create more of an open source journalism school,  yeah, $249 makes a big deal.  It's not the one laptop per child, which isn't very good.  It really does most of what anybody needs to do.  It says we fully live in the cloud.  This is the cloud show, so I got to live in the cloud, man.  And we fully live on the browser as the pathway to it.  Gina, am I insane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think you're insane.  Kevin Purdy and I discussed this all the time, and he said, you know, I spend my days in  my browser or writing, you know, writing in docs.  And he, I believe he ran Lifehacker, I think, for like a week just using Chrome OS.  And he said-  A week?  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However did he survive?  What happened after seven days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, he was kind of-  That's not a successful trial, I got to tell you.  He said himself off and said, I'm going to just try to use just this computer for- and  And he did this a while ago when it was back when it was like the CR 48.  This was kind of a while ago.  But he said, you know, I wanted to see if I could do it.  And the answer was that he absolutely could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And obviously not having so much fun that he decided to keep doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, right.  Yeah, I don't think he works from a Chrome OS, but he works from Linux, which is basically  he just spends his time in Chrome.  There's a significant difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I just say this is completely retro?  We've been here, we've done this before.  It was called a netbook.  And because of the very, very, very cheap price, similar to this, a lot of people bought  them and put them away after about three months saying that was a lousy experience.  And the same thing.  I don't understand why this is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the difference is actually Windows is just really heavy and not built for this  low power.  And Chrome OS is built for this machine.  This machine is fast.  It turns on really fast.  It's, you know, it's just it's much more lightweight.  Look, I can't switch to a Chromebook just because I like my IDE.  I do development.  That's how I'm writing code most of the day.  I know there are cloud based code editors, but I got to run my tests.  I got to I've got my sort of tools on the desktop that I aren't quite offered in the  cloud yet.  But I'm not.  I think most people who spend spend their time in the browser, I think that it's reasonable  for journalism students.  The Chromebook makes complete sense.  I'm actually surprised.  Jeff, you require students to buy a Mac.  That's pretty that's pretty expensive.  I don't I don't around around UCSD.  I see most students with Windows laptops and I don't forget that's a price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  We're teaching students to to make video for TV and such and make audio and photos.  And so they need to learn Final Cut, the Adobe suite and all that.  What we do is we had a lot of discussion about this to require a student to buy a Mac when  we're a city university and we have students, though, from across the country.  We are a state supported public university.  But a lot of schools require technology and require technology fees.  What we do to soften this load quite a bit is we provide free use while they're at school  of an incredible array of software, including Final Cut, including the Adobe suite and much  more.  Though, interestingly, that software has shrunk and shrunk and shrunk and shrunk as we've  had more online tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  I think this is great for businesses who have gone the Google app route.  I mean, if I were a small business and I had first of all, I would be on Google Apps because  it's so easy.  And then I would give it every single one of my employees.  You know, the day you come, you get this as a laptop and use this because, you know, you've  got offline access to docs.  There's, you know, except in the corner case where you are doing things like video editing  and whatever.  You know, I think this is great for that.  And I also think it's really good for education.  So I agree with Leo.  I've never been a big fan of Chromebook, but at this price point and with all of the marketing  they're doing around this, I mean, I was seeing ads, I think, during the during the playoffs  for the Chromebook.  I was really surprised how much they're doing to promote this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The new commercial, the new commercial is great.  You know, it's for everyone, that commercial.  Yeah.  It's a cut together of a bunch of YouTube clips.  I think it's a big fat lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And seriously, I do.  And I think people I think it's going to be we've seen this so many times before.  The Commodore 64 was very popular because it was very cheap.  And then people got it home and realized why it was so cheap.  The netbooks are very popular because they were very cheap.  And people got them home.  And I'm going to get the calls in six months from people say, oh, computing, it's so horrible  because it's just so slow.  I just don't.  You know what?  I had this argument, by the way, I've had this argument with the guy.  What was his name in charge of Chrome OS at Google?  I stood across from him and said, I don't get it.  So we're yeah, I don't get it.  I don't think you have a product here.  Now I do have to point out that Michael Horowitz at Computer World, he runs the rights of the  defensive computing column, says that Chrome OS is a great choice for online finances.  This might make sense as kind of a standalone secondary computer.  I know people who use Linux for that.  Just by the side of the phone or whatever, it's completely secure that you just use for  things you really want to be secure with.  Is that Sundar?  Sundar Pichai.  That's it.  Sundar Pichai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But Leo, OK.  But here's, but I think two things have changed.  Uncle Leo.  One is the quality of the services that are in the cloud, this being the show by the cloud.  When you think about it, it's really amazing.  When we get to Gina's, she'll be mentioning some other services that are available now.  It's constantly growing.  It's constantly there.  It's not just, you know, you can, we video, you can edit video in the cloud and the rendering  is a lot faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But who would want to do that when you can buy a good computer for a couple hundred bucks  more that doesn't really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well A, here's why you can do the rendering, which is the biggest pain in the butt of video  editing in a much faster machines in the cloud.  So you upload, you pay for the speed once by uploading and then you gain back speed.  Number two, you can bring in other clips and other things and collaborate just like we  do on docs.  You can do the same thing with video only if it's in the cloud.  Right?  That's the big change.  The other change is with my iPad and now with this, I'm working with a keyboard.  I'm turning my tablet into a computer and that's where Microsoft is going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I never got that either, to be honest, but at least you have touch with that in some  mature applications.  Maybe, you know what?  I'm just registering my skepticism.  Perhaps this will be wonderful.  Perhaps it will take off.  I think we've seen this story lots of times before.  Hey Gina, Gina, I think we should challenge Leo to live on Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've tried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a CR 48.  I've had every Chrome.  And I try and it's a browser and I just can't get past the fact that all I have is a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What other applications do you use every day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  What are you using Leo, like besides your browser during the day?  A ton of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like?  Twitter, email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I use a standalone email client.  I'm not going to use Gmail.  I never use Gmail in the browser.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  AOL, grandpa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  I use Apple Mail and I use a lot of sophisticated filtering and stuff that I'm not going to  be able to do on the Gmail website.  I use IRC Chat Textual.  I use a lot of different apps.  I don't actually do video editing, but I wouldn't dream of doing it on the...  Go ahead.  Live it up.  Get back to me in a month and let me know how well you're, how it's going for you.  The only reason I'm aggressive on this, because otherwise I don't care.  The only reason I'm aggressive on this is because I think that unfortunately consumers  look at the price and go, hey, a computing experience for $249, I'll take it.  And it's in the closet.  And I've just seen this so many times before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's being careful, I think, to position it as a second machine, as a traveling machine.  Let me...  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I look at that ad and they're positioning it as a, you're going to love life when you  have this great machine and you're going to do neat things and it's so much fun and even  your dog can compute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it a mom's machine?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The less sophisticated the user is, the more power they need, not the less power.  A sophisticated user can understand how all this works and make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My father uses AOL.  If this were an AOL machine...  It doesn't run AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know what I mean.  And it's a moral...  But wait a minute though.  Don't deprecate that.  Because that's my point is for geeks like us, living in Chrome maybe is doable, but  there are real people out there who are going to spend $249 and it's a waste of their money,  I think.  But we'll see.  I mean, I may be completely wrong.  This would be the first.  There have been many, many, many generations of these machines who have tried to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the price point, the changes in the background and the price point makes a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember Think Inc., the little company that your boss started some years ago?  Oracle had a... it was a network computer.  It was a Think Nick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There was a lot of these around at that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've seen this again and again and again.  And each and every time people say the same thing, which is, well, it's not there yet.  Maybe it's there now.  Maybe.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I've seen this with the daily news.  They say, I want to do something new and they'd say, do your daily news and they'd say, no,  we tried that in 54, right?  It didn't work?  No.  Go ahead.  You want to try it?  We tried it five, six times.  It hasn't worked.  Show us what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wouldn't care, except I just feel like a lot of people are going to be taken for granted.  I think that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's very fair that you are doing caveat and pre-order.  Gina, you were trying to break in my...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was just going to ask about saying that the less sophisticated the user, the more power  that they need.  That's interesting to me, Leo.  I don't know.  Why do you say that?  That doesn't seem...  Because to me, I see this like the Mac is a luxury computer and the Chromebook is a  less powered computer.  If I wasn't a developer, if I was just writing or if I was a student, I totally see going  to school with a Chromebook if I was just writing papers and doing mostly everything  in my browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think what happens is, it's very frequently the case that the least sophisticated users  buy the cheapest computers.  It ends up having been a mistake because it doesn't do what they need it to do.  They're not sophisticated enough to figure out the ways to get it to do, like video editing.  Yeah, right.  Good luck.  I'm a consumer.  I have a camera.  I have a video camera or maybe I have a still camera.  Now I have a Chromebook.  Now, what I'd like to do is send Grandma the pictures.  How easy is that going to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It has a slot for your memory card.  You put it in there, you email the picture to Grandma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll see.  I have to say I agree with Leo on this for the most part.  I really want to love the Chromebook.  My wife, after seeing the commercials, who's not into technology at all, came and asked  me, I just saw this commercial.  Is this something I could use?  I said, no, it's not for you for the reason that you just said, Leo, is that she's always  getting stuff from other people.  People that are using Microsoft products or other products.  Then she goes, because she runs Linux, because I make her run Linux.  What a poor woman.  Oh my God.  Sometimes, sometimes she's not able to do things on Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're like Bill Gates' kids.  We have to use a Zoom because Daddy won't let us have an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's like the scene out of Diner where he wouldn't marry.  That's right.  The football quiz.  You had your wife do a coding test before you'd marry her, I'll bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I don't think she would pass.  That's actually a good idea.  She definitely wouldn't pass that one.  So here is the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got to point out 394,000 views on YouTube.  I just want people to watch this and see who Google is targeting with this product and  ask yourself whether those people are going to take it home and say, yeah, this was great  a year from now.  So that kid's not going to be able to run any of the educational software she wants  to run.  Go ahead and give a kid a Chromebook and say watch TV.  The lazy Sunday.  The guy's sleeping.  I guess it's perfect for him.  Homework?  No, I don't think so.  Netflix?  Can you watch Netflix on it?  Yes.  Yeah.  It's good for St. Bernard.  I agree.  The number of apps is very impressive.  Okay, so you got a kid entering high school, freshman in high school.  Now, assuming price is no object.  Well, that's a key point here.  I understand.  You can't cross over that.  Well, but there's a false economy is my point.  $250 wasted is not better than $500 on a computer that actually does something.  It's wasted and you'll end up buying the $500 computer.  So it's an expensive economy.  If you got a kid entering high school from eighth grade, what do you get that kid?  Do you get her a Chromebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean if she doesn't take care of stuff well or he...  Okay, it's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If she's going to break it, that's good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good reason.  If I want his or her stuff to be everywhere and not have to worry about backing stuff  up, sure.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or you put a backup program on there.  It's not that hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll talk again in six months.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As soon as I...  Well, I hope I get my machine before that.  I want to be a bit of a guinea pig.  I hope you do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, they've sold out.  Of course, that doesn't mean that we don't know how many they might have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I ordered it as soon as I could.  It's a mother's schmuck.  I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But see, Apple does the same thing.  They allocate like five to Best Buy and then they sell the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the thing though.  You couldn't order it on Play right away.  So I would have ordered it on Play, but you couldn't for days and I didn't know when it  was going to go on Play.  So I went to the first place I could buy it.  And frankly, I'll be fully honest here, I thought if there's a problem, I can return  it to Best Buy.  By the way, it's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The skate patch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're pitching this as being able to playback 1080p video even though it's only a 768 screen.  I don't understand that.  I think Google's a little disingenuous on this.  I know they really all in on the Chromebook and all of that.  Maybe they feel like they're doing people a real favor.  I worry that they're doing people a disservice, but I could be wrong.  And I'm actually would be happy to be wrong.  I bought the one laptop per child.  I'm excited about it.  I bought every netbook that ever came out.  I still have my Asus EPC.  And I've owned every Chromebook up to this one.  In fact, Chad, we had you review them.  I've reviewed, yeah.  And how many are you?  Which one are you using now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well we had to return the newest one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have plenty of those.  We got them at Google I.O.  Didn't we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got the Chromebox at Google I.O.  Oh, Chromebox, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google I.O. before the last, they gave us a Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was the first generation.  That wasn't the C48.  That was the one that they're still doing on Virgin Airlines.  That one's a piece of crap, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, there was the CR48 and then there was the Samsung.  Right.  I had the Samsung.  I gave it to my nephew.  There's a chat room saying, Leah, why would you do a show about Google when you're so  ignorant?  They're saying, so we'll just see.  We'll talk again in a few months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's important to be critical.  I think it's important to be critical about these things for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Idiot analyst says Google could be gone in five years.  Now there's a guy I can get behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody on Twitter said, I can't wait to hear Jarvis Rayholt on Twigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Katie Thompson on CNBC.  She's the technology editor.  Google may be on its way out as the dominant player in search, according to one analyst.  Actually, I'm sorry, it's not Katie.  She's writing about ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, did the idiot analyst have to be a lady?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm sorry.  It's Eric Jackson, a nice fella.  Iron Fire capital founder and managing member.  Incredible stuff.  I don't know if I'd want my title to be member.  Anyway, he said Google could easily find itself fending off the woes that eventually took  hold and embattled Yahoo.  They could disappear in five to eight years in the same way that Yahoo disappeared.  They're still around, but they're the walking dead.  Actually, I don't know if he's really wrong on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, that's patently true.  Any company, Facebook, Google, Twitter, any company could disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eight years ago, if you had said that about Microsoft, people would have thought you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  nuts.  Sure.  Absolutely could happen.  I don't disagree with that.  It's the now, it's the mobile boogie man.  Nobody's figured out mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's why the stock market punished Google by killing its stock price five, four,  five percent, right?  Because Google had admitted accidentally that 40 percent of what they're making 40 percent  less on mobile than on desktop.  I think that's what they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's beginning to get eight billion dollars, eight billion dollars revenue on mobile.  They're still doing okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Facebook, which everybody's been screaming the same thing when they had the earrings  call this week.  It turns out, yeah, we are learning how to sell mobile.  They have hundreds of millions still, but smaller than Google.  Their stock went up 12 percent today, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, Yahoo had some profits too.  Yahoo did okay.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  20 percent for Facebook.  Ooh, good upon it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think the basic premise here is wrong.  can go under.  And we've seen it with a lot of Internet companies.  But I just don't think that the comparisons that this person's pointing out are fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's he comparing them to besides Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Facebook.  He says if Facebook saw a deceleration of their sales and growth leading to half of  their stock, why couldn't this happen to Google?  Well, Google is diversified much more than Facebook.  The comparison is just not valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, that's true.  But it is purely an advertising company.  We have to say in media, it is a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Based on, is he projecting that ad revenues are going away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think what they project is that you can't get the same kind of revenue in mobile.  As traffic moves to mobile, then you can't get the same revenue there that you get in  browsers on the web, PCs.  And that's lower.  But I think what that mistakes is, and Facebook has said this, and the same is true at Google,  I'm sorry I've said it a million times, I'll say it one more time, this is a signal  generator and it teaches you about people.  As long as the Federal Trade Commission doesn't stop you from taking advantage of that, then  Google and Facebook will know more about you than any media company knows and can take  higher advantage of it.  They've only barely begun to do that.  Google's farther ahead than Facebook is.  Facebook, however, will know you more intimately.  And that's what we haven't seen yet.  And they may fail at it.  They may not do it, but there's a potential there that I would invest in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you had to put all your money in one company right now and say, you know, survive 10 years  out, would it be Google?  Yeah.  Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a really good question.  Ten years?  Yeah.  That's really hard in technology.  Ten years is a lifetime.  Yeah, that's a long time.  That's a long time.  Apple?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will Apple be as...  No, I don't think Apple will be around in 10 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I would split between Apple and Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook?  Microsoft?  Or is there somebody not incumbent who could completely change the game again?  We've seen that so many times in technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's always someone.  There's always somebody out there.  There's always someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think what is true is that a few years ago, you'd say, well, there's no one that  can compete against Google and search because Google has years of building this index.  There is some real value to that.  We saw a lot of companies try like cool.com.  You can't just march in and be the next Google.  But what's changed is that search isn't the big thing anymore.  Search isn't the big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Social is the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  So that's why it's unpredictable.  And something else comes along next, but that's where I think what Google has proved nimble  at is pivoting to these new opportunities.  Who would have thought they'd be a phone company?  Whereas Microsoft, which was so unstoppable that governments around the world were going  after them and was unbeatable, didn't pivot so well.  Facebook is still trying to understand how to do this.  I think Larry Page and Google have shown a skill at that that I would bet on.  But the key word, the key thing you said, Leo, the limitation of this is 10 years.  Would I bet on them for 20 years or 50 years?  No, I'd be foolish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For sure by then somebody will have come along and come up with something new.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I always go to IBM.  IBM is not running the world the way it did, but IBM is still a good company.  AT&T is still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an old company.  Kind of.  It's a different company than it was.  I think the problem is that we as humans don't really have, we live in this very weird bubble  where we don't really see time.  And we're like fish in the water.  We don't see the water.  And so we think everything will always be the way it is until it's not.  And boy, if there's ever a lesson in all of this, everything's changing.  Absolutely.  And our ability to grok it.  We're going to take a break.  Gina Tripani, Jeff Jarvis, and Aaron Newcomb is with us as well from the Source Show.  SourceShow.net?  .org.  .org.  SourceShow.org.  And of course he's a regular on Floss Weekly.  You were here for Floss this morning.  I was here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hosted Floss this morning.  What did you do this morning?  We were talking about actually a company that does embedded, develops a build system for  embedded ARM devices.  So it actually fits in very well with the talk about Chromebook.  If you're interested in more talk about ARM technology and how do you write code for ARM,  check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an interesting question at some point.  Is ARM going to be Intel?  And ARM isn't a thing really.  ARM is just an IP.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's the chips that drive most of the mobile technology out there.  It's a standard or a spec.  It's a spec.  Yeah, they design stuff.  But the cool thing was you talk about technology.  They actually have a rack mountable chassis basically.  I want to call it a server.  I guess it's a server.  But it has a bunch of these different ARM chips in it.  And that's what they're using to actually run their compiling system and their system  that they use to compile for embedded Linux systems.  And it's an eight chips.  And each one has 30 gigs of flash memory mounted on top of it.  It's crazy, but they're building this all on an ARM architecture.  It's very, very interesting to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Who would have thought a few years ago that Intel would be kind of faced with this big  challenge and that's because people move to mobile.  The desktop is no longer dominant.  Taking a break.  Come back with more in just a bit, Gina, Jeff and Aaron.  Do you mail stuff?  Now, this is not do you mail a letter every once in a while.  Do you mail stuff?  Like we mail stuff.  We have to mail out invoices.  We have to mail out products.  We're always mailing stuff.  You go to the front desk, there's always a pile this high.  That's why we use stamps.com.  If you mail stuff with a capital M, you don't want to go to the post office arms laid down.  You don't want to buy stamps at the post office.  And let me tell you something.  You might have thought, oh, the postage meter is a godsend.  That's way old fashioned technology.  You want stamps.com or places you know you don't need a postage meter.  You don't need expensive leasing or special ink or any equipment.  You need your computer, your printer and stamps.com.  You can buy and print a U.S. postage.  It's kind of a postage on demand.  Anytime, anywhere.  They also print the mailing labels.  They print right on an envelope, which makes it very easy to get your mailing done.  In fact, it'll take it from your existing address book.  You use QuickBooks.  All the clients in there.  It spits it out and puts your logo on there, the postage, everything.  It's so cool.  With stamps.com USB scale, you're never putting more postage on anything than you ever have  to.  You just plop the letter or the package on the scale.  It goes into the USB, goes into the computer, goes to the software.  Does the prints out the mailing label for you.

We like it so much we have two accounts here because we're fighting over the scale.  Stamps.com.  Use our offer code Twig for that very special offer with $55 in free postage.  This is a really interesting week.  People announced on Tuesday a ton of new products, more than anybody ever thought they would.  Every product in their product line now has been revamped except the Mac Pro, which speaks  a little bit to the end of desktop computing, I think, but we'll save that for Mac Break  Weekly.  Tomorrow, Microsoft's having a party in New York for Windows 8 and then Friday, the Windows  8 store opens.  People are going to be able to buy Windows 8 computers, desktops, but also Microsoft's  new tablet I've ordered when I can't wait to take a look at it.  The reviews are very interesting.  People almost in every case, reviewers had something very positive to say like, this  thing's amazing.  This thing's so cool, but there's no software.  Even Walt Mossberg praised it highly.  Some of which I wonder is because people feel like they can't really just slam it, right?  They have to say, find something good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Who'd think we have empathy and sympathy for Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost like, oh gosh, find something good to say.  Well, it's a very attractive box because they feel bad.  And then we've got big announcements next week.  Microsoft's got its Windows Phone 8 announcement in San Francisco next week and Samsung's got  big announcements next week.  And then Google says, add it away.  They shoehorn their way into the Monday calendar with a surprise announcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not so surprised now.  It's the holidays are coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it all because it's because of Christmas, right?  Yeah, it's the holidays are coming.  But I don't remember this ever happening before.  This is the first.  And I guess it's because we have all these companies competing with the inexpensive devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which yeah, this is exciting and new.  I love it.  It goes back a bit to the Chromebook discussion is that we're not talking at $2,500 price  points now.  We're talking at $250 out of the pocket to get a new phone with subsidy, to get a tablet,  to get all these things.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the rumor mill, just as the rumor mill has been very active with Apple, I saw what  was it, Read Write Web that wrote, everything Google will announce, everything Google will  announce on Monday.  It was right here.  I don't know if that's the case.  We're going to see what they think.  A Nexus, a new Nexus phone from LG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  New Nexus choices, which is great.  There was a rumor of a Sony one, but that appears to be dead.  That was a fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a total fake.  It was a total fake.  In fact, it was such a fake that the guy who did the fake posted a Tumblr on how he did  the fake.  It was such a fake.  There is no Sony Nexus.  It's actually another one of those lessons for the tech press that you just got to be  a little bit more careful.  PhoneArena, which picked this up big time, actually had to apologize.  They called it the failure of our reporting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's how I heard about it, through PhoneArena.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The failure of their reporting.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Meanwhile, somebody at Sony is saying, oh crap, maybe we should do that.  Well, you know why I think people jumped on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was so cool looking.  It was so cool looking.  TechCrunch ran it, everybody.  The Sony Nexus S. 521 articles total.  And then the guy said, well, it took me about eight hours in Photoshop.  I took a little bit from the Xperia, a little bit from this, and he put it all together  and it was just an incredible, beautiful fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is, I guess, the argument that Apple makes about what Samsung did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the funny thing is that I thought, I had seen pictures of that thin iMac that  Apple announced yesterday, and I thought those were fake pictures and they weren't.  I thought it was somebody's photos.  It couldn't possibly be five millimeters thick.  That can't happen.  So we're going to see, now this is interesting.  In response to Apple, we are going to see apparently a new tablet, the Nexus 10, which  will be higher DPI than either of the new iPads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what's beyond retina?  Super retina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brain?  Brain.  It will be 20, this is a 10 inch tablet, 2560 by 1600.  Wow.  300 pixels per inch.  I think the, what is the iPad?  300 pixels per inch.  It's realer than reality.  Now, something I have to say about this though, is that the iPad 3 just recently got replaced  yesterday by the iPad 4 because the retina, they're pushing so many pixels that it was  kind of, the iPad 3 was kind of sluggish compared to the previous iPads.  So Apple had to double the speed of the processor.  I hope Google will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm sorry for this, but because we have the iPad mini, I guess that is the iPad Maxi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that was exactly why I thought they wouldn't call it the iPad mini.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which goes back to Gina made this point the first day of the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They made the date?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.  Oh no you didn't.  Oh they went there.  I'm sure you could do that better than me.  Go ahead, you do it.  You do the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, do the head.  Oh no they didn't.  Oh no you didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They went there.  So I love it though.  It's great for consumers because they're really, there's somebody, I think it was in our chat  room said, this, that means that this next decade, the decade of the 2010s is all going  to be about Apple, Google, Apple, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you saw that yesterday, right?  You saw that with head to head.  They took the Nexus 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never seen Apple do that.  They had 7-amp slide, right?  They were comparing head to head.  They never said Nexus 7.  They said a leading or best-selling tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So is Google going to do the same thing when they bring out the 10-inch, the Nexus 10,  whatever it's going to be called?  I think it would be really interesting to have them do a point by point back at Apple.  Say, look at our resolution, look how thin it is, look out whatever the specs are on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it.  It would be very funny if they did that.  Because Apple didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's finally going to be Google's answer to the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's getting pretty direct, isn't it?  I mean it's like boom boom.  It's also a Nexus, so it'll run the newest version of Android, which we thought was going  to be Keyline Pie, but it's just saying it's 4.2 Jelly Bean.  They don't want to over promise.  So what is, do you know Gina what that could mean or might mean?  The LG phone will have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's 4.2?  What is 4.2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it going to be?  What's new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's shared users for the tablet end.  Yeah, that's one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, shared users in that you can log in as different users.  Something people wanted from the iPad and they never got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So like user switching?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, user switching is a better way to put it.  By the way, Windows tablet does that, interestingly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Windows has done it for forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Windows has always done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of expected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you had a Windows tablet or a Linux based tablet, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This will be a Samsung, by the way, this Nexus 10.  The other one was made by Acer or no, Asus.  I can never remember the Asus.  It's one of the Asus.  So it's not Keyline Pie.  It's Android 4.2 Plus, an updated version of Jelly Bean, according to a person familiar  with the announcement.  These will be the first 4.2 devices.  Now, by the way, this is Google's and Android's downfall.  I mean, if you're going to pick the negatives, is that there are so many versions of Android.  What Apple really played on is that they rebuilt a device that can be updated, wink, wink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, not all of them.  I know, that's true.  But still, it's a frustration that Galaxy S3 users in the UK only today are getting  Jelly Bean.  I still don't have it on my S3.  It makes me crazy.  I still don't have it on my S3.  You buy the latest thing and you don't have it.  And that's very frustrating.  I think they've got to fix that.  Or you end up with tears here.  So why are we who have this happy to have the pure Nexus experience?  Because I have Jelly Bean, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't have visual voicemail unless I go out, you know, an effort to go through Google  Voice or whatever.  So I'm happier all in all.  But that creates a tearing that at some point their manufacturers are not going to be happy  about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was not ReadRetReb.  It was the NextWeb that had everything you'd ever want to know.  They also say that, as you said, there'll be a 3G version of the Kindle 7.  I mean, sorry, the Nexus 7.  Kindle, where's the Nexus 7?  Right, so the Nexus 7.  I'm so confused.  The Nexus 16 is going to go down to the price of the Nexus 8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Nexus 8 is already out of stock.  You can't buy the Nexus 8.  So the rumors are the Nexus 32.  You were the one who revealed the Nexus 7 that had space for a cellular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I saw somebody else do it, so I just opened mine.  Right.  What the hell?  Thank you for the credit.  I don't do reportage.  I'm a pundit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you get to the point where you have a $200 price point for 16 gig for the Nexus 7.  You have $330 for 16 gig for the iPad.  And I was talking to some folks on Twitter today about this, and it really struck me  that what happens is that, yeah, you're buying the spoken mirrors.  You're buying the Hugo Boss suit instead of the JCPenney suit.  So in a sense, Apple more and more becomes the designer brand in fashion terms, and  Google and Amazon both are kind of ready to wear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly the distinction I made yesterday.  I'm acting very quickly.  It feels like Apple is like the Bang & Olufsen.  You pay more, but you get a beautiful thing.  But the question is, that's a narrow niche for B&O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is, and it's small.  Apple's done very well with that.  They're happy with it.  They love their margins.  The other thing that really hit me, Leo, is that I think that Nexus 7 put incredible price  and thus profit pressure on Apple because, as we know, Google doesn't make money on this.  They're not in the hardware business.  The hardware is a path to what the real business is, and it's advertising and signals and selling  stuff where Apple does not have all those lines of business.  They have some.  They sell books.  They sell music.  They make that point, but they failed in trying to be an advertising business, and they don't  have the personal services that Facebook and Google have, really the same way.  So they've got to make the money on the hardware, and that puts them into a bind, so they've  got to sell smoke.  And Apple has smoke.  They have beautiful smoke.  It smells great.  It's hickory.  It's great.  But they sell smoke.  Same as advertisers in Vogue.  You're selling smoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and 90%.  But Apple's completely happy with their margins and their niche, I guess.  But Google is also completely happy to let Apple, to cede that to Apple and say, fine,  we'll take the low end.  We'll take the 90% users who want just to want to get something done.  I think that's a good division of the world.  The problem is I don't think Apple really is completely happy with the niche.  I think Apple got a taste with iOS.  They got a taste of dominance, and I think they said, hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They didn't lead with the seven inch.  They always lead and get copied, right?  The seven inch, they scoffed.  I think you have to give Steve a poke that they got scoffed, and the seven inch, Google  proved and Amazon both proved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ah, that's a good point.  Web 50, whatever, said, because I have an unlocked Galaxy S3, I can get it with keys.  That's the people with Verizon and AT&T locked phones that won't be able to, or whoever has  it.  It's not Verizon, AT&T.  No, I guess everybody has the S3.  So 4.2, content in the center, which when I read that I thought, whatever that is, it  doesn't sound like something I want.  But what it is, it's just a Play Store widget.  But I think it means you can access content from the, like you could watch on the widget,  you could watch a show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, oh, oh, and tablet sharing, which you mentioned.  I'm not sharing my tablet with nobody.  I know it's funny because Apple really has always said, well, we could do that.  But really we think this is each of you should own one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's also some, I know that there's some things that people have been asking around  security for a while, like parental controls.  So you assign your kid an account and when they sign in, you've locked it down to whatever  extent you can.  There are also some pictures floating out on the web about some work that's being done  in the gallery to improve the look of the gallery on Android 4.2.  But I think the biggest things are really around security, multiple users and things  like that.  I don't think there's a lot of really super new cool features that are coming out.  So I think it's a good thing that they didn't actually iterate this.  It doesn't look like the features are there.  This isn't a major iteration of Android.  It really is a minor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it doesn't sound like that.  Oh, the content in the center makes a lot of sense because when the Nexus 7 ships, the  Play Store, it was so Play Store centric, the default home screen layout, right?  It was like all your Play Store content in that widget right there.  So that makes sense.  And you know, but thinking about the multiple users thing, I'm going to really like that.  I mean, I leave the Nexus 7 kind of laying around the living room and it'd be really  cool if my wife could pick it up and just switch to her account quickly to do what she  needs to do so then I could switch back to my account.  Now it's just kind of like, you know, she's what I'm signed into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It speaks to a different use model for the Nexus 7, which is kind of, it isn't your tablet.  It's the one you leave on the living room table.  It's like a remote control.  It's just it's a device you leave lying around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use it.  I use only the Nexus 7 now to record on our DVR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is the Verizon app, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, the truth is, I do take this with me everywhere.  Whereas, Leo, you never take your tablet with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only because it's Wi-Fi and I want, you know, 3G.  But I have practically have that with the Note 2.  That's true, too.  It's so big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean to ask you, Leo.  You try every phone, you do everything.  All right.  I'm now putting you on Desert Island.  You're allowed to have one phone with you, either the Note or the S3.  Which one do you take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, see, the Desert Island is the mistake because that changes the use.  But so don't say Desert Island, just say in your normal life.  Because if we're Desert Island, I would absolutely take the Note 2 because this would be  because it's bigger.  It could do all of that.  Right.  But carrying it around, you know, it's funny, I switched to the S3 again for a couple of days,  last couple of days, because I have multiple batteries.  I have a case.  I don't have a case yet for the Note 2.  I have a dashboard mount.  So they're for pure convenience.  And I had to note that it's the same resolution as the Note 2.  They're both 1280 by 720.  So it's not like I'm getting anything more.  It's just smaller or bigger.  Right.  So I think they're both very good.  And I think it's more that's really mostly just a personal choice.  What about the same phone?  Basically, although I love OK, I'll take it back because I love jelly bean and jelly bean is  significantly better.  So because my S3 didn't have jelly bean, it will tonight.  That might be another thing.  I love even Google Now is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it has potential now to work well for me.  It keeps telling me to update my thing.  I update my thing.  It doesn't tell me much.  Is it the weather?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you have an out of date thing, you don't deserve Google Now.  I don't know what that means.  So it's showing me my next show, Triangulation.  It shows me the and I love seeing this again and again.  This is one flaw.  I've been seeing the same Giants Cardinals score for a couple of days now, but it's a good  score. So I don't mind.  It's showing me the weather in Petaluma.  See it knows and then it will do interesting things like say this morning, for instance, I  drive my son to school every morning.  It knew that and it said your commute time to Sonoma Academy.  Do that for me.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's what I got.  I still have two identities to Google, which would all right.  I have my apps identity and my Gmail identity and and I do different things in each.  So I'm stuck with my Gmail identity on Google Plus because they couldn't do apps.  I my real emails on on apps.  And it's because when I do get my Chromebook, I don't know, Gina, any advice, which of my  identities should I sign into for the browser when my browser becomes my OS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, what do you which profile do you sign into Chrome with?  Do you think your bookmarks and stuff with Chrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have signed in with my Gmail account because that's what was available.  But now that I have the chance to change, I should change it to my apps.  I don't know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, honestly, I usually just use my Gmail account because they just tend the  Gmail accounts just tend to get things faster.  You get to opt into experiments that aren't available to app.  So, yeah, I would just I would just use your vanilla Gmail account, which is a bummer.  I know I have the same problem.  I switch between my apps and Gmail account.  I thought they fixed that for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You you can move your your Google Plus over, but you lose a lot of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lose all your followers.  And yeah, you have to reset up the whole thing.  People have to re-re-circle you.  And yeah, I just I just stick with stuck with my Gmail account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody's where do I want the 100 megs of free Google?  Well, that's a point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you only get it with one place, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, by the way, I want to update here.  I went to 12th Force saying, what's the deal on your deliveries?  People all over Google Plus are getting it.  Sean answering on 12th Force and 12th Force.  That's the Twitter help force for Best Buy.  OK, so he looked into the order and they found and Douglas and Sean, both at Best  Buy, had tip to you.  This is something that Best Buy still does really well.  And I'm in speed ship tomorrow.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Deal. 12th Force to the rescue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You bet. That's what they do.  Three thousand people on one Twitter account.  You got a problem with Best Buy. Go to them.  It works every time for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are we talking to the one of the Best Buy somebody's next week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Robert Stevens, who who was the founder of Geek Squad and was the CTO of Best Buy.  He quit about nine months ago before there was a lot of other turmoil, too.  He's a great, not spoken guy.  He's on the show. Chad, next week, right?  In person, in studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In person. Oh, great. Yeah.  Cool. I have some computers I'd like to give him to fix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we have the Chromebook around?  Could he fix that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's another issue is repairability of the Chromebook.  I guess at that price, you just throw it out and buy another one.  You throw it in the pond like the commercial says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a disposable computer, essentially.  It's a disposable computer.  You can stomp on it. You don't lose anything. Almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, there's a lot fewer parts to to go bad.  Most everything's built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They never break. No spinning drive at all.  Who fixes it if they break?  Best Buy will fix yours, Jeff, but if you bought it from Play.  If it's broken and it's still in warranty, you just send it back.  You send it. Yeah, they'll send you a new one.  Oh, you're still in the cloud anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  New Egg was selling it with trying to get you to buy up the $50 data backup plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good luck, New Egg.  So now I want one.  I'm going to buy one and maybe I should do a week of just using one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, we've we've shamed him into it.  OK, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm thinking maybe I need a writing computer.  I don't know. I've been.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is actually Leo's doing it for comedy material. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's oh, I know one more thing.  We haven't done what James Bond uses an Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Change. Oh, yeah, we haven't done change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Oh, the change log.  You want to do it, ladies and gentlemen, do it.  The change log.  The Google change log says it again.  Yes. Each and every week,  Gina Trapani will tell you things that are new with the Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now Gina Trapani new in the Google verse.  Starting today, documents, spreadsheets and presentations  in Google Drive are now called Docs, Sheets and Slides.  And there are apps for them in the Chrome Web Store.  So actually, if you just go follow Google Drive plus Google Drive and Google Plus,  you can get links to all the apps.  All they do is add shortcuts in a new tab in Chrome to get right to Sheets, Slides,  drawings, forms and other kind of Google Drive apps.  So instead of just that one Google Drive Chrome app, you've got individual ones.  Google Calendar for Android just became available in the Play Store.  This is kind of interesting.  I mean, Google Calendar is generally shipped on Google branded phones  and it comes kind of built in.  Now it's available in the Play Store.  So if you have Jelly Bean or ICS installed on any handset,  you can install Google Calendar from the Play Store.  Although be warned, there are some known issues with HTC handsets.  The week and the day view doesn't quite work.  Google lists those known issues on the Play Store listing, actually.  So this is kind of interesting.  I wonder if Google's ever going to release, say, the Gmail app to the Play Store.  And I wonder if this means that someday we'll see these kind of stock  Google apps that we all love so much show up in places like the Amazon app store.  I don't know. But interesting to see them unbundle it and  and make it available in the Play Store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, I don't understand.  Doesn't doesn't the Gmail app get sent with every Amazon phone or Android phone?  But no, the Gmail does, but not the calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the so right now, I mean, I mean, in the Google version of Android.  So it's not the Android open source project.  So that's why you don't get it on these other interesting  Google version of Android that ships with Google services.  So the Play Store itself, you know, comes the Gmail, Gmail comes  and get calendar used to be one of these built in apps.  Now calendar is available in the Play Store.  So they've kind of unmuddled it and said, if you buy a phone, that's not a,  you know, Google experience phone, you can still and you have access to the Play Store.  You can download calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or if you're not in the open handset alliance because you're making a clone of Android,  you could just download all the tools and it would be just as good.  Right. Got it.  I wonder if that's really what Google wants to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder.  I wonder if it'd be interesting to see if they start offering all those bundled apps  like like the Gmail app.  The more users the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess. Why wouldn't they?  The calendar is fairly sparse.  It's not a great. I mean, there's other.  In fact, maybe for my tool, I'll show you my favorite calendar.  Oh, yeah. I like the calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's OK. It's a new icon, too.  Oh, with this change.  Yeah, it's got a little turning little corner going up.  Turning page. Yeah. Yeah.  Google adds 25 million new building footprints to Google Maps on desktop and mobile.  Building footprints are just not when you're in satellite mode,  but when you're just sort of in plain drawing mode in Google Maps,  you can see the footprints of buildings.  The areas that got the update are major cities,  U.S. cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami.  The company uses aerial imagery and computer vision techniques  to determine the shapes and sizes of the buildings.  Some neat little updates Google Maps there.  Google News gets a little bit of redesign.  Click to expand clusters.  So when you search Google News and you get a bunch of links,  they kind of cluster together and you can expand them.  And there's a new, you know, sidebars of photos and videos.  It's kind of like tech mime-ish layout.  And finally, Google Books Ngram Viewer.  This is a cool, cool product.  They take all the books that they scan in Google Books,  then Ngram Viewer lets you type in a couple of keywords  and see the frequency of use of those words over time.  That got a huge, a big data set update.  It's got a much larger data set and it understands parts of speech.  So if you use a word as a noun versus a verb,  you can get results on that.  Ngram Viewer is this kind of really nerdy, obscure tool  for people who really love data.  It only gets used like 50 times a minute,  which is a lot, I guess, to the whole world,  but not really to Google. It's really cool, though.  If you check out Ngram Viewer,  you can look at the instances of the way  that certain words are used over time.  And with this bigger data set, it's got smarter results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty cool.  I think we talked about it when it first came out.  We demoed it, played with it.  Yep, we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the Change Log.  Tune in each week to find out what's new with the Google.  Thank you, Gina Trapani.  We now have an open and a close.  I think we need a middle thing.  I know what we need. If somebody wants to work on something,  like we could count a bullet for each one.  Like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're going to lose the hell out of this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will soon have its own YouTube channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Change Log.  So James Bond uses an Android phone.  I was always wondering, is James Bond,  is he shaken, not stirred?  Is he an iPhone, not Android?  But remember that Sony, in fact, you've already seen  Sony ads featuring Daniel Craig, which I just find kind of weird.  Yeah.  But anyway, but Sony makes the movie, right?  So it's going to be bios all throughout.  And apparently in Skyfall,  James Bond uses an Android phone.  It's an Xperia T, which is, of course, Sony.  And you'll be able to win one.  There's some sort of contest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Somebody uses it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. You guys see the Coke commercial, by the way, for Skyfall?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, off topic, but it's hilarious.  If you search for the Coke commercial  for Skyfall, it's pretty funny.  They set these people up.  They went to a to a vending machine and they said, oh, if you go do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's a Coke Zero.  Yeah, it's a Coke Zero thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they had people playing the music.  So they made them run through the mall or something.  And as they were running, there was people actually playing instruments,  playing the music.  Unlock the 007 in you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is this? It's some British train station?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know exactly where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some guys, gals playing the violin, guys sweeping the floor.  There's a bunch of oranges.  And then he goes to a Coke machine and it says,  want the chance to, oh, by the way, he gets out of the way cleverly.  And she starts playing the Bond theme, says you want to.  So it's giving the machines like talking to you.  Enter your name, David, go to platform six.  You have 70 seconds to unlock the 007 in you.  Sixty nine, sixty eight.  She's playing the song.  Sounds easy. That's why we made it harder.  Oh, this is so funny.  So there's so the guy mopping turns out to be in the way. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As well as a bunch of other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then there's now some vocalese.  Oh, my God, Anthony. Oh, my God, Mike.  How are you?  But don't you remember a beautiful woman in a red dress costing him  some joggers going the wrong way on the escalator?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's people just standing there holding little boards  that tell the time how much time a lot of dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is really do you think they really did this or is this staged?  It'd be really good if they actually did it.  Big plate of glass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, and of course, I was hoping to see someone go through there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The oranges spill.  He falls on him.  This is hysterical.  Thirty nine. She's got an iPad or an Exis seven with the time.  Does Sony have a tablet?  No, I don't think Sony does.  He gets the luggage falls over the organ grinder.  Wow, this is quite elaborate.  This is kind of like, oh, and he gets to like a Zoltan.  Sing the Bond tune to get exclusive tickets.  It's not too hard to even playing it the whole right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you don't know it by now, you're in big trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the audience. That's pretty cute.  That's it's kind of a new kind of flash mob.  And so he gets some tickets.  All he gets is tickets to a movie for all of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it when companies get creative, though.  I mean, you notice you didn't really at least I didn't notice.  Coke wasn't in every scene.  You know, it wasn't like, oh, I love Coke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so great. I thought it was an ad for Skyfall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, they teamed up and they did something creative.  They could spread around the web virally and I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well done.  Now I'm going to do a boring.  I love you know what I love about this show that I play ads and then I do an ad.  Perfect timing.  And then and then you enjoy it all.  I hope I hope I hope I hope we're talking about the goog.  There's lots more to talk about. Holy cow.  In fact, I'm going to ask during the break  if you guys just pick a few because we're running out of time.  We've spent a long time talking about a few things.  So pick a few.  Each of you pick a few stories that you think are important.  Google Wallet sued for patent infringement.  News.me dumping Twitter or vice versa, I guess.  Dumping iOS.  Zynga firing a bunch of people during the Apple announcement yesterday.  So no one would notice.  And Minnesota will allow online courses.  After all, that was just a weird story.  Before we do all of that, though, let's talk about where your money is.  Now, normally I wouldn't get this personal with you,  but I have to ask, are you are you maximizing your online savings?  American Express Bank, FSB, has high interest savings account,  high yield savings account waiting for you.  It's a great way to get the maximum savings.

I was 25 when I got mine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's kind of like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be 72.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Could be 72.  No, I'd be 70.  How old are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I graduated early.  You're a young man with a vision of the future.  Involved Chromebooks, apparently.  Little did you know that 30 years later, 38 years later,  you'd be owning a $250 computer more powerful than a mainframe.  All right, Gina, what did you pick as your next story?  I'm letting you do the work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to talk about this Amazon wiping this person's Kindle.  Did you guys hear about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we actually talked about it on Security Now.  I'm really glad you brought it up.  Actually, Jeff tweeted it.  That's how I found out about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it was the same day.  This story broke off on the same day at the EC2 outage.  I saw a lot of tweets about how the promise of the cloud is, you know,  that the cloud is dead, the cloud doesn't work.  This is the dangers of the cloud.  And the EC2 outage and the Kindle deletion were two kind of very separate issues.  They just happened to both be Amazon.  So, you know, it's interesting.  I mean, should we be telling our family members to not buy Kindle books  because, you know, Amazon could just remotely wipe your device  if they decide that your account is, you know, doesn't look good to them?  I don't know if that's the solution.  I mean, should we expect people to back up their Kindle books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me give you the background, folks, so you can decide this.  And I think it was there was the truth is we don't know it could be apocryphal.  I should say this right up front because we don't know the actual person  to whom this happened.  Supposedly her name is Lynn. She's Norwegian.  She had a Kindle and we learned about it.  Actually, it's Lynn Nygaard. We do now know her name.  She's an IT consultant living in Norway.  And there was a blog post by another person describing what happened to her.  But unfortunately, it's in Norwegian.  But apparently what happened was that Amazon had identified her account  in the UK as being associated with a previously banned account for,  banned for reasons they wouldn't say.  And not only discontinued her account, but we're told wiped her Kindle.  Now, I've heard later stories that their Kindle was broken,  but because she didn't have an account,  she couldn't then use Kindle on anything, you know,  or Kindle app on anything else and get the books back.  For whatever reason, all the books that she had previously thought she owned were gone.  And her attempts to get Amazon to explain or return it were not handled very well.  Amazon said, we can't tell you. We won't tell you.  But that's just, you know, how it is.  It was something to do with an account you're associated with.  And we won't tell you who or why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then there was a follow up that said that her access to the books she'd already bought was restored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not that they needed to. And this is the point.  And it's probably important to read the license.  Kindle content is licensed, not sold to you by the content provider.  Your rights, it's licensed, not sold.  Your rights under this agreement will automatically terminate  if you fail to comply with the terms of this agreement.  In case of such termination, you must cease all use of the Kindle store and the Kindle content.  And Amazon may immediately revoke your access to the Kindle store and the Kindle content.  In other words, your books.  As you said, Leo, on Twitter, when is a book not a book?  Yeah. And so my kind of attitude towards this is that we just assume that a Kindle book is the same as that book on my shelf.  It's not. It's not. It's more like music.  Yeah. It's like iTunes music. Yeah.  And it's good to know Amazon not only can kill your account, but can reach into your Kindle and erase everything that's on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not quite like iTunes music, right?  Because you download that and you store it and it doesn't necessarily have DRM on it, right?  Those are files that are on your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Now it doesn't anymore have DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. It doesn't anymore have it. It did. It did at some point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, you have to, you still download it, but you download it on, and you could download it.  I mean, if I look at my Android phone, I could see the files, the mobile files that are downloaded.  So you are downloading content and you could back it up and store it somewhere, but without a Kindle account, active Kindle account, you couldn't read it.  You'd have to strip the DRM out first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to strip the DRM off. Right. Right.  So I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And which would be illegal, by the way. You've already agreed. I don't own this book. I'm just licensing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Right. So my mother-in-law, a voracious reader, we got her a Kindle. She absolutely loves it.  And for someone like her, she's never going to strip the DRM. You know, she's never going to back up.  And if something like this happened to her, she would lose a lot of content.  And so I think it's important to... I think that that leasing versus buying is a very important distinction.  And for me, it's like, okay, I'm... you know, this is for throwaway books. This is for books I'm going to read once.  And then, you know, I don't care. I might lose.  Although I take a lot of notes on my Kindle as well. I highlight a lot of stuff from books. So this story really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we heard this before. It's not the first time we've heard it. Remember the 1984 case where somebody had a copy of 1984.  They had heavily annotated it. Amazon deleted the... it turned out to be an illicit copy.  I can't remember whether some reason, but Amazon deleted it. And then all their notes, and they never did recover all their notes.  Right. Yeah. So that's not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a matter of principle, right? Do you... it's the same problem. Do you...  After all this fight about copyright, at least let us buy something and actually own it.  And that's... if that's the essence of copyright is that you get some right to it, that's been taken away too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I agree that should change, but I should also... I would also say that everybody should understand that when you're not buying a book...  And so don't be surprised if it doesn't continue. And we've talked about this a couple of months ago where what happens is you die.  If you have a library of books, you don't give it to your heirs. You can't give your iTunes music or your Amazon books to your heirs. It's not yours to give.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or Henry Blodgett today too was saying that I was doing my Nexus 7 whoring, pushing those people going bananas about the new iPad.  And Henry said, but I've got my family has all these books and all these movies and things on Apple.  And basically it becomes the business model like airlines and cable companies. You're prisoned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lock in. Yeah. Yeah, it's just your content. You don't want to lose your content. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't know whether this case is real or not. It looked pretty real. The emails back and forth.  I did email Amazon personally and asked them for response. I got none.  One of the sites in Scandinavia that reported this said they got response and put that up.  But I don't know because I never got to Amazon, so I'm not going to fully judge. I wish they'd respond to me. They haven't done that.  I said I was on the show. But I think it's one of those cases where, you know, I hate to say it this way, but true or not, it is a reminder of what we're buying into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And the average user is not going to know that. Right. I mean, I mean, to your point, Leo, the average user is not going to know that it's a just like with music.  I mean, people get in trouble with music. It's like you have a license to listen to the music. You do not own the music, obviously.  Same thing here with books. I think it's going to trip a lot of average users up eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Amazon certainly I encourage them to contact us. You could contact chat at Twitter TV or me, Leo at leoville.com.  And we'll put you on. But I will. I'll channel them. You didn't you read the Terms of Service? It said very clearly you don't own that book and then we can erase it.  Why would you ever think you owned that book? And that's and it's just a confusion between the 20th, the old 20th century way of disseminating information in the modern 21st century way.  You got the convenience of the Kindle. It's the ease of use. You get the portability. But in return, you don't actually own a book.  I mean, if you've ever moved and you have thousands of books, you know that that's it. That's an onerous burden. We've eliminated that burden for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hmm. But the real issue here, I think it's somewhat of a real issue. One is one is lawyers in terms of service, obviously.  And I was at a good session yesterday at the Ford Foundation about helping media.  And Andrew Ruscha was there from New York talking about the effort to make sites link to plain language, crowdsourced versions of their Terms of Service before you sign into a TOS say, what are you agreeing to?  And a link there and go off to someplace where it's been reworded in short English. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do have to say that I'm now I'm looking at Amazon and Fifty Shades of Grey and it does say buy now. Right.  I mean, it's saying I'm well, wait a minute. Now let's look in the Kindle. Wait a minute. Let's look. So that's for the book.  All of the wording is that you are. I now with one click. So I'm buying. Well, it looks like I already bought it. Never mind. I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  License this content now. Yeah, I should say it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would say there is a burden on Amazon and at some point somebody's going to have to tell Amazon to do this to be to change your language.  I'm sorry. I'm very clear. You're not buying this. You're renting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo in leather out of my head now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was an instruction manual. What I didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Friends of mine with a Kindle went out and actually bought the hard copy of that book with cash because they didn't want anybody to have a record that they had bought that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just announced to the world that I only. Well, you know, actually, Gina, the argument is I only read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It sold so well is because people could hide the fact that they're reading it in a Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right on the Kindle. You know, this story, not only is it the issue of leasing versus buying, but if you read through the customer service emails, I mean, Amazon was basically saying your account was associated with another account that broke our policies.  This woman asked what account and they wouldn't tell her.  So and I feel like that's just a reasonable kind of expectation to say if you're going to shut down my account, you have to give me you got to give me something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got to give me some. Yes. Or there. But there may be legal reasons they couldn't tell her, for instance.  So sometimes. OK, I'll give you an example. And I don't know if this is germane or not.  But if somebody calls me and asks me why the employee was terminated, I can't say, well, he was the biggest schmuck ever.  I have to say I can't say anything about that. I can merely say he used to work here and he's no longer works here because of liability to you for liability reasons.  And so I suspect that the lawyers at Amazon, there's no Amazon's not trying to obfuscate, but they've been told don't you can't talk about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'll still go to Gina's trying to do the right thing, which is go over the principle of rights here.  The principle should be that you have a right of appeal. If you're being accused of having some wrongdoing and you have real material loss to this.  Same as same as if I've argued with Google that when you when you get shut out as a presumed to be a bad advertiser, I've said that they ought to have a jury of peers to judge you.  There should be some mechanism of appeal. That's expensive. I know.  But it's exactly the same Leo with every time you get knocked off YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should. However, I just have to point out they're very clear in their terms of service and their license.  They're they're not doing anything that they are not absolutely entitled to do.  And they don't say we have to explain it. In fact, I think they explicitly did not just read it. They explicitly said we don't have to explain it.  I know. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is where the FTC, John Lewis, the head of the FTC, was at this thing yesterday.  And that's the point made when Verizon comes along and said recently, when you're one of our customers on the phone, we are going to watch your browser history.  We're going to do this. We're going to do that. And we're going to sell it to people.  And yeah, you can opt out if you go through about 87 steps, hoops of fire and glass.  But as long as they told you they're going to do it, then as noxious as it might be, there's absolutely no liability.  The problem is it's hidden in a TOS. So I think what we what what what again, if this case is real or not, it forces a discussion about about about terms of services again.  And we've got to figure out a better way to deal with making that public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cory Doctorow does talk a little bit about what it speculates a little bit about what's going on and has to do with an English language book contracts.  It's almost always the case countries where English isn't the native or official language are quote open territory.  That means if a writer sells her English language rights in Canada and the US to Macmillan, the UK to Penguin, both Penguin and Macmillan are legally allowed to sell competing versions to Norway.  However, the universal approach taken by ebook retailers is to pretend that open territory doesn't exist.  If no publisher is registered as the exclusive provider in an area, the retailers refuse to sell to people in those countries.  So it may very well be that Amazon said you're in Norway, you bought the English version.  You can't do that and just erased it.  That sounds that sounds that sounds like something they might do.  Yeah. I don't know.  It's anyway, there's all sorts of reasons they might do it.  There's even reasons why they may not be able to or may not want be willing to explain it.  And so people I think it's a bit certainly behooves them just morally and ethically to be very clear.  And maybe there should be a pop up saying, hey, by the way, you're not buying this book.  You're just reading it.  And if we decide to terminate your rights, it's gone.  Or at least the first time you buy a book. Right.  I mean, the first time they do. I mean, they say they do.  They have it in terms of service. Don't you read that?  Amazing. Come on.  I love the South Park episode where the Apple terms of service allowed us to enslave you.  And didn't you read the terms of service? I read the terms of service.  It's a very good send up. It's kind of foul. That was a very good send up.  OK. Good. Good choice. Thank you, Gina.  Sure. Jeff Jarvis, what's your story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right. I've got to go to my European friends.  And it's not the fact that Google and Nokia and other companies entered into an agreement to start a service so that you can blur your house on maps.  I won't. I won't go to that. I won't do that.  I won't do it. And we just be too obvious.  Yeah, it would be. But now that there are publishers in Germany and France and Brazil all threatening to pull their stuff from Google and try to get laws passed to charge them.  Google finally is fighting back. And in France, they sent a letter to a bunch of government ministers saying that this would be deadly.  It would kill them and basically threatening. If they're told they have to pay for the links, they'll just stop linking publishers.  And they send four billion links to media in France alone in a month. And I think it's high time for Google to fight back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Talking about cutting off your nose to spite your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like this. We might do the whole show this way. You just pick a story, pick a story, pick a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a good way to do it. Yeah. Why should I do any work?  Aaron, did you pick a story?  I did, actually. And this is about Google Maps. So Google Maps has started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they actually previewed this at Google I.O.  They're walking cameras that they backpack cameras.  Yeah. And they can walk around trails and things like that where you wouldn't normally obviously get a car or the tricycle.  And so right now they're doing the Grand Canyon, which I thought was really cool.  They're starting with the Grand Canyon. It makes sense.  And they're going to be walking around with these cameras and doing basically Google Maps for trails.  And if you haven't seen these things, they're really interesting.  They've got the soccer ball camera looking thing on the back.  And it's painted Google colors.  Yes, of course. Yeah. And it's the nice Android green there.  Leo would buy one if he could.  I would. Are you kidding? I'd love to walk around with that.  They say they're 40 pounds. They weigh about 40 pounds.  So can you imagine going up and down the Grand Canyon with 40 pounds on your back?  That's hefty.  So yeah, they actually said I was listening to an NPR story on this this morning and they said that they specifically picked people to wear these things.  They had to like pass a little bit of a physical apparently.  I would think they'd want to hire people, guides who walk around there all the time, right? Or strong, tough.  Yeah, they're probably there too, but they're just not wearing the backpacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But and the really cool thing about this too is they have Android apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd never seen this before.  But they actually have Android apps that talk to the backpacks and they can control what's going on with the cameras and the system and monitor the heat and all this kind of stuff with an app that they built that runs right on Android.  So they're walking around with a thing on their back, but they're looking down at their phone.  Hopefully they don't fall off the edge.  Actually, one of these guys is a Google engineer.  Yep.  And it takes it to capture the image of the guy on the phone.  And it's a really cool thing.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, one of these guys is a Google engineer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it takes it captures images every two and a half seconds.  Fifteen cameras, five megapixels each.  Holy cow.  That must be incredible.  Yeah, it's incredible.  It's a technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And can you imagine like I can't wait till these actual images of Grand Canyon come out.  It's going to be really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a good way for Google again to get some lock in because the more of this they do, the harder it is for Apple or anybody else to do it.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish they'd use it for some news events.  Oh, yeah.  Wouldn't that be cool?  Really get amazing, amazing perspectives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think?  Okay, we got an election coming up in the US in a couple of weeks, I hear.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there going to be some interesting?  There's the Google CNN campaign explorer.  You're going to talk about that, Gene, in a bit.  But is there but do you think technology is going to change how we participate in election night or in election day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think it did have an effect on the debates.  I think the fact that we can vote early in many states and I vote absentee.  I'm going to be in Azerbaijan that week.  You know, I think that some of it's kind of over.  I don't know, election night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a great piece in the Sunday Times last Sunday about how if you if you if you can look at search information, you can you know a lot more about the election than any pollster could know because people lie to pollsters.  But they don't lie to Google.  And you could tell from what they're searching for.  You know, that's interesting.  That's interesting, Leo.  For instance, Paul Ryan shirtless is Googled nine times more often than Paul Ryan budget.  See, people would never admit that is so depressing.  And Paul, now this is weird because Paul Ryan shirtless is Googled more often in blue states than red states.  So apparently Democrats are just sexist as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he had these beefcake shots.  Are there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Didn't he do some kind of goofy photo shoot at some point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because he does all that PX 90 stuff, right?  Or does he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, see that I have to say, Romney Ryan is probably the best looking ticket ever in the history of presidential elections.  I mean, those are two handsome guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, girl, let's get fiscal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She found the she found the tumblr.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, Leo, Leo, throw this out.  I will bet you now that two people in this country already know who's going to be president.  And those two people are Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg.  I think you're right.  They have data.  And they really you can't really do anything with it because it would seem to then be having an impact.  Right.  Star Trek Prime Directive.  I'll bet they bet you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bet you're right.  They are from the future and they're not allowed to tell us.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, some of these things are sometimes hard to gauge, though, too, like the influence of social media in general.  Since we're in a time zone, we have different time zones in the country as things happen.  And it's always been this way even on TV.  But I wonder how much more so social media will have an impact this year as things are happening, as polls are closing in various eastern time zones and things like that.  And then they start moving forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In 2008, how frequently people in a state searched for Obama jokes almost perfectly predicted Obama's vote share.  I'm sorry, John McCain's vote share.  In other words, the more they searched for Obama jokes, the more likely McCain was going to win that state.  And I just want to point out that Romney jokes are very popular in Iowa and Ohio.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leading indicators.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it depends who you're for.  It's bad if you're a Romney fan.  It's good if you're an Obama fan.  I got the reverse.  No, yeah, because they're searching for Romney jokes.  It means that these swing states may go Obama.  Got it.  And the problem is, you know, the polls are all over the place.  You can't because people lie.  They say, oh, yeah, I'm going to vote.  And they don't vote.  You know, there was a there was a Shark Week rerun and they had to stay home and watch that.  You can't vote.  There's sharks on TV.  What are you crazy?  Anyway, this is I really I read this article.  I thought it was very interesting.  But I think you I think you nailed it.  I think Jeff, I think you I think Larry and Mark know already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I've become a devotee of the FiveThirtyEight blog of the New York Times.  I love Nate Silver.  He's just really great and does wonderful things on.  Have you had a date on triangulation?  No, let's get him.  Chad, make a note.  Thank you.  He'd be gradually elections over his little busy right now.  He's busy.  But but going to you know, using whatever historical data is available and going across multiple sources and then trying to give a percentage prediction of what's what.  I would love to unleash Nate Silver on to Google data and also Cam Cam Marlowe.  Right.  At Facebook.  X, X, Yahoo, Cameron Marlowe, I think it is right.  Who's there?  Who's their stats guy?  Their social stats guy.  You know, incredible data that's going to go on there.  And when they get enough elections under their belt, as it's been said, not just presidential elections, but also more frequent House and Senate elections, you'll start to be able to see patterns that will become.  If your Fitbit can predict when you're going to, you know, get a heart attack, then it's going to predict the country's vote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, there's just so much more data available right now.  I mean, if you're a statistician or a pollster, you know, over the next over the past, like, four or eight years, I mean, you must be pulling your hair out.  I don't know if you send this through a MapReduce engine or what, but there's just so much more data right now to analyze than there ever was before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why Nate's having such fun.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to get to our tool.  This is an apropos segue into our tool tip and number of the week, starting with you, Gina Tripani, and your tool of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google and CNN launched Google's new campaign explorer.  If you go to google.com slash elections, there's a link there for explorer.  It lets you visualize ad spending, fundraising, candidate travel from the presidential campaigns, the US presidential campaigns on an electoral map, which is pretty cool.  There's some really good neat data here.  This is for developers.  It's a really neat HTML 5 app for political junkies.  Just neat to see what's going on.  You can dive into data for a state, compare multiple states.  You can save and share snapshots with your own insights.  So it's cool.  You can kind of just click around the map and see what's happening with it with the different candidates in different states and compare and everything's in red and blue.  And it's really pretty and snappy.  And Leo is demonstrating right now.  Yeah, actually, Chad is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Colorado versus Ohio.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Colorado versus Ohio.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  This is just great.  Boy, is that neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fundraising and travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Very cool.  Campaign Explorer.  Easiest to find at google.com slash elections, which is kind of a big elections news page.  But up there in the menu, there's a list of things, including YouTube Live Explorer.  What are they going to do with YouTube Live?  But YouTube really is getting into those.  They've got all the debates, but I imagine they'll do campaign coverage, too.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know a lot of people who watch the debates on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did a lot after the fact or live after.  Yeah, both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tried both.  I tried to watch them live when I had time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to be here because I'm going to Australia, but we're going to do I think we're going to do election night coverage, but not like of like, you know, who's winning.  But of I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to do some stories about like, yeah, what the tech what's happened with the tech will probably use this google.com election slash elections tool.  Interesting.  That'll be with Tom Merritt, Justin Robert Young, a few other people.  Nice.  That'll be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Justin Robert Young is our John Stewart.  Yeah.  He will add the comedy side to that.  Very nice tool.  Thank you, Gina.  How about a number from you, Mr. Jarvis?  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could go with the fact that Iceland's voters approved their crowd source constitution to go to the next step.  That's amazing.  That's just wonderful.  I also love that there are the 66% of the half of Iceland's 235,000 qualified voters.  So it's it's a town, but I'll do this instead.  You gov has the top brands for right and left.  So the top brand for Democrats.  Yeah.  Followed by Amazon Cheerios, Clorox and Craftsman.  I guess that's because we work hard.  I use all of those.  Yeah.  The Republicans.  Okay.  Top brand.  You get one guess.  Fox News.  Fox News.  Fox News.  Okay.  Followed by the History Channel, followed by Craftsman, followed by Chick-fil-A.  We know why that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Chick-fil-A.  How funny.  So Craftsman was in, did you say Craftsman was in both?  It was both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was also in the independent voters.  I think that's kind of a blue collar thing, right?  People actually still work for their...  I'm a Stanley guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm more of a Stanley guy than Craftsman.  Craftsman's okay.  Or steel.  I like steel.  You think Craftsman's better?  Okay.  So Lisa, who's, you know, very handy, says she says Craftsman's better.  Interesting.  John, do you have an opinion on tools?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Craftsman's lifetime guarantee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Craftsman's lifetime guarantee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I didn't even know that.  I just buy whatever the hell I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm surprised Coke wasn't on this list.  Yeah, what about average brands?  It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's you, Gavin.  I don't know what their methodology was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can tell you Apple is definitely leftist.  Yeah.  It has Levi is left.  Levi too.  It's in San Francisco.  Yeah.  Cami.  Cami.  Beautiful.  Cami Town, USA.  Craftsman.  Chat room's now telling me Craftsman's a lifetime warranty.  Apparently I'm just out of it.  Leo, Leo, Leo.  If a Craftsman tool breaks, Sears will replace it free.  See, everybody's nodding.  Like, yeah, that's common knowledge.  Craftsman's the Chromebook of tools.  Aaron, do you...  Maybe that's it.  I'm just a snob.  That's what...  People have been telling me this on Twitter all week that I'm a snob.  And I guess I am.  I'm a snob.  And proud of it.  I guess.  I don't know.  I'm just better than you all.  Does that make me a snob?  If that makes me a snob, so be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you know that Tupperware will do the lifetime guarantee thing too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tupperware too?  Yeah, Leo.  How do you know that, Chad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have Tupperware and if it breaks, you send it back.  It doesn't burp right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  How do you know it's broken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have cups from the 70s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And someone's like, hey, if those go bad, just send them back.  Like, if they stain...  I have cups that are older than you, Chad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they stain or if they crack.  You don't want to crack a cup.  Yeah.  So, Mr. Aaron Newcomb, I'm going to give you the chance to do a number, tool, a tip,  anything you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, I'm going to do an app.  An app would be great.  Can I do that?  So, I'm going to show you an app that I wrote in App Inventor.  I think you guys have talked about App Inventor before.  They stopped doing that, right?  They moved it to MIT.  So, MIT is running it.  So, MIT is doing it.  Yeah, they're running with it now and they've got a lot of great tutorials.  So, my daughter is being a robot for Halloween.  And I thought, wouldn't it be cool?  Actually, I think it was ThinkGeek came out with this stomp panic thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about that yesterday in the GizWiz.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I said, well, I'll just write an app to do the same thing.  Using the accelerator and the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Using the accelerometer.  Now, this is a beta version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I made it just good enough to work for my daughter, basically.  But you can get this on the market.  And it took me about 24 hours to put it together.  You put it on the market?  It's on the market.  It's called SoundShaker.  I'm not trying to advertise the app, but my point is that if you haven't tried App Inventor,  you should really try it because it's a really, really good learning tool.  Now, you're a professional programmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a hobbyist programmer.  I don't program as part of my day job.  But it took me no time.  I had never used it before.  Everything is like little puzzle pieces that fit together.  The if-then statements are little blocks.  And it all fits together.  What's it called?  Sound?  SoundShaker.  I found FartShaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there it is.  Aaron Nuko.  The red speaker icon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's a very nice icon.  So, what you do is you just pick a sound on your phone.  Yeah.  And hold your phone the way it will be when you, you know, like a starting position and  hit calibrate and that'll kind of load those, load the values in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, pick a sound.  So, let me see what the choices are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you have ES File Explorer, by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you have to have ES File Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's unfortunate.  I can't get around that.  So, try it with mine.  So, let's do it over here.  We'll do it this way.  I've got the sound loaded.  I've calibrated it based on that angle right there that you're holding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you did robot step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  So, now hit start.  Start.  Now, if you shake it, it should, let's see if it works.  Live demo.  Oh, it's on mute.  It's on mute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turn it up.  It sounds not turned up because you're on a show right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  Trying to be a good guest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do I turn up the sound on this thing?  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  There it goes.  Oh, it's making noise.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you shake it too often, there you go.  Now it's going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, it's pretty good.  I just point out that everybody in our live studio audience has their phone out and is  downloading that.  So, I mean.  A bunch of Android users out there.  That's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a really simple little app.  It's not guaranteed to work every time.  I just got it to the point where I could make it work for.  But the point is, is if you're in education or you want to teach programming and you want  a simple way to do it, go look at App Inventor.  They've got some great tutorials and the simple videos and walkthroughs.  You really should go look at it because it's a great way, I think anyway, to teach programming  to kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, there you go.  Very, very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm glad MIT has taken good care of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They seem to be the one thing that they haven't done that I really hope they do is the ability  to export the code so that it actually can be imported into.  You can export the code, but it's not importable into something like Eclipse or the Android  SDK.  So, if they do that, I think it would be great because I think kids are going to get into  this and they're going to say, oh, now I want to go do something really complicated  that they might not be able to do in App Inventor and they're going to get stymied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, you mentioned, I'll just do this real quickly because by the way, triangulation  is coming up.  Jonathan Abrams is here.  Remember who that is?  He created Friendster.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, and he's back with actually a really cool, you'll be interested in this, Jeff,  social news site called Nuzzle.  Yeah, I've heard of it, but I haven't gotten into it yet.  I'm eager to watch.  I check it every day now.  I love Nuzzle.  So, Jonathan Abrams will be joining us.  But meanwhile, I said I would mention, now I did try the Google Calendar and it's nice.  I mean, it's fine.  And I've been using S Planner because I use Samsung phones and that's the calendar that  comes with it.  I ended up buying and it wasn't cheap.  I think it was five, maybe 10 bucks, something called Business Calendar, very generic name.  But I like it.  A broad variety of widgets, which is very important to me.  In fact, the widgets let you create and set new appointments on it.  It has a variety of views, which is always great.  The month view is as you would expect, except that it's doing little colors here so you  can kind of get an idea.  You could pick individual calendars, turn them off and on from the month view.  It even has a year view.  You could select calendars.  But I particularly like it.  I use the agenda view.  I particularly like it because of the choice of widgets.  And I just also think it's a little bit prettier than I can select a period of time and then  we'll show that.  It's just a little bit prettier than the generic Google Calendar and has a lot of functionality,  which is fantastic.  So, it's called Business Calendar.  I'm not sure how much it is.  There it is.  All right.  I've tried a lot.  Calendoo, which seems very popular.  I don't like very much aesthetics mostly.  But I think this is a pretty good business calendar.  That's it.  Now, Lizard77.
