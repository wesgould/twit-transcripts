Transcript:  Howdy.  It's going great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good to see you, Tom.  Good to see you too.  And Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com.  How you doing, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm pink as always.  I'm going to figure out this damn camera thing, but I haven't figured it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Believe us.  Jeff is in the pink.  We're very happy also to be joined by Douglas Edwards, former Googler and author of the  book, I'm Feeling Lucky, the Confessions of Google Employee Number 59.  Welcome, Doug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now I was thrown into this at the last minute, so I'm ill-prepared.  I'm hoping Gina and Jeff can save me in talking to you, Doug.  But Employee Number 59, just to get us started, explain where that fit in.  What was that like?  What were you doing when you started at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I had been working for the San Jose Mercury News for seven and a half years and  was doing brand management for online products for them when I left.  Came to Google expecting that it would be different from the Mercury News, which is  a 150-year-old night reader corporate entity.  So I showed up at Google for the interview and of course Sergey Brin interviewed me and  was wearing his roller skates and his hockey shorts and his hockey t-shirt and had already  come in from playing outside.  Didn't bother to take a shower first, which I appreciated.  And it was a completely different feel right from the interview on.  The questions he asked and then the experience of actually joining the company was quite  different from what I had expected, even knowing that in Silicon Valley it was going to be  different from what I had left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so the book itself is just a tell-all of all the secrets behind Google and what  makes them so fantastically successful?  Or is it just a tell-all?  Not all.  It's a tell-some.  It's a tell-some.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a little bit of a history of the company in terms of the major decisions that  they made around certain product launches.  But more than that, it's my tale of how it felt to be part of Google when it was  fewer than 60 people.  It's hard to explain just talking about it, but it was a very unusual place to be in terms  of the energy level of the people who were there, what they were trying to accomplish,  certainly the personalities of the founders and the other engineers, made it unique in  my experience.  And it was just my attempt to capture in words how that felt, which you had to kind of have  been there to really experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You started there in 1999 when you could probably all fit in one picture.  And then you left in 2005 when the place was gargantuan.  What was it like when you left?  Did you feel like you were jumping ship too early?  Did you feel like it was the right time?  And why did you leave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Certainly the right time for me.  And there were confluence of different trends that happened to come together.  At that point in time, I'd already been there for more than five years.  And so five years of working startup hours started to take a toll on me.  And I had three children at home that I hadn't seen all that much of and decided they would  like to see more of.  But also the corporate culture was shifting.  My boss, who had been there from the beginning, also left at the end of 2004.  And she and I were very simpatico.  And when she left, I was going to be reorganized into a different part of the company that was  a lot more metrics driven and less, I don't want to say less fun, but certainly less focused on  the things that I enjoyed doing from a brand management standpoint.  So between that and the time commitment and the fact that Google had gone public and  because of the shares I own, I no longer had the burning urgency or need to  generate a paycheck every month.  It seemed like a good time to make a transition out.  Have you sold your shares?  I sold most of them, yes.  You did?  Yeah, probably earlier than I should have.  But for me, it was a simple equation.  I mean, having known Larry and Sergey as the kind of guys who like to go helicopter skiing  and take unreasonable risks, I decided it was probably a good idea to  take the burden of the hand instead of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Didn't you give a book talk at the Plex like two weeks ago?  I did, yeah.  So how has the reaction been to the book from inside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google has been great all the way through this.  They've really helped me out in terms of providing access to current Google staff.  And a lot of the people I worked with are still there and I wanted to talk to them.  And Google could have made it very difficult for me.  They could have said, no, we're not going to provide you access to these people.  Or because of the non-disclosure agreement I signed as an employee,  they could have said, you can't write about it at all.  Sure.  And they didn't do any of that.  So I was really quite happy.  And then the reaction, for the most part, from the people I've talked to,  has been very positive.  They did invite me back on campus to give a Google talk.  And so the reaction has been much better than I actually anticipated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love that the book is...  I'm sorry, Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sorry, Jeff.  I was going to say I really enjoyed the book.  I liked the conversational tone.  You kind of come at it as this kind of regular guy.  And you imagine that the first 60 employees of Google were sort of 20-something,  just graduated engineers.  But you were 41, I think, at the time when you started.  And you were marketing.  So you were kind of coming at it from, hey, I've been covering all these startups.  I wanted to find the next big thing.  And I wound up at Google.  And the title, I'm Feeling Lucky, was that kind of...  There was some irony there that this just sort of happened by chance  from some of the anecdotes that you tell.  It sounds that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish I could claim this incredible foresight in picking Google  among all of the startups that I talked to.  But it really just kind of worked out that they were the ones who offered me  the job that seemed most interesting.  And I had talked to Yahoo and they offered me a position, but it just didn't feel...  Oh, are you lucky?  I already felt in 1999, like the moment it passed,  Yahoo was clearly a very large company.  And I really wanted to get in on a small company.  And I found out that the reason they were even hiring marketing people  is because somebody on the board had told them that you need some marketing people.  You need somebody to do the stuff that isn't engineering.  All that stuff you don't want to do, you need some people in the company to do that.  So they went out basically and said, okay, we'll get some marketing people.  But they didn't really have a clear idea of what marketing people did or should do for Google.  And that was a little confusing for me when I showed up and there was no job description  and no clear expectations about what my job would be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a personal question because I come from your two last worlds,  working around the internet and tech now, but still in newspapers.  Speaking of feeling lucky to be out of the Titanic,  what was the contrast like then?  And I mean, how do you feel now seeing your old ship  with just its mast above the water versus what you did next?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I still subscribe to both the Mercury News and the New York Times.  And I enjoy very much getting a print paper delivered in my driveway every morning,  even if I have to dig it out of the bushes sometimes.  But even at the end of 99, it was clear to me.  Part of the reason I left the mark was that they really were struggling to understand  this new internet world.  And I thought, well, I'll go off, I'll join a startup.  It'll probably go out of business in 12 months.  And then I'll come back to corporate newspapers and I'll be the in-house internet guy.  I'll have gained my stripes.  I'll have some expertise in what it's like to be at an internet startup.  And then I can bring that back to the newspaper and leverage it.  Into some kind of position.  I didn't realize that the newspapers would be gone in 12 months.  That was pretty surprising how quickly things turned south.  But I could see, I mean, Knight Ritter in particular was really focused on  protecting their print classified product because it was just such an enormously  high margin business.  And so everything they did online was geared towards getting people to buy ads  in the classified section of the Mercury News.  And so that did not feel like an ultimately winning strategy to me.  And I probably needed to try something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, did that scare you at all that Google and to this day still relies entirely on one  source of income advertising on search?  Is there big cash cow similar to the position the newspapers were in?  Their big cash cow was classified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's never a good thing to have all of your eggs in one basket, I think.  But the difference is that Google isn't sitting still trying to protect online advertising.  They're constantly innovating within the advertising itself.  They're expanding into video ads and brand based ads and ad networks.  And advertising is a very large field.  And I think they've diversified quite a bit within the advertising space.  Whereas Knight Ritter had a hard time, I think, at least from my perspective,  in expanding beyond just the print version of classified.  They tried a lot of things online, but they were not really successful.  And I think ultimately it was because they kept bringing the classified model from newspapers  to the online space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say, having worked in an industry, I worked in television as the web guy,  it is really hard to turn that boat.  It's really hard to get people to understand how a new system works and how it can work for them  because they have their own preconceived notions.  Was that a relief working at Google?  Or did you start to run in as it got bigger to some of those same sorts of situations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was such a reversal of what I had been living.  At the Merc, they had a separate database for classified ads, for display ads,  they had a database for the newspaper, for the editorial.  They had a circulation database, none of which talked to each other.  There was no interaction among the different technologies within the company.  I went to Google and everything was built from the ground up and it all worked together.  There were none of these legacy issues.  You didn't have to worry about whether something new would work with something old  because if there were ever a problem, it was all online, they could just fix it in the back end  and the user would experience it as if it were a continuously upgraded product.  I came to Google thinking, all right, I'm older than these kids, I'm 41,  I've had 20 plus years experience in marketing and I'll come in and I'll show them how this is done.  That's not exactly how they viewed my position in the company.  That took a little getting used to the idea that everything that I knew to be true was actually  wrong and that I needed to start from scratch and unlearn, not just start from zero, but actually  go back and unlearn all of the things that I thought were absolutes in marketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've mentioned that you waited six years to write the book and you kind of  said in one of the interviews that you finally realized you had to.  Take me through that. Why did you wait so long and why did you have to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I left Google, I immediately thought, oh, I'll write a book about my experience.  Then I said, well, I was at Google, I want to do something non-traditional,  I'll just blog my experience. I set up that Zoogler's blog back in 2005 and was just pouring  a lot of stories into it and so forth. It started to feel like work. When I would take a week off  and not post anything, people would be emailing me, what are you going to post again? What's going  on? Are you abandoning this? The pressure to continuously update it started to become a  little annoying. I said, all right, I'm just going to quit. I'm just going to give it up and just  move on with life. I went on and did some other things. Everywhere I looked, Google was a presence.  Online, certainly it's everywhere, but in TV, in print, on the radio. Every time I heard Google  mention, this little ding would go off in my head and I'm like, oh yeah, remember the story behind  that and how we got to that space. Somebody would be giving some lengthy explanation from an outside  perspective of what Google was about and I'd say, well, that's not exactly accurate. I finally  decided, well, if you're going to get this out of your head, I had to write it down. The only way to  get it done was to write it down. I started working on the book about two and a half years ago. If I  had known how long it was going to take, I certainly would not have embarked on the journey. It was just  a lot of interviewing in both current Googlers and ex-Googlers, a lot of trying to recreate the  timeline of things that happened. Finally, when I had written over 500 pages and my editors started  choking on it and said, that's probably enough for now. They cut it down by a hundred. They probably  should have cut it down by 150, but I think they wanted to actually have it see the light of day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  at some point in this century. I'm asking in the chat room what they want to know and the first  question up is, what do you think of Google Plus? Do you have an account? Of course. I do like Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Plus. I've been A-B testing it with Facebook. I'll post something on Facebook and then I'll post  something. I've had a Facebook account for a long time, a personal one. Then I'll post something on  Google Plus and see where I get more reaction or how quickly I hear from people. The thing that's  amazing to me though is that not so much Facebook, but Twitter, which I had set up an early account  on Twitter, a personal account and never used it. I understand it's very valuable to a lot of people,  but for me personally, I didn't need it. Then when I wrote the book, I said, okay, I'll set up one to  talk about the book and Google issues. Over a period of a few months, I built up I think three  or 400 Twitter followers. That seemed like a fair number of people. I was on Google Plus for  a week and I had 1500 followers, people I didn't know from all over the world. I'm like, why? Why  are these people signing up to follow me on Google Plus? But just the difference in the scale  really impressed me considering how few people, I mean, 20 million people are on Google Plus, but  compared to Facebook, it's not that many. It's your audience. Yeah, I've been impressed with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what they've accomplished so far. You're A-B testing Facebook versus Google Plus,  which is funny because you said you had to unlearn everything. You emphasize in the book how Google  is such a data-driven company. I think that question of what do you think of Google Plus is  kind of a bigger question of do you think that a company that's mastered this data-driven  algorithmic approach toward indexing content has the capacity to do the same for people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, this is the big challenge for Google because I think they will continue to develop  great technologies to plug into Google Plus, but the human intelligence that goes along with it,  that Facebook seems to have really understood what people are looking for in a social network.  I'm not convinced Google is going to be as quick to grasp that. I'm hoping that they're going to  bring some people into the company who are, as I said in one interview, a little more irrational,  like normal people and not just completely driven by metrics and logic and coding hygiene and this  is the way you do things because that's not the way people operate in the real world. People do  things that don't seem all that logical on the surface but make perfect sense to them.  So I'd like to see Google bring in some of those folks and possibly the impact of that would be to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have a better social networking product. You told a story earlier in the book  how you were having a conversation with Larry, I think it was, and you had lost an argument and  you were going back to make amends and you said, looking back, I know more often than not you've  been right so I just wanted to let you know that I knew that and he looked at you and said, well,  when have we been wrong? And not in an offended way but in a way that he wanted to, kind of in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  robotic way. It just kind of blew me away. I'm doing this all that we can all get along and I  appreciate how smart you are and everything. Right, you were appealing to his emotion and he

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  wanted more signals for his internal algorithm and I thought that was very telling. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  he was really puzzled that anybody would think that he had actually been wrong about anything  because as far as he could tell he'd never been wrong about anything. Everything was clearly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  moving exactly the way it should be. Well, I get the sense it's not out of pride but out of  assurity. We have followed the algorithm and the algorithm works so point out the error in my code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. I've written a good program here. You show me where it's flawed. The output is exactly  what I expected and desired so I don't see where there's any problem with it. One of the criticisms

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hear the most often about Google these days anyway is that they don't have a good customer  service presence. That it's hard to get an answer from somebody. It's hard to get  some response when you have a problem. Do you think that that has its roots in that engineering  basis of it? They seem to be trying to get better at that. They've been doing a lot with Google Plus  at public outreach but it's one of the areas that they need to catch up. I talk about that at length

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in the book in terms of I was in charge of customer service because clearly customer service was not  engineering so it must be marketing. I was handed, here you do customer service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Well, that is very Zappos. That's very Zappos, Doug. I mean customer service is the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  marketing. Yeah, well that's not the way they look at it. They look at it as a non-engineering  function so anything that is non-engineering they don't want to deal with. There was one guy using  Microsoft Outlook to respond to thousands, tens of thousands of users and that quickly became  overwhelming. But Larry and so we would fall behind and we'd have these queues filled of email  comments from people who we were trying to get back to within 24 hours. When I went to Larry and  Sarah and complained, we need more people to deal with customer service and they said well we  shouldn't even be answering customer service emails because if they're calling to complement us,  they already love us so we don't need to send them a note back. They already like us so mission  accomplished. Or if they're calling to complain, if there's a technical issue then it's far better  to take our resources and allocate them to solving the problem that they've identified  rather than emailing them back to tell them oh we're going to work on that problem for you.  So it was a resource allocation question so they never saw any need to respond to email. In fact,  at one point they suggested just writing a program that would randomly generate responses  and send them out and you know nine times out of ten that response is going to be just fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Efficiency above all. Yeah, I guess you have to pitch it as any customer service email  is a search query and how are we going to respond to that? Yeah well they didn't buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah well and you know Cheryl Sandberg who went off to Facebook as COO, you know she talked about  trying to respond to queries at Facebook and she ultimately came to the same conclusion that Larry  and Sergey did. I think that it doesn't make sense to answer every email that somebody sends to you.  It's just not efficient. It's too easy for people to vent themselves through email and the question  of whether or not all emails are equally important and urgent is one I think you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  companies have to deal with. Yeah well especially when you're getting them at that level. The risk  you run though is that you end up with these people ranting in public because they feel slighted  whether it's justified or not and you may or may not suffer from the fallout from that. Yeah I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  if there's critical mass of people complaining about one feature or you know an inability to  use the service then clearly you have a real problem and you need to address it and certainly  some of the stuff that came up around privacy I think that in particular is an area where you  do need to be very responsive or you can start getting a very bad vibe spreading about your

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  product. Before we wrap up Gina any more follow-up questions? I have to say that when I read the  beginning of the book about your interview with Google Warren Sergey said to you I'm going to go  to the candy machine now and I'm going to be five minutes to think about something really complex  and I expect you to explain it to me for an hour when I return. I spent a long time thinking about  what I would be explaining to him and that sounded that's how I've heard that Google  interviews are scary that sounded really scary even though it was you know kind of back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a tough one because you know I you know he wanted me to tell him something he didn't  already know so that he wouldn't be wasting his time if they didn't hire me at least he'd get  some knowledge out of it and I didn't know I you know I just met him I had no idea what he knew  and right right you know so Cindy McCaffrey who was head of marketing PR said you know I mean he's  interested in everything so you can talk about anything it doesn't have to be related to  technology so that gave me a leeway. Obviously you nailed it. Yeah I don't know I think Cindy  probably felt like I did okay I'm not sure Sergey agreed but he knew that he needed some marketing  people and Cindy said hire him so I think he didn't get in the way. So the other question

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the chat room wants to know is what what kind of phone do you use? I have an iPhone version of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  3GS yeah although my son you know is all about the droid and he's he's very happy with his so  we're we're sort of a mixed family when it comes to technology. So I'm curious because you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  here you are head of marketing the company that grew to be huge the fastest growing brand in the  world with no marketing and having come from an industry based on marketing now that Google has  the Android and is starting to market some products how do you think they're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know I can't say that I have a real solid sense of Android as a brand you know I mean it  feels more like the old you know Intel inside kind of things you know where it's an ingredient  and so I don't have a you know I'm aware of Android as a presence in the market  but it seems kind of fractured to me I don't have a very concrete sense whereas with Apple you  always know exactly what you're what you're looking at which is basically Steve Jobs vision  you know implemented in hardware and software and with Android it feels a lot more amorphous to me  so I can't say that I have a strong sense of of Android as a brand although you know if I do  associate any qualities with it it's that it's you know fast and very innovative and continuing  to evolve so you know I'd say that it's you know it's still got some room to grow as a marketing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  concept. All right any more questions before we let Doug go? Thank you for coming on the show it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  was great to have you. Yeah thank you so much. Congrats on the book. Yeah it was a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've been looking forward to this. Doug is the author of I'm Feeling Lucky the Confessions of  Google Employer Employee number 59 available bookstores everywhere easily found online do  a search on Google it'll come up with it. Thank you Doug we really appreciate you taking the time  to chat with us. My pleasure. Thanks Doug. I really like the Zoogler site too I'm going to check that  out I know you said you need to post more on it but that's the ex-Googler's reminiscing so check

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that out as well as x-o-o-g-l-e-r-s.blogspot.com. Well related news in the list here Tom is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google got rid of its Google friends newsletter. What was the good wait what was the Google friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  newsletter? It was an early early newsletter of people talking to uh maybe Doug still on maybe  he can tell us what it was in the earliest days. Yeah Doug you're still there. I'm still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Larry started that back when they were in Stanford and it would be you know just him talking about  new machines that they bought or you know that they were going to Burning Man or whatever and  so you know don't bother sending him an email not that he would have answered it anyway but  and that that became one of my responsibilities. I had to start writing the Google friends newsletter  and it was you know supposed to be a monthly I think we ultimately went to bi-monthly with updates  about all the Google products and it went to any user who signed up for it and who was interested  in you know learning more about Google so it was a real pain to write too because you know Larry and  Sergey always like to have a red pen on it and they make a lot of changes. Was anyone subscribed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff were you subscribed to it? No I wasn't I didn't know about it till it died. Yeah no I know me too  and you wrote a book about Google so I did you I wonder if Leo was subscribed I hadn't heard of  it until they until it died and then I said oh there were 30,000 subscribers back in you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  2001 2002 so I mean it had you know a fair readership yeah I mean I'm sure it grew quite a bit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  since then. Well they they claim the number of subscribers has remained flat because they have  so many other ways of communicating the official Google blog Twitter and and and such so they've  concluded the format is no longer the best way to get the word out. Yeah well the blog you know the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  launch of the blog that was a really harrowing experience that happened during the quiet period  and right before the IPO and so the original Google blog you know there were questions about  whether we could even do that but ultimately we you know as Google often did pushed ahead without

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  too much fear of legal ramifications. Full speed ahead. That's so crazy can't have a company blog  I mean that seems like you know now in this day and age it's like such a funny you know. The fact

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that we hadn't done it previously that we were launching a new communication vehicle during the  quiet period right was in the base of my barrel so it wasn't that we couldn't do a blog and we  could certainly do it after the IPO right we owned the blogger I mean we owned and we had bought  Pyra Labs which was blogger so we were using our own technology to do it but you know there were  so the first posts were things like Charlie Eris fried chicken recipe.  It was rather non-controversial unlikely to inflate the stock artificially. That fried chicken recipe

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was pretty good. It was damn good. You never know that could have an influence. We got that recipe from

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Elvis Presley's personal chef and so it was the same fried chicken Elvis and the Colonel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and see. All right well we will we will let you go now Doug but thanks again so much for talking to  us. Really appreciate it. Take care. We got to take a break before we get into the news and thank  our sponsor Squarespace at squarespace.com the fast and easy way to create a high quality website  or blog. Easy to use UI for creating and managing a website optimized for beginners and CSS experts  so if you don't know what CSS is you don't need to you can still use Squarespace. It's drag and  drop. You put your modules in you write what you want you put it where you want on the page it's  what you see is going to be on the page but if you do know what CSS is you can get in there and edit  the code behind the module. In fact one of the things I like when I'm creating posts in Squarespace  you can either go in the raw HTML and edit it there and do the coding yourself and they give you  some tools that allow you to highlight and put in links easily but if you're not if you're in the  in the more visual interface you can still click a button that says just show me the HTML really  quick so I can make a small tweak and then go right back. It's really easy to flip back and  forth between it. We love it. I use it for forecast. I use it for sword and laser and it's easy to move  into. If you're on blog or movable type type pad WordPress you can export your data into Squarespace  and try it out. In fact you can try it out for free thanks to the fact that you're watching Twig.

It's you know by the way

Transcript:  if you haven't listened to it this week's or the latest online podcast from This American Life.  Oh yeah that's fantastic. Called When Patents Attack. Everybody listen to it. It's just amazing  and it puts Nathan Mirabold in his right spot but it also shows mainly the insanity of this of the  billions of dollars that are spent on patents not to increase invention, not to increase  production but only to defend oneself and this is exactly what Google did. It bought itself some

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hardened underwear. Yeah because they're patent poor is the way they're determined and I think  they have taken the attitude that we don't really need patents. You know we feel like we can be  open and we want to share and we'll patent what we really need to but it turns out it doesn't  matter whether you feel you need patents or not. You need them because it's the only way to defend

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  yourself. Gina have you ever gotten a patent? No. No I haven't. Talk to me about your attitude about  that in terms of if you invent something why would you consider it? Why wouldn't you? What would your  your thoughts? I know you have invented things and probably you just don't think that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think that way and you know I'm just so disgusted with the whole patent system that I  just would hate to do it. You know and honestly all of my projects have been either side personal  projects that weren't a huge business or I've been working for someone else who took care of  that kind of thing so it really hasn't come up for me seriously but I am completely disgusted  with the whole system and I'm kind of a little small part of me hopes that Google is going to  try to change the system because the next story in our roundup is about how Google is hiring  an IP expert from the FTC. Suzanne Michelle. Yeah who wrote a paper about how bad the patent  system is and ways to improve it so that was an interesting hire so I wonder if they're just  bulking up their patents and then maybe they're trying to acquire enough to then you know make  change the way that try to make a change or make proposals about how the patent system is and you  know some improvements that they but they needs that leverage right they need to own a bunch of  patents in order to in order to make a move or try to change the way it works I don't know how  they would do it I hope that they do yeah that's I'm not very articulate about it. I think Eric

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Schmidt's job right now is to do this kind of stuff to lobby for this kind of stuff in Washington  among many other things obviously so I know that they have that effort beginning but buying up the  patents and then getting an intellectual property expert like Suzanne Michelle to be she was one of  the FTC's top intellectual property officials leaving her post to go work at Google implies that  they may be going after it from the other end a thousand patents at once that's that's huge there's  also another patent pile I can't remember who it's from that Samsung Apple and Google are all bidding  on so so Google has finally changed their minds. It's Nortel. Thank you. I think they had the same  attitude you did Gina which was I don't really want to play this game I don't need to play this  game and they've gotten big enough they've realized well now every Oracle's coming after us all of the  Android phones are now under all of these patent lawsuits from various areas we need to get in  there now the way they would normally get in there and this is what was described in the this American  Life episode so well is to go and fight fire with fire you you threaten to sue somebody to keep them  from suing you or if they do sue you you you file countersuit so that you can force a settlement but  Gina I feel like what you're saying is you're hoping that they would they would do something  different where they would actually try to change the system could they change it from within that  way could they could they use a huge pile of patents to just stop lawsuits in general somehow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know maybe they could I would like to see them try I mean what's what are there some big you  know other big things that Google's tried to change they tried to change a little bit the way  the mobile industry works and the way that that mobile phones are sold to consumers and contracts  and all those things that didn't go so well so so I don't know I don't know if they're this hire  is interesting it's interesting that her responsibilities are not clear she's been in the  FTC for 11 years very interesting so I would like to see them try to change because I really think  that at this point patents do not protect innovation they stifle it and we have companies spending so  much money on lawyers like lawyers make tons of money and and and companies have to you know put  resources toward instead of innovating building new things fighting these stupid these stupid  battles so I would love to see Google take on the the patent situation because I really think it's  in a bad place and just does not serve the technology industry well at all do you feel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like there should be patents either one of you Leo has gone on record you know as recently as  this week's twit saying he doesn't think there should be software patents at all Gina you first

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hmm I tend toward I tend toward saying no uh I I not the way that they are now and honestly I  haven't thought this through fully so I'm I'm afraid I'm going to say something sounding really  dumb but I really think that most great ideas are just you know we're all kind of standing on the  shoulders of giants right so we all going to build upon things that other people have done every  single kind of technology and I just I don't think that it serves that it serves anyone well to say  you know this this is mine no one else can do anything with it I mean I know there has to be  some sort of protection in place just just just not what we have now there's a lot of room for

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  improvement yeah I keep on going back and forth Tom on this I I think that uh because because  I've had the same battle with myself about about other IP about about copyright as well  I guess the question on on patents is that the whole raise on debt for patents is that  it was supposed to as Gina just said encourage innovation by having people be more open than not  because it gave them a path to openness that protected what they did right well it's clearly  not working that way right it's stifling innovation it's making people scared it's stopping things so  the so the rationale behind patents is not being served by patents now part of that is the absolute  inanity of the patent system if we had a decent patent system would that be better was that a  solution I don't know but we all know the patent system now is insane on on the this American Life  show they highlight the patent recently issued for toast um you know which is just an absurd  mockery of the whole system using the system itself and some of the patents they talk about  on the show are so broad as to cover absolutely everything and there are  you know a thousand patents just like that patent they can't even issue patents on top of patents  let alone on top of real prior art all right but so let's say let's say the system worked let's say  that they actually got down to decent patents that really were real would that improve innovation  I think in a world that moves as fast as ours does today it wouldn't because the patent system  no matter how fast it could be will be way behind the innovation that we're seeing today  will be way behind the innovation that's already occurring and when you see something neat what do  we all do you learn from it you copy it you build on the on the shoulders of giants as Gina said  so I'm the same as Gina I'm afraid to say anything definitive because I'm afraid of being stupid  about it but I am seeing that this needs a very different way to think yeah I guess I just won't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be afraid to to be stupid I I don't think there doesn't need to be patents I think there is a  room for patent law but I think patents and I'll throw in copyrights in there as well  need to be ripped up and started over with the aim of what you're saying where they actually can  be demonstrated to encourage innovation then we should have the law because like you said the idea  was I want protection for my idea so that if I start putting it out there I don't just get  ripped off by somebody else and it gets taken away from me in software the reason I think a  lot of people say we just shouldn't have patents is rarely do you see software patents protecting  true innovation something entirely new you see them protecting a little variation the algorithm  is broken for determining what is patentable and that needs to be absolutely overhauled and I think  in that process maybe we can discover whether software actually is patentable or not I mean I  tend to favor the free software foundation perspective a little bit that I should be able  to write whatever software I want run whatever software I want on my devices and and software  you know should should be open and free because it's just the thing that's making the device work  and the device is the thing that's patentable but I don't I and maybe I am being afraid of being  stupid a little bit I don't want to go so far as to say there would never be a case

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  where software couldn't be patentable you know I just wrote a piece for wire to Germany which they  were they nicely translated for me that I'm hoping to sell here in the U.S. on Gutenberg as the first  technology entrepreneur and I was fascinated doing the research for it I just loved it but one thing  I learned is it went when Gutenberg lost his business to his main investor because he couldn't  do the cash flow to pay up Gutenberg had been incredibly incredibly secretive before very Steve  Jobs like he operated out of three or four facilities so no one knew the whole picture  what was going on he wouldn't let people in he wouldn't let them in the business just all kinds  of things but then when he lost the business you know what he did he open sourced it he taught other  people how to do it because it was his na na to the guys who'd stolen as it was taking his business  and you know what made more innovation happen the closed printing press method or the open method

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the answer is obvious yeah for sure I agree I agree with the with what you're saying Jeff I mean I  I think that we have to have a path to openness and a path to innovation and this idea that we  seem to have the presumption these days that everything should be locked down either for a  long time in the case of copyright or in in breadth in the case of patent that every little  thing you could possibly come up with should be locked down let's let's talk about Google plus  good news for Google plus hitting 25 million visitors and apparently pretty sticky as well  even while it's still invite only I mean it's it's not impossible to get an invite it's it's  fairly permeable but it's limited not everybody can just sign up for it so that's that's a pretty  big number and remember it was introduced on my birthday June 28th so not not that long ago  thank you Andrew Lipsman vice president of industry analysis at comscore is the one  estimating the 25 million unique visitors and you guys you know you talk about it every week  developers now think Google plus can beat Facebook 25 million viewers you got developers starting to  talk good about it what does it need what needs to happen for that to work though

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina Google plus is Google plus is on the right track it's it's doing really well people love it  people are using it I think it's great that it's had this this adoption this you know kind of  vertical line of adoption I tell you truth I don't think that it's that big a deal given Google's  suite of products and then the sort of brand trust that people have in Google you know of course it  took Twitter and Facebook much longer to gain users because people didn't know who they were  that you know that they were unknown companies that had to build themselves up on that build  themselves up on the basis of this you know new product Google search I mean I think is one of the  most trusted brands in in at least the United States I think we've talked about people love  Gmail and the fact that developers think that that that Google's going to beat Facebook absolutely  and and we've talked about the trust factor a lot on this show I think that people or for my  perspective our people I should say our people our audience trust the Google brand more than  than than Facebook so I think I think Google plus is absolutely on the right track still really  enjoying the kind of customer service speaking customer service that Googlers have been doing  inside of Google plus I see I'm following I've circled quite a few Googlers and they're constantly  discussing the product I think that the one snag that they've got going on right now is this name  issue which they've been real quiet about and I'm and I'm kind of really interested to hear  what the outcome of this is going to be the real names policy I'm referring to I think that this  real names policy really contradicts the don't be evil stance I think that they need to support  pseudonyms and brand names and that kind of thing I'm hoping to see them kind of announce a  resolution to that other than that I think that that's a problem for a small percentage of people  other than that I think Google plus is going to continue its uh its its rise I've been using it  a lot and it's really been taking a lot of my social media attention I really enjoy it I'm  guaranteed to get 100 comment thread on a Google plus post a public post almost every time the  engagement level is extremely extremely high and for the most part there are little little snags  here and there it's a great product to use really enjoying it I'm feeling very bullish about it  myself as a developer I can't wait for the API to get released I think that's KG and you're right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean I actually found that I'm using it a little bit less my my hashtag fun of a week ago  was better done on Twitter because on Twitter with hashtags as I said last show you could  search you can gather around a topic and you can't gather around anything on Google plus and I find  that frustrating it's hard to to kind of get a sense of what people are talking about or join  in on a conversation it bifurcates so but but these are things that I agree they'll fix I think  search the irony to me is just so incredible and and I wish someone would explain why they came out  with this product this company without search I know it's incredible but you know I was talking  to some people there's a field test Jeff that's why I know but Jesus they got the technology  there's got to be a story behind that and I would die to know the story I was talking to some people  today from a Mozilla news project that's really quite neat that Google's involved in and you know  somebody started talking about the word social in there it occurred to me what the heck does  social mean right I can define anti-social and social is kind of the whole rest of life  everything is social and I don't think that Google plus is really about Google and social I go back  to the notion that it's about them generating signals and and and having more connections with  us as a person you know in a sense it's not about Google creating a social world for us it's about  Google trying to get more human with us and that's what makes Google plus to me so interesting is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it becomes this petri dish for us people I find that Google plus for me ends up being a place to  ask a question and get an answer and start a conversation about your own topic where Twitter  is a place for me to throw out kind of a thought and maybe get a little reaction but Google plus  works much better for hey I want to discuss this one thing Twitter works for like let me just kind  of throw something into the the general stream of conversation so for instance I used to use  Twitter quite a bit for researching top fives for the show I do top five I'd say you know what's your  favorite Harry Potter movie moment and everyone would at reply me and then I'd have to go find  those at replies and and page through them Google plus works much better for that because you get  everything in one thread but like you say it doesn't allow you to bust out of that so if you  want to have a more wide-ranging conversation Twitter's better for that but it's entirely  replaced Facebook for me I don't touch Facebook anymore yeah yeah and and to be and to be fair I  didn't I didn't touch Facebook that much to begin with but it I find of the few uses that I had for  Facebook have been limited now to getting in touch with close friends and relatives for very  particular purposes which I probably if they were all on Google plus could do on Google plus

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're just not all over there yet well I think Gina just raised a metric for success here is the  robustness of the conversation that's caused right and Facebook is the lower end the lowest end of  that Twitter is up but disjointed and Google plus is actually very high it's engineered very well  to do that to the point of a fault because you know you have to mute Scoble all the time as he  decides Google plus is the next thing and dead next thing and dead next thing and dead you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scoble himself admits you just got to mute me a lot in life but do you think that Facebook is low

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on that list because you're you're you're followed by or commented on on Google plus by more of your  audience like like I go to Facebook because my family and friends from high school who aren't  nerds are there you know so so the conversations I have there you know they're all like what's all  this techno mumble jumble you are talking about you know but I can have a conversation about  something something highly technical on Google plus and that's your audience our audience so the  conversation is very high quality I mean Facebook's features are very similar to Google plus and it's  threaded conversations your likes and you know images and links so do you think so do you think  that that's because of the people who are on g-plus or because of the tool itself I'm not I'm not at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sure I I think that you know there's an interesting discussion here Fred Wilson and I got into a  disagreement which doesn't happen very often on Twitter and he proposed that he and I should do  a debate on this topic on the notion of real identity and he is being rather dogmatic I think  and I respect Fred greatly saying that real identity doesn't matter at all it doesn't help  at all and my argument is no and he says that what made Facebook succeed was structured feeds  and structured data well I don't agree because you could have structured the hell out of my space it  was a bunch of fake people with no investment in it and it was all crap and it wouldn't have fixed  that at all I argue that real identity real people real relationships made Facebook work and  it was the secret to it and of course Twitter doesn't have real identity enforced but there's  a hell of a lot of real identity there people really use it because they want credit for what  they're saying they want a lot of things yeah I'm sorry I see I'm freezing again  and and so now we get to the to the question of Google plus and and this and the identity  that happens there I you know after our discussion last week Gina I I'm still in  kind of a middle ground where I understand the desire to have real identity because of what it  does for the service alongside pseudonyms alongside perhaps some structure of approved  anonymity but I understand the desire to have a higher quality discussion around authenticity  and so I think that that's part of the thing about Facebook ironically is that those are the  people you really know and so you have an invested relationship with them versus on Twitter I'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  throw out a line yeah yeah it's more disposable on Twitter definitely all right we got some  Android news we need to get to but I want to thank our sponsor Netflix if you would like to  watch some streaming movies for free go to netflix.com slash twit right now and you can  get 30 days of Netflix streaming for free watch it on your phone watch it on your tablet a ton of  Android phones have it now it's going coming to more all the time and you can watch it on your  television through a Roku player through an Apple TV through an Xbox 360 a PS3 a Wii and and see  movies in HD right there on your screen no risk trial netflix.com slash twit we thank them for  their support and if you're already tried Netflix or you're already using Netflix tell others spread  it around give it to your mom give it to your kids well if your kids are out of the house if  the kids are in the house you could just sign up for it netflix.com slash twit we thank them for  their support of this week in Google so Canelis who does the worldwide numbers came out with their  most recent survey doesn't really show much of a change in the market but Google's mobile os is now  on 48 percent of smartphones worldwide month to month that's not that much different but it's a  steady uptick that has Android headed to 50 percent and it looks like there there's no there's no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stopping the rampant growth makes sense a little tons of handsets out there and options lots of  Android devices out there it makes a lot of sense that active this is activations or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um this is just cell phones handsets just handsets yeah we're not talking about tablets  and I believe we're talking about existing market share not sales if I'm right okay gotcha gotcha

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah makes a lot of sense Android's doing really well also I hope that uh Google can study the  course for Android a little bit on a few on a few items like I'd like to see Google TV do a little  better although the Google TV isn't included this in this uh in this write-up in tablets but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  did you see the news on Google TV since our last show that that they have more returns than sales

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now they've clarified that uh they have they have more returns from retailers uh than they have had  retailers sell they are not being returned by the consumers who actually buy them so they're just  not selling any it's not that they're breaking well that's good news yeah and now they're trying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to sell some for $99 instead of $2.99 right $2.49 and you can get the honeycomb beta on it although

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you can't go back so be careful uh but it's actually fairly easy if you if you find the  honeycomb beta there's lots of places to find it online uh and put it on a USB drive you just turn  your box off plug in the USB drive reboot and it installs itself it's it's fairly it's almost too  simple uh because if it doesn't work it could break your system there's always that chance and  you can't go back but you don't have to you don't have to get root access to do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and is the is the market the market hasn't launched isn't in the honeycomb beta yet you know that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good question i did not i would assume people would be talking that up if that was in there and i i've  been meaning to do this to my uh logitech review unit uh yeah and try it out i was i've been putting  it off because i want to bring it in here and do it on camera uh and watch it fail spectacularly  live on the stream probably but uh yeah i mean i i still believe in google tv as a possibility  but right now it's just it's you know we're just talking about netflix it's my netflix box in the  bedroom because i happen to have it and you know that's the other way uh to get it i've used it a  couple times for hbo go which is one of the few few ways you can get hbo go on a on a television  versus on a tablet or a phone wait on google tv you have hbo go yeah through chrome oh through

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  chrome okay and they actually they actually have a shortcut widget on the screen that takes you to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hbo go but it just takes you to a chrome uh full screen browser very cool that's super cool i also

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  believe in the possibility of google tv i've always kind of kind of embarrassed to admit how  much i like the google tv the the logitech unit i got it as part of their developer program and uh  and i i really like having a browser with flash on my tv you know i mean there are a lot of places  even if everyone blocks it it's even well not quite everyone so i so i'm a i'm a ufc fan and  i like to watch the fights on the website the ufc website because you can you know there's a scrubber  and you can replay things and whatever so i like i really i really enjoy that and i like picture  and picture i like being able to search twitter the thing is is that it's just it's laid fallow  for so long right and they've been promising the market and an upgrade it's supposed to happen late  this summer right so soon maybe this month but it's just been a really long time so it doesn't  surprise me yeah the price was too high it you know it didn't it didn't impress when it first  got got released and it's been a long time so i'm really looking forward to the upgrade i which  apparently will be this honeycomb upgrade that you're talking about i looks like i have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  an evening project i'm looking forward to the marketplace i think that that was a good question  to ask because once this thing actually is able to run some apps i think you'll be able to make  better use of it definitely and and there have been some patches that have that have fixed some  some glitchy things for me but you know overall 99 is going to convince you to get one jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's not the money it's it's the usability you know i think i think that's what i wait  wait for and see and see what happens all right i i think that's reasonable yeah i think that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  absolutely is reasonable google and ti texas instruments are hooking up for ice cream sandwich  looking a little farther down the right line ice cream sandwich will allow developers to create  apps once and the operating system is due in the fourth quarter will be smart enough to figure out  which type of device the app is running on and then adjust accordingly ti will be a prominent  part of the ice cream sandwich rollout what does this mean got me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this means from what i understand i i have i have published an android app and i haven't done a  whole lot of tablet development but it basically means that that honeycomb and the core android will  will merge so as a developer you can make an app which is smart about what you know what is available  to it whether or not it's a tablet whether or not it has tablet support of those different panels  and that the smart bar and the different things that that that ice cream sandwich or the tablet  part of ice cream sandwich makes available which is really nice for developers because  you can you can build your app to sort of degrade or upgrade gracefully depending on what kind of  device the person is using whether or not it's a tablet or a phone and it's got an android has a  lot of that right now you when you when you publish your app you can say here are the assets to use if  you have a low res screen here are the high res assets to use on a bigger screen you know some  some devices have keyboard hardware keyboards and some don't so this just kind of continues down that  path of of letting apps take advantage of what's available to them on install so that allows ti to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  take the architecture they've been building for phones and be able to execute the tablet operating  system and put their chips in tablets is what what it seems like because of that london-based  research firm called vision mobile released a method of tracking openness among mobile platforms  called the open governance index and according to its metrics android is the least open of all  the supposedly open source mobile platforms seeing this on read write web 23 openness rating eclipse  which is an open development platform comprised of extensible networks and tools got the the highest  rating at 84 i think you know a lot of people have considered this to be true already just based on  the the issues they've had around rollouts and access to the code so they're comparing the android  to things like linux webkit mozilla mego symbian how much do you feel like this impacts you jina

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know this word open it's just so fraught i mean it's the word that google uses to sell android  and it's also the word that the that the free software community uses to indict android you  know is not a real open source project and it makes me it makes me kind of crazy i have to tell you  i would like to see these numbers cross-referenced with with with usage because i i think that android's  usage is probably much higher than a lot of these other products let's just say i love eclipse it is  the idea that i live in and develop and develop in every single day it's great great platform for  developers the thing about openness i mean you can define it in so many different ways as it  user for me android being open means i can install whatever i want on my phone all i could you know i  don't even have to go through the market someone can publish an apk and i can say install from  untrusted sources and i can install anything i want on my phone and the pure versions of android  which don't ship on all devices but the pure version of android lets me tether and it lets me  fiddle with settings that i normally wouldn't be able to to change uh in in other situations i know  that's a very loose user-centric view of what open is but i think that you know in the end it's users  that really matter so you know these these debates about whether or not android is truly open source  and oh you know what look at this what is this open google it it's it feels tiring to me because  open is a marketing term for google when it comes to android and i mean it is an open source project  but there are there are uh you know decisions that they've made that make it maybe less pure  open than some people you know kind of define isn't that the problem it's the it's the expectation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's been built around it that it's going to be open and it doesn't meet that definition for a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of people right i think i think that that's really what it is right i mean google touts the operating  system is open and that's its differentiator and then i think when when android doesn't do exactly  what people want it to do or it's blocked or something's limited it's like you know it's well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right you haven't you haven't fulfilled your promise so maybe what they should do is tout it  as closed and then people will praise it look how open this closed operating system is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i just noticed actually that web kit is in this is in the list and web kit is obviously  very heavily used in chrome and safari but packaged up in chrome and safari so all right we're going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to wrap up here in just a few minutes but before we do want to thank new tech who provide the  tricaster 850 we're using to switch the show right now it's like having a giant tv truck  but it's the size of a bread box nobody knows how big a bread box is but it's the size of a  desktop pc it's actually a little smaller than the many desktop pcs 24 channel system with  everything you need to make a tv show including amazing virtual sets we can use tricaster for  desktop or portable production we could take one with us out on the in the field when we go to ces  every year that's how we do it we get a tricaster out there and we've got the ability to do all the  switching we do right here in the new studio out on the road with us let you live stream project  and record hd video all at the same time if you'd like to find out more about tricaster head over  to the website newtech.com that's n-e-w-t-e-k uh dot com and big thanks to new tech for the tricaster  i know all of the folks running the board here at twit are incredibly relieved to have all those  extra channels those 24 channels in there uh makes things quite a bit easier let's finish off  googled apparently um still does a browser uh and i i i just got really frustrated with chrome  yesterday uh and i've been having the little frowny folder face way too often aw snap uh and  i was like that's it firefox has had a couple revs since i was living in it daily i'm going back last  night switched over to firefox was using it all morning this morning and it just doesn't have the  snappy ui uh for me it does it doesn't have i want to be able to close a tab without clicking on it  i want to be able to move tabs back and forth faster than firefox can do  and it's just it just isn't uh i i really wanted to switch back to firefox and i couldn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  uh that doesn't bode well i mean speed right speed was is and still is chrome's huge selling  point it is it is quite snappy although are you running the the beta check no i'm running the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  vanilla release the state yeah the stable version and you're still getting crashed  yeah i was getting tab crashes all now i haven't had one today  you know what i think crashes it for me plus does it see i was suspecting that's funny you say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i was suspecting google docs that seems to be whenever plus starts to try to do too much  and it wants to do a huge update because it's trying to constantly update then what happened  it starts to drag down my entire chrome instance instances and then i'll snap something a few

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  minutes later i was that's the pattern or not i was seeing it with google docs tabs  ah okay so maybe there's some google scripting wouldn't surprise me you know the story story in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the list that jenny mentioned speed the google chrome gets instant pages uh yeah i was gonna say  13 just went stable right so the instant pages just got built in some i got a question about that  what does that do likely to the analytics of the of the site that receives it and ever our  advertiser is going to have a fit does the does a page uh preload that you may never look at but  still gets counted as a page view and a unique user and an ad uh display from what i understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and i'm not sure how they're doing it from what i understand though analytics code does not trigger  unless the tab comes to the front so it does it does not mess with views from what i understand  and i'm not and i'm not positive how exactly they're doing that but they do they are taking  into account whether or not you actually look at the page got it okay good so this is this is just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a thing that's going to make it make pages show up faster yeah they pre-cache pre-rendering yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  not only they prefetch all the css and javascript and html but they actually render it so  the javascript executes the css lines up the images all that stuff happens in the background  so when you snap that tab the entire page is rendered firefox has prefetching which just  grabs the files over the wire but this is pre-rendering so it's kind of this the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the uh the next step now did you did you all talk about the page speed service last week we didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that actually got announced i think right after our episode okay uh because i i tried it out uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  page speed is actually kind of in the same channel as as this is this it's trying to make  pages faster but page speed actually wants to make it faster on the site's serving end so you point  your dns at a google address and it will speed up the loading of your website i tried it out  with tom merritt dot com and it definitely speeded it up not much a second but you know something  could make a difference when you're when you're surfing but the weird thing is the start rendering  time slowed down so when you looked at it it looked like my old site was loading faster because  you got things up faster even though the actual loading of the entire code was faster with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  page speed tool was had the dns maybe not propagand was the dns request having to refresh it well now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  see that i should have mentioned that i didn't do the uh the entire you know sign up i compared  the load times at the webpage test that they provide you so i may get a different  experience when i when i actually tried it for real right right this is blowing my mind so

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  basically google is hosting the entire internet i mean that's that's that's what they're offering  to do that they're actually hosting your site or they're just caching uh i mean are they caching  scripts if you have dynamic scripts on your site like you have a php script on your site are they  they must be grabbing grabbing the output or using their cash copy i they're re they're re

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  interpreting uh the uh the the code to optimize it so what their promise is they're saying look you  don't have to uh you don't have to write good code anymore you can be sloppy as i'll get out  we'll optimize it uh and fix any errors and then reserve it uh and so we only need to look at it  once and then we'll have it we'll have it ready uh to give to folks in fact let me see if this uh  i i think my test is still cached i'm gonna see if that now the video is oh yeah there it is  all right yeah here let me start it over again so check this out on the left is my original site  and the right is the optimized uh and when when you uh when you start going oh now i gotta reload  the page don't i see because this is what i i get for trying to do a demo on the fly from a six day  old link all right so original on the left optimized on the right now watch it takes a couple of  seconds and then it looks like the left is faster interesting it does but it does that image came  up yeah yeah because that top image in the first post come up faster uh and that's because uh the  start render time is slower now if you noticed they used to give me that start render time and  and this uh in this cached version of the test it doesn't show that uh but then you can also see the  page load time difference the first time was negative one second so it saved me 1.3 seconds  repeat view page load time you think would be faster but it's actually it's actually not that  much faster because of the caching that is already done on the browser side i suppose  um interesting but yeah you can go to uh let's see if i can get back to the uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah you have to submit your submit your name and your site to a form you go to webpagetest.org

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and you just type in your uh yeah you type in your uh location so that you're getting a fair test  you want to get a you want to get somewhere that's close to you and then uh what browser  you want it to test as put in your url start the test cool very cool yeah but you know getting back  to the the sort of like you know google is going to be running the internet is that a good idea  for them to actually you know for people to start relying on google for all of this stuff for for  their ads for their for their email for their docs uh and and now for actually the light children

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah it's a little scary it makes me a little antsy i'll be honest yeah i like hosting my website

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well you still host it that's the brilliance of it you're still hosting it you still host it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  just optimizing it right they're just optimizing it for me they're just what's the difference between

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this and akamai serving large media sites there you go it's actually not that much it's kind of  like a cdn yeah yeah yeah all right we're uh we're running short on time you guys got favorites you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want to pick out of out of what's left here uh i just saw some news just up with like this was news  to me that randy zuckerberg has quit facebook is that news used to be too randy zuckerberg that's  that's mark sister right mark sister yep she's starting her own company uh that's going to  advise media companies how to be more social now i've just lost the link so when you say she's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  quitting facebook she didn't delete her account she she left the company let's not make that clear

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and he's like a burgess starting her own company that's very interesting campus i guess randy who  by the way is on leave still i think because she has a beautiful baby and who she has pictures of  on so she's starting r2z media focusing on helping companies become more social  my goal is to launch my own innovative programming and work with media companies to  develop their programming in new and more social ways she said in her resignation letter according

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to mashable and she was the director of marketing i just read an interview with her earlier this  week where she was defending the real names policy of facebook but of course major she said that uh  that she thought anonymity had to go away yeah she's like forget anonymity it's over i think  that's a little strong i understand the impulse to say you know what people behave better when  there's less anonymity using your real name is a good idea uh in many of the forums that i've been  in charge of at different websites we've said look you know what you got to have a real account  with a real name it really cuts down on the clutter but there's that other side of it there's that  dissident whistleblower side of it that you eliminate if you require real names

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right yep right i think this makes a lot of sense for her i mean you know anyone would love to work  with her knowing the ties that she has to facebook and you know clearly she's a sweetheart she's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  she's really everybody's nice as everybody seems and and every time i've dealt with her she's just  absolutely dandy to deal with yeah and good for her for starting her own thing yeah i'm surprised

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  she didn't do it sooner honestly i can't imagine working with your brother for that many years in  your company and and to have that kind of knowledge that kind of first-hand knowledge and not want to  do your own thing yeah all right uh and we got another one of these stories about uh a school

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  banning teachers from using a social network in this case it's facebook uh in missouri it's not  just a school it's the entire state it's the entire state it's the state of missouri i didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  realize that is passing a law and there's some finer points to it but basically it is it all but  finer points to it but basically it is it all but bans teachers from friending students on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  social networks at what levels just elementary and high school level yeah yeah okay and you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and and on the one hand i kind of understand that because it sounds creepy on my own rule i teach  graduate school is i won't initiate a friending if a student of mine wants to friend me though i'll  do that you know we're all adults here um but in this case it just it's what what dana boyd often  says is that is it extends this stranger danger idea to the extreme to make all adults are bad  for young people and that's that's going too far here you know i look at it as as the school dance  and if you will if if some teachers are on facebook i actually like that because it's more eyes on the  kids it's like chaperones and now the state has said no you adults are all evil and bad to kids  well if we think that adults are bad with kids on facebook then why are they teaching them in school

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good point just had to get that out yeah i mean it does smack a little bit of fearing the new  versus absolutely you know just because do we have a law that bans teachers from calling children  on a on a telephone you know or or stopping by their house those those sound very creepy in  certain circumstances but we don't need a law against that right now this should be something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that should be determined within the community a cultural thing within a different each school  i'm sure should you know because you kind of come come up with their own guidelines recommendations  about this kind of thing and you know teachers and and and staff of schools deal with this all the  time my wife works with undergraduate students and has to deal with this question of whether or not  she's your friend she have two accounts professional account personal account  um but you know this is making a laws is insane all right well let's uh let's finish up with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tools and the tips and the numbers and we'll start off with you jina uh you've got a good way to avoid

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  airbnb disasters google launched a new experiment called hotel finder it's at google.com slash  hotel finder and uh you know you you put in a location and dates that you want to stay someplace  and hotel finder returns hotel uh recommendations and so this sounds really similar to most  you know travel kind of search sites but it's got a couple of neat features um the first thing it  does like i like i just did a search for brooklyn new york first thing it does is it goes to the  area and it adds it creates a shape around the most touristy areas where you're going to get the  best hotel deal so i searched for brooklyn but it gave me a good part of lower Manhattan which makes  sense um so it gives you a list of hotels by price and rating and you can scan the list and create a  what they call a short list of hotels that you're interested in possibly booking so it's a it's a  it's a cool little uh tool for next time you take a trip to check it out and need a place to stay  you can you can if you click on that edit shape uh button in the right under the map after you  search for a place it's got this neat heat map of uh of places where tourists uh typically visit so  that's just cool from a data visualization oh yeah that is cool yeah it's really cool they all end up  in the touristy spots yeah they all end up in uh in midtown and you can edit the shape you can  you can increase the bounds or decrease them to to narrow down the area where you want to walk slowly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
