Starting with in the upper left hand corner, Gina Trapani of SmarterWear.org.  Hello.  Our life hacker, our token developer.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh-oh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, somebody has to do it.  Great to have you.  Also with us, Mr. Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.  A great post about Facebook this week, which we'll talk about in a little bit.  He is a professor of journalism at Cooney.  You can see the Cooney sign over your right shoulder there.  That's nice. I like that.  Wherever it is, I can't.  There, there, there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm geographically dyslexic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And one of the people joining us, one of the people today, one of my favorite people in the world, Doc Searls, who was one of the authors of the Clue Train Manifesto now in its 10th year.  And he's currently at the Berkman Center at Harvard University studying, is it VRM, Doc?

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Yeah, it's V, as in victory, but it stands for vendor relationship management, which is kind of the reciprocal of customer relationship management, which we are, which senses junk mail and makes us get out loyalty cards and do other inconvenient things.  And we're trying to come at everything from the customer side.  So we're equipping customers with tools that make them independent of vendors, but better able to engage with vendors.  And we're doing this basically using open source stuff and so that commercial guys can build stuff on top of it.  That's great. What is the response from commercial guys?  The cover of this week's, I should pull this out.  Here we go. This is a Clue Train effect after a long time.  Here we go. It says, I am not an eyeball.  This is a copy of, okay, this was the...  CRM magazine.  Cover of CRM magazine. And in this small print there, it says, your customers don't belong to you and neither does the customer relationship.  And it's about half the magazine is devoted to VRM and what Clue Train said 10 years ago and how we were right and stuff like that.  So yeah, it's starting to happen after four years of work and development. It's starting to catch on.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you go to doc.serles.com, is it dot com?  Yeah. You'll find a link to Doc's stuff at Harvard and the Project VRM web page, which is at the harvard.edu address.  But it's easier, remember, doc.serles.com. Great to have you here.  I've been meaning to get you on this show and all of our shows much more.  Much, much more. Because like Jeff and Gina, you're a thinker.  And God knows we need thinkers these days.  Gina, you're going to be in town.  Do and think.  Do and think. Do and think. But you know, we got doers and we got thinkers.  But I think we got to think before we do or something.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Something like that.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  I did that for 58 years. I've been trying to do for the last four or so.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Enough making. Now some doing.  Gina, it will be coming to the Bay Area next week.  So maybe we can get you to come up to the cottage because Google I.O. is next week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes, I'm very excited.  What is Google I.O.?  Google I.O. is Google's developer conference.  It's a two-day get-together at Moscone West Center.  Moscone, yes.  I've actually never been there.  That's also where WWDC goes on, right?  That's right.  The Apple conference.  Yeah, I'm very excited.  It'll be my first time there and my first time at I.O.  And yeah, it's Wednesday and Thursday of next week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, can only developers go or probably the ink-stained wretches are not allowed in?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I registered as just a regular attendee as a developer.  Paid my way.  But I'm sure that press goes for the keynotes and stuff.  I'm sure that they issue press passes.  But I just decided, hey, I'm just going to go as a regular person and attend some of the sessions.  What do you expect?  I think there's going to be a lot of really good stuff at I.O.  Actually, it's really interesting.  They released they're not printing programs on paper, right?  They released an Android application, which is the I.O. schedule.  It's got all the different tracks.  You could take notes.  You can mark sessions as favorites.  They said that there would be printers on site if you really have to print out the programs that are out there, which is kind of interesting.  Who would do that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, look at the just the looks you would get using standing over by the printer.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to go over the printer and get a piece of paper.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They're also they're going to be waving all of the sessions, which of course made me happy because I wrote a book about wave and I'm excited to I felt like that kind of indicated this bigger commitment to wave from the company as a whole.  I think they're going to be using wave and Google Moderator, which are two kind of moderators.  Cool.  Yeah, moderator is cool, but it's not a product that you hear about a lot.  Right.  So I think that they're going to kind of combine the two so that so that audience members and even people who aren't at I.O. can watch people take notes and ask questions, which would be really neat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But so we can attend in a way we can attend I.O. by joining the wave.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. By joining the wave.  Exactly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it's coming together of your worlds.  Yeah, I know.  It is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm so excited.  I'm out of my mind about it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really neat.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  In terms of announcements, I mean, I think there's going to be some major play to Android, probably and wave, but especially Android.  So I wouldn't be surprised if we saw Google TV get at least announced or perhaps demoed.  You know, obviously all the attendees got a free Android phone.  It was not free.  I mean, it kind of came with the price of your ticket, the droid.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And you chose the droid.  You could have Nexus one or a droid.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  No, actually, in the US, you got a droid.  Oh, really?  You got a Nexus one.  Yeah, which is just I would have chosen another surprise.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And Google didn't give it.  I guess they'd already given Nexus ones out.  So yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And they kind of encourage you to start, you know, start your Android app before you arrive, that kind of thing.  And, you know, obviously there's a whole Android track.  So I think we're going to see some Android announcements.  I'd be really excited if Froyo came out during during two point two at two point two.  That would be that'd be very exciting.  But beyond that, you know, I'm just I don't know, I'm really excited to just be around a bunch of bunch of nerds.  Develop for Google.  It's fun.  Always fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, we're trying to figure out how we're going to cover it.  The keynote, which is probably where most of the big announces will happen, is that morning, Wednesday morning before we do this week in Google.  So maybe I can come down for that.  Maybe we could probably do we'll figure it out.  Maybe find a locale in San Francisco that we can do the show Skype you and Jeff and maybe bring in some Google I.O. folks and do a special.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be I mean, I would love to see the studio, but it'd be cool if we could pull in a couple of people.  Yeah, we have a facility we can use.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's right next to Moscone.  So I think we can probably do that.  Go ahead, Jeff. I'm sorry.  What did you say?  The keynote.  Who speaks?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We don't know.  I don't know.  I'm I'm Googling.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Does it does it matter?  Is there someone that I mean, there's no Steve Jobs for Google.  Oh, that's exactly it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You wouldn't expect you wouldn't even want Larry or Sergey to talk.  They're kind of figureheads at this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Or at least visit and say hi, guys.  You know, to see him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But but there is nobody who's like the Roseberger.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  I think it's Jeff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.  I'd like to say what would I know?  I know what Google's going to do.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  That's all.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's it.  I'm looking through it right now.  And of course, it's very hard to find stuff on Google's.  Site.  They need a search engine or something.  Speakers women like here's speakers.  No, they just have all the names.  It's a really long list.  It's a long dang list.  Thank you for organizing the world.  Now, maybe they can organize their own pages.  Well, there there will be some interesting stuff to talk about.  In fact, Verizon says they're going to do a Android tablet.  Yay.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But also three months later, they're going to do a Google.  Three months late.  I mean, I don't know.  Is it too late?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is the iPad?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know.  Is it too?  I just I wanted to have heard this announcement, you know, three months ago.  TechCrunch published.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, Eric Schmidt made fun of the tablet Davos and said, you know, tell me what the  difference is between this and a big iPhone.  So I don't think I think it sounds a little rushed, actually.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's one of those sayings people trot out.  But that makes no sense at all.  It's it's like saying what's the difference?  Oh, a swimming pool.  It's just a big bathtub.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I have with me the tablet that replaces them all.  Whoa.  So jealous.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What is that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  This is the Intel Web tablet.  It's pretty old looking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got an antenna on it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The late 90s.  That's the old Intel logo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The old Intel and it had worked on Intel.  Any point.  And there were only a few production items made.  Let me see if I can.  Here it is.  Surf 150 feet away from your couch, from your PC.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, but that's a good example of I think the tablet technologies weren't there.  I mean, there was no Wi-Fi.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The ideas were there for something to browse on and surf on on the Web was there back then.  It was really cool.  I also, by the way, brought into my office for a museum at my old QCat.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  That's back, baby.  The cat is back.  I have what else here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have my news catcher.  Oh, yeah.  Blanking interval thing where you get the news on.  I have my old Modo.  Remember your PMDs?  Yeah.  It's kind of the original little news feed.  And then finally, the Planet Portal.  This is my favorite.  What the heck is that?  Because URLs were just too hard for us little people.  So it gave us buttons to push like computers and health and beauty and Wall Street Journal.  And this was what we were supposed to plug into our computers because URLs we couldn't  handle.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, please.  Well, that was the idea of the QCat too, is you would scan it so it would type a URL  in for you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm trying to get myself, for the museum I'm establishing here at CUNY of dead technology,  I'm trying to get myself an old Trash 80, the Radio Shack thing we used to use.  You know what I really want, if anybody in the audience has this, I would kill to have  the old Mojo wire, Xerox telecopier portable that we used to have to take with us on assignment  and put in the sheets one at a time and go, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump,  thump, thump, thump, thump, thump, thump.  That's the thing to have with an acoustic coupler on it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want a mimeograph machine because I miss the smell of the ink.  Poor Gina is sitting here saying, how did I get on this show with old men?  It's a bunch of old men and me.  What am I doing here?  HTC is responding to Apple's lawsuit.  You know, Apple, instead of suing Google, sues the handset manufacturer because they  don't have any patents.  HTC has announced today that it's suing Apple for violating five of its patents.  Hey, we got some patents too.  And asking the ITC, just as Apple said, halt the sale of the HTC phones.  They're asking the ITC to halt the importation and sale of the iPhone, iPad and iPod in the  United States.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is what happens.  Patent ping pong.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Mutually assured patent destruction.  Anyway, I hate, I don't even like talking about those stories because they're just,  they're not about getting something done.  They're about, you know, tying things up and it's not, it's not good.  Happy birthday says Gina Tripani to the Shell script that runs my life.  What's that all about?  It's true.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's true.  I wrote the Shell script like four years ago.  You live on a bash script.  I do.  I use a bash script to organize my to-do list.  It's kind of embarrassing.  I didn't know you're going to call this out on the show.  I love this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, we even, I think on the first show we mentioned to-do.sh.  Yep.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yep.  It's so funny because like the contents of the script now are so kind of far beyond my  skill level that I'm just like, I know it works and I can sort of identify chunks of  code, but it's been taken over by the, by Unix geeks far beyond my, my, my skill level.  But, but yeah, no, I've been using it every single day.  And so when I mark a task as done, it goes into this done.txt file.  And I looked at it because I was like, oh, this is four years later.  And it's like over a thousand lines of stuff that I've done.  So I could just like grab this history of four years worth of activity.  I love it.  Love it.  Love it.  Grep is an organizational tool.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Thank goodness.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Grep is an organizational tool.  Grep, sort.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now when they write a command line Facebook, I'll be back, baby.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Command line Facebook is it.  Is it?  But I actually think-  Do you use Pine, Gina?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's that?  She uses, of course she uses Pine.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Of course she's a-  Oh, you know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No?

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Do you use Mutt or Pine?  I use Gina.  That's right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That used to be, it was the, it was Emacs versus VI, Mutt versus Pine, wasn't it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Now Gina is part of our nostalgic moment here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She's starting to sound like an old man.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I think my first Android application, or at least my first attempt at one is going  to be manipulating to do text and interfacing with Dropbox's APIs to be able to mark things  as done and save it back to Dropbox so it kind of updates all your computers.  So I just applied for Dropbox API access today.  So I'm going to give it a shot.  I thought it'd be a pretty simple, cool little first app.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's something magical about text.  It's so easy to manipulate.  It's so small.  It just works.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  It's an old thing that does not belong in Jeff's museum.  Because it still works.  It should be a museum of stuff that's old but not dead and still too useful to ever  give up.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Do you think we'll ever get to the point where the keyboard, you know, that we really start  to use the keyboard as an exception?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think we're getting close with Apple buying Siri.  You don't think so, Doc?

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Well, it depends on what for.  I mean, if you're writing, I think the keyboard does what it does.  It is 19th century technology.  When was QWERTY invented?  I mean, it's going to be around for a while.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I guess it's survived, but boy, I wouldn't mind seeing something better.  I think Google's getting better and better at dictation.  It's dictation everywhere on the Android.  I think Apple said basically by buying Siri, we want to do something similar.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  I don't anyway.  I don't speak in Final Draft.  I still have to go in and change it.  I still have to go in and improve it.  So I need an editing tool.  So that's still going to be a requirement, I think.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, when you're talking about VRM, what do you think, Doc, of this whole Facebook  issue?  This really seems to be an example of a...

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Which Facebook issue?  Which of all houses are pecked?  There were many faces to the Facebook issue.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I think there's an overarching story that Facebook is ignoring its users, right?  Or not paying enough attention to its users.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Well, I think we create...  With Facebook, there's a lot of fear about Facebook's going to eat the web.  And what Facebook is doing is building the great indoors.  You know, it's the Mall of America or something like that.  I think it's still AOL 2.0.  And it's a tree that will not grow to the sky to keep changing metaphors.  And as long as they're trying to make advertising their main source of revenue, it's going to  be a problem.  I think the problem with this sort of wet dream that everybody's got in the advertising  business is we'll make advertising as personalized as possible.  And what it's doing is raising all these privacy red flags.  Because people basically don't want personalized advertising.  I think most people don't.  It's like they'd rather be a little bit anonymous.  They'd rather be a little bit generalized rather than...  I don't know, Doc.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you're going to get stuck with advertising anyway, wouldn't it be nice to at least make  it somewhat more relevant?  If you have the control over it.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Have you gone through...  When you're on a Facebook page.  OK, so I've got like 700 friends, right, on Facebook.  And I see three ads on the right.  I've gone through dozens and dozens and dozens of those and clicked on the thing that...  Look at all these other ads.  You know, I'm getting ads for under 30 singles.  I'm getting ads for, you know...  Well, that's just because it doesn't work.  It's doing a bad job.  That's the stuff where even the basic demographics of me are not well understood.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right, but they're doing a bad job.  And so you're actually making the point, I think, here.  You're complaining about the irrelevance of it.  And if they did a better job of targeting, you'd be more relevant.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  No, I actually...  I would pay not to see any ads at all.  Because then they're painting the ads.  That's a different model.  Well, it's a different model.  But I'm not trying to prove personalization.  What I'm trying to do is explore whether or not they're actually any good at it.  And I don't think they are.  I actually don't think even Amazon is that good at it.  Amazon is recommending to me books.  Books that I've written.  They're recommending to me books that I've already bought from them.  Right.  Well, this is a hard thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is kind of a famously hard thing to do.  Netflix put a million dollars up for just a small percentage improvement in its recommendation  engine.  It's a hard thing to do.  But I don't think that that's an indictment of the notion that advertising that's targeted  to something you're interested in is a bad thing.  I think customers...  Don't consumers say they want that?

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  I'm first...  I think we've moved past the point where we're all consumers.  I think we're producers as well as consumers.  What we're producing is not just better, more finely targeted crosshairs on our back for  people who are working a percentage game and maybe we're going to respond to one thing  or another.  I think, as I've said before, that improving a pain in the ass does not make it a kiss.  And what we need is a kiss.  The kiss isn't going to come from a company that's advertising.  It's coming from a company that actually knows us and has a relationship with us.  And it happens within that relationship, knowing that we're looking for X, Y, or Z, not that  they're hiring Facebook or even Google as an intermediary to help them target even better  what I might want.  I think that the inherent inefficiency of advertising in the long run makes it something  of a bubble.  And I think part of the bubbleness of advertising is that we're all talking about how to make  it better and better and better and better and better.  And there's a limit to that.  When we cross that limit, it might not even be advertising anymore.  It might just be what we call relationship.  You know?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The way I put it, Doc, is that advertising is failure.  In the ideal, you have a great product or service, people love it, they sell it for  you, they support it for you, you have a relationship with them, you advertise when that fails.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Well I think there's a place for advertising as we know it.  I think sports, for example, is always going to have ads for yellow beer and for erectile  dysfunction relief and for big trucks.  That's going to happen for the duration, I think.  And it's going to pay for...  That's targeted because, as we know, people who like football have a hard time getting  hard times.  What's that?  I missed the joke.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, don't worry about it.  I hope everybody did.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  I don't think that goes away.  I think what's going to happen is that a capacity that was inherent in the net in the first  place, which is it puts everybody at zero distance from everybody else, will allow the  demand side to engage the supply side with far more efficiency and granularity and trust  and a bunch of other things than it has had so far.  My perspective on that is that the web, as we know it anyway, is maybe 15 years old.  Since Netscape 1.0, it's been about 15 years.  It's a software in high school.  As Frank Stasio said when I was interviewed in North Carolina last week, it's not old  enough to download its own porn.  So we're inclined to think that, oh, gee, Google or Facebook or Twitter, all these things  are the end of times.  They're not.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Yes, of course.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  It's all provisional, as you know, even better than I do because I'm covering this in close.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But we also do, we're ad-supported media.  I can't for a variety of reasons charge people for our content.  So we have to pay for it somehow.  We pay for it with ads.  And it's somewhat targeted by its nature because people know that, well, anybody who listens  to a show about Google is going to be a geek.  So we have ads for products for geeks.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  No, there's nothing wrong with that.  There's nothing wrong with that.  If you have a wine magazine, I work for Linux Journal.  We've been thriving for 15 years, 16, 17 years, whatever it's been.  You've got ads in there.  But the ads for boards and ads for various kinds of software.  I think fashion magazines, for example.  And no ads for Viagra.  We probably could use that.  Open source advocates.  Have no problem.  No problems in the bedroom.  I actually think that geek stuff gets these guys up, so it's all right.  That's not a problem.  That is Viagra.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, the reason we bring this up, we spent several weeks talking about it, not just on  this show, but on all our shows, the eroding Facebook privacy policy.  You just wrote a good post, Jeff, about the difference between the public and a public.  And it's your thesis that that's really the disconnect, that neither Twitter nor Facebook  kind of understand what a public is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've been doing some research because I think this is the topic of my next book.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Another one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm not going to debate it.  I'll probably do this instead.  Because I've been trying to think about this idea of publicness and the value of publicness.  And then we talk all the time about the fear involved with privacy.  And that's inherent in this.  And so I'm trying to understand why was the reaction to this so volatile, so vitriolic,  more than anything else?  Was it just a last straw?  Was there something else here?  And I think that as I did research, looking back, there's the notion of Habermas.  That's the most intellectual thing I'll say in a long time.  In the 18th century, we saw the emergence of the public sphere.  But before that, what Gutenberg did and art did and printed music did was the ability  for people to create their own publics.  And so I saw in there, I hope, maybe a little bit of glimmer of where the confusion is for  especially Facebook, that I think that Zuckerberg thinks that once it's public, it's public.  But we made things in Facebook public only to a public, to our public, the public we  control.  In Facebook, we control who's in our public.  In Twitter, we control what publics we join.  In blogs, we publish to the whole public.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  To the public.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so this separation of a public and the public, though it sounds really like a geeky  way to say it, and I don't know a better way to say it, I think that's the line that Facebook  crossed.  So that this idea that, oh, you already made it public.  It's okay.  I'll publish it to the world.  Well, no.  I didn't.  That's not what I was doing.  Well, I'm going to make it really complicated for you to decide what you're doing with your  public.  No!  That was the whole point of Facebook.  That was this whole value that it added, was that it was real names and real relationships  and real people and not this anonymous world we had in the web as a whole.  And now it's mixing up the two.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it's all about context, right?  So you're saying, you know, this is the public that reads my blog.  This is the public I'm friends with on Facebook.  See, I think that's the difference between the advertising that freaks me out and the  advertising that I appreciate.  Like I appreciate personalized advertising, but not when it's so specific that I'm like,  how did you know that about me?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that is creepy, isn't it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's creepy when the ad says, hey, 34-year-old singles in San Diego on your cross street.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's pretty obvious on Facebook because you gave them all that information.  Right, right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And I know that.  But my sister-in-law saw that ad and the age changed from yesterday and then it was her  birthday.  And then it said 37-year-old and she said, wait a second.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it knows.  You told them your birthday.  You told them.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, this is what.  Right.  But I think that that's kind of the difference like being creeped out.  I mean, it's like if I'm watching The Ultimate Fighter, which I love that show, but it's  so clear it's a Spike TV, which is like for 20-year-old, you know, hormonal guys.  And you know, all the advertising is beer and, you know, Red Bull, Nostra Trucks and  all that stuff.  And it's like, okay, here I am participating in this sort of community of people who likes  to watch people get beat to death.  And I kind of expect that the advertising doesn't apply to me.  But you know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So the real question is, why are you watching UFC?  I don't.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't know.  There's this weird Greco-Roman thing.  I don't know.  It goes on.  It's also very gay.  I will make the argument.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Instead of Glee, you watch UFC.  I get it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I watch UFC and Glee.  Yeah, yeah.  So.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is why advertisers are confused about you, Gina.  They have no freaking idea what you are.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's your benefit.  But if I got an ad during The Ultimate Fighter that was clearly targeted toward women who  live in San Diego and like work in tech, I'd be freaked out.  I'd be like, they know something that they should know about me.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But time and time again, surveys have been done where people say, I hate ads unless it's  an ad for something I'm interested in knowing more about.  Then I like ads.  I mean, we know this.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We go looking for them sometimes.  Yes.  You go to Google search or when you buy Vogue magazine, you are seeking out ads and then  that's the contract you have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's why, by the way, ads in search work better by several orders of magnitude  than anything else.  That's really works.  So I don't see I don't have a problem with Facebook in that regard.  I don't.  There's a very telling, I thought, interview with a Facebook executive in the New York  Times today in the Bits blog.  What did you think of that?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The attitude seemed to be opt in.  Well, when you join Facebook, that's the opt in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You joined.  I was to me, I was I was seeing red.  I was livid.  It was one of a number of data items that convinced me.  I'm going to do it later on the show to delete all my presences on Facebook.  I was it was it was so disingenuous.  It was so clearly disingenuous that I just felt like these guys.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  OK, if I were ever just a genius or was it delusional?  Well, that's what I think is going on.  I mean, that's a good question.  I think I think it's it's it's an honest mistake, but it's a gigantic mistake.  You think it's honest.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So Jason Calacanis, we wrote a post which also I know Jason's talked about.  This before on Twitter.  He obviously there's something between him and Zuckerberg.  He does not like Mark.  And it was, you know, it was a vicious post.  But I don't know.  Maybe. And you could certainly say that they're both entrepreneurs.  Mark has had huge success.  Jason's had success, but nothing in that order.  But I think that he makes some very good points in between all of the to operation.  And one of the points is that Mark is amoral.  And and then Facebook is ultimately amoral.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's that's the question I was trying to ask.  And we should go. We'll go to Jason Ward a second.  But I guess that's the question I was trying to ask is that I think that Mark believes fully.  And I got email from others saying that after reading more, Mark said that they don't agree with this.  But but my assumption in the past has been that he really does think that by connecting people, he changes the world.  So the more we connect, God damn it, disconnect.  And you should do that.  The problem I have here is I think that he didn't do.  Google defines and redefines evil all the time.  Famously, I don't think that Facebook has ever defined evil.  What's going too far? Yeah.  And they don't have a culture of doing that.  They don't have a culture of enabling people to ask that.  And so it leads them astray in a way that's going to hurt the company.  The other piece of this is not just your public's and the public, it's also identity.  And if Facebook thinks that it can control our identity in this world, it's quickly becoming wrong.  Versus what I said in my post, Leo, was your view last week with Gina about if Google made your personal profile page, the first link on a search for you and it became canonical.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I control my identity.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's your identity. That's the identity you control.  So Facebook is potentially losing this huge investment in a way that I think and then the PR stuff also shows them to be tone deaf to this.  Yes. In a way that I think if it were purely cynical, they'd be better at it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Listen to what Elliott Schrag, he's vice president for public policy at Facebook, says in this New York Times interview.  He says, nobody at Facebook wants to make our users lives more difficult.  We want to make our users lives better.  Our mission is for Facebook to be the best place in the world to connect and share with friends and family.  And he says, we're just not doing a good enough job communicating.  We're not telling you what's going on.  I'm sorry. I just don't think that they're delusional.  I think that they're deluding.  I think that they're really actively attempting a number of things.  And it doesn't to me. I'm not worried about them selling information about marketing.  That's not to marketers. That's not what I'm worried about.  I'm worried about a power grab. They're trying to control the Internet.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They want to control your info. That's not the issue.  So what's your worst case analysis for what Facebook does that everything in the world goes through Facebook with the like button?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That Facebook is the ultimate home of for all this data and that everything that we do,  everything we participate in is mediated by Facebook.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Gina, Doc, what are your worst fears?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That every major web app will incorporate the Facebook mechanisms like the like button, just like Leo said,  and that just like Leo said, that I'll be interacting with Facebook even when I'm at my sort of favorite web apps,  because they're like, well, Facebook has the users and they can drive the traffic.  It's all Facebook Connect.  Yeah, right. Right. Everything becoming Facebook Connect.  Now, weirdly, I'm not really that worried about Google Ads being everywhere or Google Analytics,  JavaScript snippets being on pretty much every web page I visit every day.  And it goes back to what you said.  I mean, you know, Google seems to have sort of this public conscience in that they do constantly define evil and redefine evil.  And Google has a little bit of a guilt complex.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, they're like Germans. They're going, oh, we were bad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You could tell that they do.  With Facebook, Facebook's just sort of like Asperger's, you know what I mean?  Like just completely.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that was what that was the word, by the way, a very inflammatory word that Jason used to describe Mark Zuckerberg.  And I wouldn't use that word, but I would use the word perhaps amoral, not immoral, but amoral.  And there is a certain thread going through a lot of technology and a lot of technologists where  the technology trumps all we can do it.  So we will do it. And that's not our we don't need to worry about morality.  We're just technologists. You know, it's Oppenheimer versus.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Wow. They want to be the biggest nuclear power on the net, I guess, and to everybody.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oppenheimer had a conscience.  I can't remember the other guy's name, but he was just a trustworthy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  Chat room.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's the old men again. Teller.  Teller.  Teller just said, well, no, we're just we're going to invent it.  That's not our job. We're not. We're scientists.  It's not our job to moralize or determine what it's being used for.  It is merely our job to invent it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Oppenheimer said Tom, there are song.  The Rockets go up. There they go down.  That's not my job.  It's not my job. Not my business.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I feel like that that is a threat in technology that we need to be really aware of, alert to and fight.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. That is something that I think all geeks have to keep in mind for sure.  It's funny. I don't want to say amoral because that feels that feels it's a judgment, oddly and judgmental to me, too.  Like a comfortably judgmental to me.  I don't mean it judgmentally.  Asperger's is pretty judgmental.  I don't mean it judgmentally.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean that it's not in the equation for them.  They don't believe it's their job to consider evil or not evil.  They just are doing what they do.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But do you think, Leo, that Zuckerberg is sincere when he says that he sees a new world of people more connected?  I'm not trying to get too much credit.  But again, I think that I don't see him as being purely cynical.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know.  I can't speak to his motivations because who knows?  You know, we don't know what his intent is.  We can't read it.  I mean, my suspicion is, yeah, my suspicion is he's cynical and and he doesn't really care.  But I don't know. He may have and it's a nice gloss to put.  Oh, we just want to connect everybody.  It's a wonderful gloss.  Technology companies of late have gotten very good at glossing stuff that's good for them and couching it.  And I blame you, Doc, couching it in in terms that are very positive.  They've learned the lingo of connection, conversation.  They read Clutrain.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Absolutely. The best.  The worst thing about the consequences of clutrain is that we have oxymoronic conversational marketing.  We can talk at people now.  We can we can call every damn thing there is a conversation and and be no more personal than we were before.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's because these people are fundamentally tone deaf.  And so they don't I don't I think you're probably right.  They don't get what they're doing. Go ahead.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I mean, I mean, they're you know, they're I just think it.  I don't think, by the way, that Zuckerberg is is a moral.  I just think he's full of it. And that's and I think and delusional is maybe the wrong word.  But I think he's reading he's reading a lot of things wrong.  And I think every it's sort of the nature of large companies to want to take over as much as they can and control as much as they can.  I think Google, to a remarkable degree, is less inclined to do that than any other company that I know.  They get open source. They get what the net is about.  They come from that.  This is what what Jeff's book is about.  And and I think that that's the advantage there.  I don't think that I agree with Gina, by the way, I have the same fear that that we're all going to start using some Facebook back end because that's the convenient thing to do.  And that has a lot of users and the rest of it. But I think they're going to arc over.  I think that they're I think they're going to wear out.  And I think there's going to be any number of other things that come along that will be just as fashionable and just as interesting.  And and move people away from it.  I mean, we were saying the same things about my space, you know, four years ago, five years ago.  And and well, and Yahoo in their time.  And they say it about Twitter now.  Yeah. And about Twitter as well.  I think Twitter has a sense, some sense anyway, of of their place in the world.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it's not only when it's too late for them.  I think what I'm hearing here is Twitter.  Twitter still has a chance to listen well and define evil.  And in fact, I've talked about that stuff about Southwest.  I'm getting a sense that it's too late for Facebook.  Now, the question is, some will say to you, Leo, OK, fine.  So you leave this 400 million soon, 500 million people there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So we lost one. Yeah, they could care less.  And I admitted I'm being a little grandstanding, but I I think it's important.  I'm going to talk about my radio show where I deal with much, much more normal users.  Precisely. Who have not considered any of this.  I mean, this is this is all way of struts minutia to them.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is there any way that they could if if because I would think that the investors  in Facebook have to be upset about this, too, if they see the potential of a of a fall here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But there isn't going to be there's 400 million users.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's what you're saying.  Well, that was that was the case that Pete Rojas made when he left.  And I had a conversation with him on Twitter.  And he said that the fast growth masks the problem.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, very good point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And it's a really good point.  And it's happened with lots of companies.  And it goes to your tech point, too, that you don't notice there's a problem  because hell, man, we're growing like crazy.  500 million people are going to control the world.  And there's something nagging there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And of course, we're the we're the, you know, the the sand and the oyster  that's bugging it.  This is let me read from Schrag's quote.  This is the one that you were referring to in the Times.  Well, the TimesBits blog post is reader questions and then answers from Elliott Shragg.  The question from Abbeycats in New York.  Why not simply set up everything for opt in rather than opt out?  Facebook seems to assume that users generally want all the details of their  private lives made public.  Elliott's response.  Everything's opt in on Facebook.  Participating in the service is a choice.  We want people to continue to choose Facebook every day.  But that's a telling sentence.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I want to use that voice in these moments.  Adding. Yeah.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  You're reading this like an obituary.  You should read all terms of use.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You should be soothed by what I'm saying.  We care.  You know what it is?  It's the mortician's voice.  Yeah. Adding information, uploading photos or posting status updates or  liking a page.  They're all opt in.  Please don't share if you're not comfortable.  That said, we certainly will continue to work to improve the ease and access  of controls to make more people more comfortable.  Your assumption about our assumption is simply incorrect.  We don't believe that.  We're happy to make the record on that clear.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Huh? Nobody's making you smoke.  It's it's robotic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's robotic. It's weirdly robotic.  So I'm getting more and more uncomfortable about all of this.  And here's what makes me uncomfortable.  Look, I'm smart enough to know that everything I post on Facebook is potentially public.  So I'm just going to only put stuff on there that's public.  In fact, that was the solution I came to last week.  I'm going to keep the account.  But but then and just it's public.  But then I realize there's a really insidious problem here.  If I use Facebook at all, whether it's as a public persona or as a private persona,  I'm coercing either my public or my friends to use Facebook,  because the only way they can interact with me is by joining Facebook and participating.  So in a way, it's this and it's this was that we talked about the Farmville.  It's this coercion of of social relationships.  I'm coercing people I'm in relationship with to Girl Scout cookies.  Yeah, to do something bad, to do something I know fundamentally is bad.  And it crystallized for me when I talked to my kids last night,  18 year old Abby and 15 year old Henry.  What do you understand about Facebook and privacy and public?  For instance, I said, Abby, you really should treat everything you post on Facebook  as public, because ultimately, maybe you don't necessarily know.  And and there's all sorts of issues.  And she says, no, no, no, I put private stuff on there all the time.  And I'm it's it's private.  And that really concerned me that even a sophisticated 18 year old  know does not make that distinction and is not aware of the issues.  And so I decided I did not want to be complicit in this, frankly.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  What are you saying to your kids?  Are you not? Will you no longer be able to spy on your 18 year old?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you I do not have the password to her account,  although she foolishly often uses my computer and logs into.  She logs into Facebook on my computer.  And I always know she has because it's her pages in French, because she's pretentious.  And so I know all that.  And there's Abby's page.  I can. But I'm very good and I don't look at it.  Do you spy on your kids' Facebook page, Doug?

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  I only found out he had a Facebook page recently.  He's 13.  He goes he goes to a school that discourages the use of computers, even.  And everybody in his class has a Facebook account.  Of course they did.  And yeah, it's there's huge benefits.  It's all very innocent stuff.  It's mostly, you know, you know, where are we going to go hang out?  And what are you doing?  Yeah, it's innocent. Stuff like that.  So there's not a.  In fact, I asked him once I knew he was there, I said, are you sure?  Do you want me to friend you here?  Because I don't want to, you know, jump in on your private life.  He says, I don't care. Really?  Oh, that's interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not allowed to be anywhere near them in any way.  Especially.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jake, of course, is all too good at the privacy controls.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He knows what he's doing.  But Jake's a Facebook's builder.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Jake, I haven't got a quiz in more interview on this actually for my book.  But but he's kind of confused why people are so upset with Zuckerberg now.  He says Facebook is, you know, it kind of makes sense to him.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, makes sense again for from a purely business point of view.  Makes sense. I'm sophisticated.  I don't understand the controls for the life of me.  You know, that's the next question.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Do you think that if you don't understand the opposite?  Oh, my God. Well, exactly.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't. It strikes me that no one could possibly understand what's going on here.  And by the way, try and find out how you can deactivate easily.  It's in your settings.  Try to find a way to delete your Facebook account.  It's hard.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, Doc, you're doing VRM.  I mean, all of all the privacy controls in Facebook are basically their VRM.  So they have it.  But some would say it's obfuscated.  I mean, how do you deal with that?

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  If it were truly VRM, it would be, you know, something is common,  not only to Facebook, but to many other things.  So that's a big one.  Open standards.  By the way, I should put in a plug this this coming week.  Just before Google I.O.  is something called the Internet Identity Workshop, which I help organize.  It's at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View.  And it's very much a pass the hat, get in and get in kind of thing.  It's the tenth one of these open ID, OAuth, micro formats.  A lot of things like that were were visited there, incubated there,  came out of there one way or another.  They're discussed all the time.  It moves identity forward every time we get together.  And there are Facebook people there, too.  You know, so but they're they're the geek ones.  And it's it's interesting to be some good, some really fine geeks  have gone to work there and don't seem to feel morally compromised about it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But let's see. But anyway, I was just doing a search on Google.  How do I? OK, how do I find my IP address, get a password, know if I'm pregnant?  How do I love the the number six item?  Numbers five item.  How do I delete my Facebook account?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I love these Google Suggest games.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  That's the dark thing that Jeff is talking about.  OK, that's the that's quite that means a lot of people are searching.  Right. It's a pearl in an oyster right there.  That is definitely a pearl.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you're going to do the history of Facebook, when did this moment come?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. Recently.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's been a while ago.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Recently, it came with this last enough. Yeah.  So it's jump the shark. There it is.  So it's 400 million people jump into shark all at once.  But they won't flash.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When is when Doc, when does the network effect become so potent,  so powerful that you cannot overcome it, that it's done?  I mean, yes, we're a young corrections.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  I mean, so is the network effect in the way up?  But the one on the way down exists as well.  Well, it's a Microsoft problem.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  People go about Google with Microsoft.  No, Facebook is becoming Microsoft.  It occurs to me here because we don't have alternatives.  As Eric Schmidt says, for every single thing that Google does,  there is a perfectly good alternative.  Want to leave Google, go to Bing, you'll find knowledge in the world. Right.  But Facebook, by trying to become the network  of our identities and connections, you leave it.  You leave all your identities and connections.  Leave your friends.  But we have a little room.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. And diaspora is I don't know if it's the right alternative effect.  I know we should get Ken Shepperton in here, who's our VP technology, because  there are a lot of people in the open source community  who say diaspora is exactly the wrong response.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  I only found out about it yesterday.  I donated a hundred bucks when I.  I've done it. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The cheap guy. Yeah.  Well, whatever.  The whole point is the intentions are right.  Yeah. The whole point.  The intentions are right.  But let's get Ken in here because he does have something to say upon this.  If you go to Kickstarter dot com, that's the donation site.  Diaspora is a Kickstarter project, which means they're saying, give us money.  Oh, my God. It was twenty thousand yesterday.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to be a living out of this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Their goal was ten thousand in less than a month.  They got more than their goal.  Yesterday was twenty thousand is now forty three thousand dollars  donated through or pledged through Kickstarter.  These guys are just college kids.  They're going to they're going to from NYU's current institute.  They're planning to spend the summer building diaspora.  I think they have enough money to do that now.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  So you need to track the growth of that number along with the  the ranking of the delete my Facebook account and Google.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm actually stunned because that was twenty thousand yesterday.  Is now four. That's amazing.  Good for them. There is something going on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They got a New York Times feature today.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, there you go. That's what's going on.  That's what's going on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, but what they're trying to do is create, in essence,  the public Facebook, right, where you control everything.  And it's a seed.  And I kind of like that, but it's it's apples and oranges.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, can pull your pull your mic in because Ken Shepperton's here.  He's a developer, web developer, known him for a long time.  And I'm at Bearhug Camp when we were trying to get Twitter to open up.  And he he's our new VP Engineering's replacing Colleen any day now.  But you had a problem with.  The way diaspora is going about it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well, I just you see this quite often with the open source projects where  and Kevin Marks is actually an IRC.  He'd know a little bit more about this than I do,  but you see this quite often where people look around and they see what open  source projects are already out there and they say, well, I don't see the  the project there that does exactly what I want to want it to do.  So I'm going to go start my own rather than a whole new project, right?  Rather than looking around and looking at what other projects are  are doing something similar to what I want or what other protocols

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  are contributing to strikes me.  We probably should be looking for existing protocols  that we could cobble together. Right. Right.  Gina, does that make sense?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's always it's often a better choice to reuse code  that already exists, right, because people have put in time and effort.  But but but it is it's true.  It is a problem with open source projects.  I think that people say, well, let me just start a new one  versus using using one that's already out there.  I mean, I guess I guess the question is, you know, what's already out there?  You know, that that maybe this project could roll into or use on top of.  I mean, can do you do you want to?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, is there something like I mean, I'd like to is that a solution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Identica, Evan Padromo's tried to do sort of the same thing back in July.  What was it? 2008?  There's a little known project out there, I think, called Nose Rub.  It's it's another thing that somebody just started  because there wasn't anything that they could find.  Kevin Marks and the activities, the activity streams work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The the people who started it seems like the pieces are out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a Diceo project that Kevin Christmas, you know, started working on.  He they mentioned in the diaspora documentation that they  it wasn't going anywhere.  So we decided to start this project.  And I just point out that the diaspora project isn't a project yet.  They're they're collecting more guys saying, let's we want to do something.  Yeah, they're saying that if you fund us at this level,  so maybe it's not too late.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe it's not too late to say, guys, yeah, we gave you a lot of money.  But what we're saying is we're voting for an open alternative.  Maybe it's not from scratch.  Maybe it's combining all of these existing technologies.  Maybe it's more a movement than it is software volunteer to advise.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Not that they're going to have enough.  You know, I don't know. You guys know far better than I do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I volunteer.  I'll advise them. Yeah.  I'm sure Gina, you'd be glad to help out. Absolutely. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are a lot of parallels between this and what happened with  Identica and Laconic, where Twitter was in this period  where it was crashing all the time and people were upset with the fact  that it was this closed system.  I was one of them. I went there to support them.  I don't use it.  People first went over to Jaiku and then they wandered over to Identica.  And there's still lots of people are using Identica,  but it never got critical mass just because 90% of the people  didn't know about it, didn't move over to it.  And now it's out there.  But it's still it's not challenging Twitter for mind.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So is the solution to push Facebook to back down, do open stuff,  participate in the community, not try to do a closed  because that is that even a doable strategy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so.  Maybe that's what we should be doing.  In the end, all these services end up trying to compete for page views  and for ad impressions and or trying to get people to sign up  to use their UI and to use their service.  But there isn't really it doesn't seem like there's a business model out there  that allows people to go out and contribute to protocols  and really altruistically work on a protocol and get these systems to connect.  They always end up saying like the diaspora folks, oh, well, yeah.  And in the end, we'll probably charge to host something.  They want to do a hosted server.  And then they're going to start to compete and try to.  There's going to be another Facebook.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Should this be these are donations.  Should this become a Mozilla of identity?

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Well, there's the interesting I really like what you're saying about  about protocols, because that's what we need, you know,  and maybe the protocols that they're already are there or are they not?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, we're going to get Chris.  Chris going to be on next week because I think so.  Yeah, I think Chris is seen as a good guy to talk about this.  Certainly that's now he's at Google now, but he's he's been very involved in.  Well, and Chris and that's why he's doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It actually David record on it at Facebook,  who was very active in the community before going to Facebook.  These guys, I may just be missing what they're saying now  that they're in these larger companies, but they sort of fall off the map.  And all the efforts, Brad Fitzpatrick at Google now, who was building.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I've also talked about Rick Clow, who's he's going to be on to manager for  Google profile. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just hard to find a sustainable sort of  critical mass of people who can do something outside of the sphere  of influence of the Google or the Facebook or right.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  And I think Kevin Marks stayed with it, going both going in and out of Google.  I think his output remained pretty much the same.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I would agree. Yeah.  It's one of the reasons we really like Kevin, have him on as much as we can,  because I think he has three or four functions.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Aren't there here if you if you try to start to separate it,  there's there's an identity function, which is what you talked about  a week ago with with profile.  There's this publishing function of here's my stuff. Right.  There's a joining function of one of my connections to people.  And Facebook kind of try to bring them all together.  And that's probably the main problem they have.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like what is GeoCities?  It's like what if GeoCities said, we're the web and if you  and somehow coerce people that everybody ought to create a web page,  created on GeoCities, that would be a good thing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, Riley is kind of arguing that we have that kind of new OS  fight going on and that in essence, Apple is competing to be the web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I agree.  I think they all would like to. Right.  I'm sure Google. Well, maybe not. That's a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, Google's following the same approach for for Buzz,  where they're saying we're going to support off and and Sam.  That's why I like Buzz.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And they're just cobbles together. Open protocols.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It will be nice when they actually roll that out.  They have to have an API.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  We should advise our fuzz.  And how would they get Buzz right? Maybe because it ain't now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we're certainly rattling.  Ken, thank you for coming in.  We were certainly rattling the tree on this.  We're going to take a break. When we come back, I'm going to press the button  to delete my Facebook account.  We could talk more about this.  There's gosh, there's so much news we haven't even gotten to.  We'll get to as much as we can.  There's a there's a Google Wave story from.  Did you write this, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Um, which for Fast Company, which one?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Fast Company, Google Wave got its groove back.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, I actually didn't.  I didn't add that to the front feed.  I'm not that self-promoting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I'll promote for you. How about that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Thank you. Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Before we go any further, I do want to mention our friends at Citrix,  the makers of GoToAssist.  If you're in the tech support industry, the business,  if you have software you support, you're an IT person.  Maybe you're just the the family geek and you support a lot of friends  and family with PCs and Macs, you should know about GoToAssist from Citrix.  It is simply the fastest, easiest way to do remote assistance.  You know, Citrix does go to my PC, that great, you know,  remote desktop background they've got makes this such a fast and easy  use product. Your family, your clients, your your support ease  don't have to have it installed ahead of time.  They you send them a link, they click it.  It downloads in a second and now they're ready and you can get in there  whether they're there or not.  You know, they can give you the right to get in unattended, which is very nice.  You don't have to wait till your clients around to fix the computer.  You can have up to eight sessions at once, which means you can start a scan  or install in a system and then move to the next and next while it's going on.  It gives you an assay of what software is running, including security software  and operating system, as I said, PC or Mac.  You even have two way screen sharing so you can show them  what's on your screen if you want integrated live chat.  So you can say, here's what I'm doing.  What was the symptom you had?  That kind of thing. Citrix is so great.  They've got all the data encrypted, of course, using end to end 128 bit SSL.  There's free customer support 24 7. That's for you.  Give it a try. 30 days free.  Go to assist dot com slash twig.  That's the that's the URL.  Go to assist dot com slash twig.  Citrix is a great supporter of this week in Google.  I guess they're a cloud product, aren't they? After all.  So we're really glad to have their help keeping the show on the air.  And you can help us by going to go to assist dot com slash twig.  Help yourself to.  We're talking about Facebook and I'm ready to pull the plug.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Before you delete it, there's one person I see who said everybody should leave  their Facebook profile saying you can now find me over these other places.  In other words, you're limiting everything, but a pointer to maybe I should do that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Huh? You think instead of deleting it.  Yeah, don't slow me down. I was on a roll.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I mean, it seems like there are two issues.  No, Leo, don't jump. Don't jump.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  With building like an open Facebook, there's like the issue of like consuming  and and publishing open protocols, right?  Using open protocols.  But then there's this issue of like federation, right?  So if I understand it right, diaspora gives you an installable  application that you can put on your own server, post your own data. Right.  And that's I mean, that's not something that most Facebook users are going to do.  So really, it has to be like Facebook, which is the service which anybody can join.  It is free. You don't need a web server.  You don't even have to understand what a web server is.  But then there has to be this other option where you can.  So we're talking about federation and open protocols.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And so others can come along and find a business opportunity  in creating the red herring of, you know, we don't mean that red hat of diaspora.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Red Herring was a magazine. We don't want a red herring.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right. Right. And that's a tough that's a tough it's a tough business model.  I mean, WordPress does it right.  They have the hosted service that they have.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah. And they benefit from all the work that goes on.  And I talked to Polaris, the investors, when they did that deal  and only echoed what Mark was saying, but leave the open open.  And you're going to benefit.  And yeah, you're the first to build on top of it.  You'll get the advantage of doing that.  But you'll also get the advantage of the platform being trusted and added to.  If Facebook had any damn sense,  they'd open source the things that are most bothering us.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hmm. I guess all right.  I guess I shouldn't delete it. You're right.  I should probably just I wish I could get rid of all the content,  except for one wall post saying, I'm not here.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm not here. You shouldn't be here either.  Come sign me here.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How long before Facebook deletes that one?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You create a new identity on Facebook.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, that's what you do. Leo two dot.  Oh, that's what you do.  OK, so I delete it and then come back at some point.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I'm trying to convince you to jump here. I don't.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Yeah. The IRC wants you to delete it, by the way.  There's a chat room is chanting, delete, delete, delete.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, they're the crowd on the street below.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah. So I did that Google search.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  They want to see you through the corpse of Facebook.  I will do it. I will do it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I did that delete that the Google search and WikiHow yesterday  posted a very good article on how to permanently delete a Facebook account  that talks about some important steps like make sure you remove  your Facebook Connect logins.  If you've been using that exclusively on sites like dig.com,  you want to create an account because you'll lose that account.  They also give you a direct link to a page that is hidden deep within Facebook.  The delete account form.  And you won't see this unless you really know where you're going.  If you do not think you will use Facebook again and would like your account deleted,  I'm sorry, Dave, I can't do that.  We can take care of this for you.  Keep in mind, you will not be able to reactivate your account or retrieve any of the con.  You know, they really act like you're going to do something significant, right?  And I'm going to just quickly.  You're about to be sure I'm going to just in case you're a robot, I'm going to.  Let me actually.  What do I care if you get my password?  I'll type in my.  It's come to think of it.  Actually, you don't want people to get your password because it's

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  going to tell you to burn the witch.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, burn the witch.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You remember there was a Saturday night live early on where the audience  decided whether to kill Larry the lobster.  I feel like this is it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is Larry going in the pot right now.  By the way, they say you have two weeks to change your mind.  We're only going to deactivate it.  And if you do anything that in any way touches your account, we're back.  So I should really just change the password.  I don't like anything.  Don't you can't like anything?  You can't use Facebook Connect.  You can't in any way, you know, accidentally log in because it'll say,  Oh, see, we knew we knew.  OK, there we go.  Your account now has been deactivated and will be permanently  deleted within 14 days.  If you log in, your account will be reactivated and you'll have the  option to cancel your request.  So there you go.  We have to start sitting Shiva for you.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So that's it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's gone.  It's gone.  Yeah.  And I think that's the right thing to do.  And I think you're right.  What I will do is create a Leo Laporte account sometime down the road.  There are already fan pages that say I don't do Facebook.  Here's why you shouldn't.  And see you on my blog.  Is the blog the right answer, the personal blog?  Is that the right place to to start controlling your identity?

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Well, it's certainly the best place to express yourself in something  longer than 140 characters, which it always has been.  I mean, I think a blog is simply a publication.  Controlling your identity, I think, is a different thing.  I think there's a you know, you need a kind of a dashboard or some kind  of a context for doing that, and it has to be open source and it has to be  something that can be universally used or at least at the meta level can  include a number of different approaches to doing that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What do you think about Google Profile, Doc?  I mean, we've talked about that.  I don't know enough about it.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I'm the wrong guy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I use that.  But as Jeff pointed out, if it showed up at the top of the Google search for me,  I'd be perfectly happy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that's why having Rick Clow on it can be really interesting to see if  he can talk, he's the new product manager and see what they're thinking at Google.  Because this is their opportunity now.  They've got an opening.  They've been nowhere on social, nowhere on identity.  And the question is, what can they do right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  Mm hmm.  You know, and one of the questions that I did ask myself about this is, do I get  benefit from Facebook that I'm giving up?  What is the intangible benefit?  Uh, and can that be transferred to another outlet?  And you know, because 400 million people use Facebook have, you know,  people are trying to find me, but this is exactly the problem I have.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think Twitter is my new Facebook.  Yeah.  Pretty much.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I want Google to be.  I want, so do you want people to go to Facebook to find you or go to Google to  find you?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google, web search.  That's why identity is different from your public.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Exactly.  Your public.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Making your work.  Cause you know, let's get to, I'll go too far, which is what I do for a living.  If the family is dead, we create new families at Facebook.  We decide what to do as a family.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what that is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Identity is an entirely different thing.  It is your identity to the world.  And Facebook's big mistake, I think in the end was to try to mix the two because  your identity is what you give to the whole world.  Your, um, publics, your limited publics, your families are what you feel safe in  and you need control over both.  So the other mistake Facebook made was by saying, don't worry, we're just going  to gather all this stuff and share it for you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What do you say to people?  And I get calls like this on the radio show a lot who say, well, if you Google  me, you get all sorts of awful stuff.  Or what if your name is just John Smith?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, that's Google's opportunity is to have you take over your identity.  That's who can become the verifier of identity.  That's a huge job.  Some have said over the years, the post office should do it.  Uh, should banks do it?  I don't think anymore.  Um, could Google do it?  Is there a way, you know, Twitter is actually the one organization that  does now verify identities.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But don't dare change your profile because I was verified and then changed  the bio and I'm not unverified.  And that's been months.  So I unverified myself by changing.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Truth is we have the fake Leo here.  You'll never know.  I deleted his account.  He is gone and I'm in charge now.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  So Leo, one of the guys in the IRC is wondering how many fake Leos will now show up.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there may be.  There are other Leo report pages and stuff.  Uh, there was a fake Leo for a long time.  Um, but.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I, I still think the webpage rules all right.  So, you know, I decided to set up my own webpage and code it by hand.  You could use the page that Google profiles created for you.  Even Facebook creates a public page.  I think, I think the reality is though, that we all should say everyone in the  world is going to have a webpage hosted wherever they want to choose, you know,  and they choose to host it.  Facebook is a choice, right?  Cause it does create a public facing page that defines you and that the way that  you find people is through searching the web for that page.  And I mean, a blog is a particularly good solution for establishing your identity,  especially for someone like John Smith, who says all this junk comes up for me  because blogs are, you know, really good food for search, you know, engine, you  know, engine robots and we'll get pages with your name, you know, to the top of  the search results, just be by virtue of the fact that they update a lot.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Um, but it does have to be something that everybody uses, right?  I mean, that's the reason Facebook has this power.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It has to be something you can find from anywhere.  Right.  So I can create my own canonical page about me and Google, if it's somewhere  anywhere, it's my blog, you search for me.  I think bug machine comes up first and that's exactly what it does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But you're giving a lot of power to Google because if it doesn't, if that  thing does not exist on Google, then you don't exist.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, any search engine replace Google with, but you can't replace Google with

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  any search.  That's the point is that Google is, can you, yeah.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  The important thing is substitutability and in economic systems and that's  I guess that's what you were saying.  Google at the search level is it's substituted.  It's already substitutable.  It's not  my, my Google profile page is actually better than some of those.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google's profile page is worthless.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wonder if my Google profile page comes up on Bing.  It doesn't come up on Google.  Wouldn't it be funny if it came up on Bing, but not Google?  Yeah.  It doesn't seem to come up on Bing either.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, the thing is, you know, how to search and just, and just  discover pages inbound links, right?  Generally.  I mean, so I mean, do you link your Google profile?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My blog gets links because it's in conversation.  My identity page would get no links because it's rather static.  It just says, hi, I'm Jeff.  So that's why Google has to change its view of, I get identity and there's so  many people who are doing so much more than this than I do, you know, creating  things like OAuth and all that, but identity is a different world from publishing.  A different world from creating societies, Publix, whatever you want to call it.  Is frenzy related to this at all?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Actually, my Google profile comes up number four result on Bing.  On Bing?  Yeah.  My Wikipedia.  So I have, so my webpage is number one.  My Wikipedia page, which I just discovered and weirded me out is number two.  And yeah, so that's, that's interesting.  So I guess, so Bing is definitely indexing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But for some reason, mine's not on there at all.  I wonder why.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Maybe because-  By the way, there's, there's, there's breaking news that Eric's saying who of  Google running Android is going to Facebook.  Oh, great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  What was his, what was his position at Android?

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  They said chief.  I don't think he's that, but I don't know.  I don't know.  Eric's.  Ooh, I'm mad.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The other Jeff Jarvis, I being the Jeff Jarvis, the other Jeff Jarvis, the  jazz musician, the one with talent is number one on Bing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Jeff, that's really bad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's bad.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We could Google listeners where we all sit around and Google ourselves.  That's so sad.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Eric, by the way, was senior product manager for Android.  So a fairly high up Android going to Facebook.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  So maybe Facebook's going to make a phone or maybe Facebook's going to make  Yeah, of course they will.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Of course they will.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Would they have, would they make an Android phone?  Would they make it?

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  It'll look like that Borg thing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Resistance is futile.  Oh, I got my Facebook phone.  How do you like it?  That's great.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Isn't it?  You'll never get one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I don't get a Facebook.  You know, and that's the other thing is there's this, there is this social  coercion.  I'm I expect pressure from my family and friends.  What, why aren't you, what happened?  We can't find you anymore.  You don't exist for us anymore.  But I think that's when you say that's those are the times you really have to  start to fight when it's that kind of situation.  I think we should wrap it on, on that note.  There are a lot of other stories we're going to have a lot more to talk about.  Obviously next week, Google IO and we will report right after the keynote and  let you know what's going on with the Google.  Meanwhile, before we go, I had time for our tool number and tip of the week,  starting with Gina Tripani and our tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Really simple, short, easy one.  How to delete your Facebook page.  How to delete Facebook page.  I'm actually going to, it's actually going to be a Google thing.  We talked about Facebook a lot this.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's do something.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We're going to get complaints.  The irony is Facebook's not a cloud.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It isn't, but it, but it, it does tie in a little bit to our, our main.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does.  It does.  You can now draw drag and drop images into Gmail by default Chrome only, but  other browser support is coming.  So I love this.  I love this because you know, back in, I don't know, whatever, two years ago,  when everyone was talking about when are we going to move to web apps?  Well, you can't drag and drop files into web apps.  Well, now you can.  And so with Gmail right now, if you're running Chrome, I believe it's windows  only, I actually didn't try it on my Mac.  Just drag and drop images right from your explore, you know, from your file  system into your compose window.  And I believe you can even resize them before you send.  So it's just sweet.  Yeah.  It just launched this week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I use Chrome.  I have to say more and more and more.  Yeah.  Um, I'm really liking it's fast.  Uh, it's got enough extensions now that I don't feel like I'm missing anything  in Firefox, Firefox is getting slower.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.  You know, who's the winner is web kit.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Web kits, the winner, right?  That's the engine behind.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Thank you, Apple and Linux geeks.  What do you know?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cause it's the K it's the K engine, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, I just, uh, installed, uh, Ubuntu, uh, lucid links.  Uh, on a netbook and it's the best install I've ever done.  Highly recommended it.  Uh, this is a Samsung NC 20 is fairly generic, Adam based netbook, but it saw  the camera, saw the Bluetooth, saw the wifi I've never yet installed Linux  without having to do a little broad com chip hacking or something.  It was like wind.  It was better than windows.  Really fast.  It works great.  It's beautiful.  I think Ubuntu, I think canonical has done a very good job of making  Ubuntu the desktop, uh, Linux.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  That's great.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Laptop Linux, which is pretty amazing to run on a netbook.  Yeah.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  There is, there is not a white box laptop.  I mean, right.  They're all something.  They're all a little different and partly because Microsoft made them that way.  You know, they don't, this custom work with all these different makers.  And now maybe they've stopped doing that.  That's one reason why.  Maybe they would love it.  If you do the art, the Chrome OS date.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was just about to say, I wonder what's going to happen to Linux.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Chrome OS, Chrome OS.  Haven't heard a lot about a Chrome OS in a while.  I'll be interested to see if I am.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Could it be the wave of OS's?  Yeah.  Sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, well it's nice.  Cause we got Android and the portable devices moving up with a tablet,  almost to a netbook.  Then we got a number, number, number, number.  Let's get the number.  Thank you, Gina, for your tip.  I'm almost, I, oh, I'm verging.  He almost did it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  He almost did it.  The number is 28, which is the market share that Android had in the first  quarter of sales, beating the iPhone with 21%.  Wow.  Android 28%.  But BlackBerry is still 36% in the first quarter, according to NPD group.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you look at the, the graph though, BlackBerry is kind of plummeting.

Speaker: Doc Searls
Transcript:  Is that worldwide or is that?  US.  US.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  US.  So your worldwide numbers are very different.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a gut check.  You know, it's like everybody in the world doesn't have an iPhone and uses Gmail.  You know what I mean?  Everyone buys BlackBerry's and uses Hotmail, but in our little geek world,  it's Android versus iPhone.  Do you, but that's pretty interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's huge.  Do you think that, um, that's because there's a saturation that the iPhone  has saturated the marketplace?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that's part of it.  Uh, certainly.  Yeah.  And I think it shows Google strategy that the more devices you get on, the  more Android will just grow.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's, I think, boy, that's the strength, isn't it?  I mean, you get, you have some really good choices of phones now.  Really remarkable.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And other devices too.  The, the, the Wepad that I was trying to see in Berlin that I didn't see has  now changed its name to the, uh, WeTab and it's now for sale on Amazon Germany.  Um, you know, we're going to see more and more and more devices.  You saw them when you were in Vegas, Leo.  I think we're just going to see more and more.  And that is, Erschmidt has said it when we were in Davos.  That's his strategy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I imagine it won't be too long before I have a webOS tablet, a Android or maybe  Chromium tablet and, uh, and an iPad side by side, and I think they'll be fairly  comparable and be very interesting to see who's the winner there.  The app store is going to be a big part of that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN

This is twit.tv over the last five years on the number of times that that term has  been used in search, where it's being used.  Um, very interesting, uh, stuff.  You can add commas to add comparison items.  So compare twit.tv to say revision three, our arch rival.  You can do, you could do a comparison between the two of us.
