Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google.  Oh, we're going to have fun today.  Kevin Marks is here.  Matt Cutts is here from Google.  And Jeff Jarvis, he's live from the Facebook F8 conference.  Well, not exactly. He's live from the lunch tent.  But we'll have the latest from F8 VR, robots,  and a little Louis C.K. thrown in just to spice things up.  It's all next on Twig.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we cover.  You know, I've been thinking about this.  I really should rename this show.  Because it isn't, as anybody listens, about just about Google.  I think it really should be this week in the cloud.  Or I was thinking maybe something...  This weekend anything that's going to be in the cloud,  I'm going to be talking about.  And I think it's going to be in the cloud.  This week in the cloud.  Or I was thinking maybe something...  This week in anything we damn well want.  That's really the truth.  There's Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism at CUNY,  the City University of New York.  He is in San Francisco right now, at the Fort Mason Center at F8, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I am.  I'm sitting on the floor by an access point  outside the main Herbst auditorium  so I can get connectivity without wind.  So people are going to walk by thinking this is pretty strange.  But I'm just sitting here doing anything for the good of Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  I think that should be our motto.  Without wind.  What is it?  Audio without wind.  Hot air but no wind.  Yeah, right.  Hey, we actually have an amazing panel.  Because we weren't sure whether we would get here or not.  So we brought in the big guns.  I hope you don't mind.  Matt Cutts is also here.  Googler himself.  One of the early Googlers.  Yay, Matt. Love Matt.  Good to see everybody.  Great to see you.  And as if that weren't enough, so is Kevin Marks.  Yay.  Another former Googler, former Appler, former BBCer, former British Telecomer.  He's former many things.  And go ahead, give him a high five there.  High five.  High five, Kevin, to your right.  High five either way.  Yes, yes.  Right.  They're all together.  The gang.  We brought the gang all together for this.  How's F8 been, Jeff?  Has it been fun?  I suspect we're going to be talking a lot about F8 today.  Oh, poor Jeff.  Poor Jeff.  You know, what's good about Jeff...  But who is that?  That was F8.  Oh, that was F8.  Okay.  What's good about Jeff is he really believes in dog food in Google products.  So he will not buy a laptop.  He insists on using a Chromebook.  And now he's using a Pixel C, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I am.  Well, this way I can do Skype.  I have my laptop in the hotel room, but it would do Hangout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is fine.  I'm not complaining.  I'm just saying.  Oh, yes, you are.  But that's okay.  You're dog fooding.  And good on you, my friend.  So what did you think of Zucks?  We did not see the keynote.  We did not broadcast the keynote today, but we watched and broadcast the keynote.  We watched and broadcast the keynote yesterday.  What did you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it was pretty amazing because he came out and said, we're going to do something  different.  We're going to talk about a 10-year plan for Facebook about connectivity and access and  connectivity, artificial intelligence, and VR, AR.  And so he took through a roadmap there.  And I think it was also very important that he made a political statement, too, saying  that you can't progress in the world by building walls.  You do it by building bridges.  And that Facebook believes in connecting people and that good comes from connecting people.  And that's what this company is about.  That kind of stunned me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was surprised that he was so political.  So now the scorecard is Tim Cook and Mark Zuckerberg both stepping up and being very  political in their keynotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  And I think in this case, in Cook's case, it was about an issue that affects the company  directly.  In Zuckerberg's, it was about a philosophy that says that we're trying to connect the  world and the world is getting more disjointed by this kind of talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How reasonable is it, though, for Facebook, which is not yet 10 years old, to talk about  its 10-year roadmap?  That's like a 15-year-old saying, when I'm 40, I'm going to be working in the NBA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.  But he does have a large strategic view where, I mean, he's not giving up India be damned.  He's not giving up on the dream of connecting the world.  They put up a map showing where the population lives versus connectivity.  This is clearly where they see huge opportunity.  AI, that's what the newsfeed does, right?  It gives us what it thinks we want based on knowing us.  And VRAR is all about going from discovery to immersion, as they said.  And so that was all very interesting.  And then they did a whole separate track of things yesterday just for media, which was  also interesting around live, around VR, around instant articles.  And they care about media and they care about content.  So I'm really glad I came. It's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the things Mark talked about is why they have kind of deconstructed the blue app.  I mean, it was, in fact, it even shows on this roadmap, the big blue app, the Facebook app,  was the heart and soul of Facebook until recently.  And then remember, they acquired WhatsApp, they acquired Instagram, they split off Messenger.  And I think it's for the first time he kind of, to me, succinctly explained,  you know, there's many reasons you might say that you did this.  One is, of course, to occupy more home screen real estate.  The other is to get notifications and more of them.  But I think he described it well when he said there's different ways people share.  They share individually, hence the messaging apps.  They share to family and friends. That would be for Facebook.  And then they share to socially when that would be Instagram.  And that kind of all makes he mentioned Facebook groups, which I don't think I think half of people use Facebook don't even know they have groups.  Yeah. But but but it showed that he's thinking a little bit about the different slices of the of the user base.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's not just user base. It's also the use cases. Right.  The lesson I think that Zuckerberg gave us in media when it comes to breaking up the big blue app was that we still try to get people to come to one destination that's going to do everything for everybody.  That is the mass media way to treat the world.  And Zuckerberg recognizes not only that you're an individual, but also that within the day you have different uses and different needs for connectivity and information and entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What let's talk. There's so much to talk about here.  Let me start with bots with messaging.  And I want to make sure that Matt and Kevin have some something to talk about, too.  But we can talk about this. Let's talk about it, Kevin.  What is Facebook is better positioned than anybody to take advantage of messaging the messaging platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Now, maybe. I mean, the thing is, yes, they've already got two big messaging apps and a billion, almost a billion users for each.  Yes. I mean, the other big ones, the other people who have lots of users, Google and Apple.  And then there's the various Asian messaging apps that already exist and already doing this.  And that's that's the template that they're all looking at.  And part of this is the app bubble is over.  The people aren't installing apps. They're not making money from apps.  And a big chunk of Facebook's revenue was from selling ads for apps.  So that they've been seeing that vanish for a while.  So they're looking for a new platform that they can use, encourage people to build stuff on.  And they can. Facebook has the ability to direct people's attention.  That's something they're good at. That's they have control over the streams.  And so they can feed people to that for a while to to make that something that people are paying attention to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this driven by people's needs or driven by businesses needs?  Is this driven by what Facebook wants or Amazon or Google or Apple?  Or is it driven by what users are looking for? Is this this is a new this is how users use it now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I think it's driven by them wanting a new a new conduit and a new place to encourage people to interact.  Part of it is that users interact with notifications.  And the notifications have taken over from the apps as the sort of primary interface to your phone.  And the messaging is the notifications that you don't turn off because you may get messages from people.  Somebody called it the last unpolluted part of our phones, which was, I think, a very good way of phrasing it.  And then now they're busy coming along to pollute it and fill it with commercial messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I have to say, it wasn't very compelling to look at one eight hundred flowers and ordering flowers in a messaging app.  That was not particularly compelling. It was not something I would want to do, particularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but imagine if you're just you talk to your phone and you just want to say send flowers to Mark Zuckerberg, which, by the way, Danny Sullivan did.  It was a brilliant, funny, interesting one.  Test it out. So we sent flowers to Mark Zuckerberg.  And then he said, oh, my wife's not happy. So we sent flowers to his wife.  I saw Danny a few minutes ago and he said that Zuck sent him and immediately said thank you for the flowers.  Oh, he knew. Yeah. Yeah.  I don't think I don't think messaging per se, I mean, you know, basically all messaging apps do right now is cut up content and feed it to you in spoonfuls.  That's no use. But if you imagine conversation as a platform and if you imagine truly agents who are going to go out and get stuff for you and come back and alert you when it really is worth an alert, then I start to get happy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I followed I followed CNN, you know, as one of I followed a couple of bots just to see.  And it isn't a really good use for news. We saw the Quartz app, which was basically the same interface.  What's interesting is that the Facebook platform does allow them to do a carousel within Messenger.  So I actually get the stories, you know, kind of scrolling horizontally, you know, which is interesting.  And then there's buttons on every one so I can read the story, get a summary, ask CNN and I presume that alerts will come through this way.  I don't know if this is better than an app from the point of view, the user.  I'll tell you one thing from the point of view, the user, I would much rather talk to a phone representative than have to interact with a company in messaging.  That's going to be painful. Do you think that there's an age difference?  Go ahead. Let's let Matt wait here. Well, I'm just curious if there's an age difference because I'm kind of with you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I'm like, this sounds like my worst nightmare to have to talk to companies on a chat system and an automated, you know, AI chat system doesn't sound all that much better.  But I'm wondering if people who are, you know, a little younger might feel more comfortable having those sorts of conversations.  Maybe I'm the cranky old man or we're the cranky old men. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it does recognize that younger people are much more comfortable interacting with their phone than a tablet or a computer.  I mean, that's really where they live. They're probably more facile than you and I are on the keyboard.  But I don't I mean, remember, young people aren't even using Facebook very much.  They're they're they're using Snapchat. And so this is not this is going to be a tough one for Facebook because while they are dominant, for instance,  I think Amazon's Echo is a much better platform for ordering flowers than a text based chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, OK, I'm going to push back on that one, I think, because the problem with Echo is that it is just voice.  It doesn't have any way of showing you an image. So you can say, I'd like to order some flowers and it'll say, OK,  order you some flowers, but you don't actually get to see what the flowers look like.  Whereas so you're kind of it's like an IVR. It's like phoning one hundred flowers.  It's like I'd like some flowers. What have you got?  You know, whereas the point about the chat thing is they can put up other UI like you were showing with your carousel.  So you can you can say there's a good post by Stephen Wolfram about this where he says,  you know, the difference between a conversation with a human and a conversation with a computer is that the computer can give you a user interface that you can then interact with.  So you can ask. And obviously he's talking about this stuff with Wolfram, Wolfram Alpha.  But does Alpha is an interactive environment like that?  Yeah, so you can you can talk to it and you can say, you know, what's the population of the US over the last 50 years and give you a graph back and stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would love to have a Wolfram Alpha chat bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And it's that's that's that's basically something that that's it's not that good at understanding speech, but his take is basically we're building command language that  we sort of would teach you how to talk to it and it'll it'll respond to you in that way.  And the same way you do with Siri at Siri or Google Now at the moment, you know, there's a set of commands in there you can give it.  And the challenge with these chat UIs is working out, you know, knowing what the command is for the bot or having something at the other end that's good enough to map through from what you typed in into the subset of things it can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I and I do have to I mean, we have to acknowledge that it's very early days.  So just as in the early days of the of the web and of apps, we're going to see a lot of failed experiments as we kind of learn what the medium needs and wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's not really a big day.  These chat bots for 30 years, you know, well, we had a license.  It's you know, if you think about the way we use them in our series in places like that.  No, but you know, I've in the webcam, I see channel has a bot in it called Loki that Aaron wrote, and it will it'll respond to you.  It'll let you set timers.  Oh, yeah. People who use IRC have had experience of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's a that's a tiny sliver of the population.  Most people have never experienced anything like this.  What about Slack?  What about Slack?  Well, in fact, it's like an interesting counter example because Slack everybody loves Slack at first.  But as you add bots and connectivity to Slack, as more and more people use it, suddenly it's as annoying as your inbox.  It's not a replacement for email.  It's as bad as it's like email without the controls.  So what's also going to be extremely important is control for end user control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, and in the same way that if you go ahead, Jeff, no, no, you go ahead.  Oh, I was just going to say in the same way that if you like something on a company on Facebook, then you're kind of like joining their mailing list.  It seems like if you follow a chat bot, you're likely to get notifications from them at all times when you don't want.  And I think that's bad.  I think what's really going to be annoying is bad AI because even you know, so I've got an Alexa and I like it.  But the idea that you have to tell it which skills you want it to know as opposed to sort of automatically figuring out here's what I want to do and going to the right service provider.  Like if Amazon hasn't figured that out yet, then most individual companies are going to write really bad bots that are really brittle.  And then you're just going to feel your blood pressure rising as you're trying to take your Internet of Things and get your blood pressure.  You won't know the exact right way to ask for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it is an opportunity, though, for some.  We talked about Sam Lesson's Finn last week.  Sam, who did the timeline on Facebook and then left and is now as a startup Finn F.I.N.  .com, which is an artificial intelligence, which I haven't been able to get in the beta.  Maybe you guys have you can use on Alexa, but you can use it in other ways.  Didn't Jeff, did you say it's like 150 bucks a month?  Yes.  So maybe that's a nonstarter.  But if you can't figure out how to make money with the chat bot, a free chat bot, I don't think you're thinking very hard.  I mean, seriously, this is a way to this is a way to coin money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Benedict Evans said today, you know, he's so smart from Andreessen Horowitz said that he thinks bots are ridiculous because they're basically a really bad way to do a Web page a piece at a time.  But he thinks the bots are good versus email.  I think that bots are nothing until they are true agents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all going to come down to good A.I., isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And that's hard and that's rare.  And there's there's going to be like at Y Combinator demo days, there were so many chat bot companies.  And, you know, it just feels like it's we're back in the 90s.  We've got chat bots and, you know, VR and OK, I was there the first time and it wasn't that great, you know, and I'm hoping it's better this time around.  But the idea that everybody's going to magically really enjoy talking it is it's very much like an interactive voice response system.  Like you're on voicemail, except you're with a company that can keep talking to you over and over.  I mean, we'll see.  We'll see.  But I'm a little skeptical.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's like, you know, we also the Knowledge Navigator video in 1987, wherever it was, which was John Scully's vision for the future of computing.  And that was that was the guy at the desk.  Knowledge Navigator.  And annoying his colleagues at the last minute.  If you actually watch that back, we built chunks of that stuff.  And but it's still it's still a bit fishy.  You know, it's like that bot is is rather smarter than any of the bots you've actually been able to build and any that exist.  And in some ways, the closest thing has been when you if you like the OK Google thing where you say that and ask a question and it will it will filter through the world and give you something back.  But it's but that's trying to do a very broad domain.  And there's obviously you can do things in narrow domain, but then effectively you're learning a command language.  You're basically learning a set of commands that interact with the thing.  And so you've got your back to command line interfaces again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's the Knowledge Navigator, the Scully era Apple Knowledge Navigator, which is an AI in a book at a bow tie.  I'm sorry about the quality, but it's from a VHS tape, I think.  And it is extraordinarily annoying.  I mean, it's just the Amazon rainforest.  Right. But it's it's like a human assisted notes from last semester.  We're way far off from this. And this was 1987.  I mean, this is 20 years ago. No, 30 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  30 years ago. But this is the point.  This is the vision of the future as given by a Pepsi exec who was having a secretary.  And that's you know, that's that's kind of what a lot of these things are.  It's like, oh, I'm used to being this like self-important guy who shouts at people and get stuff done.  And I want the computer to understand that. Yeah.  And maybe maybe we can make things that do a bit of that.  But it's missing. It's missing all the actual work that the people who are executive assistants actually do,  which is model the world for the boss and shield them from it and let things through selectively.  And that's actually a very hard thing to do artificially because it relies on emotional emotional knowledge and understanding,  which is the thing that we can't model. So I'm I'm yeah, I'm skeptical in that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the things that struck me, Jeff, about Mark's remarks is that in some ways I think he didn't understand the optics.  I've seen Google do the same thing and I seem a little tone deaf when he showed off, for instance, his his drone,  his UAV that looked like a stealth bomber and was called a killer.  It seemed it seemed like he didn't.  I did immediately. And I think the rest of the world might be a little bit afraid of Mark and their 10 year vision did sound a little bit like something out of Skynet with AIs and drones and virtual reality helmets.  I think that a normal person, of course, normal people aren't watching F8.  This is for developers and people like us.  But I wonder how normal people in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think that's a point.  You know, I said on the show a couple of years ago that Google thinks the world thinks Google is Godzilla and Google thinks it's Snuffleupagus.  And I think the same is true of Facebook that, you know, who could be against connecting people?  Who could be against bringing people more knowledge?  Who could be against this?  Well, India was, you know, others could be.  So it's it is the optimism.  It is the fundamental, essential optimism of this part of the world.  Yeah. And that conflicts with the nerves of others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So so 30 years ago, we had the the Pepsi executive in his isolated, you know, corner office with a personal assistant.  He would yell through the door at.  Today, we have the guy in the in the gray T-shirt who is in a different kind of bubble, but just in some ways, just as much of a bubble.  I don't think Mark Zuckerberg is necessarily any more in touch.  This was scary. This drone.  This was this is not what people want.  This is the eye in the sky watching.  It's just like Mark marching down the aisle at Mobile World Congress while people are, you know, obliviously wearing headsets.  I think maybe maybe it's just me.  Matt, you probably mean that Google had to deal with this to this perception and Google's in some ways back down.  I think the sale of Boston Dynamics to some degree must have to do with the fact that these are scary robot dogs and probably better not for Google to be developing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't know about the on Boston Dynamics, but have you seen the shaft robot video?  Yes, like a much cuter robot.  Isn't that interesting?  Yes, that robot would hardly kill me at all.  Yes, I thought that was interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a that's a Google.  That was what their DARPA winning robot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, I think shaft was Japanese, but there's in the rundown, there's actually a video of the shaft robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why did I think Google owned the shaft robot?  Maybe I misunderstood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think they do.  OK, yeah, I think they do.  True.  You know, but I for some reason I thought that it was maybe developed in Japan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, that doesn't mean Google can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, the keynote was in Tokyo.  That's what the that's what the connection was.  Let me find the video so we can show it.  Yeah, that's a much, much friendlier looking robot.  Nice robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nothing wrong.  Nothing wrong with nice robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Put some felt on him and he needs a nice Alacantra shell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't find it in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's under Alphabet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, there you go.  I'm looking under Google.  My mistake.  Whoops.  Alphabet owns it.  See, I got it.  This must be hard for you, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You've been there for a long time to get I usually just say Google all the time and yeah, people don't worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That much people know what you're talking about.  Here is.  Yeah.  So it's a it's a bipedal very kind of cute bipedal robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Carrying a bomb.  But never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, this is a little creepy, too.  I mean, it's not perfectly uncreepy compared to the robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do you manage the creepy line?  What do you expect Facebook and Google to do with new technologies?  The technology itself is what might disturb people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you not show it?  No, no, no.  I'll tell you how they do it in movies.  They don't try to make them bipedal.  The more you make it look like a human, the creepier it is.  So I don't I really don't understand this kind of motivation to make robots human like.  I understand that some robots, a rescue robot needs to be able to go through a door and go upstairs and stuff like that.  But this is this robot's bringing you food.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the point is that we build the world around us.  So yeah, there are staircases and things that are hard to deal with if you've got wheels.  And I suppose you could just fly in with a drone.  But yeah, that's creepy in a different way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The hotel robots not creepy, right?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it but it goes in elevators and it just is like a little post post office box, a little mailbox.  They have those in hospitals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, those are whizzing around hospitals delivering pills to people.  And they just are like mailboxes and they use elevators.  And I think there's a reason they look like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't they're not bipedal and they don't have faces and go, here are your pills.  That would not be.  I will watch you for compliance.  Yes, you must take it.  That's in humans, right?  Isn't that in humans?  I love that in humans.  They have these Android nurses and they exactly say you've not been taking your pills.  You naughty boy.  Nurse ratchet robot.  Yeah, it's kind of like a nurse ratchet.  What else?  Let's see.  Virtual reality.  The Oculus Rift, of course, you know, Facebook owns Oculus Rift, but Oculus is going to see some tough competition.  The Vive is coming out right now.  People are saying in many ways it's better.  At least has the paddles that the Oculus Rift is delayed on the move.  PlayStation VR is going to be coming out soon, too.  I feel like though what's interesting to me on this, both on messaging and on VR, is how seemingly far behind Google and Apple are on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, that's why I find that the catch up games that are going on here in various areas are interesting to me.  And then that's one.  Yeah, I think live video is Google's also behind on and is going to catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google should own that.  I mean, Google really they were they had the jump camera.  That's basically what Mark has copied a year ago.  But his has 17 cameras, not 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's one more.  It's one louder.  It's one more.  That's better, right?  It's just one better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So it is interesting to me that thinking about Google, I recently burned like four or five nights watching the premium shows that YouTube Red has.  So I think there was there was something where Google or YouTube wanted to, you know, spend some resource resources getting a good subscription product.  So you subscribe to YouTube Red and I watch Scare PewDiePie and Frank Academy and there's it's actually pretty entertaining.  I like more than I expect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My kids watching Scare PewDiePie.  I didn't expect him to.  I thought my initial reaction is, oh, this is old media trying to imagine what young kids want to watch.  It's the Fred Figglesworth model.  You know, he was a huge YouTube star.  But the minute he was on Nickelodeon making movies, it was like, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But there's actually a little bit of a story arc like they're playing.  They play a trick on PewDiePie that plays out all through the season.  It's funny.  So it kind of that kind of surprised me.  So, you know, it's always easy to say, oh, you know, YouTube should have done live video or YouTube should do this.  But I do think if they could get a base of subscription subscribers where that can support, you know, creators on YouTube, you know, that's a pretty good thing to work on.  And you'll always have people saying, oh, YouTube should have done Periscope first or Meerkat first or live video first.  And that's fair criticism.  But I do think I didn't realize how good the premium shows on YouTube were.  And that sort of makes me say, OK, well, yeah, for example, take the chat stuff, you know, probably getting the artificial intelligence machine learning down is a little harder than the chat or the app and getting that exactly right.  Right.  And so, you know, maybe maybe we haven't invested all of the resources, you know, completely optimally.  But I do feel like Google now and the artificial intelligence aspect of it are pretty well positioned if we can then find an app or a way of communicating that people really like and can sort of come together on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's various. That's very astute information.  Very guidance.  I guess we have to use the financial term the guidance from.  Well, this is all just my personal opinion looking from the outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, I know outside outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But but that makes sense because Hangouts feels like it's been kind of left to drift.  But you're exactly right.  That's an easy thing to play catch up with.  That's trivial.  But the hard thing is the AI is the and Google now is way ahead of anything anybody else is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We're in pretty good shape on AI.  But now, to be fair, like getting the network effects like it's hard to to try to come back from behind once everybody's on one platform.  That is true.  So that that is tricky.  But, you know, I think they've got good people working on all the aspects of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm sure they do.  Yeah, I feel like I feel like I want to say Apple's Apple's going to have trouble because right now they're not cross platform.  And even if they made a cross platform messages, it's really an iOS thing.  And so that's going to Facebook really just seems to have the inside track just because everybody's on Facebook.  And you know, the big thing that happened to me was a few weeks ago, I guess this is part of Marshmallow Android six.  But all of a sudden, instead of just using Google's messaging app or the Samsung SMS app or Hangouts, I could use Facebook Messenger said,  Oh, you want you want me to be your SMS app? I could do that, too.  And then others did. And so now I have many choices.  And I'm actually trying Facebook Messenger as my SMS app.  And because it's Facebook, it has a lot of features that are are superior.  So you can choose this is a Galaxy S7.  But if you go into default apps right now, I can choose from a variety of them, including signal, which is the super secret encrypted one.  And I you know, I don't know why Telegram isn't in there, but that's a big change.  And so if I use Messenger as my app, now Facebook messaging and SMS messaging is all going to the same one.  That's a huge advantage. That is.  And Google kind of did a weird thing.  When I got Project Five, they said, Oh, please don't use Hangouts.  Use the messaging app. Maybe that was carriers that might have been carriers enforcing that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Google's got three apps to do it, which is really confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So carriers want you to stick with SMS, right?  They don't want you to use data. Well, there's yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's the AOSP app.  Then there's Messenger, right, which is Google's one that's confusing when you search for Facebook Messenger.  And then there's Hangouts. Right.  And then when there's still Google Voice looking in there somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they turned off the widget. They turned off the Hangouts widget, which was another way of nudging you out of the Hangouts ecosphere at exactly the time where if I were them,  not knowing everything about what's going on inside, I would have said, let's get more people to use our platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think that's fair criticism. Yeah, things got muddled.  I would agree with that. Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple's going to Apple's going to miss out no matter what happens, because because they want this is they double down on privacy, security.  They want to keep you in the Apple ecosystem.  Those there's a strategy tax for that. And that's the strategy tax.  Facebook's in a really good position, especially since they also on WhatsApp.  So they really have global dominance.  But Google can be in there and Amazon's the dark horse, because no matter what you say, I think Echo is a messaging platform.  And it's just a matter of time before they start integrating some of these skills, which you're right, are kind of ghettoized right now.  They're kind of separate. You have to turn them on and you have to use this weird syntax to get to this skill.  But that's just I think that's it.  That's probably more just kind of a Darwinian selection process.  And eventually I would imagine Google will I mean, Amazon will kind of unify that platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's my so my theory on the Google versus Alexa thing is that they need to make one of those, but one that integrates with now with now.  But now now is the obvious thing, but also it needs to integrate with nearby screens.  So it needs to be able to put stuff on the on the on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So you could say Google box or let's say on hub on hub play Game of Thrones for me on my living room TV.  And I can do that with my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can say I watch I can say play this and I've got the chromecast and it can go with us nowhere to send it.  And the thing that the Alexa can do is know where in the room you are because it's got a microphone array.  So it can actually if you've got an open plan house like I have and there's two TVs that are available,  it can pick which one you're near to and make that work.  So that's the thing that you get by having that physical object that has six or seven microphones in it is you actually get to triangulate on people.  And so that I think that if you remember, what was it called Oblong?  Do you remember Oblong?  They were they they were they were the company that was that did the stuff for the was that movie.  So basically what Oblong did was they would let you attach gadgets to TV sets in a room and have a pointing device and say put that stuff there and put that stuff there and have control.  Do a presentation.  So they were selling this to large large companies as a in your war room.  You need a bunch of screens and we can control all the screens and you can move stuff back and forth.  And this end, you know, I've played with it and had demos of it.  It's cool tech.  But it was sort of proprietary and required.  You spend a lot of money with them.  But we're sort of walking towards having that ability in the home as we gradually have a bunch of screens and we put a little thirty five dollar widget in the back of every screen.  And Apple Apple could do this certainly because they were Apple TV as well.  But Google's have have have this ability and have to have it cheaper.  So it's easy to stick a bunch of chromecasts and things and the chromecast will do the thing of switch to that channel and show you the show if you if you plug it in correctly, which means you can do that thing of I want to order some flowers.  And it would say turn the screen on and say which one of these you want and and show you give you that that visual interface as well.  So there's there's there's a bunch of interesting bits and pieces to be worked out there.  And it does involve having lots of stuff in the house.  But I think there's I think that that's a natural next step for a lot of these things.  And it's the it's the back and forth between the the spoken stroke typed query and the richer visual response that's going to be the next iteration of this stuff.  Facebook's saying we're very serious about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They just hired away Alphabet's head Regina Dugan, head of the advanced technology and products group.  Actually, she was at Google before that.  Before that, she was a director of DARPA.  She is going to come to Facebook with a hundred million dollar plus budget to do R&D and building eight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Zuckerberg says hundreds. That's not about consumer products, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's about big advanced research. It's about the drones.  What is it? A killer? A killer?  Google.  She's we have a drone to fly over the campus.  So this isn't consumer facing.  This is like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm asking is that she's not going to be making phones, is she?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yes, a tap was doing Project ARA.  I doubt very much she's going to be doing modular phones for Facebook or an Atlas.  But she certainly knows about a lot more than that.  DARPA was about very big ideas, right?  Yeah.  And I suspect AI.  According to Bloomberg Technology, she's going to direct efforts to build hardware that uses Facebook software  and complements technologies from Oculus VR and the company's artificial intelligence research unit.  So AI, VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like the guy at Hooli who got promoted up.  No, it's not. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you know Regina, Matt? Do you know her?  I don't know her personally, but I think Regina is super smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  And the article says she's going to be building things that are mission aligned.  And certainly stuff like Tango, things like Johnny Lee had worked on where he had worked on the Kinect before that.  So there's some really neat stuff that happens at ATAP.  They've got radar where you can do go like this to scroll stuff.  So I think if she's working on interesting hardware that aligns with things that Facebook wants to do,  I think that'll be really interesting.  It's always sad when somebody leaves Google.  The idea that somebody would put hundreds of millions of dollars, hundreds of people and hundreds of millions of dollars into this effort over time.  I can see the appeal of that to her.  So we'll see what happens over time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Such a huge advantage to have as Facebook and Apple and Google do this just massive, unbelievably massive bankroll to do this kind of blue sky R&D.  It's pretty exciting.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's good to have all these ideas coming out and people trying out a bunch of new things,  whether they be satellites or drones or airplanes or closer to the home kind of tech.  But it's nice that people aren't just resting on their laurels.  I do worry a little bit about whether some of the chat bot stuff is like just a step back and everybody's going to wait in a year from now.  They'll be like, well, that was a fad.  What were we thinking?  Right.  We'll see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you have to do that, though.  I mean, I think it's still possible that could be the case for VR, for instance,  despite all the money and publicity it's been getting.  And I have a lot of fun playing with my Oculus Rift, but I don't know if the fun translates into something more lasting or if it's just, you know, like a steering wheel for your driving game.  I mean, it makes it more realistic.  I don't know.  It's hard to tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I actually worked on a here with social VR where you play with somebody else and then you give each other images to step into and you create each other's avatars.  And you can have an interaction with each other's avatars.  And they even had they showed off today an Oculus Rift virtual selfie stick where you're in the same environment together and the two avatars come together and take a picture of themselves.  And then they put it in a little box and it went right on to Facebook.  It's fun stuff to think about.  VR is social.  But you're right.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're in a virtual Westminster Bridge or something.  That was the bit that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there it is.  But what's weird is, well, not weird, but what's disappointing is that you're not going to be able to do this for some time because they're way delayed on these paddles.  September at the earliest.  So all of these things are cool, but it's not anything anybody can do except in the Facebook labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Part of the problem for me, at least, is I actually worked on virtual reality stuff back in grad school in the late 90s.  And, you know, like 70 percent of all virtual reality demos are like, OK, we're going to put two people in a space and they're going to look at a computer part.  And we're like, oh, we need to change that computer parts.  Tiny little parametric thing here.  Oh, now everything's ready to go.  Send it off to the 3D printer.  And if you look more closely, like every single one of these demos is like, why couldn't they have done this in person or over a video conference?  And the idea that they're actually going to change the design of some CAD part together in a virtual space.  I'm just allergic to that demo.  And that demo happens a lot with this sort of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that bizarre Microsoft one where they put his daughter in the room with him, except she couldn't see him.  And when they did put the guy, you could see him.  And then all you could see was each other's goggles.  He couldn't actually make eye contact.  It's like, ah, you're missing the point in a painful way here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's good for gaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, entertainment. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have an app for this, which was next to our conversation before the show, which is the thing that actually makes sense for this is theater.  My son puts his play on in London.  I'd like to Facebook or Google camera in the front row and watch it from there rather than have someone filming on their phone from the front row and not seeing all the action.  Because you're either too far back and you can't see what's going on or you're too far forward.  And then they've got a panel over the place to try and follow the action.  Whereas, you know, to actually film a stage properly takes six cameras and a director and then a bunch of editing afterwards.  Whereas if you could just stick one of those things in one of the seats, that would actually be a useful way of getting the experience.  So I think that that's the thing that makes sense.  And it also makes sense in that you can't edit in VR.  As soon as you can't, you've got to wait five, ten seconds for somebody to work out what happened and where they are.  You can't do montage. You can't cut through stuff.  So you either have to direct it like Birdman or you have to sit the camera in one place and have it act around you.  And that's where the theater stuff makes sense.  And in some ways, it makes more sense for this kind of small room experimental in the Round Theater than it does for the proscenium arch style theater.  So I think that there's a set of interesting things that will happen there.  But it's going to be hard for people who used to directing video because all the grammar used to video doesn't work.  So I tried out the Jungle Book demo for the VR.  Did you see that one? No. So this is an Oculus.  Is that what you say? No, it was one of the other ones.  I think it was the Samsung VR thing. OK, I have that.  I could try that. But they said you go into the room and you're in the room where Louie is and then Blue comes in.  The problem is I could hear Louie speaking, but I didn't know where he was.  I thought this little monkey in front of me was him.  And then I turned around and this very large monkey behind was the one that was actually talking to me.  And it's like the audio wasn't good enough to give me a cue of which direction I was supposed to be looking.  So I missed like a big chunk of the action here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What, Matt, you said you did this kind of research in college.  What how does what we're seeing today?  It seems to me that with the exception of the headsets are smaller and lighter and don't have a big cord coming off the back to a silicon graphics workstation,  that what we're seeing isn't so far different from the stuff I remember trying at SIGGRAPH in the early 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I don't want to be I don't know. I don't want to be the skeptic.  It is true. You get more polygons, you get better rendering, you have better resolution.  But, you know, we had a ceiling that would light up and you'd use a Coleman filter and it would do twenty thousand productions per second.  So at very low latency, what is new is you have better inertial sensors, better accelerometers, you know, cell phones have driven the price of those way down.  So you can do this stuff self-contained.  But unless you really dedicate your hardware in very specific ways, the latency is bad.  Then people get sick. You can't register in the augmented reality.  And I really don't think most people have actually solved this problem yet, which is, you know, maybe some of these, you know, dedicated hardware as well.  But if you just slap a phone in front of your face or if you just use phone hardware without specifically trying to make sure the latency is good,  it's going to be fun for ten minutes, but people aren't going to work in it.  They're not going to actually collaborate or do too much social stuff.  So I'm a little skeptical that people have really done the hard work.  The stuff, the technology has gotten better, but you need special purpose hardware to really do this stuff well.  This is one of those shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We got VR, we got augmented reality, but we can't get a goddamn Skype connection to work to save our lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'm on the goddamn floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. I think we got a ways to go to be honest with you.  But your lighting looks good.  Technology.  We just work on the basics for a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I just read a picture of my perspective here at F8 doing the show.  That's you know what? Are you comfortable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I see you got a little lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm sitting on some F8 t-shirts trying to cushion my bony ass.  I feel so bad.  Right across from me is the snack line and the water cooler.  Oh, go get something to eat.  I don't want to run away from my from my machine and somebody's going to steal it.  Oh, no one would steal it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I hate no one would steal that pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, are you kidding me?  You're more likely to get it thrown out.  Somebody left some old junk on the floor there.  No, I love my pixel.  See, I'm just teasing.  Here's the picture.  Here's Jeff's Jeff's POV.  Leo seems to be falling asleep in that picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so somebody says hi here.  Leo, come on in.  Come on in.  Come on in.  Put us up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, it's Colleen.  Hi, Colleen.  Oh, my God.  Colleen.  Colleen works for Facebook now, of course, our genius engineer who put twit on the map.  How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just getting ready to have the end of the live stream.  So then I can go home and then have hopefully a vacation for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this is what you've been doing at Facebook is streaming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you'll notice that.  So like, did you see the demo that was like the green screen stuff where my friend Joyce was playing with other people in VR or I'm also in the 360 camera shoes.  So I've been working on VR and spherical and stuff like that.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come up here and visit us.  You can show me how to use this Oculus Rift thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We still miss you at Google, Colleen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, man.  You stole her from us and then Facebook stole her from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love you, Matt.  Nice to be in demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I didn't realize you knew Matt, too.  That's great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, we had a good time at Google.  The crossroads of the world.  Well, your lighting is really good, Jeff.  You look dramatic.  It's the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm right next to the garbage can.  And the acid.  Was it tantalus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah, tantalus could never get down to the water or up to the fruit.  And you're just right there.  He's being tantalized.  It's more of a Kevin Marks kind of reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can just work some epigony in there.  You got it, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  If we could just reify something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to Jeff Jeff suggested that we buy this.  And for the next broadcast, you can you can use this.  This is one of the cameras that they demonstrated yesterday on the stage at F8 for live video.  So we played a lot with Facebook Live last week.  And it definitely had a big role at the has had a big role at F8.  Right, Jeff?  Yes, it really has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's huge.  And this is the front.  They announced the Facebook Live API.  So what I what I believe that means is that you'll be able to take your output Leo and stick it into Facebook.  I've so without having to use the tablet or be a mess.  It also enables you to pull other things so that you can put comments straight in.  So there's one of the API users CNN was demonstrating that they can have a stream of comments and then you can pull a comment out and just put it on the screen.  So finally, the chat room can feel like they're legitimate.  And then this vivo camera is the other thing that was first built with the Facebook API, the live video API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting because it gets a 4K picture into the camera, which you can then control with an iPhone and you can pick your shot or you can use face recognition for it to follow you.  Because what you're going to get is a 1080 piece.  You're going to get one quarter of the screen somewhere and it's streaming out live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's three camera shot with one camera and an iPhone.  So if you go to the video there, Leo, you can see how it shows that you just pointed somebody's face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The cooking demo is a good one. Yeah, it's the only one as far as I can tell.  That's why I'm a little suspicious. But as soon as they put another video up, I'll be thrilled.  Yeah. So so taste made, which is, I guess, a cooking podcast, used this.  And so the camera's tiny.  And but the problem is you still need a director and the director instead of using a tricaster is using an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was thinking, Leo, what if what if you started today and that were you used to have to switch yourself?  What if you all you do is you point at one person's face and it'll zoom in on that person like right here.  Right. And that makes that shot.  Then you can move that box down and show their hand. No, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll have to see how smoothly the transitions go and all of that.  But that's a very intriguing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, this fits in what I was saying about the problem of capturing live theater is it's that same thing.  I want I want a single thing to point at the stage, but I can edit it afterwards.  And, you know, you can do that with a little 360 cam.  But the problem is this is not up to it yet.  You can do it with the big 360 hands. But this is so this looks like an interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Facebook's is thirty thousand dollars.  The Oso from Nokia is sixty thousand dollars.  I imagine if you built a jump Google jump camera be comparably exposed.  Sixteen cameras is going to be very, very expensive.  This is just a single high res camera and a very wide angle.  It's one hundred fifty degree angle lens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I saw the guys from the company and I said, oh, that's it.  And they said, I said, can I get where can I get it?  So you can order now and one hundred dollars off. Yeah, we did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You did, too. Yeah. All right.  Yeah. Did you see the labs camera camera kit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Tell us about that.  So that's the labs is a is there like sort of research thingy they have in San Francisco.  And I went to their open day a couple of weeks ago.  And one of the things they've built is the like the field, the field reporters and 360 video,  which is basically two GoPros and a good microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And why does that look professional?  It looks professional. OK, don't 3D print it in red.  Maybe maybe that would make it a little bit better.  Oh, my God. That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's with the watermelons on it. You won't be worried. Right.  It's an intermediate step between the there's a little camera you can buy that's three hundred bucks.  But that is that is lower res, whereas this is full for as GoPros that are Genlocked.  So it can give you a. Oh, they're Genlocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's OK. That's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a decent mic. And so they've they've put this.  Zoom is a great mic. Yeah.  Yeah. What could we what would be a sensible thing to do this with that's still like reasonably affordable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this is 360 as well. It is. Yeah. It's immersive as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they basically they put together they're using it, but they also put together right here's how you can make your own and put this together for other reporters.  YouTube's YouTube's going to have four or three or four live streams from Coachella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I imagine at least one of them will be three hundred sixty degrees because YouTube, of course, supports it.  Facebook supports it. I in almost even more than VR, I think three hundred sixty degrees is is going to be useful because of that immersion thing that you can be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think one eighty one eighty is going to one of the surprises. I've not seen more one eighty degree camera.  One eighty is plenty, to be honest, because I shot a whole bunch of stuff at you know, I just I just put my my data up in the air.  Right. You know, stuff you didn't care was behind me. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the same thing with theater, I guess, unless you put it in the middle of the action.  But if you put it at the front of the stage, you really don't care what the audience is doing behind you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. No, exactly. So you don't necessarily need to have the back for this camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this camera has one hundred fifty. So it's not quite all the way around, but it's pretty close.  Not all the way around. I mean, all the way in front.  But it's close enough that, you know, that would probably be adequate for us, for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be interesting to play with.  But the other part of this is the difference between the reason they have 16 or 17 cameras is that that actually gets you good stereoscopy.  So there's a difference. If you've just got two lenses pointing opposite directions, you just get a sphere.  Right. Whereas if you've got lots of them like that, you can actually move your head and you get that sense of being there that you get with the with the Oculus,  with the when that when it's actually giving you separate views and understanding where your head is.  And that's one of the that there's there's there's two things of 3D perception.  Dana Boyd wrote some interesting research on this.  But there's the parallax between the viewpoint.  But there's also you you look at look at the object and adjust how you're looking.  And that decides is that in front of it or is it behind it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The children of the coroner behind you.  No, I'm just I'm sorry.  I'm just there's there's a storm going on back there.  I don't know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I need to go put a towel at my microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think is that lightning I'm seeing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Oh, we're not in Kansas anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just spiral upward.  Speaking of ill wins, what's this deal with BuzzFeed having to cut its its revenue expectations in half?  Jeff and then and then the CEOs denying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jonah was on the stage yesterday and then I heard that the PR people were saying that no, no, no, no, no, this was overblown.  The numbers were right.  And it wasn't so much that they lost money, it's that the expectations are very high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They thought they were going to make half a billion.  They're only going to make a quarter of a billion in revenue, not profit revenue, which is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know. I think the product they sell.  My argument is a BuzzFeed sells a service to advertisers.  We can make our stuff viral, make your stuff viral.  And that's not easy. That's not cheap to do.  Is this the end of native advertising?  No, I can only hope.  I don't know.  Jonah was on stage yesterday with Chris Cox and he had a nice chat about how wonderful Facebook is and how wonderful BuzzFeed is.  And nobody asked anything about that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If that's new, I can go to M.me slash my Facebook handle and that's my Facebook.  That's my messenger feed.  I wonder if that's new. All the bots are there, too.  So M.me slash CNN, for instance, is how you would add the CNN bot to your messenger feed.  One way anyway, you can also search for it.  That's, by the way, one problem. It's kind of hard to find.  So I went to M.me slash CNN and this is and then it pops up.  It's hard to find some of these bots.  I don't know if they're going to have a bot store.  Third parties are doing that.  But that's that's kind of unknown.  The store is critical, isn't it?  Because that's what if you're going to be the app for the platform, then you're going to need to have somewhere to go to get the apps.  All right. Let's take a break.  We're going to come back with more.  We have the greatest panel ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bots don't need you don't need to install an app because it's a web server effectively.  Yeah, it's a different UI to a web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but but you need to follow them, which is the version which is the equivalent of installing them.  You have to say hello. Hello, bot.  I mean, yeah, there's nothing to install. It's a lot easier.  Right. But you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. But that's the point of that is that you've now got a URL that lets you open a chat window, which Twitter has to Twitter has a thing that lets you open a DM.  There's a URL link to do that.  It'll spawn it in the browser, spawn it on your right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just using a URL scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's just using an HTTP scheme, but then it redirects depending on what's installed.  Right. And they both made that work, which is a sensible thing to do because making things linkable is a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and I might put in my email signature, right?  Yeah, if I want to fill my inbox with spam, I think I will.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it makes me makes the thing that's only to companies.  It's like click here to chat to somebody and you're chatting inside the environment you're comfortable with.  Right. Right.  Chat with us.  Yes.  Because it's like when you're washing machine breaks, what you really want to do is chat with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the reason I liken it more to an install is because as soon as you communicate with a chat bot, it's there.  It doesn't go away.  It's not like going to a web page and you don't have to go back to that web page.  No, you've invited into your home like a vampire.  Yeah.  And now, hey, my God, it's old home week.  There's Alex Lindsay in the in the headset.  Alex, are you working or are you visiting?  No comment.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just just wandering around, you know, having fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Having fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, just thought I'd say hi.  Nice to see you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These are all people who used to work with me.  My studio now have better jobs.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's why our Skype doesn't work so well.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just fair warning that the last talk just ended at Herbst.  I could get kicked out of here, which is a go find some place under a tree with it next to an access point.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, let me do the ad and then we can just end the damn show.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Keep going.  I'm just warning you.  That's all people are walking out.  I'm sitting on the frigging floor for you.  I'm next to a garbage can.  I don't want to cross to get my water and my chips.  I made a tenured professor sit on the floor for me and you won't believe what happened next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I can just pick an orange.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, shut up.  Shut the front door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's, by the way, how my friends are.  Shut up.  Shut the front door.  That's, by the way, how my father in 1971 convinced the tenth, the ninth grade Leo that it would be OK to move from Rhode Island to this place called California.  He said, literally, you'll be able to go out to your back porch and pick an orange right off the tree.  It was like the Jode family that we loaded up the pickup, put grandma on the rocker in the back and we drove out to California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, let's get you paid.  That's the pain thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Let's get you paid, Leo.  So you can stay in California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, man, with the tax rate in here, I got to do some ads.  Holy cow.  Lisa says, you know, as soon as you're done, we're moving to Nevada because there's no income tax there.  So I want to live in Nevada.  I want to live in California.  Well, it's going to cost you 13 percent of your income every single year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you'll have no income then.  You won't need the tax.  Right.  That's what you tell her.  And by the way, you can't really good.  What's good?  I'm not pink.  I'm not pink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This lighting is good.  No, the camera is fantastic.  The audio is not so hot, but the camera is fantastic.  Oh, it's not.  It's fine.  Don't you care money so you can buy me a better.  I'm amazed that you can do what you're doing with the Pixel C.  Have you put the new have you put nut roll on it yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, not on this one.  No, because I don't want it to be dicey for my important shows with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because we've had some people have said it's crashing their Pixel C.  Mine's working great with it.  By the way, Matt, right?  Nut roll.  That's what you're going to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  What was the blog post?  I'm not nut telling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nut telling.  It's not going to be Nutella, though.  It's kind of maybe it is.  I'm nut telling.  That's kind of sounds like.  Yeah, it kind of sounds like Nutella.  How tell me about the cafeteria, Google.  Is there a lot of Nutella there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It's strange.  They used to have a lot of marshmallows.  Yeah, that's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How would you mention it?  A lot of Nougat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Nougat.  It's all over the place.  River.  Yeah, you can just kind of swim in the Nougat River.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, there's a town in France.  When I was a kid, we went to town in France that's famous for their Nougat.  And you could get Nougat.  You could get Nougat at the gas station.  You could get Nougat ever.  You couldn't get away from Nougat.  I don't know if it's I don't know if it's still like that, but it's good.  Now I want some Nougat.  Instead, I'm going to give you all the magazines you can eat.  Now, wait a minute.  I know that doesn't sound very delicious, but it is.  If you think about how we've been binge watching television shows on Netflix,  wouldn't it be nice to binge read magazines?  Some of the best journalism is still being done in magazines, weekly and  monthly magazines.  But here's the problem.  You know, most there's many.  I could think of a dozen magazines that there's a lot of magazines that  there's always at least one article every issue I want to read.  New Yorker, Rolling Stone, Wired, Vanity Fair.  There's always at least one article.  But am I going to go out and buy that magazine?  Five bucks for that magazine just to read that one article, let alone  subscribe and then my coffee table is buried and I feel bad about the trees.  See, texture is the solution.  Texture lets you subscribe to all those magazines and many, many more.  The best magazines in the world and they come delivered to your phone or your  tablet automatically.  You can read them offline.  You're going to find magazines that you, you know, like Billboard.  You're not going to go buy a Billboard, but you know what?  There's great stuff in there if you're interested in the music industry.  The Billboard charts alone and every page that is in that magazine is on your  tablet.  And it's not just this month's edition or this week's edition.  It's back issues too.  Plus bonus features you can't put in print like videos, car and driver, you  know, great videos, National Geographic.  Just for the pictures.  I think the images look better on my iPad than they look in print because  you're getting all the resolution.  Consumer Reports.  If you like science, Popular Science is awesome.  PC Magazine, Mac World Magazine, PC World, Popular Photography, and all for one  flat rate.  And by the way, finding articles is easy because their editorial team lets you  deep dive into interviews and stories that they, you know, you show your  interest.  They say, oh, you got to read this.  I could star my favorite magazines and that adds them to my personal library,  downloads them automatically.  You can even share your subscription with your family.  I'll be honest.  It's not my subscription.  It's Lisa's subscription.  We may read different magazines, but we get to share the subscription, which is  really fantastic.  You're going to love it.  I want you to try it free right now.  Texture.  Texture.  Texture.  You know what's great is, yo, I read all the high brow magazines.  I got my New Yorker, my National Geographic.  Every once in a while, a little Entertainment Weekly or People magazine.  That's not going to hurt, is it, Jeff?  That's good for you.  Jeff created Entertainment Weekly, I should mention.  I'm not going to bring up all the laws and actually good news.  The California, crazy California assembly bill to ban the sale of smartphones in  California that had strong encryption has flopped.  It has been.  Yeah, it did not make it out of committee.  Yep.  And thanks probably to the EFF, which has done such great work.  EFF.org slash action.  And get your member of Congress or your state representative in there and send  them emails because we still have this Burr-Feinstein thing hanging over our  heads.  And there's a new one.  I wasn't going to go into this, but what the heck, the Email Privacy Act.  That's good news.  Actually, this is good.  So you got to see, this is why you got to stay in touch with Congress because  they can do good things too.  This is, people didn't realize that your email was not protected in the same  way your snail mail is protected, right?  What's the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  So basically the Electronic Communications Privacy Act dates back to 1986 before  anybody had cloud mail.  Back then they assumed your mail would be sort of local on your hard drive.  And so after 180 days, you know, if you had a cloud provider, they didn't need a  warrant.  So somebody could come to Gmail or Outlook and just do a subpoena and not have to  get a warrant.  It was considered abandoned.  Yeah, which is crazy.  So, you know, now this thing, the Email Privacy Act, which eliminates that  loophole has made it out of the House Judiciary Committee, which is fantastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  news.  28-nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, you know, now we got to tell people in the Senate to vote for it and tell  people in the House to vote for it.  But for the first time, you might actually have your cloud email protected just  like you would if you were doing it locally, you know, and sort of bringing it  in line with what everybody in society would expect to get as far as privacy  protections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it probably was a loophole, but it's about time we stitched that  loophole up because that's terror.  That's ridiculous.  So this is HR.  Let me get the bill numbers.  So, you know, again, EFF is a great place to go.  Is it going to be HR?  Maybe they haven't assigned a number to it yet.  It just came out of committee.  Yeah, HR 699.  You could just say the Email Privacy Act.  That'll do it.  Email Privacy Act.  And again, EFF does a great job at eff.org slash action.  You can find out who your member of Congress is, and they have good advice for  how to contact them.  It turns out snail mail or phone is better than email.  I want to talk about the Textilizer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Did you see that they now have colorful USB cables?  For the Textilizer?  So for USB-C, you know, you can always get colorful regular USB cables.  But if you look in the rundown under other monoprice now has, so I've got a  Chromebook Pixel and I've got a Nexus 5X.  And so all of my USB-C cables look, you know, the same and get lost.  And now they've got red, white, blue, and black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have been ordering, and by the way, Benson long approved.  That's so great.  I have been ordering gold rated USB-C cables for exactly the same reason.  I don't want to confuse it with my mic.  Because even if you don't look real closely, they even look like micro USB a  little bit, so it's easy to accidentally use the wrong one.  So very nice.  And Benson has won the battle because Amazon has stopped selling the bad  USB-C cables.  There's a potential problem with the old USB.  We're living in the future.  Yeah, baby.  They're missing a resistor which could fry your MacBook or your Pixel C by  charging a phone with an inappropriate cable from those devices.  Not only has Amazon stopped selling them, but there's now software, right, that  could run on the Mac or other devices and detect this before it's a problem on  your Pixel, Chromebook Pixel, before it's a problem, right?  So this is we're finally I don't know anybody's system got there.  It is software picks fix is coming for USB-C cables.  That's Dieter bone writing in the verge.  And that's actually from the US.  I think that's coming from the USB Alliance.  So good thing.  And Benson really gets a lot of credit.  I think.  Do you know Benson the young?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I follow him on internal Google Plus.  I haven't gotten to meet him in real life.  But I anytime I'm going to buy a cable, I check.  Yeah, it's been approved.  Oh, gotta be Benson improved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's awesome.  He just took it on himself.  He's a Google engineer who just said, you know what?  This is a terrible thing.  These cables, you could fry your computer with it.  So he has he just tested on his Chromebook Pixel with various software and he he  reports back in the reviews and always read the Amazon reviews.  I hate to say this, Jeff, but Louis C.K.  I know says Horace and Pete has sunk him into millions of dollars in debt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So people go out and buy it.  It's not much money.  Thirty one bucks.  It's an experience like theater.  It's amazing.  It's it's I adventuresome.  It's creative.  I really enjoyed it.  I watched every show, bought every show.  And we want this kind of creativity and independence.  So go watch Horace and Pete, please.  It's weird.  It's strange.  It's different.  It's strange.  That's my definition.  So I don't want to hear people like Leo complaining.  It's too odd.  Just go buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bought I bought the first episode.  Some finished it.  You dropped off.  Yeah.  Well, so OK.  So there's you could describe a number of things to the failure of this or at least  so far the failure of this one that Louis himself decided not to promote it in any way.  Yeah.  And two, that it was a little odd.  He had a great cast and it was very much like a play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think now what he should do is go to a place like Netflix and sell them.  He can get his money out of it.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, he could.  Yeah.  He's Louis CK.  Yeah.  He's in fact, he says, you know, so this is on Howard Stern, right?  He says after four episodes, the whole idea was I'm not going to have to spend my own  money after that.  Well, not quite.  And he says, I believe by the these millions of dollars in debt now, but I believe that  by the end of a few, like at the end of summer, the whole show will have paid itself off.  And then he'll consider selling it, which he's resisted so far because he wants to  create a good for him, create a new avenue for making this not going through HBO or Netflix,  but doing it himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And, you know, there's episodes are different than those, but it's really creative.  It's really different.  Fabulous cast.  Yeah.  Oh, unbelievable cast.  Paul Simon did the theme song for him.  You know, it's really quite something.  Although the New York Times said how Horace and Pete made the network suits look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But there was another New York Times piece that was really good.  Look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there was another New York Times piece that just went on elegiacly about how magnificent  Horace and Pete was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you know, different strokes.  Yeah.  They're there.  This piece is basically saying that the network suits rightly rejected Horace and Pete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if that's the case.  To give it such great stuff.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right.  Plenty of stuff.  Something they could have rejected.  There's some there's it's really there's some great by the way, the actors in it are fantastic.  And it's really fun to see Alan Alda chew the scenery in a way that I probably was never  allowed to.  As a nasty son of a bitch.  He swears up a blue streak.  And I have a feeling that because, you know, he's Alan Alda, he was never allowed to be  that Alan, that guy.  And he's just loving it.  I have heard from many people who really enjoyed it, by the way, and thank you for recommending  it.  Yeah.  Support this kind of creativity.  That's really the truth.  You know, and I you know what?  I'm going to go buy.  So you can now buy the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if you can buy it.  It's the other thing.  You should have made it easy just to buy.  I would have bought up front.  He would have least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you had to go episode by episode.  Can I play a little bit?  This is this is I don't do we may have to blooper this.  I don't know.  Let me let me rewind.  There's no laugh track.  Real to say about her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're incapable of a real debate.  You know, the problem you liberals should think you're the good guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You think that gives you a pass to do random criminal acts.  You know, I saved an owl and I can go kill a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That seems like you must know that's not it's kind of an interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The way you guys define yourselves and each other liberal conservative.  Look, how would you define a liberal like to you?  What is a liberal?  Just PC animal rights.  Don't try it.  You can't try to push in the liberal agenda.  They hate Christians and they hate white men.  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because they don't think it through and they think they're better than everyone else and that they should tell everyone else how to think that just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, how would you define a conservative?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Just Jesus everything.  And they hate gay people and racist, but pretending they're not and they're selfish and they only care about money and they think everyone has to do their conservative Christian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See the fact that you start out by seeing each other like that.  I mean, how could you possibly ever respect each other or agree on anything?  Yeah, well, they do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like this.  And I think that this is you're never going to see that on network television, the profanity side, because it's that's very controversial.  And yet you can tell that's Louis C.  Did he write all of them?  Oh, yeah.  You can tell that's him honestly talking about some stuff that's really important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is an autopsy of of of of a completely dysfunctional messed up family and what happens generation to generation.  Louis C.K. as a character is, you know, he's not a great guy.  He's just a schmuck.  He's just a guy.  And that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a show about a guy with a great supporting cast.  Here's Steve Bushimi and Alan Alda and Louis C.K. in the background.  So either this is this is Alan Alda.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is it, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's great. He's the bartender in this.  He's pouring a movie.  Four fifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I thought I heard you charge that guy three dollars for about.  Don't worry about what I charge him.  Just don't get why I have to pay more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to pay more.  You can also get out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, different people, different prices.  That's not a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're going to pay for this beer or you're going to wear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen, you mumbling little you say one more time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What what did I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  Just let me get it.  I got it.  Keep going.  Sorry.  You all right?  What's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was charged for fifty for but was that guy charged three dollars?  I'm just not sure why the discrepancy.  He's been coming here a long time.  So is that a privilege for just that one guy or is it more people that get to pay?  Pay for fifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He'd some people pay three.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you decide that?  Is there like a list or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If he looks like him, he pays three dollars.  If he looks like you, he pays four fifty.  So just out and out discrimination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you aware how totally unfair and not OK that is?  I'm not sure what group I'm Jewish.  Gay.  Here's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're getting more for your money than he is.  How so?  Because well, see, you come here and you make fun of the place because it's an old Brooklyn Dive bar.  So you and your friends get to enjoy that part of it.  And then also you get to have a beer.  But he just gets the beer.  But he just gets the beer.  See, you're here ironically, but he's really here because he just lives on the corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's like a douche tax.  Yeah, kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, I love them.  And that is greatest.  That's his that's Louis CK.  You can hear it.  That's his humor.  That's you know, he tells it like it is.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The chat room says you can get all 10 episodes for thirty one dollars.  I'm buying them all just to support season.  Yeah, because it's not that it's frankly not that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it still spend the money so that you support.  I want to support it.  Exactly.  It's the same thing.  It's why people support us.  It's not that good.  But I want to.  I'd like to make sure Leo can keep doing that.  Right.  You are.  Right.  You are.  Web RTC is coming to what Apple?  That would be nice.  Yeah.  Apple, which, of course, is a great company.  Apple, which, of course, famously said FaceTime is open and it's an open platform and someday  we'll tell you how it works.  Never opened it up.  But they have now said that they are going to place Web RTC into development for WebKit,  the engine that powers the Safari browser.  That is that is fabulous news.  Web RTC.  I don't I think of it as a Google technology.  It's not right.  It's open.  It's an open technology.  Google kind of has been promoting it.  And of course, Hangouts uses it Web RTC.  Right.  I believe Kevin's our expert on codecs.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hangouts has switched using it.  I mean, Hangouts was used to installable thing you had to put in for a while, but it will  use it Web RTC when it can.  And I think it still makes you install something on Safari.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it won't have to going forward.  That's the that's that's the point.  Web RTC is not a codec, however, doesn't specify the codec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, but then you've got to get overlapping codecs for it to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Google uses VP8, I think, right, because it's unencumbered.  But they also support MP4.  And MP4, which is encumbered because you have to go to the MPEG group to license it.  It's probably what Apple will do.  H.264 or something like that.  OK, so we.  Good news, Kevin.  He's thinking I feel like we're in a Louis C.K. story.  Seems like good news.  Seems like good news.  OK, that's all I want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's this kind of continual cycling around Web standards stuff where, you know,  one of the browsers will introduce something and then we want them all to do it so that we can all support that stuff and use it.  And so there's there was a transition recently, which is that now Chrome and Firefox and Microsoft's new browser are all on a six week update cycle effectively,  whereas Apple is on an update cycle when they release new products.  And so there was a point where Safari was the place to have all the new stuff.  And now it lags a bit.  Oh, I know when they're releasing new products, the recent US first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There is this purple Safari purple now, which they are getting letting anybody use.  I just installed it, which is their technology preview.  So maybe Apple's becoming a little cognizant of the fact that they are not keeping up with the Joneses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they were actually developing access to that.  And before you would get access, but you would get it through newer versions of the US effectively.  Right. So you wouldn't get if you sign up for a program and you get the seeds for the next version of iOS, the next version of Mac OS, then there would be updates far in that as well.  Right. But yeah, there's there's but there's a bunch of other web things that people are sort of waiting for Apple to add support for as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought WebKit was kind of an open source project.  Apple controls it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So WebKit is an open source project and it was the basis for Chrome.  But then Chrome forked and became Blink.  And so there's there's then our separate code base.  And there was always some separation in the code base of the rendering and stuff.  So now that basically pretty much Apple is using WebKit and I'm not sure if anyone else is building browsers based on that.  Whereas others are building based on Chromium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, WebKit is definitely used in some Linux situations.  I know. I'm not sure.  Not Chromium, but some some Linux browsers are using it.  Right. And I see I see I see the libraries.  GTK has a WebKit library.  So I know they're still used somewhere.  Here is definite good news.  No doubt about it.  Internet hyperlinks do not infringe copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so advisory opinion.  Oh, but that in Europe.  But that's this tells the court that now, you know, that wouldn't be such a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Were they actually considering such a nutty idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, because, well, you know, listen, it's already there to an extent.  If you link to a copyright violations in some places, there is an argument that you're violating copyright yourself, which obviously is absurd because then everything you look.  Yes, there was legal discussion of this going on in some places in Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yes, in the Netherlands, a website provided a link to an Australian site showing pictures of a Dutch celebrity taken by Playboy magazine.  The Australian site did not have Playboy's consent to do so.  And so I guess it was Playboy saying, hey, we want to go after the Dutch site because you linked to the Australian site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Same being made that if you link well, but the same arguments being made as you link Pirate Bay, Pirate Bay, Pirate Bay doesn't have any pirated content on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just has torrent links, which are just pieces of information that say here's how to get something right now.  You could make a stronger case, I guess, against that.  Well, could you versus web links?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I guess it's not that different because then because then the precedent you said is that you are responsible for the content of everything you link to.  That's absurd on its face.  Yes, there was discussion around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it was and it was triggered by Pirate Bay and the the law says they've already had around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you if you think about it, though, if you're linking to a torrent of a pirated content, there really is no other.  That's it. Right.  I mean, you're basically I understand you're not a pirate, but you're but you're facilitating it.  Whereas a web link.  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I guess the same place that has, you know, some cracked version of Horace and Pete could also have a Linux distribution.  So it's not clear why you know why you're looking somewhere up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not all torrent links are bad.  In fact, I've downloaded many a Linux distribution over BitTorrent for in the early days of Twitter.  We used BitTorrent to distribute.  Oh, yeah.  It was actually it was cool because you know what I like about it is the first people who download it have seen it.  So they kind of want to you kind of get them to agree.  OK, yeah, I'll see it because the more seeds you have, the more effective it is.  And so that was really neat. It was it really felt like it was kind of crowds crowd distributing it.  I liked it. I would have kept doing it.  But but not enough people really had the capability and nobody really understood what was going on.  So we ended up doing just links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're always a head. Leo, you're always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would love to distribute by.  We were thinking about BitTorrent saying can all sorts of things.  We had long conversations with Bram and the BitTorrent folks about different ways to do it.  And certainly a portion of our audience is sophisticated enough and would love to have that significant portion, but not all of them.  And I want everybody. Are they throwing you out, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know I'm outside. Yeah, they threw me out of that.  But I'm now outside in the food tent, which is now being torn up.  But I'm still here. Well, we could wrap it up.  You've done a yeoman job.  The tent may come down on my head, but by God, I'm still here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You and your bony butt are not going anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh-uh. This week in bony butts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good news. The next big thing in Silicon Valley, according to The Washington Post.  Poets. The net. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What? Finally employment for poets for the first time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Full employment for what are these poets doing?  They're writing scripts for bots.  Ah, bot scripts. Yay.  So you're going to have a poetic bot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Or we're going to have a poet bubble.  It could go either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think Siri could use.  I think Siri could use some.  Well, let me let me just you know that Siri is a big fan of the Game of Thrones, right?  Do you know that?  Is Jon Snow dead?  Oh, you can't hear. I got to turn it up.  She's very quiet.  I have to unlock her. She actually has an opinion on the subject.  Turn this way up. Turn off the sound. Let's try it again.  Hey, Siri. Is Jon Snow dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know what they say to death. Not today.  But why would tomorrow be any better? Anyway, I'm not exactly sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But is Jon Snow dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or is it what's dead may never die? No, wait.  Death is so terribly final. I give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think they hired a poet.  Is Jon Snow dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know what they say to death. Not today.  But why would tomorrow be any better? Anyway, Siri winter is coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's good. That's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's it, right? That's poet. That's the full employment for Poets Act of 1923.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's how they could get scale. Get poet scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I once went to the Red Loaf Writers Conference in a rare moment when I was trying to be classy in life.  And if you were if you wrote fiction or nonfiction, people would presume you did that for a living.  But if you were a poet without fail, people would say, oh, and what do you do for a job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of true. It is. I don't want to say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there is a bot that has poetry.  This is if you go to confetti.coole, this is a bot that the known guys put together that you connect to your Slack channel and it sends you news posts in poet poem form.  I'm not quite sure why they built this, but it's kind of cute.  I think the point of it was to demonstrate that they've got a bot kit that you can use to send news to Slack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Confetti.coole cool cool cool cool cool.  I'm probably spelling confetti wrong. No, I'm not.  I'm part of a very serious news service. Oh, it's a Slack bot.  A lot of the best bots are written for Slack.  I hope some of these will get migrated over to Facebook.  Facebook. Have you looked, Kevin, at how hard it is to write a Facebook bot? Is it difficult?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't look that hard. It basically looks similar to the Slack bot thing, which is like here's the prompt and here's your response.  They have an authoring tool too.  They've got an authoring tool where you can give it a set of conversations and it will try and extract it for you or something.  I haven't played with that sort of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just saw it this morning for the first time.  This is a bot engine based on wit.ai. Is that what it is?  Yes. Yeah.  Telegram has that too. I have a bot on Telegram and I didn't have to do a Licka code.  So that makes it very easy to do stuff that...  So really the advantage of it is its push.  So a thousand people follow my bot on Telegram. I don't know why, but you get a push.  When a new show comes out, you get a push. When I arrive at the studio.  You arrived. Yeah.  So I guess that's the point is its push, right?  So easy a poet could do it.  So easy a poet could do it.  So build bots easy. You tell us what your user said. We tell you what your bot should do next.  Oh, this is pretty easy. There's no coding here.  Right.  I'm going to have to try it. This is wit.ai and Facebook acquired them.  Oh, I'm definitely making a Leo bot.  Oh, this looks good.  All right.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can attach this to the direct messaging thing.  That link and then people talk to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, the Telegram bot gets its content from Twitter.  So I have a Twitter bot and it gets its content from other from if this than that and Zapier.  And then it tells the Telegram bot what to do.  And there's a little latency, but it's not too bad.  I have it set up so that in my automatic, which is that OBD two thing, when I pull up in the vicinity of the studio, the automatic tweets, no, the automatic goes if this than that, if this than that tweets.  And then the and then the Twitter gets pulled into the Telegram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But it's turtle bots all the way down.  It's turtle bots all the way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That cuts. So great to see you.  What are you up to these days? What's your are you still on your 30 day challenge?  Was it a food challenge?  Food challenge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Always.  So I had such fun.  April.  March was so much fun.  March was I'm trying to exercise not just once a day, but twice a day.  Wow.  I decided to double it up and repeat it.  So I'm doing the same 30 day challenge back to back because winter I didn't get out as much as I wanted.  And I'm like, oh, I got to do some cleanup.  You know, so it's been going really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought, oh, I see.  You scared me. I thought you were going to do four times a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no.  Just continue. Continue forward in time.  It's exponentially doubling.  Yeah.  Next eight times a day.  The next time I'm on the show, I'll just have a treadmill and I'll just be doing a show on the treadmill nonstop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been trying to make this resolution that I will not watch TV unless I'm on the treadmill.  Oh, come on.  No, that's a good one.  I think that's really good.  Should I do that for 30 days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Both you obnoxious people are going to use that new thing that Google is going to put in your calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't.  We didn't mention that.  I find that incredibly annoying.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Just like you bragging about TV.  You're going to watch a treadmill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, come on.  So what Google's new calendar bot does is looks for free time.  You tell it what your goals are.  Actually, do I have it or not?  I never forget it to do again.  No, that's different.  That's the reminders thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The blog post has some good GIFs of people adding stuff to the calendar.  So it's sort of you can see you want to work out.  You want to work out three times a week for an hour in the evening.  And then it shows on which is in the rundown.  The GIFs show how it will fit those into slots in your calendar so that you work on important stuff, not just urgent stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nice.  So you tell it kind of what your goals are in life, how often you want to work out.  And then it looks.  This is what I don't like.  It looks for free time in your calendar and it sticks it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's super cool.  Are you guys kidding?  This is awesome.  I knew you'd love this.  I knew you'd love this.  I knew it.  How much time?  I mean, I sorry.  I spend like three hours a day surfing the web.  If I spend an hour on a treadmill while I'm surfing the web, that's a good outcome.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, just when I want my phone to nag me.  What happens when you don't do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It reschedules it.  Oh, God.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's painful.  Good.com.  It's painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you can defer, edit or complete your goals and then we'll choose even better times in the future.  It's 2 a.m.  Why aren't you running?  Run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I know why Matt's doing the double exercise because he's actually last month's exercise.  It moved over to his calendar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's right.  Got to do a catch up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, this is their 10th anniversary widget.  They turned 10 on April 12th.  Happy birthday, Google Calendar.  And I live on Google Calendar.  I have never found anything better.  It's just fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know what?  I finally switched over to inbox because I couldn't use it at first because, of course, of my usual rant about apps accounts.  And then I was kind of scared to use it on the show.  I got really frightened by it and I ran away.  I love it now.  Oh, good.  I waited too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's great.  Inbox is awesome.  Yeah.  It's really nice.  Jeff, did you have a number you'd like to share with us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I have to go to my phone here so I can see it because of my Pixel.  My Pixel C. God knows what will happen.  Oh, shush, both of you.  Shush.  So there's a calculation, take it for what it's worth, that says that crappy ad tech costs iOS users alone $8 billion a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, just pulling up pop ups and weird ads and just junk you don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All this.  Why ad blocking?  Why the need for an app?  Why the need for instant articles?  Here you go.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They say a user who uses an ad block in the US on iOS can save $7.19 a month in excess bandwidth fees.  Matt, I didn't get to ask you for a tip.  I see you have a few in here besides the Google Workout.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Do you want something that's happy or sad?  Happy, please.  All right.  So if you go on a mobile phone and you do a search for something like Europe Destinations,  it will show you all kinds of cool places you can go.  This came out like a few weeks ago, but I don't think we covered or I didn't hear it covered on Twitter.  And you can basically select somewhere like Rome and it will show you places to go and typical tourist attractions and stuff like that.  So it works well with broad queries like Europe Destinations or Canada Destinations, that sort of stuff.  But it kind of shows you like suggested itineraries, 72 hours in Rome, day one, day two, day three.  It looks at what a lot of people recommend, Colosseum, Pantheon, and it's really kind of nice.  So if you just you want to take a trip, you don't know exactly where, this shows you the kinds of places you can go  and the sorts of things that a lot of other people do and even can show you what trips would cost and all that sort of stuff.  So it's a lot of fun to explore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We had also mentioned on the radio show, Johnny Jed, our travel expert, that Google now allows you to find better deals on flights  by choosing one way flights over round trip flights.  And that's built into that's, I suspect, the ITA technology, as would this be the ITA, something Google acquired a couple of years ago.  And yeah, it turns out that especially if it's a you have a stop,  that it's often cheaper to get it one way and then buy the return than it is to buy the round trip.  I always thought round trips are cheaper. Yeah.  Interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Nice stuff. Thank you, Google.  Kevin Marks got something for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a couple of IndieWeb things. There's IndieWebCat Nuremberg this weekend.  So that's are you going to have a big rally there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, now.  Oh, dear. They're going to parade. They're going to parade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We put people on trial.  The triumph of the link.  I'm sorry.  So that's this weekend.  And then there's another IndieWebCat coming up.  Who writes your material, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know, but it's I got to talk to Louis CK. I think I might be able to get a job as a poet.  I think it's a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then there's one in Dusseldorf in May.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, actually, Nuremberg is a wonderful sound.  And if you're in Nuremberg or going to Nuremberg, get one of the Nuremberg sausages.  And then if if you really want to annoy people in Nuremberg, what do you say, Jeff?  You say the sausages are so much better in Wurtzburg and it'll make them crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're little tiny sausages. They're Trump sized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're actually quite good. Trump size.  For people with baby hands.  And then what's this WebMention Rocks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So WebMention is the standard we're working on for when a site notifies another site that it's done something like commented on it or replied or RSVP to something and so on.  So WebMention Rocks is a site that Aaron Peretti put up as the WebMention spec is going through the W3C for you to check that you support WebMention properly.  So there's a series of pages. So if you link to one of those, test one, test two, click one of those.  The idea is you link to one of those and then WebMention it and it shows your WebMention there.  So you can check to see if it supports all these various ways of discovering it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I'm sure known does perfectly in all eight tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does now.  Which is why we had the test. That's why you have the tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's awesome. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if you click through, you will see all the responses that people have done to it and which things they've.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool. It becomes a blog post of its own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, because it's what WebMentions do. They let you send stuff from one site to another.  There's beer.  This is all us testing it out in different browsers and things.  And different Indie websites and known and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. I shall. I shall be testing tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the thing is, if you're we're at the state with WebMention now,  there's a really good way to start implementing it because it's about to go through the WPC standards process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't have to do anything to get WebMention and known turned on.  No, no, no, just does it. It just does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you want it in WordPress, you've got to download and install a plugin.  That's the problem. Yeah. Yeah.  And we're working on trying to get that as a default plugin.  We're working on trying to get installed by default in other sites as well.  So we should see more of a return of the track back.  But with better presentation, I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I hope you're ready for any spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, track back really became a problem, didn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Well, yeah, we've got some ideas on that.  But yes, we were always ready to listen to your thoughts on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The difference is, of course, that we now are prepared for it.  I think when blogging was first starting, we didn't have these problems.  Ah, the innocence.  We were innocent. Now we are not so innocent. We know.  Oh, schmucks.  Jeff, thank you for sitting your bony ass down there at the beautiful Fort whatever it is.  Mason?  Mason, thank you. I love Fort Mason.  Oh, this is where it is.  Oh, he looks like he's in pain.  You'll find Jeff at BuzzMachine.com.  He also is the author of many great books, including Geeks Bearing Gifts, his latest Gutenberg, The Geek, Public Parts, and What Would Google Do?  And if you're lucky enough to be going to CUNY, you should go over there to the CUNY School of Journalism and just sit at the foot of the master.  Your students are lucky, lucky people. Thank you, Jeff, for being here.  Next week, are you going to be here or you're not? You're in Germany next week, right?  I'm in Germany, but I'm going to hope to, so just be safe for...

We love having you on. You're just welcome any time you want.  Thanks for having me.  One of the nicest guys in technology. It's just really great to see you.  And of course, Kevin Marks, who is the king of the Indie Web.  He's bringing the web back to the way it used to be.  I'm not going to say the king, but one of the citizens of the Indie Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Citizen. He's a citizen king.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no. You are the mayor of the Indie Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's the ruler. He's the first among equals in the Indie Web.  No, this is so tricky.  No, and thank goodness, because I think the open web is such a beautiful and elegant and wonderful and important thing.  We want to keep it alive.  For all the wonderful things Facebook brings us, it's not the open web.  The open web rocks.  I'm sure we all agree on that. Thanks, Kevin. It's great to see you.  Good to see you.
