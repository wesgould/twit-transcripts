The show that covers Google, the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, all that jazz.  Jeff Jarvis is here from CUNY. Actually he's from his home. I don't like jazz. You don't like jazz?  You look like somebody would go to the West Village, the Village Mayfair. None of that jazz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, not in jazz. Don't tell me you're in dubstep. I don't know what it is. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My notional Jeff Jarvis is intact, sort of. When I ran EW, I tried to ban jazz. What? Haughty.  Just to be trouble too. Well anyway, welcome Jeff. He's the author of What Would Google Do?  Public Parts, his latest geeks bearing gifts. Which I have in the other room. I should bring it so I  can hold it up. Because of course Jeff doesn't have a copy he can hold up.  I wouldn't have. I would have to go a long way. Good to have you Jeff. Also with us Mike Elgin,  our news director. And Mike and I this morning got up. Well you didn't get up. You actually,  I guess you did. I got up at the usual time. The usual time, which is like three in the morning or

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  some ungodly hour. And I like jazz. And in fact, I have a quick recommendation. That doesn't surprise  me. Quick recommendation, there's a movie called Whiplash. Is that good? It's very good. Of course,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oscar nominated and I think he won an Oscar. Somebody won an Oscar for it. It's very good and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it'll give you an appreciation for jazz. They emphasize the sadistic qualities of sort of  band leading and instruction and so on. But it's a great movie and there's a lot of great jazz in it.  It's a high school jazz band, right? I think it's college level. It's like a New York academy of  some kind. And yeah, it's a great movie. And of course, J.K. Simmons is the star of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We love him from his insurance company ads. Yes. It's a little disconcerting to see a guy who  I remember for insurance company ads on the Oscar stage. But you can do everything these days. It's  no longer a stigma to do an ad. So I think easily the big story today is this thing that  the Wall Street Journal has been reporting. The FTC, and we reported this at the time  a couple of years ago, investigated Google and ended up deciding not to prosecute them.  But now the details from the FTC investigation have been leaking out on the Wall Street Journal.  I guess the Journal got it. Did they get it in a FOIA request? They made a FOIA request. The FTC

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  accidentally sent them the 160 page report, then said, oops, can we have it back? And the Journal

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  said no. Too late. Freedom of Information Act. So the staff report apparently was a little bit more

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  negative about Google. There are two reports. There's a staff report and there's an economist  report. Staff report is lawyers, economist report worries about impact on the economy and on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  consumers. They're different. You can read it on the Journal, but I think Danny Sullivan has been  doing a marvelous job at Marketingland.com. We actually tried to get him on the show. He's not  available. Parsing the report. And apparently the Journal is only publishing every other page. Is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that right? It's some weird thing where he has every other page. And then he says the footnotes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  are tying stuff together. Back to other pages. So there's lots of juice in it. There is and there  isn't. Well, okay, this is why I thought it would be a good conversation for this show. Because the  impression that you get from the Wall Street Journal article is the FTC should have prosecuted  and that went easy on Google and that there's plenty of smoking guns. Is that not your sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, from the Wall Street Journal, absolutely. And the Wall Street Journal, I mean, let's keep  in mind here. I said at the end of the piece that I wrote about this, I wish Google would F up more  so I could criticize them more. I don't want to be in a position of defending them too often.  And I'm not going to defend them fully on this. But let's keep in mind, for context, that Rupert  Murdoch has had an absolute attack going on against Google. He had Robert Thompson, the head  of News Corp, write a screed against Google. After this report came out, they then went and got the  visitor logs for the White House saying, look how often Googlers go and visit the White House.  230 private meetings. Yeah, well, I'd be surprised at that. They're an important company. I'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're not the only company that had many meetings in the White House. They might have brought t-shirts,  you know, I don't know. So the report, and this is the one by the lawyers,  yes, labeled them a monopoly and recommended litigation. Is that right?  Yes, some. Yes. Yes. Shortly after the report came out, the FTC decided to close the investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But no, they said, well, they did change some changes in behavior. Yeah. But they didn't go on  for investigation and note that it was unanimous across party lines. The journal is trying to  hint that there was a political game here. That's why all the meetings at the White House.  Hey, but the Washington Post wrote a very good and balanced explanation of what goes on and how  in these investigations there are these two reports. They come together. This is normal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. So there is a contingent often that advocates stronger action than the FTC ends up taking.  That doesn't mean the FTC decided to release. Lawyers like to sue you.  Yeah. So Danny Sullivan says, it turns out a vocal contingent inside the FTC wanted stronger  action. The report written by the FTC's Bureau of Competition is one of several sets of findings  and recommendations. The commissioners then take it all into account. And as you say, the post says  somebody is always going to be left out. Not everyone will be handled. They ultimately voted  against bringing legal action, although they did say that Google was able to mitigate some of the  issues. The report concluded that Google had abused its market position. Google's conduct has  resulted and will result in real harm to consumers and to innovation in the online search and  advertising markets. The evidence paints a complex portrait of a company working toward an overall  goal of maintaining its market share by providing the best user experience. That's not illegal.  While simultaneously engaging in tactics that resulted in harm to many vertical competitors  and likely helped to entrench Google's monopoly power over search and search advertising.  And this is the thing I've always said was a red flag with Google was that they are in all of these  businesses, Google Local, YouTube, Google Shopping, the Google Flight thing, the booking stuff,  where they would have a temptation to put their results ahead of competition's results,  even if technically in the search it shouldn't be, if PageRank wouldn't rate them that highly.  And that's essentially the fundamental complaint here, right? That they found evidence that Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  had done that. Well, I'm sorry. Go ahead, Mike. You go first. So it's not that clear, especially  if you look at Danny Sullivan's posts on this, exactly what it is that they found. They found  a lot of tweaking. And from what I can gather, first of all, this is from 2007. And at the time,  apparently, Google was vexed by the fact that product searches for product and service oriented  results were very poor. The user experience was poor. So if you forget about the content,  the experience was very poor. And they were testing these different types of results against  groups of people and seeing whether they said, OK, I like this result. I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll call these testers the searchers. That's what Danny's term Danny uses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. Sounds like a creepy movie. But these are like focus groups.  Exactly. Focus groups. Exactly. And so Google has something called a diversity algorithm. So  for example, if somebody searches for Leo Laporte, they're going to get all this praise  for Leo Laporte. But Google will go find some criticism of Leo Laporte and throw it in there.  Because that makes searchers happy. Well, because it gives balance.  Gives you a choice. Yeah, exactly. And so-  That's not inappropriate, I think. And so they were tweaking that. So my guess would be that,  yes, they did things that made some of their competitors rank worse. And they probably did  things that made some of their competitors rank better than they would have. They're trying to  tweak and fudge these numbers so that it looks balanced and gives users a result that makes them  think, OK, this is the result that I was looking for. That's where the debate lies. Were they doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this to improve search results or were they doing this to defeat the competition? And now in one  part that I read in the Wall Street Journal, it said that Google would go to searchers, searchers  would be unhappy with the result, and they would still go with it. Stick with it anyway.  And so that gives light to the idea that they're trying to make better search results.  That implies, just reading that by itself, that Google is acting anti-competitively.  This is what the journal said in a sidebar, how Google skewed search results. Google would  automatically boost its own sites for certain specialized searches that otherwise would favor  rivals. This is from the FTC report. If a comparison shopping site was supposed to rank highly,  Google's shopping was placed above it. When Yelp was deemed relevant to a user's search query,  Google Local would pop up on top of the results page, the staff wrote. Now, Danny points out this  is common practice. I don't know if this lets Google off the hook, but this is common practice  among search engines. In fact, he's written many articles that talk about this. He's not in favor  of this, but he says this is how search engines work. The thing that's really important, though,  in antitrust action and monopoly action is a company that's not a monopoly can get away,  can legally do things that a company that is a monopoly cannot. So Microsoft bundles Internet  Explorer as a browser. Because of Microsoft's dominant position in operating systems,  the Department of Justice went after them, even though if, you know, Leo's operating system  bundled a browser, that'd be fine. Or actually, OS X bundled a browser, that'd be fine. And it's  because of the dominant position. Antitrust law is all about not using your dominant position  to enter other markets. And it sounds like that's exactly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, but here's, and I had this argument with somebody at The Guardian on Twitter,  who's to say that Google is what it started to be as a search engine? I would define Google as a  personal services company. And I would say that it's not entering other markets, it's expanding  its service as one would. You know, McDonald's adds breakfast, it's a restaurant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would also argue that this is something that always pops up when you talk about the  Facebook algorithm, when they were caught doing experiments on users. People were talking about  that for a while. We don't talk about it anymore. But this is an example. You can be sure that  Google's search group is changing everything every single day. They are tweaking and changing.  They admit it.  And they told, in a follow-up to Danny...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They need to admit it's part of their job.  It's what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They told Danny that they were trying to solve a specific problem that existed  seven years ago.  Which was?  Which was that the results for when you're looking for things like  restaurant reviews and things like that, the results were crap. And they were trying to make  the results be something that was more appealing to end users. My guess is that the results  changed, other companies changed, and they kept tweaking it and changing it. Whether they  tweaked it in a way that was anti-competitive in a new way or not, we have no idea. We have no data  on that at all. But my guess is that this is a moving target. They basically got a snapshot  of some tests that Google were doing at some point. And that didn't sound right. It didn't  feel right. It seemed anti-competitive. Especially if you assume, which I don't know that they did  assume, that the search results are a set it and forget it thing, where you write the algorithm  and you walk away. And then it's supposed to be fair and blind and all that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's never going to be the case. Danny quotes his 2008 article that he wrote on how this works  exactly. This is seven years ago, right about this time frame. He's quoting Marissa Meyer.  He says Marissa Meyer said, the first result in Google might get clicked on more than a third of  the time out of all clicks. In other words, that first result is the result that really counts.  In fact, Google's search quality team makes it a goal to try to make that first result as relevant  as possible. Universal search, well, he goes on to say in contrast, the one box insertions,  those are those boxes on the side, right? Get clicked on less despite getting prime  placement on the page since they aren't as relevant. Or maybe the one box is the one that's  in the search results above the first click. Anyway, Universal Search, this is his articles  about this technique, aims to fix this through something called blending. With Universal Search,  Google will hit a range of its vertical search engines, then decide if the relevancy of a result  from book search, for instance, is higher than a match from web page search.  Overall, now Danny writes today, what the FTC staff seem to find so damning about Google actually  reads like a standard practice to those who know how search engines operate and why they operate  the way they do. But then he says not this part. And this, I think it's not clear, but I think this  is from his story in 2008. While Google- Or is it from the-  I can't, you know what Danny? The staff said so.  Okay, this is the Wall Street Journal. You mean it's the journal.  Yeah, this is the journal story. While Google promoted its own results, it sometimes,  and this is the key, demoted rivals the FTC staff found. For example, Google compiled a list of  comparison shopping sites that compete with Google shopping and demoted them from the top 10  web results staff wrote. According to the report, and here's what we were talking about with  searchers, Google users and tests didn't like those changes. Only after Google tweaked its  search algorithm at least four times and changed the ranking criteria did the new results get  slightly positive feedback. Slightly positive. That's when Google went with it and said,  all right, we were able to move the needle a little anyway.  It's always worried me about Google and we've always said on this show there's no smoking gun.  But keep going. But keep going.  That's alarming, Danny writes. Google has consistently- This is his modern article.  This consistently said over the years in various ways, at various times, it doesn't blacklist  particular websites for competitive reasons. Yes, sites might get manually penalized or hit  with algorithmic penalties for violating Google's spam guidelines. Matt Cutts does this all the time.  In fact, that was a big improvement in search results when Matt Cutts stopped  linking search results from the search results. And that was a big problem. Remember, you'd get  linked farms and stuff. But no, Danny writes, Google has said it does not try to wipe out Yelp  or Bing or Expedia just because they compete with it in search areas. The Wall Street Journal's  article about the FTC staff report suggests evidence this is not the case, that Google indeed  actively decided it would demote competing sites and did so even though its searchers didn't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And there's three postscripts here. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we talked with the Wall Street Journal reporter, first postscript,  Rolf Winkler, about the demotion section. A scan of the actual footnote covering this on  the Wall Street Journal site, but I haven't been able to locate it yet. Sounds like Google may  have been doing a test that didn't go out to all searchers at the time, one approving this diversity  that we were talking about of search results. One of the big problems at the time, writes Danny,  is that it was common to do searches that led back to pages of search results at other sites,  which is, as we all agree, a pretty bad user experience. Google even issued a guidance against  it. The guideline remains, although Google pretty much seems to ignore it. So what he's saying is,  this example, you do a search for buying a product. You click the top result, which actually leads you  back to another shopping site, which gives you more of its search results. This is an experience  Google says isn't a good experience, and they demoted them for that reason, not because they're  competing. Am I reading that correctly? Yeah. And keep going. Okay. Postscript.  Postscript 2. I feel like we're in court. I found, Danny writes, where the Wall Street Journal has  posted some of the original report it obtained. The section about demoting competing sites is  covered in footnote 154. The context to what 154 is covering isn't provided. This is a case where  we don't have the page, but we have the footnote from the page. And by the way, only Danny Sullivan,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  bless his heart, would go through and find footnote 154. I was watching him at five or six this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  morning live. Actually, it was six his time. I was at 3 a.m. this morning California time,  watching him live tweet this process. It was amazing of going back and forth. And that's why  I really wanted to get him on, but he's probably sleeping. Although Google originally sought to,  this is the footnote, although Google originally sought to demote all comparison shopping websites,  after Google Raiders provided negative feedback to such a widespread demotion,  Google implemented the current iteration of its so-called diversity algorithm. Google claimed the  goal of this algorithm was to increase the diversity of Google's search results for product-related  queries. So far, I don't have a problem with that kind of activity. Zero problem. Right. We don't  want to search for a product and then get a page that's full of searches for a product. But there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  were companies that, there was a couple companies have sued Google saying, you've ruined our business.  We are a legitimate index. And Google says, no, you are an awful comparison site and just spammy.  And this is where I have long, long, long argued that Google is at its most vulnerable because it  does indeed hold the power of God over these companies. And what I have suggested, nobody  pays attention to me, but what the hell is that Google should have some kind of outside jury of  commercial peers, because it's in the interest of decent companies not to have that crap in search.  And somebody though has to judge, is this a legitimate company or is this just a crappy  comparison site that's just trying to get search juice? And it's not sometimes an easy call. And  that's where Google is at some vulnerability and this shows the vulnerability. Yeah. And it's why

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've said again and again, Google just shouldn't get in the side businesses. No, no, that's where  I'm, no, I'm sorry. I think you're wrong. But there's always going to be, Caesar's wife must be above  suspicion. There's always going to be the suspicion if Google's in a competing business

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that it's going to favor its search results. Is it a competing business to force, to give me,  as I'm using regularly now, flight results directly on Google versus making me go through  for Cockta Expedia, which is a pain in the butt. Well, in that case, Google provides a better  service to me through its direct flight recommendations for which it bought a company,  for which it's having a competitive impact on the others. I don't have a problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because it's a search result. The search is a vertical search, a flight search. And in fact,  when you click the link, you are then sent to the airline. So all it's doing is giving,  it's a, that's a form of search. I don't know. Here's where I think, let's use a cleaner example.  Yeah, I know. But, but, but that's a search, that's a search function. Let's give you a  cleaner example. I search for a video. I search for Twit, a Twit video. I search for This Week in  Google and I get two results. Number one result is our show on YouTube. Number two result is our  show on our webpage. Let's say. I don't actually know if that happens. The problem is if that does  happen, there's this inevitable suspicion that Google's doing that to promote its own service

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  over my site. In fact, in fact, your site comes up first, the Wikipedia entry comes up second,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and YouTube comes up third. No, but you search for a show. Like, I don't know what happens.  This Week in Google. This Week in Google, two, three, four. And yet, putting another fly in  the ointment, we have personalized search. We come up first. Huge, nice listing. Yeah. YouTube is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the third result. And this is one of the problems with this criticism or this fear that Google's  going to favor. It's actually very difficult to do searches and find clearly skewed results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Search on This Week in Google, the words. But all I'm saying is that's why. But I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  important. It shows the quality of search. Look, search on This Week in Google. And that's why I've  given them a pass because in these obvious examples, they've been very... Wow, what a nice, big, long  result for Twitter. Yeah. But Jeff, these are the obvious examples. And by the way, YouTube is the  number two result, which it probably shouldn't be. But nevertheless, you're right. And that's why I've  always given them a pass. Okay, as far as I can tell, they've not been doing that. But now we have  a smoking gun. And that they are doing it for diversity or whatever. The point is they would  be above suspicion if they weren't in YouTube, if they didn't own YouTube, if they weren't in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  these businesses. I know. It's a private... And who's to say... And so you freeze dry a company  at one point and say, this is what it is. Google, I think in the long run is not primarily a search  company. Google, as I just said a few minutes ago, is a personal services company. I value Gmail  as much as I value search. I understand. It's an ad company. So, but this is why there's some

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  difficulty here. And the easiest way to cut this problem would be just not set yourself up in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  competing businesses. But then, no, but then you have froze... You've freeze dried the company and  you put a fence around what it's allowed to do because it's in one business. And you've defined  it by that beginning business. Okay, but that's what antitrust law does. What antitrust law says

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is you cannot use your dominance in one sector to then give you an advantage in other sectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they've done that in this case. Let's go to the next case of the FCC. Or  unless you want to continue on... No, no, no. I think... Google has a response.  Enough said. Enough said. No, no. Well, I want to go to the rest of the  FTC thing. But there's a Google response in Danny's piece right there. Postscript 3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Google sent me some background information now, which I'll summarize as follows. It didn't  provide a statement I can actually quote, just info offered to explain the situation from its  point of view. Google said, and this is Danny writing, in 2007, aggregator comparison sites  were dominating results for product searches. We remember those bad old days. And these sites  were often of low quality. I used to use PriceWatch a lot. In fact, starting in 2000, I used PriceWatch  all the time. Now, if I search for an Asus motherboard on Google and it sends me to a  PriceWatch search page, that may actually be what I'm looking for, but maybe not. And I don't think  it's wrong for Google to say, well, that's probably not a good result. You want to find that Asus.  Basically, you want us to do what PriceWatch is doing and give you a list of places you could buy  that Asus motherboard by price. But you can also see how the FTC might say, well, that's just you  getting in their business. By the way, is PriceWatch even around anymore? You'd hate to be in that  business if Google's doing it. Even in cases of good quality, Google, again with Danny,  Google still felt it was a search issue when people would click from its search results  to ultimately land on another list of search results. That would be the PriceWatch example.  Google says it was a desire to improve these user experience issues that motivated the  experimentation, not an effort to push its own shopping results. The goal, Google says,  was to come up with the right mix of shopping aggregators as well as actual merchant sites.  Eventually, Google says it found a mix its raiders liked. The FTC says liked a little,  but okay. One that retained the best aggregators as well as providing for overall result diversity.  That's what was kept. It stressed this type of diversity is something it aims for in other  instances. Let's say you search for Birdman where people may want theaters and show times,  a trailer, info on actors as well as news. That's what Google does do very well. It does give you a  diverse mix of results. Google says the shopping algorithm change was limited to English language  searches only for those within the US. Those outside the US such as in the EU or those  searching in languages other than English from anywhere didn't get it. I don't know why that  would be. Google said that the FTC addressed the experiment with its closing statement to say  it was part of the changes that could quote reasonably be viewed as improving the overall  quality of Google search results because the first search page now presented the user with  greater diversity of websites. Well, you can see where the argument is. You can see both sides  have a point of view. You can see that the FTC commissioners having weighed those decided to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  trust Google's statement. The Wall Street Journal's report I think made it seem as if they'd found the  smoking gun and said, aha, Google did bad. Let's go to something where I think there is a less clear  case here, which I wrote about, which is that Google is accused of scraping TripAdvisor and  Yelp and such. They scrape things. I have no problem with that. I went through this kind of  piece by piece of where's my line. Scraping is not a problem. It's the same as reading,  holding on to it so that you can analyze it for search behind your wall. Not a problem. In my  view, some argued that was a copyright violation to hold on to a copy. I don't have a problem with  that. I see that's what a search engine does. Let's face it. Exactly. So I have no problem with that.  Quoting from a site in the process of linking to it. Well, this is the essence of the get ready  folks. And Spain link tax fight. But I've already made my view on that clear. I have zero problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's fair use. And I agree with you. It's an extract to give you an idea of what you're going  to get. It does not replace the content. Snippets are okay. It is alleged that Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that Google wholesale copied and republished content from the places like Yelp.  That would be in my view, a clear violation of copyright. The second part then of this was  that it is alleged in the journal that when competitors asked Google to stop taking their  content and I'm quoting, it threatened to remove them from the search engine. This is the problem.  Google wields a mighty stick would be a terrible action. But I don't see that that's been proven  conclusively in what was said here. And the reason is because what we know is Yelp's ever  never disappeared from search. In fact, that's how I get to it. Most days when I search on a restaurant  on the way home, it's the Yelp link that I quote click on because it has a better phone link on it.  And I use it all the time. So I don't know that that actually ever happened. If Google threatened  it, that would be wrong. That would be evil. That would be un-Googly. I don't know whether there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  pure guilt there. So that's one case. I agree with you. That would be a very strong smoking gun.  You'd have to find an email to Yelp. In fact, Yelp should step forward. This is an opportunity to say,  yeah, I got the email right here where Google says we're going to pull you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see it. Now let's also remember this is A, this was seven years ago.  And B, if it happened, it's a wrong action. There should be something about that. I'm no problem.  But is that cause to launch a gigantic investigation to break up the company?  I think one stupid sin does not that make. We remember the whole case about Google supposedly  scraping people's data as they drove by. And there were calls to break them up right then.  If they did that, that would be wrong. And that would be evil. They shouldn't have done that.  There should be consequences. But what are those consequences? The next thing is this question of  Google favoring its own services. And I dig into that too. And here I'm still going to say,  and I understand your point, Leo, that they're in other businesses and that puts them in a position  of conflict of interest. And that's why I've always said they can't own content purely.  But let's remember a couple things. Show me the law that says that search must be impartial.  Let's remember a couple things. Number one, that's the last thing we want because that's  noisy search. I want search to be highly partial, partial toward quality, relevance, authority,  timeliness and other fact. Impartiality is also impossible. Literally. It is impossible. We know  that in journalism. We know that in search. So it's a ridiculous made up standard. No such standard  exists. Let's start there. Then let's also remember that the idea of ads in search originally came  from Bill Gross's go to dot com, which became overture, which was bought by Yahoo and Google  eventually had to pay. I believe the number was three hundred sixty five million dollars  in a patent settlement with overture and Yahoo because they took the idea of putting ads in  search. Now, when you go to did it, the advertiser paid for placement. They paid for preferential  treatment in search. And that was the way it was. Google is the one who set their standard,  who said, no, that'll be bad search. So Google set its own bar. There's no law anywhere that  says you couldn't have prejudicial search. If you want to, you can. It's a product. You can make  prejudicial newspapers. You can make prejudicial TV shows. You can make prejudicial search. There's  no law anywhere that says the search should be impartial in that sense. Now, the same time,  the FTC does indeed take companies to action, not for violating the law, but for violating the  company's own promise to consumers. So the question here is, did Google ever promise to consumers  that search results would be so-called impartial? I can't find that. Google did promise that ads  should be relevant and labeled. Both of those things are true. So I don't see, you know, if it's  true that Google purposefully and with competitive intent downgraded competitors to push its own  services, I would say that would be wrong. But I do not think we've seen a smoking gun of that  happening. The only other two points in the journal that I mentioned is one is that they  allegedly restricted advertisers from using data obtained during a Google ad campaign in ad campaigns  elsewhere. I think that's wrong. I think that goes against the principles of Google and open  information. And Google did stop that practice. I think it was a wrong practice. I don't know that  it was necessarily illegal. I think it was un-Googly. And then finally, in just a graphic, Google said  the journal said that Google tried to restrict sites that did search deals from also doing deals  with competitors, including Bing. I would say that's just stupid. That would be a red cape for  anti-trust investigators. But in the report, according to the journal, one investigator said  there was insufficient evidence. And so that one doesn't go. So in the bottom line here is that  I don't see, again, I wish they'd have helped more so I could criticize about them more. I have  criticism for things. But I think that we have to take the journal's worldview and Murdoch's  worldview here of going after Google with a grain of salt. And it's the journal's basically is trying  to accuse the White House of a politically motivated dropping of the action against Google  because of the close connections to Google. Witness the next story that came out was all the people  who've gone from Google to the White House. I'm a journalist. I know how these tricks operate.  And I think we've got to judge the messenger. There's another thing that has to be said anytime

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you talk about antitrust, because there's a bit of confusion about what is illegal and what isn't  illegal. I'm not a lawyer, but I do watch The Good Wife. And one thing that people need to be aware  of is the fact that it's not against antitrust law to do things that harm competitors. This is  something people don't understand. You have to harm competition itself, the competitive process,  meaning that you have to artificially inflate prices. You have to artificially do something  that harms consumers. And then it can be an antitrust issue. This is very, very difficult  in search results because you don't filter anything in search results. You rank things.  All the results are always there. They're just in slightly different orders and throwing a  fly into the ointment. They're different for individual people because of personalization.  So for example, when you got YouTube as the second result looking for this week at Google,  this is the third result. The second result was Wikipedia. You'd almost have to log out to find  out what the generic results are. You start pulling the thread out of the sweater from the FTC's  point of view. There's no end to it. And it will be very, very difficult to find that prices have  been raised, that consumers have been harmed, or any of this stuff. Even as complex as these issues  are, it's very difficult to actually make a solid case that will hold up. Which is what the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  economists report. That's what they concentrate on is just that. The lawyers are concentrating  on the actions and so on. Do me a favor. Go to Google and search for maps and then go to Bing  and search for maps and tell me who's more upstanding. I get Google Maps MapQuest. I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  got to log out though to really get this to be, let me sign out of my Google account and search  for maps. Okay. Without being signed in. Oh, actually I didn't have to do that. I could have  just done an incognito tab. Oh well. Google Maps MapQuest, Yahoo Maps, Bing Maps, Weather Maps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In other news, MapQuest still exists. Heard it here first folks. All right. Let me go to bing.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think I'm signed in there and search for maps. But remember, Google's not going to make a  big mistake. Bing is number one. MapQuest is number two. Yahoo Maps, Maps. I don't see Google. How far

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do we have to go to get Google? Keep going. I don't see Google Maps. MapQuest, Rand, McNally.  It's not in the first page. Come on, folks. Which is the more upstanding company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also, which is the better map service? How do you make the case that Bing is the number one best?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Google Maps is better than worldatlas.com and it's below it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't begrudge Bing putting their maps first. That's my other point. The other point I make is  that if we're calling Google a publisher and hold them to the standards the publishers hold  themselves to, they never promote their competitors. Never, never, never, never, never.  The European publishers led by the Germans made a big video about how when you search on shoes on  Google, running shoes, running shoes is an example. Oh my God, you're going to get ads, ads, ads.  But then you also get Nike and other companies. If you go to Bilt, the largest newspaper in Europe  owned by the company that has led the fight against Google, and there's a whole shoe tab on the site,  you don't get anything but their own ads. And so do we expect people to promote us and us people?  No, we don't in any other world. So why do we have this supposed standard of no self-promotion  and objective search? Because they're a monopoly.  They're no, sorry, there's no such thing as either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and that's one of the things we also learned from the Wall Street Journal report, which is  that Google is very happy to see comscore results that said they're not a monopoly,  even though they weren't accurate, because Google knows it's a monopoly. They just don't  want anybody else to think so. It's the rules change for monopolies, as you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the wrong standard for monopoly. The issue isn't search monopoly. And, you know, the number  is much higher, it's 50% higher in Germany. The issue is advertising monopoly. And that's why I  said that Google's primary weakness is in having the power of God over whether advertisers may or  may not be in the service and how they're treated. And that, if the FTC had any brains about how,  Danny's real point here is they don't understand how search operates. And this is the danger of  government regulation of these kinds of activities. I think that's unfair. First of all, the FTC

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  declined to prosecute. So they did the right thing in the end, in my view.  And they did the right thing, if that's your point of view. I'm not, by the way, in that camp. But  if that's your point of view, they did the right thing. So it's ridiculous to say they don't  understand search. Apparently they do. Maybe those lawyers doing that report didn't. But I  don't think that's accurate. I think that there are different ways to look at this, and it depends  on your point of view. And ultimately, I think it comes down to whether you trust Google or not.  And if you give Google's statements credibility, then you'll say, oh, okay, that makes sense.  But I think you can also interpret the actions in a more negative fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I put where my lines are, and with appropriate proof, I said these are lines that if Google  crossed them, they'd be wrong. I think we don't know. I think it comes down to, do you trust

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google and what Google has said? Yeah, what they say makes sense. Whether it's true, I don't know.  It's a very self-serving statement. Here's the other part of Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that when I was here in all week, and this is just me, is that the world, all around,  Germans and Americans, oh, you Germans better eat crow. Oh, look at this, what the FTC said.  Well, look at the journal, a better German better eat crow. Google's evil, Google's wrong. Google  should be broken up. I don't see that. But that's part of the problem here of where-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Welcome to the internet, Jeff. I don't think that's what a sensible person's saying.  Oh, wow. There were some well-known journalists and media executives who were saying-  I wouldn't say Jeff Jarvis should eat crow. What I would say is the FTC did, the process worked.  The FTC did a reasonable thing, whether it's right, I don't know, a reasonable thing based on all the  reports they received, and it looks as if they got good information. I'm glad the Wall Street  Journal published this report because I think it's important to know the full facts of the case.  Well, I'd like to have the full report. I would like to have the full report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would like it all. As the 160 pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it bothers me that the FTC feels this should not be in public view because it should be,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  all of it. Well, I don't know what the normal  process is on staff reports, I have no idea, but once the journal has it journalistically,  why isn't the journal putting up the entire- I don't know either about that. So I want to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it all. And I think that that's a reasonable thing because this is a discussion that is  don't you feel an appropriate discussion? You want Danny Sullivan to lose sleep for  the next week. The other thing I would say is we yell at Comcast because Comcast isn't just  in the internet business, it's in the TV business, it's in the content creation business,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's in the telephony business. No, I don't yell at Comcast for that, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I do because it muddies the waters. I understand we live in, that what I want is not  reasonable in the society we live in. The businesses in this society have free reign  and they have free reign to enter any area they wish and compete and compete vigorously. That's  a free market. But I do believe that we are in a situation where some companies are starting to  dominate. I think Google is dominant. I would feel much better about this if Google had two or three  equal competitors, just as I'd feel much better about Comcast if they had two or three equal  competitors. We're seeing that they are getting- they are starting to get-  Yes, I think that's very important. Two things.  I would love to see- wait a minute. I would love to see a search engine- I don't mind if they sell  ad results, that's fine. They've got to monetize, but that's what they do. They do search and ad  results and they leave it at that. I would love to see that. Because a search engine has a higher  mission, it is too important for it to be a hurly burly free market business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's why I disagree with that. Because then if you separate, as someone would want to do,  if you separate search from, let's say, maps, then the map company doesn't know my searches and  doesn't know that I like often looking for pizza where I am and blah, blah, blah, blah.  That connection of personal data matters. I spend all my time now arguing to the media business that  they've got to get in the relationship business. They've got to get their own first party data  and they've got to start giving people relevance in the manner that Google does.  You just chopped off the relevance engine. I do it. That's why I'm drawing to put a fence around them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's a societal- I understand. I think there's a societal cost to that convenience.  I would prefer to see many smaller, more narrowly focused businesses than giant businesses that are  using the interrelationships between the different arms of their business in a synergistic way that  is often to our disadvantage. Yes, we'd be giving up some great stuff like Google now.  I think that's a fair trade. I think we'd be in a better world if we had many small businesses

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  competing against each other. The other argument I heard from my European friends particularly was,  and I had an hour long conversation with an Austrian journalist about this time,  and it's, well, they could do this. They could do that. Just because you could do something is not-  Unless you're Tom Cruise with a big screen in front of you, that is not cause for legal action.  Right. It's what you actually do that matters. I agree.  I think that there's too much going on here that says, Google's too big. Well, again,  show me the law that says too big. Show me where the line is so that I can't go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're absolutely within their rights and the great American tradition of free enterprise.  I'm not saying it should be against the law. I'm just saying it would be nice,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  aesthetically. I think that the thing that has to be mentioned is the fact that we're moving to a  world of relying on virtual assistants for a lot of answers. They don't give you results. They just  give you answers. You don't know where it came from. It's like talk to Siri and say, hey Siri,  what's the deal with XYZ? It says, here's the answer.  Apple has intentionally- Where did that come from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cut the head off of that result. They don't want it to say Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is competition growing. There is competition growing,  Leo. We have a story in the rundown today of Business Insider and it's typically blunt way  saying that, is Larry Page asleep at the switch? Google should be scared to death of Facebook.  Facebook's not nearly as big as Google yet, but it is making huge inroads. I want to remind you of  the days when certain parties thought that Microsoft was going to take over the world and  now Microsoft is darn near a laughing stock except on your show because they're nice to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I think in Windows Weekly, we spend a lot of time going, what is going on?  You do. I just got a joke. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a great conversation and I completely see your point of view.  And I yours. We just disagree.  I don't even know if we disagree. I fear a company where those synergies are so massive  that we become little cogs in their data machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it possible? But here's the question, Leo, because somebody went after me, somebody who's  a Google hater went after me when I said that I think Google is basically a good company.  Oh, Google, I apologize.  I agree with you. I think they are basically a good company.  Well, but that's the question. That's part of the question. I think there are those who think that  companies, Siva Vadanathian, who I respect greatly just says companies must be companies  and basically they're going to, I don't want to, I'm going to oversimplify Siva. I don't want to do  that. But there are those who would say companies will inevitably go bad, be wrong, be corrupt.  Can we believe in the possibility of a good company?  And I still hold out the idea that we can, because if we don't, if we can't, then yeah,  you reflexively regulate everything, but you then limit the upside of the world that's being created.  And that's why I know I sound like a libertarian. I'm a Hillary Clinton Democrat. I'm a liberal.  I believe there's need for government in many cases, but I don't believe in reflexive regulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we all agree on that.  Oh, a lot don't, a lot.  I do feel like there's such power in nowadays in a search engine like Google to be the arbiter of  fact, to its curation. And I think they should be, I would love to see an order, a priesthood  that would hold as its highest goal to do the best job at that as possible. And of course,  if that's their highest goal, then they wouldn't get into side businesses that, you know,  you maximize profit by getting this.  Well, so use, use, use Duck Duck.  Make them a nonprofit.  Oh God, communist.  Well, I think there are some things.  Go, go, go eat your kid's pie.  I think there are some things. The roads are a good example. The roads should be nationalized.  They shouldn't be run by private business because otherwise you get interlocking toll roads and you  get all sorts of horrible things happening. There's certain things that work best if they  are not held by a for-profit entity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Never with speech. Never. That is a first amendment violation. Search is speech, damn it.  And if you then do that, because hey, that's exactly what, you know, China wants. Yeah.  We'll control the search for your own good.  I don't mean government run. I mean nonprofit.  Like nonprofits are any better? No, I'm sorry.  I mean, well, I think that if you.  I know plenty of nonprofits that are greatly compromised because of where their money comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd also have to suppress speech in the sense that if you had, let's say for example.  Well, they have the right to do this. I'm not contesting.  But what I'm saying is there are market forces here and there's how reality works.  If Google were suddenly handed over to a nonprofit organization, it would suddenly  halt in its tracks because nonprofits are very, very slow. And then some nimble startup would  come out of Stanford and everybody would gravitate toward it. And you'd either be back  to Google again with a private company making these decisions, or you'd be saying, we have a  law saying you can't have a search engine. I understand what I'm proposing is not practical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I completely understand that. I know you're being provocative.  I'm not even being provocative. I think this would be the, I think we need a society of Jesuits  who are single goal, which is to curate, to provide a good search that is  not tainted by appearance or fact of competition. It would solve also this privacy issue.  You know, people are worried about Google. The more these synergies happen, the more Google  knows about you, it scares people. All of those would go away because Google wouldn't need to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  anything about you. You know what you're doing, Leo? You're erasing Gutenberg. You're going back  to the scribes. You want scribal search. Not in every respect, but in one. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if you're going to give a company the right to curate, the right to arbitrate fact,  it's become such a powerful thing. I feel like I know it's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bottom line is that number one, there's no such thing as a, as valueless search results or  content. A search engine company has its corporate values. Those are not going to be in line with  anybody else's values, yours, mine, anybody's. And the second horrible reality is that any sort  of entity that has a search engine, somebody has to do it. Somebody has to. Is the government  the right one? Is it a bunch of Jesuits? I don't know about that. There's always a POV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I understand. There's always a point of view. So that's why the next best thing is to have  true competition. And while you might say, oh yeah, well, we got Bing and we got Bing,  there's not competition. So I'll go back to Alta Vista. There is not competition in search.  And the default is Google. And I don't know where these market share numbers come from,  because no one I know uses anything but Google. One good thing is that it's not universal. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for example, in Russia, Yandex is a bigger search engine than Google. It's just in the US.  Well, US isn't even nearly as bad as it is in Europe. In Europe, it's like 93% or more,  something like that. US is much better. 63 or something. 63 or something like that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But don't get me wrong, there's a lot of people. Well, but it's the same reason as why is Yahoo  still around? Why is AOL still around? Because people have habits that go way, way back. And  that's where we're not like that. You try every darn new thing down the pike. But that's not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is DuckDuckGo a true competitor? No, it's not. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bing and AOL and Yahoo are together. Yeah, but DuckDuckGo is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where do their results come from? They come from other search engines, right?  They keep saying they're going to make a crawler. I don't know if that's a viable

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  notion. Another way to look at this is a whole different way to look at this  is you could argue that what Google should open source is the crawl.  The crawl data. Okay. And let others build on top of that. I like that. Let others be the curators.  So what I'm buying from Google, what I'm with my time and my attention.  Is their curation? Is their point of view? Is the value they are adding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like this idea. Is the partiality they're adding in.  This is analogous to the idea of let the municipalities create the infrastructure for  an internet, but let 100 companies on top of it provide the internet access. I like that idea.  Again, and something that's never going to happen because that is the crown jewel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if you were France and Germany when they were trying to create their own Google,  well, there's a couple things here. One, they were trying to create the wrong thing. Two,  I would argue once again, the monopoly is not in search, the monopoly is in advertising.  That's what nobody looks at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Except it is in search because the crawl data is impossible to duplicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's all no, it's beyond that. It's now just a marketplace because the search data  doesn't really greatly affect double click the way it does search ads and double click is a huge  part of the business and video ads aren't greatly affected by the search results. So no,  Google's monopoly is in digital advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if that's the case, that's good news because as you point out, Facebook and others  are giving overrun for their money. So if that's the case, but I feel like it's not the case  because I feel like they have what they have really is the index of the internet.  And that is so hard to duplicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I don't think it's the it's not. It's not the raw data about the internet.  So the screen saying it's information they have about us.  It's relevance. It's the experience data. Yeah.  So what?  But even that even that again, I don't think that's the monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Let's take a break. I think it's a great conversation.  And I don't think there's an answer to it. And I actually think the FTC did the right thing after  looking at all this analysis. But I'm also glad that I maybe don't go as far as you do as saying  this is a hit piece by Rupert Murdoch. I think it's appropriate for the journal.  It's published in all Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just saying and I don't want to besmirch Wall Street Journal journalists, the journalists,  the Wall Street Journal wonderful, amazing work, but they are affected by I think one must judge  some things in the light of the ongoing never ending attacks on Google. I think have an impact  on how we judge that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. But you know what? Real people don't care. They just say what's the best search engine.  Actually, they don't even say that. Right.  They don't know what they're doing. They just type it in the hole in the top of the browser  and whatever happens, whatever comes out, that's what they use. That's really what happens.  What is the back end?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We know the back end of Siri in terms of the search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a variety of things including Google, Wolfram Alpha, Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they have a tendency to try to get rid of Google as much as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think they use Google. What they have a tendency to do is to strip the name Google.  Strip the ads out.  Right.  If I were Google, I'd be a lot more incensed about what Apple's doing to them than when other  companies are saying about Google doing to them. March is National Business Month. So get going.

Mike Elkins here. Love having you here. Appreciate you coming earlier this morning.  We were at the Facebook F8 conference. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Zuck on stage. That's right. He killed a buffalo on stage. It was amazing.  Did he eat it? Yes, he did. He ate as much as he could.  He had blood all over his face. It was horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is clear when you watch Facebook that they have ambitions far beyond that of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  social network. They want to be an alternative internet, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it really looked like they want to be AOL.  You go into Facebook at the beginning of the day and everything is within there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When they send me a disk, I'm done. I'm cancelling my Facebook account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They did announce... So last year at F8, this is their developers conference. By the way,  we will continue to cover it tomorrow. The second keynote, 10 a.m. Pacific,  1 p.m. Eastern time, 1700 UTC. Mike and I will be here and it's going to be,  we think, the Oculus Rift stuff. Virtual reality.  VR helmet stuff. But today, what they were talking about wasn't as revolutionary as last year.  It was really kind of the same stuff. But the idea that we... Facebook's motto is very famously,  what is it? Work fast and break things. Or something like that. Go fast and break things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get drunk and break things. Last year, Zuck said, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what we really do is... Our new motto is go fast and provide a stable infrastructure.  Which isn't the same as Ring. He's older now.  That's age. That's what happens when you hit 30. But for developers, that's kind of what they want  to hear. So it was really about a developer platform. But the one thing that is kind of  interesting, this whole year has been about deconstructing Facebook. Taking the big blue  page and turning it into slices of apps like Messenger and WhatsApp and Instagram. And I  think more are coming all the time. This was a little bit in the opposite direction. They wanted  to say, Messenger is a platform. Platform was the word they kept saying again and again.  And they showed Messenger integration features, the ability for you as a developer to create an  app that worked with Messenger. They showed JibJab. And it becomes a part of the Messenger  infrastructure. It extends Messenger in effect. Yeah. Which who wants that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't want it. But it seems to me that they want to...  Their whole multiple app strategy. And again, I've said before, I think they're going to have  more than 100 apps within a year or two. They want to get everybody as occupied with Facebook  stuff as possible. If anybody's going to do anything else, they're going to do Snapchat or  anything like that. They want to get in front of it. They want to capture that behavior and get  people doing it on... My guess is that even today, a huge number of people use Instagram,  either don't know or don't care that that's a Facebook product. They just like Instagram.  And that's fine with Facebook. It doesn't even look like a Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't seem to have any connection. But here, Facebook is the one that has a  monopoly on our relationships, one can argue. It's the most common.  1.4 billion users. Google gets crap all over about  tying the relationship database it has across its applications. Facebook doesn't. And I don't know  if they should, but it's interesting to me that that's what makes this powerful, is that Facebook  knows you across WhatsApp and Messenger and Facebook. And the only thing they need to know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is that it's used so they can serve you ads. And also harvest your personal data and behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have something called Moves. I don't know if you've ever used this, but basically it  automatically tracks how much you're running and biking and all that kind of stuff, but also  where you go. So if you look at your day, it says, oh, you were at Starbucks for 22 minutes.  But Google's been doing that for years. Yes. But this is an interesting thing that now  Facebook can take that sort of location data and they can apply it to advertising on Messenger,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  or some other location. So you have an ad network that's across all the platforms,  and you have data aggregation across all the platforms. It's powered by that. Which again,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm arguing that rather than trying to kill all that going on, what I argue to my media confreres  is get in that game, people. We'll talk in a few minutes probably about Facebook and news,  and this has been my sermon on that point. But aren't you sitting on top of sand,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because really ultimately if you build your business on Facebook, their interest is not you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's them. Yes, but it depends upon the deal. I think that the idea that we have to continually  drive people to us and our sites, that goes away, especially in a mobile world. We're going to have  to go to where people are. So the art of this, I would argue, is what deal Facebook does. And  I've talked with Facebook about this, and I wrote a post before all these announcements and leaks  saying here's my wish list of what I wish Facebook would do for news. And then when there's word from  the New York Times that they are talking to news organizations, my message is very simple.  It's not sufficient to put your content up on Facebook to get branding. It's not sufficient  to put there to get links. It is a help to get revenue. Facebook should start sharing revenue  for those cases, and that would be a good thing. But neither is that a business model. What you  need to get is data. Now the yes-but-I-get-from-everywhere is, well, about privacy.  And my argument is very simple, that if the user makes a transactional agreement saying  that I want to share this data, so I get this relevance back, then it works. So the example I  give is Facebook can say, well, Jeff, we see that you follow the Jets a lot so you can make fun of  your friend Jim Brady and your poor son who is a fan of the Jets. And we see you care about this  topic. And we also see that you follow NJ.com a lot and The Guardian a lot, and they cover those  topics. Would you like us to alert them to alert you when things that are relevant happen? And I  can say yes or no. And if I say yes, I've now given permission for that data about me, that  information about me to pass across, because I'm going to get relevance back. Same as I do on Waze,  when Waze knows where I live and where I work, and I get relevance back from that.  I think it is possible to construct things on Facebook that will give media companies the data  they don't have. The problem is, once they have it, will they know what to do with it? Probably not.  But that's what we have to fix in my business, because we're still in the mass business where  all we do is give anonymous faceless eyeballs messages. That business is commodified, the value  will go to zero. We have to go to relevance. There's various ways to do relevance. This show,  your shows, are one way to do relevance. You target the content extremely. Another way to do  it is what Facebook and Google do. I don't know that Facebook's going to give any data across,  but what I say to media companies is, if they do, do the deal. You're building your own business.  You're learning more about your consumers than you have learned in the last 20 years. Go for it.  If they don't, yes, sand is under your feet. But I don't see any evidence. First of all,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't lump Facebook and Google into the same category. They are categorically in the same  scenario. I don't trust Facebook. We were watching the announcement today, and they flat out said,  oh, this is a great kind of advertisement because users can't tell the difference between  the video ads and the regular videos. That's why it's so good. That's why it's so powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The whole industry is going through that problem with native advertising, and I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something provably shameless about Facebook. If you recall the advertisements  that they used to have where they were clearly ads and they labeled them in a misleading way  to make you think that they weren't ads, they were called sponsored posts or recommended posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think they called them. I did a test, Mike. I took a screenshot. This is on Medium today. I don't  know if you can find it quickly. I took us a screenshot from Upworthy, which has a little  box and it says the word promoted on it. I went to Google and I paid $50 for Google consumer surveys.  I asked people, what does promoted mean in this context? Does it mean that an advertiser promoted  it, that the editors promoted it, that the readers promoted it, or an algorithm promoted it?  44% got it right, which is to say that the majority got it wrong. The majority didn't know it was an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about this one?  And suggested posts. What does that mean?  Right. Who suggested it?  Who suggested that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook's advertiser. This is the thing that bugs me. Facebook likes to brag about how  much more videos are being played on Facebook. The reason they are is they tweet their algorithm  as well. They're censoring more stuff that is not videos and keeping it from coming into your  newsfeed. They're pushing videos, these trivial, inane videos, and they're pushing those. Then  they're auto-playing, as you pointed out. They're saying, look at all these people. They love video.  I just don't trust Facebook. I think they tweak these algorithms for the reasons. We had a long  discussion about whether Google was being anti-competitive and how they tweak their  algorithms and show product information. I just think Facebook is just shameless about how they  push things in the news feeds. They have total power. They've admitted last FA conference  that they only push from business pages, what was it? 12% or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every business has learned that this is not a way to engage customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A tiny number actually make it into people's news feeds. This really bugs me. I just don't think  it's even in the same ballpark as what Google does with their algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it was a mistake for Facebook. I think it's still true on the right that you do get the raw  feed of everything that comes into your feed. I think the Facebook should make that extremely  accessible so you'll decide which is better for you. I think most people will decide that the  Facebook curated feed is better. Except they'll never do that. They'll never do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, even Scoble, because I did observe that in Facebook that if I go to the chronological order  as opposed to the news feed that I would get everything. He said, oh, you don't want to do  that. He said, well, I think in some respects this might be the right answer. You want to give  Facebook enough signals so that their algorithm can give you a feed of something you really will  like. So when you go to news feed, you can click the selector. I doubt anybody much knows.  You can either do top stories or most recent. If you do most recent, yeah, you're getting everything.  But no one does that. Scoble's point was just spend hours teaching Facebook what you like and  you'll love it. Hundreds of hours. By the way, see, I don't really want this... Now this says  sponsored. Before I had another one that said suggested. I like sponsored. I know. And this  video auto played. And so, you know, of course I'm watching this video. No, I'm not. That's bogus.  I'd like to know how many videos were clicked on Facebook, not how many videos were played.  I just, I can't wait to get rid of Facebook. I really can. You go so back and forth on that.  No, I don't. I've never wanted Facebook. I only have to have it because how else do we have this  conversation? Right. I have to have it. I don't want to have it. And I don't really get any  anything coming in. But here's Lisa loves it. Now, let's say, let's assume Lisa is kind of a normal  person. She's kind of a normal person. She loves it. I keep saying this to her. She says, no, this  is like, see all my friends. I have a great time. She looks at it all the time. Loves it. Nobody  likes her. She likes her friends. I feel horrible after I look at it. I don't ever feel good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The fact that Facebook is talking to big publishers, this is the ego of us big publishers  talking or in my world. But I think that's a hopeful sign that they're looking for quality  content, that they've realized that crap doesn't pay. Put that on your badge. And that's the  problem. And just as Google had to learn about being gamed, Facebook has had to learn about  being gamed by the upworthies. And, right. Well, they seem to have learned. I don't see a lot of  that anymore. Yeah. And I think that they're trying to go for more quality in the feed.  And not everybody wants the New York Times, but those who do, it'd be a better experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Such an analog, though, to what we were talking about in the last segment, because  they've now become a curation type engine. I mean, they really are telling me what's real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's- They're telling you who your relationships are and which of your relationships are irrelevant.  Yeah. You don't need to talk to that person. I don't really want them to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I also hope spring's eternal as soon as Mark's talking about how great Messenger is.  I reinstalled it, because I'd taken Facebook off all of my devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Should I reinstall it? On Android, it was driving me berserk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It will drive you even more berserk. For instance, one of the things they pitched at F8  was if you're a brand, you should have a push me notifications on messenger button on the checkout,  on the cart, so that you can interact. Because all the user has to do is click that,  probably even logged in through Facebook. So easy peasy. And then all of a sudden,  the brand's going to be messaging you with like your shoes are on the way.  Oh, those shoes are great. They look good on you. Do you want to buy another pair of shoes?  Hey, you bought shoes last week. You want more shoes? Would you like some shoes?  I don't want- That's just stupidity.  That makes Messenger less useful, not more useful to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. But what's the fix to that? I mean, I always go to Amazon.  Well, I'm not going to click that button. The story I always tell is that when I buy my daughter  a Taylor Swift album, the next day I'm a dirty old man on Amazon. What does Amazon do? It gives  me visibility to that data and the chance to change it. And that's what Google does it somewhat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  often in its dashboard. Amazon probably knows enough about me to be bugging me all the time  and has the good sense. Thank you, Amazon. I do get emails and you can opt out of this from  Amazon saying, Hey, you bought the Xcopter. Somebody is wondering if that Xcopter uses  batteries. Would you like to answer that? Really? That's very annoying. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really annoying. But I turned that off. Yeah, no, Amazon, I think Amazon pays attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to signals. The difference is Amazon is not in the business of selling advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And they're better at it. I've never really seen a lot of accurate contextual advertising  on Facebook, whereas on Amazon, it's really good. That was the other lie on the F8 stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Deborah Liu comes out and says, not only do customers like native advertising in their  content, but they love it that we only show them ads they like. That's right.  What? Not in my feed. I'm still getting ads for barbed wire fences and 60 year old men in Petaluma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here I see I'm looking at an ad men's suits at Nordstrom. Leo, have you ever seen me wear a suit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Never. Not once. But Facebook thinks you do. Facebook knows you should, Mike.  Let me see actually. I think Mike can look pretty good in a suit, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mike is a natty. It's only theoretical. Natty, natty. It's never going to happen.  American Express gold card ad. Yeah, I got that. But see, we both have it.  We're big spenders. This is just TV advertising. It's a waste of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They should know I have that. But it's like it's TV advertising. We're both getting the same ad.  What's contextual about that, Leo? Right.  They're showing everybody the American Express gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad they no longer say, 58 year old men in Petaluma are very interested in these toasters.  Because that was annoying. All right. There's lots more to talk about than this dumb stuff.  Let's talk about cool stuff. Eric Schmidt says Google's not giving up on glass. You're a glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  hole. I am a glass hole. Yes. And the fact that the fact...  Former glass hole. Reformed glass hole. This is a perfect example of the tech  journalist echo chamber creating a lie in the public consciousness. The idea that they were  retiring, it was pure wishful thinking. And here's the proof.  I do wish they did. Basically, what Google said was that they  were going to take glass and they're going to take it out of the experimental phase out of Google X.  And they're going to create a product division and develop it into a consumer product.  And everybody said, it's dead. Now that is the biggest leap you can imagine.  They did exactly the same thing with their project that maps indoor location.  Right. Exactly the same thing.  They can still roast it. And everybody said, oh, look, it's the future.  They're going to do this thing. They're going to make a real product.  So this whole thing that Google glass was dead and they were killing it off  was a fabrication by the tech media. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pure and simple. But really they should kill it off.  No. You know what they should do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said this before, I'm going to say it again. They should offer every poor glass hole the  opportunity for a refund. Your money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, how many people, how many glass buyers would ask for... Jason, you'd ask for your money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe I'd be asking for your money back. My money back. And I wish you would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, you'd be asking for your money back. But I guess this guy over here,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mike, you wouldn't want your money back? No, I wouldn't. And here's what they should  do to make Google glass. The whole problem was caused by the camera because the idea  of holding up a phone is something nobody ever does. Oh, wait, no, everybody does it every day.  Me or Kat. But what they should do is that the  camera on Google glass should be removable so that we can get the notifications, we can get the  information as we're walking around and not be pointing a camera at people. And nobody would

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  object to it. I think it's the opposite.  It should just be a camera. On my watch now, I'm getting the notifications  and the instructions. I don't need it here. Yes.  I do want a point of view camera, but it should be very simple. Red light on it.  All it needs is a red light when it's on. Really, were you satisfied with the camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you have to aim. It's like looking at what your eye is looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought it was okay. It was a very wide angle lens.  If you're in the men's room and you're trying to take pictures of people in the men's room,  it's really easy to do. Just kidding. But the wearable...  The junk's so small. The wearable... Well, it's only  because it's a wide angle lens. It's so far away.  It's a wide angle shrinkage. But the wearable computing  revolution is coming and we're going to be able to just know things. And Google glass is a great way

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to just know things. Really, you found it useful because I feel like that screen of over my eyebrow  was too small and too difficult to look at to be really useful. I think there's other ways to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that. I think there are other ways and that may not be the best way to do it. But I do think that...  I like augmented reality. Yeah. I mean, well, that's what Google glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  theoretically could be. No, not at all. I mean, really all it is is a monitor over your eyebrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but if it's contextual and you... Remember the initial faked video of Google glass?  A guy walked around and you like... That was so cool.  Information, oh, your friend wants to do this. That was augmented reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what, FTC? Go after them for fraud on Google glass.  Yeah. That ad, that video. Yeah. Do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Quartz says Google's driverless car, this probably is another journalist getting something  wrong, might come with airbags on the outside to protect pedestrians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it should come with springs that push the pedestrians further away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This can't possibly be true. It can't be.  It can't possibly be true. Out of my way, pedestrian.  This comes from a patent application. That's meaningless. Sorry, Quartz.  People patent everything. We enjoyed it.  It's a good laugh. I do like this. Now, I am the only person in the world who likes Google's inbox  app. But I think if you start to think about it as a new platform for Google to integrate mail into  other things, this makes a lot of sense. They're working on a project to let you receive bills  in Gmail and pay them. It's called Pony Express.  That's a strange name. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And maybe a code name. This is going to kill the USPS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, I love this idea. Yep. So they use a third party company to verify your identity. And this  is another thing that I think is being underplayed in the report on this. Google essentially gave up  on Google Plus as an identity platform. They got rid of their real names policy and all the rest.  And now it's not your identity. Now they're talking about a third party company that will  really verify your identity. Not Google.  Not Google. It's a third party company. Do we know the company?  No, no. It's a theoretical company at this point.  But this is how it would work. Right. So they would really know who you  are in the way that financial companies and people who you pay your bills to would be able  to identify you as. But once they know who you are, once the Google system, the Google password  is associated with a really solid identity, there you go, they've got identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a really, really good point, Mike. Uh-huh. Yeah, they always say about how  Apple has all those credit cards. Yeah.  Mm-hmm. Yep. This would be better than that.  Yep. And imagine if they tie it in a wallet. They already have,  it might be something as simple as linking to your wallet account. But yeah.  So this is a document that the recode got that says it'll come in the fourth quarter.  May or may not be called Pony Express in the real world. That could just be a code name.  But boy, I love, this is an example of I love my Google overlords.  Yeah. Because man, the data they'd get, everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. And of course, they're speculating, I think that was Kurt Wagner who wrote that  they would use the data for contextual advertising. They could use the data for  additional financial services, including getting loans and things like that.  Uh-huh. So could be the other issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you get your visa bill, that visa bill is itemized.  Yeah. Is Google going to analyze the itemization?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, why not? Why not?  You know, I mean, there are already companies like our advertiser Personal Capital that do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until it's Mint does that. Yep. Yep. And again, this is if you look at  how they do ads right now on Gmail, it's basically they read the content of your  messages and say, oh, you're talking about scuba diving. You need this regulator,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  whatever. I mean, it's theoretical, but- Or better yet, you just bought a wetsuit,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but do you have the tanks? Or better yet, we're looking at your bank  account. You've got a lot of money. Have you considered a self-driving car with airbags on the outside?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From the Washington Post, the story that came out this morning, the nation's top technology  firms and a coalition of privacy groups will be sending a letter to the Obama administration and  senior lawmakers suggesting that Congress place curbs on government surveillance.  Apparently the deadline for the Patriot Act expiration, June 1st, is rapidly approaching,  but the effective date really is the day Congress goes home for Memorial Day recess,  which is sooner, May 21st. The letter says, quote, the status quo is untenable and it is  urgent that Congress move forward with reform. The reform government surveillance industry  coalition includes Apple, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, and of course, Google.  We know that there are some in Congress. This is policy director of the New America  Foundation's Open Technology Institute. We know there are some in Congress who think they can get  away with reauthorizing the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act without any reforms at all.  This letter draws a line in the sand. It makes it clear the privacy community. It's funny that Google  considers itself part of the privacy community. Oh no, that's another part. And the internet  industry do not intend to let that happen without a fight. Good on you. We'll see what happens.  Remember that day, May 21st, Congress recesses. If they're going to reauthorize the Patriot Act,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it will have to be before then. That's the kind of thing you do in a late night session.  Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve on a holiday or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's see. We did the FTC stuff. Google Fiber is expanding once again. Salt Lake City, the next  candidate. Google Fiber plans and experiment. This is an interesting one with targeted ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and TV. They want to make TV ads more like internet ads. You were just saying that American

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Express ad was effectively a TV ad. You and I got the same ad. Exactly. But that's Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, Google isn't always all that contextually savvy either. But basically what they're talking  about is having the ad, like there's a moment in the programming where you can put very local  advertising. Like literally the store at the end of the street could actually put advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cablecom is already, Comcast does this for instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. There's Visible World, NBC Universal, and Cablevision and DirecTV are doing similar things.  This would probably be more Google-ish. It'd probably be a little bit better in terms of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, because what happens is you watch an ad block in a TV show. Something I do as little as  possible. But you watch an ad block in a TV show and it starts with the really glitzy, high-gloss  ads from major national companies. And by the end, it's better called Saul.  Yeah, exactly.  It gets more and more local towards the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. Now here's the cool part. Even if you DVR it, it'll put a different ad while you're  watching the DVR than when you're watching the live thing.  No kidding.  So it doesn't care if it's a recording or live or Memorex or whatever. It will always put the  contextually relevant ad in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow. I don't- You know, people hate this idea because they feel like it's an invasion of  privacy. Essentially what we do on Twitter is contextual ads in the sense that we're a very  targeted service. So the ads we do are targeted at people who would watch the kind of crap that  we do. So we have ads that are, for the most part, I think, of interest to the audience.  It's always better, isn't it, to have an ad that's of interest in the audience than an ad  for something you don't want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The alternative is an irrelevant ad. A counter to boys.  You're going to get an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'd rather have an ad I care about.  Yeah, I think it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually argue, too, that media companies should have some kind of reward for you.  If I knew that I were more valuable to the New York Times by giving them 10 demographic points-  You might do it.  And I'd do it. A, I'd make more valuable to them. Maybe I get a discount on my subscription  as a result. They make more money as a result. And by the way, I get more relevant ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's why we ask our viewers to help support Twip by going to twip.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Great segue.  Did you say twip.tv?  Twip.tv slash survey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twip.tv slash survey.  We do this every year. We do a little survey.  And actually, it's not that little. How long do you think it takes? Half an hour? Less than that.  No, five minutes.  Not even that long.  Some of it is for us to understand better what you watch, what you like, how many of you watch video,  how many of you watch audio, which shows you watch. One of the stats we got from last year,  which was very valuable, is how many different shows the typical person watches. How many watch  just one, how many watch two, how many watch every show we do, you know who you are.  But then we also ask some demographic information. Please don't be affronted by it. We're not  collecting personal information about you at all. That will not in any way be linked to you.  But what we do want to be able to do is some advertisers want to know, well, how many men  listen, how many women, how many college educated, what's their income, that kind of thing. And we  do want to be able to provide that. That gives us, I think, better ads to better target what you're  interested in. If you don't want to do it, you do not have to. But if you do, we thank you. It's  just like you giving the New York Times some extra points, Jeff. twit.tv slash survey. Jeff,  please don't take this. You'll skew the results all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only if all of you twig readers take it and all of you check off that you watch twig.  And all of you say that you love twig. Please, please, please, please, please.

Transcript:  Do we ask your shirt size, Dr. Mom, really?  You don't have to pee in a cup. That's the optional.  That's right. It's optional.  HP. No, see, this is the this is not the story I want to do. But you saw Pwn to Own,  Cansec West. This is the big security conference in Vancouver last week,  shortly after the show, actually, on Thursday. They had the Pwn to Own contest, where teams of  hackers compete to see if they can crack modern versions of operating systems and browsers.  Nobody was uncracked. Google Chrome was cracked. Everybody was cracked.  Almost all of them by a single Korean hacker named Lee, who won $255,000 and a couple of laptops.  And will never be unemployed. Yeah, what a job security. Steve  Gibson said this guy must be really good. One of his exploits chained multiple different  vulnerabilities together to slowly escalate himself. The key is to be able to run a program,  arbitrarily run a program on that owned computer. And he wrote 2000 lines of code

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to hack one of them. I love Pwn to Own. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I just love the name. The good news is the thing I don't like about it is that  these hackers keep their information, you know, find exploits and then keep it to themselves.  For as long as they can. But after the event, they do release the exploits to the company so  that they can patch them. All four major web browsers were hacked. I wonder though, Jeff,  if they did a Chromebook. Because man, that feels like I feel like when I'm on my Chromebook,  I am safe. You're in the Google. I am safe. Lee's hack, the Chrome hack was the one that took  2000 lines of code. He took down both stable and beta versions of Chrome by exploiting a buffer  overflow race condition in the browser, then used an info leak and race condition into Windows  kernel drivers to secure system access. The standalone Chrome bug fetched $75,000. The  privilege escalation bug $25,000. And to finish it off Google's project zero, as it usually does  when Chrome is hacked at the event, said here's an extra $10,000 for your efforts. Lee went home  with $255,000. He did say the Chrome exploit was the toughest. Okay. And not only was it his first  time writing Native Client Code, but his first time dealing with a kernel exploit. And also,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he did it by himself and was competing against teams. Not a team. Isn't that nice? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So credit to, I want to get his full name, Jung Hoon Lee, a Korean researcher.  His name was Loki Hart. A Vikings reference from the  History Channel series, The Vikings. Could be. Could be. Thor had a hammer. What did Loki have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Loki has a lot of mascara and an ability to build boats. Our changelog, new on-body detection,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  smart lock mode in Android seems to be hitting some devices. So this is cool. I don't know if  you've used this, Jeff, with your Nexus 6 in your Chromebook. You can unlock your Chromebook just by  proximity with your Nexus 6. Yep. It has to have lollipop. Yep. Now. I love it. Now they're extending  that. Smart lock mode is called on-body detection. Use your accelerometer to figure out when your  device is in your hand or pocket. If it's not locked. I have it. Do you have it? I just saw,  I have it. If you leave your phone sitting on a table or forget it, it locks. Otherwise,  whenever you're using it, it's unlocked. That's how it should happen. After you actively unlock

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it the first time with your code. Of course. It's not like, oh, you picked it up. All right,  I'm unlocked now. So this is Android 5.01 or later. I think we're up to 5.02, aren't we?  It's not necessarily 5.1. Yeah, I'm not on 5.1 yet and I have it. So yeah, nobody, very few are on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  5.1. Well, this is great. Trusted devices, trusted places, trusted face, on-body detection. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is started with the Motorola X, which was cool, which was new when you were tied to  a trusted device via Bluetooth. It would unlock that. And then they had the skip.  They would unlock it, which was NFC. Now they've added places. So if you're at home,  it just stays unlocked. I have that already. Face is facial scan, but I love this on-body detection.  Keep your device unlocked while it's on you. Just unlock once and your device stays unlocked  as long as you keep holding your device. I want fingerprint, by the way. You don't need any of  this if you don't have to type a password. If it's just fingerprint, lock it all the time. I don't  care. That's one of the great things about the iPhone. I don't care if it's locked. It's so easy  to unlock it. We're doing a mini changelog. Android Auto now available on Android 5.0 Plus  and Pioneer Headends and units. Android Device Manager now lets you find your lost phone using  your Android Wear watch. That's cool. You can beep the phone from the watch. You could always  do the watch from the phone, right? Now you can go the other way around. Motorola adds a new gesture  for the Moto X. It's an Android 5.1. Chopped twice for flashlight.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't like that. I don't want the flashlight to be too easy to turn on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate it when that happens. Remember when we had the OnePlus One

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  all in.It would just turn on in your pocket.  Yep. Suddenly my pocket is getting really warm. Like what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now Canary is using the successor to Speedy. It should be called Speedy-er, but it's called

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  HTTP 2. I thought Speedy was a better acronym. So if you are on the Canary channel of your  Chrome and if you're not, you can easily do that going into your Chrome settings. You'll  get support for the final draft of HTTP 2. I don't know how many sites yet support that,  but apparently makes it... Steve's talked a lot about it on security now, if you want to know  how it works and so forth, but apparently it makes a difference. I don't think we're Speedy.  We're Sluggo. Sluggo. Sluggo Adaption. Cyanogen. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Turned out Microsoft...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember a few months ago on this show, I said, I'm not crazy about how Cyanogen is going after  Google. Why are they going after Google? They got a gift from Google and they raised money  from Microsoft. Are they getting money from Rupert Murdoch? Well, it turns out they didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  get money from Microsoft. That was a mistake. But they did in their Series C round get 80 million  dollars from Twitter Ventures, Qualcomm. Of course they use Qualcomm chips. Telefonica,  SmartFriend. Those are both international telecom companies. And Rupert Murdoch. See previous  discussion. Values them at half a billion dollars. It is of course a version of Android,  stripped of Google services. I don't know if that's really accurate. Without Google services,  I don't think you'd really want to use any version of Android. And Cyanogen, at least on the OnePlus  One, has Google services. But when you... Okay, now actually, if they think about it, when you  download the ROM, if you've put a custom recovery on your Android device and you download the ROM,  the ROM, Cyanogen does not include Google services, but there's always a checkbox that says,  oh, by the way, you're going to probably want Google services. Yeah, you have to install,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at least the last time I had to do it. Yeah, it was separately the Google apps kind of package

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  service installed separately. The G apps. The G, the gaps. That's why, if you ever wondered why,  because it's an open source AOSP version of... But nobody wants it. Tencent Holdings is another

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  investor. It's a Chinese giant. Go get Google. Go get them. Now I think you're right,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis. Maybe that's what they're up to. Yeah, so Cyanogen is becoming the anti-Google,  which, you know, fine, fine. Competition is good. I wouldn't mind a whole other operating system,  but the funny thing is they're building the anti-Google on top of Google. It just seems...  It's weird. It's rude. It worked for Amazon. Yeah. Yeah, it didn't. It didn't. Amazon unlocked

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  will give away paid apps for free. Well, they're already giving away paid apps, but this is more  than one a day. This is like a subscription service. Oh. Something similar to like Amazon

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Prime or something like that where... Yeah, yeah. Because you have a Kindle service for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like all you can eat, you know? The Amazon's delivery drones, the one they famously showed  on 60 Minutes. They just got FAA approval to test them. Except the drone that they got approval to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  test has been retired. And Amazon... What? You wanted the FAA to move fast? It's what they said.  One of their top executives told a congressional committee yesterday that it's like, yeah, you guys  move way too slow. We're already like, we're done with that drone. Now we have a new drone, which  is not approved, and we wish you guys would approve these things faster. So the FAA did actually come  out with a new ruling so that under 200 feet during daylight hours within visual range,  you can now, if you have an exception pre-standing, you can just go and test it. But Amazon's saying  that's not good enough. We're going to test in the UK because our whole point is we need to be able  to fly drones that we can't see. If I could see where it's going, I could just bring you the thing.  Exactly. The whole point of what we're testing is all of our algorithms and software that enables it  to fly without line of sight. So anyway, so the FAA is still a dinosaur of a... And they're still

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  holding back US innovation. Why do you come down on that? Do you want the sky filled with Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  drones? Yes. The US has a very large sky. What Amazon is proposing is to... They don't want to  crash their expensive test drones either. And what they're proposing is to test drones on a giant  piece of private property in the remote wilds of Washington state. I don't care if they test them,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but when they roll them out, are they going to be on giant swaths of property on Washington state?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or are they going to be downtown Petaluma? Well, first of all, I don't think that they're going to  be a mainstream way to deliver things, but I do think that they'll be useful for delivering  emergency supplies. In other words, they will save lives. I love that. Right. I just think that...  Drones have been used that way. I think if a problem emerges, we should deal with that problem. But  so far, we ban the commercial use of drones and we allow the private use. And it's the private use.  It's the private citizens who are crashing drones into the White House and doing all this mayhem.  So we're ignoring the actual part of the problem while banning something that has never happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  as a problem. It just seems irrational to me. And if it becomes a problem, we can just shoot them  out of the sky. Shoot them out of the sky. Get a free drone. By the way, people are perfecting  new forms of drone destructing, like beanbags that you can shoot. So it doesn't hurt the drone.  It just takes it down. Then you got a new drone and whatever they were delivering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe a net like a Spider-Man net. A net?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  NFL will be broadcasting one game this season on the internet instead of on direct TV  and everywhere else. It is the game that... The only reason they're doing this is because it's a game  that takes place at 6 a.m. West Coast time, 9 a.m. East Coast time. It's the Jacksonville  Jaguars-Buffalos-Bills game in week seven that is in London. 930 in the morning in the East Coast,  which is of course where the Bills and the Jaguars play. But yeah, I'm not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not exactly the Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like it's not... I'm not sure what they're doing here with this.  It's a publicity stunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a publicity stunt.  Nobody's going to watch this game anyway, so they might as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is one they can throw away.  This really peeved me a bit. Radio Shack has gone belly up. They're selling off the assets.  The stores are going to a sprint and some are going to go to Amazon.  But you know, and this is what people always talk about when they talk about privacy policies.  Yeah, sure, you can trust company A, the current company, but what if something goes wrong and  they sell their assets? Radio Shack wants to sell tens of millions of email and home addresses.  These are the ones they've gathered when you joined the battery club or...  They always ask for your phone number. Remember that at Radio Shack?  Radio Shack? Well, you thought maybe you could trust Radio Shack. Well, 13 million email addresses,  65 million customer names and physical addresses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And by the way, the company that irritated me every damn time asking me for my phone number  when I wanted to buy a battery. It gave me hell when I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it turns out that was an asset.  AT&T is trying to stop the data sale in Texas. It's a violation of state law to sell identifying  information if the company's privacy statement says it won't do it. So the attorney general's  of attorneys general for Texas and Tennessee plan to challenge the repurchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Part of the legal rationale behind this is I've been through this with companies with  takeovers and stuff. Let's say that, oh, I don't know, Amazon has bought Radio Shack, then  the privacy policy is written such that you could pass over the data to a third party such as an  acquirer. In this case, it's an acquirer, right? It's out of bankruptcy.  But it's not clearly what was intended by a decent privacy policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also love the fact that AT&T is trying to stop the Radio Shack sale.  That's ours. That's not yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's it's no. Yeah, I should make it clear. They're not doing it to defend you.  Exactly. They're just afraid that Sprint will get the information.  They don't want anybody else to get it. That's our data.  And I think this is actually a good it might even be a good tip.  Thanks to is it Gary Judge? Oh, yeah, that one. Yes. Yes.  His headspace blog. He showed Jeff how to put Skype on his Chromebook.  So easy even I could do it. Yeah. And I think that the trick is  that it's possible. You know, it's not that Skype suddenly runs in the browser. We're not using  crouton and installing Skype on Linux, but it's impossible using an extension called Torque  to run Android apps. Torque's an Android emulator. I'm going to put it on my Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't tried it yet. I was going to call you with it today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And let me do it. So this is crazy because you first have to install Evernote. I don't know.  It's really easy. It's easy. Torque is dependent upon the app runtime for Chrome that Evernote  installs. Then you install Torque. Then you get the Skype APK because you're going to side load  this. Drag the APK. I don't I guess you could get that from the Skype site. I don't know where you  get the links right there. You included the link. Yeah. OK. But let me just see where that link  comes from. It comes from his website. So just a word of warning when you get APKs from a third  party site, you don't know what the hell you're getting. I'm not saying this, you know, this guy  is not completely on the up and up, but that's kind of the issue. Remember that checkbox you check?  That says, do not I want to download apps from third parties? Let's face it. The worst case  scenario is you'll get Skype. That's a good point. That's a good point. Torque, though, is available  in the Chrome store. So that's presumably OK. You'll install the APK into Torque. You'll do some  settings. You save it as an unpacked extension, which you then install as an extension into Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, jeez, Jeff. Every time you open it, you have to go over the extension. Can you do me a favor, Jeff?  Just keep using the back. When I'm out of town now, when I'm out of town now, we can try this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I bet you there are a lot of people who would really like to play Clash of Clans or whatever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on their Pixel. Do you think this slows it down? No. It's going through an emulator? No. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because your Chromebook, especially the Pixel, is so much faster than anything. You're fine.  In fact, you'd probably run better. Well, the good news is you can do this. The nice thing about a  Chromebook is you could power wash it after you do it if you feel at all uncomfortable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's just a word of warning. Side loading APKs is a little tricky. All right. Let me give

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you a final word from our sponsor, and then we'll get our tip, tool, and number, and we'll let you  all hit the road. I've used BlueStacks, which is an emulator, and I didn't find it was very good.  So I don't know if this is better or not. Our show today brought to you by, but I'll tell you  because I'm going to do it when I get home tonight, brought to you by HipChat. We use HipChat now.  We started using it with our developers in Austin, Texas, the web developers. It was a great way to  stay in touch with them if they have a question, if there's something stopping them. I'm always on  HipChat because it runs on everything, Android, iOS, Windows, Macintosh, everywhere. In fact,  if you run it on a Pixel, for instance, or running on a Chromebook, they have a web interface that  works beautifully. So suddenly now you're communicating. Now you may say, well, this  looks like an instant messenger. No, no, no. It's so much more. It integrates 57 services like Jira  and GitHub and Zendesk, MailChimp, Heroku, which is great for developers, but it's also great for  people who need product management services. Email is as asynchronous and slow. If a team's  working over email, I think that's not ideal. Instant Messenger alone is just kind of not designed  for this. You're getting video chat. You're getting document sharing, screen sharing, code sharing.  This is great. The web developers in four kitchens, they're an agile house. We have meetings  every day. They really want to be able to iterate very rapidly. So being in constant communication  is great. We're using HipChat now with our engineering team, our sales team.  And on Tech News Today.  I see you have one for every show.  Every show because we have a different co-anchor every single day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that makes sense.  Yeah. So we have a Monday one, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday that we have one for every  show. We have one for TN2. We have one for the department in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a way to share a HipChat chat with somebody outside your organization and restrict  what they can see. It's really great. It's also the URL. It's SSL. It's completely locked down,  completely secure. And if you want to even trust no one encryption, you can actually run the HipChat  server in your enterprise. So now you've really, I just think this is so great. Just fabulous.  Now there is a freemium version you can use forever, but for the next 30 days, I want to  get you the full version of HipChat that includes all the videos sharing the screen sharing.  So that's free. You don't need to give us a credit card. Just go to hipchat,  H-I-P-C-H-A-T dot com slash twig. Sign up, click start chatting, invite some team members and you're  in. You got 30 days to enjoy it. And I'll tell you a little secret. If you're one of the first  hundred people to respond to this particular ad right now, you got to, I don't know how long it  takes to get those first hundred signups, but I would do it right now. You'll get 90 days,  three months free. Run. Don't walk to hipchat.com slash twig. 90 days free for the first time.  If it's really good, it's really, really useful. Uh, I don't have a tool. Actually I do have a,  I have a few tools because now I'm being, I'm a big Chromebook user, Jeff.  Whoa. You have some Chromebook tools. I'll go for that. I'm loving. Give me some Chromebook loving.  Well, a lot of the stuff that I do on Chromebook is probably not something you would necessarily  need, although you're a writer. So, um, you know, one of the things that's really great about, uh,  uh, the Chromebook is it's basically Chrome. So when you install an extension on the Chromebook,  it installs it, uh, globally on Chrome, which is really handy. And Chrome has it's, uh, it's little,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um, uh, app. I don't know, Leo. I don't know. Google should be a search company.  You're starting to win me over. No, I shouldn't have this computer. I don't know. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It shouldn't. But since it does, I'm going to use it. I wish somebody else were doing this.  Where's my app tour? I don't see it. Am I running some weird, what machine are you on?  I'm on the Macintosh. Where's my, it's, it's, it's, it's a window. What's weird. Where'd it go?  Oh, where'd it go?  On the upper left usually.  Yeah. It usually is. I want to show you.  There it is. There it is. There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Where? Where?  Left. Up top left. I'm pointing, I'm pointing to the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's on the bookmark bar. Thank you. Um, there it is. So this on a Chromebook  shows up as a, like your star menu, which is really nice. And you can see I'm starting to  load it up. I've used CIRC for our chat room. I use secure shell to log into my, uh, my, uh,  Linux server and use EMACS cause I'm just that kind of guy. I use Authy for, uh, the authentication.  Authy is great because it syncs across all of your devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should use floating twit. It's one of my favorites. Floating twit gives you a, a twit,  uh, window of live dot twit.tv. You can expand it to any size.  Wow.  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now this is a programmer's tool that a lot of, uh, where we're going to go. Hey, come back here.  A lot of programmers will like it's called Carrot. It's free. Uh, some viewers sent it to me,  but I think Jeff, even you might use it as kind of the ultimate text editor.  The reason programmers like it because it does syntax that it does. It's based on the sublime  text editor. So if you've used sublime as a programmer, you'll know it immediately.  It gives you access to the file structure on the Chromebook. So suddenly you're kind of using the  Chromebook like a real computer. Um, so I've, I've been very happy, uh, with this and, uh, and as  always, when you install something on your Chrome, uh, book, it appears in Chrome everywhere, which I  really like. I now have a set of tools on all the computers I use if I can only find the, the bar.  And that's just really handy. So this is somebody, somebody sent me a note cause I,  I talked about one of the few things I can't really do very well on the, on the pixel, which is  computer programming. And, uh, carrot is very cool. There's also a site and I'll add this too,  as a bonus called code anywhere. It's kind of the same idea. It's designed, uh, for people who are  on a Chromebook. Actually, let me go to the front page. This is the login page. Code anywhere is a  cloud-based programming environment. So it allows you to do collaboration and it'll work just great  in any HTML5 browser. And of course that means a cron a Chromebook. You have cloud storage of  your software. Um, you can work with others, which is great for team programming or pair programming.  And they have dev box stacks, which is nice. So you could pick the language you want  and suddenly on a Chromebook, you're actually, it looks like you're, you're really programming.  Very affordable. I thought this was very cool. And there is a free, uh, trial. It's, uh, most of you  probably want to spend seven bucks a month if you're going to use this. So carrots free and it's  local. Uh, but if you want to do cloud programming on Python, angular, node, uh, Ruby, that kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  thing, sports, GitHub code, anywhere.com. What do you, what do you lose with that? What, what,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, a lot. Chiefly what you lose is REPL, which is, uh, I, it's something I like. It's a great way to  learn. Professionals don't care, but the idea that you can, um, uh, do a, uh, a, uh, what is,  what does REPL stand for? Uh, uh, I can't remember parse and parse and list are the last print and  list. Anyway, it allows you to, it's an interpreter. So you can, you can work in the language,  whether it's Python or Ruby or, uh, a list, you can work in the language and interactive box.  And that's something you can do on a desktop. You can't really do it on pixel. You can do it  remotely. I actually can. It's one of the reasons I've been using EMACS on SSH is cause I can,  there's a racket REPL and EMACS. That's enough of that. Jeff, your number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, well, first I want to give a shout out. So, uh, cause somebody shouted me out in the street.  I was walking down the street. Hey, Jeff Jarvis, Pete, listen,  Hey, Jeff Jarvis. And, and it's just, it's, it's my favorite one. Jesus. It was a rotten day and it  makes it a great day. And so thank you, Pete, you know, thank you, twig fans. Uh, you know, I see  this when I was in Atlanta at the Atlanta airport. After I see somebody, somebody says, Oh, I just  see Jeff Jarvis, the airport, you know, come up and say hello. I love it. It's two seconds. It's  great. Um, uh, I think it's the greatest thing on earth. Um, thank goodness no one has ever asked  for an autograph. They must ask you occasionally. Yeah. So of course now it's not the autograph.  Autographs are dead, right? Everybody wants a selfie. Do you get that? Oh yeah. Yeah. I bet  you do. But you do not lie. I get as much as you do. No, no, no. I don't get it at all. That's fine.  They don't want a selfie with somebody on the street. No, it'd be embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  REPL stands for read, evaluate, print, read, eval, print loop. Thank you. Oh, I guess I'll go with

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  this one. Uh, MIT data storage researcher wins the Alan Turing award, which is $1 million from Google.  My stone breaker. So Google, Google funded the Turing award, uh, as a kind of, um, Nobel or  Pulitzer of, uh, technology. And you remember that Yuri Milner also has an award for, um,  physicists and theoretical scientists. And so his efforts to, to, because some of these people,  you know, you, you look at the Tim Berners-Lee's of the world who, who changed the entire world  and didn't get rich from it per se. I mean, I hope he's got good gigs since including MIT. Um,  so, uh, Stonebreaker did foundational research and database management systems, an industry now  worth billions. And so here's a, here's a million dollar shekel for you. Uh, and I think it's, I  think it's very cool that Google does that. He was at MIT's computer science and artificial

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  intelligence lab. And he founded multiple successful database companies. Wow. A million

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  schmackers. Yeah, it used to be Intel and Google, uh, together it was a $250,000 prize, but then  Google took it over and made it a round, they rounded up. He founded nine separate companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nine. That's a busy boy. Volt, DB, Tamer, Paradigm, Four, Vertica,  are the big names. Nice. Million dollars. Your number of the week. Yeah, that's, that's one  pretty good. Now, did you, uh, have anything, uh, Mr. Mike Elgin, you'd like to pass along to our

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fine twig? I do today at, uh, during the F8 conference, you and I were lamenting the fact  that Facebook has a tendency to come along with a copycat, something or other, right? Long after  it's been discredited or long after it's been, I can't remember the name of most of them. Yeah,  exactly. Well, uh, yesterday they announced a new feature called on this day. And the way that works  is if you can, if you have it already and they're rolling it out over the next week, but if you have  it, it's a facebook.com slash on this day. And what it does is it shows you things that either  you posted on this day in a previous year or that when exactly. So that's my, that's my, um, and,  and so on this day is for Facebook only. Uh, so my pick of the week is to remember time hop.  I love time. Time hop pulls from not just Facebook, but also Twitter, Instagram, four square,  Flickr, Dropbox, Google, iPhoto, and even your camera roll. And it will show you, uh, things that  you, that were posted on this anniversary in from previous years. It's a lot of fun and it's  everything that on this day is, and much, much more because it pulls from so many different things.  This was originally, uh, a four square app from a four square contest. Yeah. It was called,  I think the original name was something like four square and seven days ago or something like that.  That was the name of the app. Uh, but, but nowadays time hop is available for both android and iOS.  You just download it. You're connected to your different social networks and it will just remind  you of how quickly life is passing you by. I mean, it'll show you stuff that happened a year ago or  two years ago. And you're like, really, really? It seemed like it was two months ago. Anyway,  it's, it's a lot of fun. It's very enjoyable to use. And, uh, you know, forget about that Facebook,  uh, copy on this day and just use time on. Yeah, I agree. It's great for throwback Thursday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. Because you've always got some images you can throw. And if you're like me and you go to  facebook.com slash on this day, it says, Leo, thank you for coming to check out your memories.  Currently this feature isn't available. You have no memories. I have no memories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you've canceled your Facebook account. I'm going to cancel it now. Let me tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Thank you, Mike. Again, it's always great to have you. He's our news director,  guy in charge of our news coverage. That's such a great job every Monday through Friday,  10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1700 UTC on tech news today. That's right. Uh, and you can  also catch him tomorrow, uh, a little earlier at 9 a.m. Right. You're going to start an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And again, yes. And of course you can always subscribe to tech news today on the app,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the podcast app of your choice. So yeah, and then following it tomorrow, we're going to do F8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. Virtual reality tomorrow. Tomorrow's going to be the fun one. I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's what we're hoping. Couldn't be less fun. Did anything today make you say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ooh? Made me say, ew. Oh. Does that count? Well played. Well played. Well played, my friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I can't think of one thing that Facebook announced yesterday that made me go like, I want  that. And I tried because, in fact, I even apologized during our special. And that's a  TwitLive special if you want to watch it. I didn't mean to be snarky and negative, but I couldn't  find anything to say, oh, that's great. I can't wait to get that. Everything was been there,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  done that. The spherical video, all of it. It was just. They don't, they don't. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't seem to be good at inventing new things. And yet they did and they are and they're  smart. And Apple's done fine not inventing new things, just refining existing things. But  Facebook, everybody just goes, that's nice. Show me pictures of my cat. Jeff Jarvis is at the City  University of New York. CUNY, they call it. He's also on Google Plus as is Mike. Both of these  guys are big Google Plusers. Are you at all in any way feeling like I should put less on Google Plus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a public page. If you post to public, it's like having your own website, even if you don't  have engagement. If you do have engagement, it's all that's good. It's just like Google's really  into it anymore. It's really frustrating. You know, this whole meerkat thing, which I know you're  fed up with, okay. Why didn't they do this three and a half years ago and just make hangouts on  air or something you could do from a mobile device? They were so close, weren't they? Yeah.  But it is frustrating and I wish they would do a lot more. But it's still a bazillion times better

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  than Facebook. Well, Bradley's in charge now. Let's see what he does. Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love Bradley. Yep. He's cool. Jeff also has authored many great books. He blogs at buzzmachine.com.  Get that geek's bearing gifts. That's about the news industry. It's wonky. It's for news wonks.  We can reinvent news in the internet world. But I think a lot of what you talk about is happening,  which is good. And we do this show every, it's kind of my last show of the week, so I'm always a little  glazed by this time of day. Every Wednesday, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time, 2000 UTC  at live.twit.tv. If you want to watch live, we love that. You can be in our chat room, irc.twit.tv.  But you can also get on-demand audio and video at twit.tv slash twig or iTunes or any of your  podcatchers, Overcast or Pocket Cast or Dog Catch, whatever it is that you like to use.  We also have great apps thanks to our independent third-party developers. We don't do any  ourselves, but they've done a great job. And you should find those apps on iOS, Android, Windows  phone, Roku. I received a number of emails that we are no longer listed on TiVo. TiVo,  which is a relatively small platform, has its own podcast section. And I guess not never were all  our shows listed there, but a few were. And apparently TiVo has pulled them down. You can  manually enter RSS into that, although I don't know who would want to do that. And I apologize  to those of you who watch us on TiVo. I have no idea. TiVo never asked us ahead of time. They  never told us they were pulling us down. We don't even really know anybody at TiVo.  Tom Rogers. Well, Patrick Delahanty in our programming department, as in our engineering  department says, he is in touch with TiVo about getting it back. It's a weird thing. I don't know  what happened. If you have problems, let me know and I'll email Tom Rogers. You know somebody over

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there? I know the CEO. You think that would help? Try it first. And if you have a problem,  I complained on Twitter once about a broken TiVo box and bingo, Tom was there fixing it.  He came to your house? Well, yeah. With a screwdriver? Yeah, yeah, a butt crack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a service. I am a TiVo, Romeo pro user. I love my TiVo. I've sold the world on TiVos,  so I'm somewhat mortified that TiVo doesn't like me back. All right, well, we'll keep that in mind  and if Patrick doesn't have any success, we'll let you know. Let me know. Thanks for joining us.  We'll see you next time on Twig.
