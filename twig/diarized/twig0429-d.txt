Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That bad it's not it's not high quality queso, but I will say  I've gone to taco cabanet too in the morning and gotten queso  That is only slightly better than that and I would still pay for that now I'm wondering about Jeff

Transcript:  I was I I seriously thought about Wow creating a queso slash mole tumbler and no one sends me  T-shirts about queso in the mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You would deserve it if you had any real taste on queso if you could even tolerate  That drivel that drivel  Then then then then then go running out in the streets screaming about what they did to queso

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It ruined not so again not the best case

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So but definitely not the worst and better than whatever that was you tweeted that did not look good at all

Transcript:  See, I'm just really glad that for some reason  Next thing because either you can't get queso in Northern, California  Chipotle is the first I didn't even know about queso till I went to Austin, Texas and and by the way my reaction was oh my god  Where have you been all my life? I mean no  queso is good, but I'm glad they don't have queso here because it would I would be even fatter than I already am but it's ruined

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was okay. Well, you're not gonna get fat on chipotle queso. That's for sure because it's awesome  Terrible. I liked it there. I thought it was delicious  By the way all the nice things we ever did for Chipotle they ever send us a nice chipotle t-shirt actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but we did have  the  digital marketing guy from Chipotle came to visit the studio and he  He gave us like a bunch of coupons. So oh, oh, yeah. We've got free chipotle for a while  I don't know if the one we had what stays here here last week was free, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they weren't good, but they weren't like they weren't warm. So I shot of the oven or anything  I mean, no, they were stale and they were too thin you need it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need a more substantial chip with a little bit more like that's actually the biggest objection  I had on that bite of queso was the chip  You're diverting

Transcript:  You're diverting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

We're talking about it earlier on windows weekly the best quarterly net revenues in  more than a decade  Apple will have its quarterly results soon. I'm sure they'll be and again  It's been a really really good tech sector quarter and and really  I think we can call it the trump bump because all across the board stocks are up  Uh consumer confidence is up employment is up  He's a damn fine president

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry is jeff's head spinning around. I was trying the case of the queso stuff's even worse

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how bad that is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even worse before the show we were watching and we're i'm still watching uh, the razor phone announcement. This is an interesting, uh,  development I  Razor which is known for gaming accessories and gaming laptops r a z er  This is not the motorola razor. This is a new phone from the gaming company acquired  You may remember nextbit they made they were a crowd sourced phone, which I got and I liked the nextbit robin  Uh, and they acquired that team  Uh, which included some people who'd worked for google on android  And they they developed in house an android tv device called the uya those both those teams worked together to make a  699 phone which they're announcing today, which is a primarily for gaming  Uh, but we'll also have I don't know why the quality is so poor on this. I maybe i've set something wrong on  Let me let me look at the settings quality is auto right now. Let me let me turn it up  Um, this is their keynote in london, which is going on right now. It has a great accent  Yeah, i'm not sure who he is I presume he's the ceo of razor  Uh, they uh, they say will be available november. No reserves reservations are available today  And it'll be shipping november 17th. So this is really interesting  The competition has heated up not just in android  But with i with you know, people who have iphone 8s are now looking at the iphone 10s which come start coming on friday  Uh, and actually I want to talk a little bit about how apple's uh, very interesting apple  Marketing strategy and the way they I think I say although others disagree  We andy and I got in a fight over it yesterday on macbreak weekly manipulated the media that apple press  in an interesting way  But and then google's two new phones the pixel 2 and the pixel 2 xl are out  But now this phone out of nowhere  stock android  It's going to have um  You know a giant 4000 milliamp hour battery which does respond  I think to the people who uh who've been hating  frankly on uh modern phones because of poor battery life  A special screen that gives you 120 hertz resolution. It's a gaming focus on gaming phone and interestingly  They'll use the nova launcher as their launcher  Which I think really in a way is a very good idea  It's the launcher that many android aficionados choose to use instead of pixels the google pixel launcher and others  so  Uh, what what's the main thing that makes it a gaming phone? Uh, the 120 hertz refresh rate  Okay, apple does something similar on ipads. They can get up to 200 hertz. I think on ipads, but it's only when it senses  that it's  Needs it or something. I don't know exactly how it works  It doesn't normally sit there it normally sits at the normal 60 hertz  So this is twice as fast refresh rate. They're really pushing that they bought thx  So it's going to have thx sound  front-facing dual speakers  Uh, they call it the ultimate entertainment phone and it's unlocked 699  Which makes it very competitive?  I think with some of the other it's a unibody aluminum phone with the razor logo on the back dual cameras

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I I don't know whose software they're going to use for the camera. It's a snapdragon 835  It has eight gigs of ram, which is again over, you know way over spec  Micro sd slot no headphone jack  Uh type c charger and there is a dongle that's thx certified in the box for 24 bit sound high res  audio  Which actually is probably a good idea  You know, I don't it's that's a  I don't know an analog jack on the phone isn't maybe the best way to do that. Uh  So this jack what's that? Yeah, what is that? Nobody's doing that anymore  711 although they say oreo before the end of the year  Dual uh  Well a 12 and a 13 megapixel uh cameras on the back one wide angle one zoom and eight megapixel on the front

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why wouldn't they put a headphone jack on this because honestly bluetooth sound qualities

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know they're proving the codex, but I know I mean that's you know, they're pushing the sound  I agree, although, you know, you can hardwire a phone uh headphones into it through their uh, their dongle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but uh, why don't you just take 50 bucks from me now just as a tax?  Roll the dog

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like I feel like such an idiot walking around with my phone with the dongle still hanging on it. It's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, keep the dongle on the headphones. That would be tips number one. Like when I travel I swap between my

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  normal headsets and then noise cancelling headsets  and so  Is it ideal no, but and also  I grabbed the wrong dongle before I like went up to the studio and then I was just

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you can't charge unless you buy the really expensive one

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was I was feeling very  No, I was like tech tech is failing me right now. I agree with the neil a patel who said it's user hostile

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's talking about apple doing it but a good phrase. Yeah, it's user hostile and unfortunately apple and google are doing it  and now so is razor. I mean this has become the uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does the essential if you wanted to know no headphone jack on the essential either

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everyone wanted to buy a pair of headphones with a usbc. Those don't exist, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do but I mean, yeah, I know, you know, good luck finding them. What kind of quality one phone?  I think it was the uh, the essential shipped with usbc headphones  But it mustn't be a standard because I tried them on other devices with usbc ports and there's no audio coming out. Really?  Well, I don't know. I don't know what that means but uh,  Yes  So there you go. That's that's kind of the breaking news today and then the senate is  Having hearings  The house just ended theirs the house ended theirs in the senate now or that was just the house  It was a high. Yes, and it was yesterday house today. I've watched most of both of them  So I do want to talk about that because I think those are interesting. Uh yesterday was the general council for facebook twitter and google  who faced the senate  And really didn't say much but you you probably watched I was busy working so I didn't get to watch you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did they say? What happened? Oh, I mean not much happened. It's just it's just you know  My overall impression is for god help us if these people the government people end up running the internet  um  They're just they're just ignorant. It's just might as well talk about pipes  and tubes  And and a lot of hostility  Uh from both left and right?  To the platforms. It's very easy target right now  Uh, it really struck me how the platform should have come out been way ahead of this and this is this is silicon valley hubris  Um really hurts them. They should have been way ahead of us and set new standards

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's just it was a senate committee, right? Which was it the intelligence committee intelligence committee

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a senate and it was a subcommittee of the senate and I think it was the I think it's the house intelligence committee

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and and the idea is that they want to know well  Did you help russia  Medal in us politics essentially, right? So al franken who went go ahead stacy go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So i've been covering these things for a decade now. So I have watched many a tech  Tech getting raked over the coals by congress members of congress in these hearings. These are not  These are what's what's the word for?  Theater yes, their political theater grandstanding might be the word  They're grandstanding. So the thing to know about this is this is basically  Congress getting to say their talking points in yelling at these companies  This is not going to result in anything substantive what happens substantively  Happens behind closed doors with the lobbyists for these companies and the aides in the senate  You know the aides for the senators and representatives so I would caution folks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From reading too much into this. Let me give you a couple of quotes from yesterday's hearings. This is senator mark warner  Of virginia. I hear all your words, but I have more than a little bit of frustration  That many of us on this committee have been raising this issue the issue of russian  In you know influencing the election since the beginning of this year and our claims are frankly blown off by the leadership of your companies  And dismissed that's true facebook denied it for more than a year  We've raised these claims since the beginning of the year and the leaders of your companies blew us off your earliest presentations  Showed a lack of resources a lack of genuine effort a lack of commitment diane feinstein said  I don't think you get it. What we're talking about is a cataclysmic change  What we're talking about is the beginning of cyber warfare. You have a huge problem  On your hands ron wyden said we'd like to walk out of here knowing the changes you're going to support  senator burr  chairman of the committee  Suggested congress should supply the companies with antitrust waivers  Because of course collaboration might be considered collusion. So they would need you know to have some sort of indemnification

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They already do share

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A lot and said so I now admittedly this you're right. These are talking points senators are grandstanding, but I don't disagree with those points  Do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem is that it's go ahead stacey. No, go ahead. Okay. No, no, no you go you go so  There's there's two things here one is  It looks like  well  One is congress has is pushing all the blame under the tech companies which may or may not be fair  but they're also refusing to  Look at and analyze what it means that these companies are international in scope even though they're based here in the u.s  and so  If they're saying okay, you guys need to do better  To prevent, you know russia from hacking our elections are overly unduly influencing things  They're forgetting that facebook, you know google and twitter may have  Conflicting goals in russia, so I think they're ignoring the real issues here, which I think we should be talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But facebook's participation in in russia doesn't mean that they should allow russians to buy ads in  political ads in america  I understand that when they're in russia, they they have to follow the laws of russia and stuff  But but to but when the when the internet research agency russia's troll factory  spends rubles  To buy ads on facebook influencing the u.s election, which is illegal  How can facebook say? Oh, uh, we didn't know let's talk about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's talk about that because I mean al franken who I generally like, you know use that for major theater to go after about  Rubles rubles rubles. Okay. Well  We you there's five million advertisers a month on facebook. I'm not trying to just defend facebook here facebook needs to do more  But you know, how could this happen? Well, they can't as stacy said it's such theater. You can't actually answer this  Well, you just have to throw yourself on the ground  Brostate and say okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry  I'm sorry

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Facebook says we're doubling doubling from 10 000 to 20 000 the number of people who are involved in doing ferrening this out  But they also said that these this troll factory  Reached 150 million people 150 million americans through facebook million

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I see. No the new number. This is the new number

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was 126 million now leo. Let's talk about a few things here. Let's talk about a few things one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The the ad was bought in rubles  Well, this is an international company that sells things all around the world if they weren't looking for that signal  If they weren't aware that we need to be looking for political ads bought with rubles. They're not going to find that  It's not like oh gee, yeah, somebody's they're looking at all five million advertisers every minute  They had to be aware that this was a problem. They weren't maybe they were stupid. Okay, but but that's point one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But wait a minute  I agree that it's ridiculous to say well, we're gonna play a blame game at this point  What's completely reasonable is for these senators to say well, what are you gonna do now? And it's there's one very simple thing  Which is to add transparency and these companies seem to be more and they're they're saying they're doing that now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they've got to be  I I my standard for transparency is every political ad every political ad buyer and the targeting data for all of them should be public  Yes, and searchable and available. That's what i think they said they're doing  Um that first they didn't I think they are now I don't know  I don't have the latest statement on this but that's my standard for what they need to do  Now mind you there is no required transparency and political advertising in print not on billboards not in direct mail none in robo

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is on broadcast? Oh, okay. So print you don't have to disclose who bought. Oh, I didn't know that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's well, you have to disclose the paper to end up to disclose a thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They should they should change that for newspapers too. No then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is where we're going to get to the first amendment ladies and gentlemen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the first amendment does not protect foreign  governments from interfering in  Our politics that's illegal and it's not protected by the first enforcement fine

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if and if and if a foreign government buys a fake ad is it up to the newspaper to know that that it went through  Five shell companies. No, no, no  If somebody buys a fake ad transparent, that's all  Well, but transparent. Yeah, I know I know and I agree with that. I just said that they should be fully transparent  But let's remember the transparency is also going to be limited because it goes through shell companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're trolls let the let the press do their job  And be transparent and let the press figure it out. We're agreeing and yelling at each other

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um, yeah, well, but but but but  Beware  Putting a legal requirement in this area  I mean broadcast is there because it's our airwaves and all that the rest is a matter of the first amendment in terms of what laws

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Listen if if the good news is newspapers are dying anyway, so we don't really care about print

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  second good news  Second point the fact that they got 126 or 150 million people to see supposedly this stuff from this one  Uh russian fake news factory the ira the internet research agency  um  What does that indicate it indicates that?  A hell of a lot of your neighbors pass this stuff around  It indicated that was that was that wasn't advertising that was the organic  That was that was content that people passed around now bots had a role too. The ads had a role too. All that had a role  But we got a bigger problem here folks, which is that your fellow citizens are passing this crap around

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Point three, I don't think that's as much of a problem  And by the way, i'm looking at the federal election commission's website  And disclaimer notices are required of broadcast  newspaper magazine outdoor advertising mass mailing and telephone banks of the political campaign

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When it is for a candidate wait when it's for a candidate most of this advertising was for issues

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A communication that solicits funds for a federal candidate or federal political committee that contains or that contains express advocacy  Of a political campaign

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I can go advocate for for for equal rights for all human beings, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't have to so that's part of the problem with some of these ads is they don't even mention it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  90% of them 90% of them are and they're trying to sow discord  By by going after after race  The real problem to me is that media?  Need to learn a lesson here our you know, we just still say oh come come and read our articles. We'll we'll wait for you over here  While the bad guys are using facebook and company natively well see that's why I don't even mind us how to use them natively

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't I don't think it really matters so much about print because the real problem is these pro programmatic ads that are bought  and automatically displayed  the kind of  granularity  Uh that can happen and the fact that they're dark ads, you know  If it adds in a newspaper everybody sees it but dark ads are shown only to specific people and no one else sees them  So really it is it's an internet problem more than it is. It's also no, it's robust direct mail

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's been the case ever since direct mail. Yeah, I guess direct mail would be the same, right?  right  So so i'm not i'm not taking facebook off the hook  What i'm saying is that facebook and twitter and google should set a standard far beyond that of broadcast  They have a public responsibility. They should have been ahead of this  The only reason they're sitting there is because they they the hubris of silicon valley said oh, we don't have a problem  We don't have a problem zuckerberg said we don't have a problem  They had a problem and they should have been out front saying this is what we know  This is what we don't know and we're being manipulated  They could have been the story the russians could have been the story rather than them. So they messed up big time  i'm not defending them there, but  But my bigger point is when you listen to these dorks ignorant fools in congress  I dread what they do to the internet trey gowdy was just on in the in the house hearing  Pushing hard against the platforms against facebook. Well, if I say it's thursday and it's not how should that be allowed?  Uh, well our lies constitutionally protected and the facebook lawyer says, uh, yes  The supreme court has actually said yes because the adult doesn't get our own constitution  If lies are not allowed then whether it's a court or it's facebook or it's trey gowdy says this is a lie  And you can't say that that's a limitation on speech from a government level  And our own member of congress doesn't understand

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  although there's a long history of  Congress not understanding the first amendment going right back to the amen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So to me the basis for the whole story is you don't want these people controlling the internet  So facebook platforms google facebook get your damned axe together and get ahead of them. Otherwise  They're gonna be on your asses regulating our net

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I would like to see I feel like I should applaud you jeff there but um, what I would like to see  Well, no, it's more just like very impassioned very impassioned, um, I would like to see a database that  Maybe all of these I mean the federateds the outbrains facebook, etc feed into with political ads  Like a database that says hey this ad and gives the context or the article or the whatever  Was paid for  And promoted put it in a database somewhere or make it put it somewhere and make it  Basically accessible via an api so reporters could actually go in and look at trends

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a great idea so do it across all of these platforms the problem is not every ad is political stacey  I mean ads that sway the election are necessarily overtly political

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we can see I mean we've got to start somewhere  I would say the things to look out for and the  The language that you'd pay attention to if anyone tried to create something like this would be  How do we define what makes it in there? Right? Is it paid advertisement?  How do we define an issue but two how do we make sure that it's open because I can see facebook  Creating something like this in house  And I would love for me company's not I mean, you can't file a foyer request with facebook. So how do you make it? Do you get?  How do you make it really easily accessible?  and I feel like honestly  Our government is falling so far behind when they're thinking about legislation when we just look at their open records requests when they look at their  digitization efforts  And I think these are very interrelated  In those kind of tools we blame the media a lot  But what facebook has done and what russia and everyone took advantage of is the fact that we can scale up  falsehoods and  Microtarget them in a way that the media can't even  Track so we can't the fourth estate as it were can't do its job because it doesn't have  The same ability so I would like to see the creation of that and then reporters getting good at using those tools and  In congress making it easier  And academics academics are  Doing some really good things. Um  And they they work around. I mean they they reverse engineer a lot of this stuff actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't want to just see the ads. I very importantly. I want to see the targeting  Data. Yes. So who's being targeted with what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Messages facebook has said and this is their post from october 27th a couple of days ago  uh  additional transparency for all advertising  Not just political ads all advertising all our starting next month people will be able to click on view ads on a page  And view the ads of pages running on facebook instagram and messenger whether or not the person viewing is the intended target audience  That's a good step. Yeah, that's that's a that's a big step. Yep  All pages will be part of this effort  Uh, and we require that all ads be associated with a page  So in other words this covers every ad so there's no ads that are not parts of a page  They're going to start this in canada roll it out. This goes beyond broadcast. This is a big this is a big deal

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  um  If they'd done this before they were called before congress if they'd done this before there was a law proposed  Uh, they would have they would have beaten her in the punch not that the congress still wouldn't want to you know  Make hay out of beating them up, but they could have been in a much stronger position

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And by the way, I don't think any legitimate advertiser would have any complaint against this  If you're as in this example jasper's market and somebody comes to your page and says i'd like to see all the ads from jasper's market

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing wrong with that. Well, well, you know, here's here's the thing if you are  um a consumer brand  Packaged brand let's say advertiser and you're trying to ab test

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, come on this isn't that's not gonna affect your ab testing. That's too small  Who's gonna do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Only people who are your competitors. I know the argument the argument the brands will be the competitors will go and they all have  Sophisticated ways to find out what's going on blah blah blah blah. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what that improves competition? I agree with you. I agree with you. This is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We need to figure out how to instill trust  And transparency is the first step to trust and we've got to be aggressive about it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So is there more do you guys both agree? This is a not only a good first step  But this might be all facebook needs to do and twitter and google should do the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would like to make sure that it's accessible to everyone. I would like to be able to pull this data in easily

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like the api idea. I agree internet api. Yeah, but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you can't scrape these pages for example, a lot of sites don't let you scrape legally  So if I wanted to actually aggregate  meaningful data across facebook, I would have to use a scraper and  You know run through all these ad pages and that would be both against their terms of service  and time consuming as a reporter, so  There's  I would like just a step further. I would like just that little step to make it easier to aggregate this and I know that  people on the web hate that but that's kind of  They're using it's using the same tools they do to police them basically as in the media

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let me ask you both both another question, um, just lip is testing here so jackie spire, uh  representative from california  all but  Ordered google to pull rt off of youtube  What do you think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So talk about that

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't believe the government should dictate what content makes it on what platforms so twitter pull down face

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter fold down sputnik and rt, right?  Yeah  um  Because those are  widely considered  propaganda arms of the russian government

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but but  um  and and I and I can't stand them and I and I and I've been asked to be on rt and I refuse and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, so I think they're awful. You could make the argument that fox news is a propaganda arm of the u.s. Government  So I I don't think that should that I agree with you that this yeah, that's troubling

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and I wonder by the way the precedent we said here that that I I tweeted this and nobody's answered  I wonder whether uh voice of america and the state department and the cia also probably advertise. Yeah  deutsche vella bbc have international outreach  Putin can consider the bbc propaganda for democracy. Yeah  Uh, we set my point is the precedents we set are dangerous and in the hearings  From both sides. I'm not doing false balance here, but I heard from both was basically a another  way to demonize  foreigners

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it foreign? Oh, yeah, there shouldn't be allowed. So the fact that no we'd be more international  So fox is protected because they're a domestic operation. They're protected by the first amendment is is rt protected by the first amendment. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because it's out of the russia is it? Um, well, no, they have an operation here, right? No, no, they're they're they're they're they're protected by the first amendment  Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so why is or what representative spear suggests is a  violation of the constitution

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, if she if she makes it happen. Yes, it is now if if youtube decides to take it down on its own  Then no, that's youtube youtube can youtube has the right to edit editing  They can do that private entity can do that. But now we have congress pressuring  youtube what they should and shouldn't put in their platform

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and we should underscore that what stacy described is an api so that the press that all of this transparency is meaningless  Unless we have a strong free press  Because we expect the the press to do the homework and reveal  Because no one I mean maybe an individual will do it  But but then they become the press in effect so that that's the strong free press is important  So you don't want to see it undermined even to the point where they say well  We're going to ban propaganda arms for foreign nations. No  And and the other the other you could brand it a propaganda arm and let you know, let people decide let people decide

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you also have to I mean the strong free press also has to be better at doing its job  And I know I harp on my own people here, but but somebody has to um  I go back to the 150 million 120 650 million people  We don't  Take our journalism to where the people are the manipulators do  We don't inoculate the public against the lies that we know are going to come from the manipulators. Yeah, they have to come to you still  Yeah, yeah, and and so there's a real problem here in the in in the in the architecture and structure  of that fourth estate  around I don't think people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's a part of the problem, but I do think the good stories make it out to the people  But I also think that journalists are kind of  We're not in in some ways we're not doing our jobs. We are not learning how to  Access data widely we are not learning how to write compelling stories  I mean, I love 5 30 5 38  But my god, some of their stuff is so didactic. I'm like good kill me now  Um  So we have to as journalists figure out how to pull the data  And turn it into a compelling story. We know the story. I mean journalists were aware of  Russian influence on facebook in the elections, right?  They just couldn't figure out how to get the data they needed to tell that story and it was very much a data oriented story  and  I this is  I I feel like there are some j schools that are not doing a great job  At teaching journalists how to think this way  I think journalists often in newsrooms don't have the time to allocate towards training people and making them better and there's also the mentality of  You know just send people click farming basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, so that's the that's the larger problem is the business model which motivates us to go for clicks  Not for understanding not for value and even you know, I was at a world economic forum event today and i'm also  There was a time when we said let's get past clicks to get to attention attention will be good  People realize that no attention is just as corrupting and just as bad  What are the metrics? What are the goals of media and journalism? What are we here to do?  We have a big truth to power  We can't just amen. We can't just blame  What I fear is happening is we're blaming the technology companies and the technology companies being hubristic and being  secretive  Are are bringing it on themselves, but there's going to be danger to  The internet number one because government's going to come in and do stupid stuff and number two  We're not looking at ourselves in an honest mirror and seeing what we have to do what role we have  I think we need a truth and reconciliation commission  for media and platforms  After this election not because trump got elected but because the quality of discourse in this country is suffering badly  We all have a role in it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I would I would also say that journalists  I mean the tech media is not great because we tend to  laud tech companies but  Journalists need to I mean like I don't know a single journalist out there who when you mention an oil company  Doesn't immediately assume that they're being lied to about many things if it comes from like an oil company executive  But they hear facebook say something and to a point  This is better, but they think oh, okay. Yeah facebook. So I think there's also a lack of  And we were too trusting we were like, oh facebook you got to do this yourselves, but really as a journalist you just gotta see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what's happening? I think we're I think we're going I think we we we we're we're getting an overreaction the other way now  We're getting a a downright moral panic. My god has been talking about how we're in a moral panic right now  Which he defines is when the public isn't really upset but media and politicians try to convince them they should be upset  That's a moral panic look at the new york times yesterday, which I thought had a horrendous piece  Which was how to fix facebook number one. That's the new york times saying facebook is broken  I don't think most of the users think it's broken number two  Seven out of the nine ideas in it were just absolutely absurd and stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's take a break I might I might want to look at what's wrong with facebook and what the nine experts farhad manju and kevin ruse  Who both of whom are tech journalists, right? And some of the ideas were good, but some of the ideas were really awful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  That is actually a saucepan. Okay. All right. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, this is this is horrible i'm following this right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  follow  Anyway, anyway, anyway stacy was sighing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, how do we oh, yeah the side let's let's not go there. Let's let's move on from moving on because how to fix facebook  Farhad has become farhad has become a a moral panic person. His his new book is called the frightful five

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The entire guardian is the entire guardian. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's oh i'm glad you told me that because I agree the guardian has now become technology is ruining the world. Let's stop it  Kevin kelly who is a good person to ask of of wired magazine and a great writer  Told farhad facebook should reduce anonymity by requiring verification of real names for real people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How often can we argue this case?  Yeah, how often do we remind people that anonymity is necessary for people who are vulnerable?  It's easy for a white man in america to say everyone should put their real names out there  It's not so easy for a gay man in certain african countries. You'd like this one though. Uh, stacy elie paris or

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  author of the filter bubble  And chief executive of upworthy. Okay  Uh says, uh facebook should open itself up for independent research  In effect the api that you were talking about and I think that would be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, not just that but also how it  runs its uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Various feeds and walls and whatnot, but that's a lot to ask a private company  That's like saying coca-cola should give up its recipe so we know what we're drinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they could make it available just to academic researchers  But they could limit it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Then it's what  It's hard to control it and you got to tell the academic researcher what they're not allowed to say about it  Right  I mean, I want to i'm trying to get them to give up more data. I think you're absolutely right. That's that's that's key  It's going to lead to trust it's going to be good for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's complicated. Yeah, and the press ask a private business to do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything is complicated now and you know what? We're always we always say it's complicated and we shrug or we say  Oh my god, this law will never happen. We can't handle all this  You know the repercussions are unimaginable. So let's not do anything. I'm like guys  We live in a complicated age. Yeah, let's  Let's sit down and figure this out. I know I would love to go and be in office just to just to be like, okay  This is crazy. This is a morass. Let me make some unpopular decisions and  Then leave

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The last one is the one that killed me what it does though

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and then i'll we'll get to the last one that what it does is uh  It says it acknowledges that facebook is not a traditional business that its impact on society is not the same as coca-colas  That it has, you know that it has it has some  You know higher responsibility. I don't think that that's false. I admit facebook probably doesn't want that to be how it's seen  But don't you think it's true stacy that facebook has so much influence  That it that it that it maybe has to have and google and well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is the argument that people made about television or things like showing uh,  Cartoons not cartoons  Television and ads to kids are regulated. That's that's where I was going with this  And that brought us legislation about you know, how much air time that you could devote to ads to kids and a good thing so  Yeah, I agree  Me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's what tim wu says and I guess this is what you're talking about jeff now  Maybe you disagree with this facebook should become a public benefit corporation

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now, I don't have any facebook stock, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As a shareholder you might not like that is that what you're saying. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah  Or an employee. I mean this this is this this notion that  communist that  Um, oh profits bad profits the root of all evil  So if we just get rid of some of the profit then it'll be okay. Yeah  Or or above, you know from from the tau researcher  Let's get rid of the emotions now. I've asked for more  You know instead of just the emoticons are there  It would be nice to have I think that's smart or something like that as one  But facebook is about relationships relationships are emotions just because people are exporting emotions doesn't make all emotions bad  And let's get rid of emotions. It's just baby and bath water is being thrown out nine times there

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  or seven times how about rocana who is a  california member of congress  Who says uh facebook we want more transparency. You should explain your newsfeed algorithms work  Well, but then explain how you use data and targeting  Uh, you should say how you make decisions about third party verification and removing offensive content that I agree with right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's some more transparency. Yes, I think I think you know  What does that define the the old open up your algorithm is really meaningless

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and that's like opening up coke's secret recipe only more so um, yeah, delina schiller makes a similar point about transparency

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I absolutely agree with that but it matters about the newsfeed algorithm

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is avail is really visible, which is what is the outcome?  And anybody who reads the newsfeed can see the outcome and you could decide for yourself  Whether or not you want to read everybody's outcome is different  No, do you have that's right? You have to decide for yourself. Am I seeing what I want to see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I should mention this. Uh, well first we're talking about facebook  I should give the standard full disclosure is that I started the news integrity initiative  Which got substantial funding from facebook craig newmark and the ford foundation  I see I sound like i'm one of those guys at the end of the commercial is telling you what they really have the point  But I also had on tuesday last tuesday  I had an event at cuny where adam asari the head of newsfeed at at at facebook came in and talked for an hour privately with  Audience development people and then we had a public event where facebook presented a booklet that they actually printed  Which tries to tell news organizations how they need to be smart in using newsfeed which is a form of transparency  It's trying to tell you what works what doesn't  Um, you know, it's trying to put it in a form that they want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, let's move on to something more less interactive i'm tired of facebook, but hey, I got something super controversial, okay  Well, yes  I think what do we think about the google docs drama?  What's the not about queso?  So some people yesterday, I believe it was yesterday. Oh, is oh, no, maybe it's monday  I'm like, where are we in the week?  but their google docs they found themselves locked out of their google docs because  They violated google's terms of service  and  This was really interesting because  Yeah  People were like wait what google's reading my docs and then wait what google could just lock me out of my you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is based on the content of the docs  Yeah, that's what they check for certain things. So if I write a short story  That has hate speech in it  as because the the antagonist is hateful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could conceivably store it there. No, but if you share it  Ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you're distributing as a reporter, I mean I share I write stuff in google docs and  You know share it with all kinds of people my editors my copy team, whatever whoever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So according to mashable national geographic reporter rachel bale  Was locked out of a draft of a story. She was writing about wildlife crime

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the new york times articles so  So  It's ai  So google says it's an error and they fixed it. Yeah  Yes, but they they said it was one of the experts the new york times quoted said it was google's using advanced machine learning and  Other ai technologies to examine vast amounts of information in real time says greeting your docs  Right, but so it could be an error in the way the ai was  Created like all the other sad aiers like remember tay for microsoft or

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Google's photos that hated black people but it reveals that google's reading your docs, which I yeah, that's a that's the yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We knew they were reading them for the purposes of advertising really  Well, those are mail. They're not even reading my mail anymore, but they're not even  You're right. You're right. They weren't yeah reading our google docs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is interesting. Like I wanted to know is this everyone or is this also like like I have a  What is it called the google admin the account you pay for?  So I have a paid google account and some professional companies do this as well  And if I were if my internal docs and memos were being scanned by google  That would be if after I paid google. This is not again the freestyle these people with

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  chrome books  Are giving everything that's on that chrome book to google for their perusal  That's pretty weird  I don't know. It's not by a human. No, I understand. It's machine  So I yeah, that's the moral panic when people say somebody's reading your mail, but it's not somebody something  but still  and  They can lock you out whether by accident or intentionally  You don't own that doc. They own that doc. That was what I thought was most

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Disturbing slash something we should probably that's one of those complicated things. We should probably figure out  um  google says this was an error they changed a rule and it automatically flagged a lot of people but

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's what google says they said this yesterday  Technically, we don't read files instead. We use an automated system of pattern matching to scan for indicators of abuse  Though it can identify clusters of data that might suggest a violation. The system does not pull meaning from the content  according to a company spokesman, so what that means is  In effect, they're doing a grep  for hateful words  And if the if the n-word is in your doc  They don't look at what's which is frankly even worse. They don't look at what's surrounding it  They just say oh you're using the n-word a lot in there. That's hate speech  Which is obviously dangerous  Yeah, I mean, okay, so they're not looking at the meaning or context of what you're reading

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem if you're if you're well, it's the same problem that when when google  We've talked about this in the show when google started accounting for the authority reliability and quality of sources  Trying to get hate speech out of  Search results search ranking. Well, guess what happened some liberal sites that were complaining about hate found themselves demoted

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the problem with algorithmic solutions like this, yep, but this is very concerning I don't uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow, I hate like to get locked out of a document I mean imagine  And to not and we all know that google is pretty sucky when it comes to trying to solve problems quickly for you, right?  No one's  No one's like oh google you're so awesome at customer service  So I I think this probably leads to dear god google  So many people depend on your things. You got to make your customer service better because yeah  The  A lot of people are like, oh the lesson to take away from this is, you know computers are reading your documents or that  What is it oh gosh, I forgot the other lesson  Okay, you don't own something

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That if you're going to create something whether it's a photo or a article or a short story you should put it somewhere you own

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or all this stuff should be encrypted and nobody can read it. Yeah, if you encrypt it now the government

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nobody chromebook doesn't really well, I guess it does you could put there's a mini lock for instance a mini lock chrome extension  You could in theory save locally  Run it through mini lock and then put it on your google drive

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, one's going to do that. No, no, no, it would have to be designed by google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, they have a chrome extension that's not designed by google. It's called mini lock

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called mini lock. No, i'm saying if you're going to make it easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Yeah, but that yeah  But my question so their terms of service say you're not allowed to post hate speech and other stuff, but i'm not posting it  I'm writing a private document. Let's just share it the question is if you share it. So this is all if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See I I could I think that if you made something public via google docs and it had hate speech and google was put in a position of  Of distributing that I can see google saying oh no  We have some right to to not be the vehicle for this  but  That's hard enough to imagine. I please that  But it has no different in a sense from saying that hate speech doesn't belong on facebook or twitter  um  So so google as publisher blogger or google docs publishing  I get that but anything short of that anything that's mine and I share it with you leo and we have a private relationship  And you asked to see my short story  No, google should not be inserting itself in there now the next period is what's google doing not just for itself  In its own liability. What's it doing in terms of government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bail by the way says that her account access was restored yesterday  Google says it was a bug  But it still raises to me this very interesting issue. And of course  One response is well, you shouldn't have your only copy of anything on google  Don't write in the cms. Yeah, and so yeah, right don't write in the cms  And so rachel's fact says that's she's not going to do that anymore. She's not going to write on google docs  Although if you're in a chrome book and you're I mean, that's all you can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can write everything in google docs. Yeah, or maybe not everything. I write a lot of things. I mean because like  What word if I don't have to use word? Yay and use it in years

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But now maybe you should use word because at least you own your document  Of course, by the way microsoft word by default now sells sends saves your documents to one drive  Yeah, which probably has a similar

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Policy, it's bad enough that there was a document the fact that they shut down her entire account  And as stacy just said they're not exactly responsive

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do they oh interesting uh nick fountain who does a podcast says his podcast script  He does he's a producer of planet money  Says his podcast script was blocked by google. That's an npr product for god's sake planet money has no hate speech on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a news organization founded its account blocked because of what google read in the script. That's google  guys  wise up  This is why you're sitting in washington sweating

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and if you're gonna do something like this, maybe don't do it to journalists because yeah, I guess you're gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  Well, it's interesting how many journalists use google docs we use google you use google we use google docs

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the best for editing because the comet system is real. I mean, it's it's really nice  Which is I share all the time  right, I mean I kevin and I share and we prefer I mean our other option is  Who's gonna send word documents back and forth? I can set you up. I could set you up. Uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You probably could use github and adam  I mean, it's because it's gonna commit to github. So you have this other good god. No, no

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you say the words github, I know you don't like that either. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't have they have some there's some issues at github as well

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so I thought that story was worth talking about because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now i'm wondering what i'm gonna do with my pixel book you want it?  Oh jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're still gonna use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, you got it  Oh, let's take a break jeff's gonna demonstrate his new chrome book. His pixel book has come mine comes next week  My pencil game you already talked about your phone last week. Did you get you got it right? No, I don't know but uh,  Actually, this is an interesting. Oh, you got your which phone is that the xl the pixel xl too  Oh, well, I want you to talk then you have many things to talk us to us about  Uh, I have mine doesn't come I got a I got the panda one the black and white one with the orange button  So i'm not gonna get it for weeks  You have the case I got the case I get it the pencil for the pixel book is coming tomorrow  But  But uh, well i'm glad you got yours. I don't know why i'm not getting mine because talk about it  we did roughly the same thing but uh  Jason howell got his pixel 2 xl  And I was I thought the screen looked pretty washed out. I did not think it was it's not a good looking screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a problem. Nope, it's a problem. All right. All right, let's save that hold that thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And yeah, I mean, uh  There are solutions that you can use people are pointing out next cloud  I use a synology nasa where it stores all my documents locally and it has google docs style  uh  Collaboration features with somebody else so there are ways you could roll your own

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's there an easy way to do an automated, uh, a sync with google docs  So I have we talked about in the past many times I wouldn't matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wouldn't do it with google docs. I would do it with something else. Do you have to do it with google docs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, i'm just all invested in google docs. Yeah. Well, maybe that's why i'm thinking

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's time time not to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff it's time to change change your ways. No, not writing the cms

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did oh malik tell you that is lightweight like one of okay, that's like journalism 101 these days

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, never write to the cms  I've written in so many platforms  And that's always yeah, you should write it locally and then paste it into the cms  Yes, although that comes with its own problems. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, actually that's why a some sort of hybrid solution where you write locally that it automatically syncs to a cms would be interesting  One way syncing or something. Hey, by the way our show today brought to you by literally  our 10 gigabit  Symmetric fiber internet from sonic. I love sonic  And I love our high-speed internet now. They're not I suppose if you're a business in the sonic  Area you could get 10 gigabit  But you probably don't need 10 gigabit. How about residential gigabit?  1000 megabytes  per second  For 40 a month  What?  Everybody should have sonic and sonic's rolling out more and more of northern california the north bay area here the east started  They started up here east bay area san francisco  Listen to what you get for 40 a month 15 email accounts a gigabyte of storage personal web hosting  With a new domain you get home phone service with unlimited local and long-distance calling fax line service  It's easy to port your existing number over so you don't lose your phone number  And gigabit 1000 megabits per second for only 40 a month  And oh by the way, it's the best internet service provider in the country all green checks according to the electronic frontier foundation  Because they stand up for privacy  They have they never cap bandwidth  friendly local customer support  And a price that just is unbelievable one of the things I love about talking about sonic  I know a lot of you can't get it  But it just shows you it's possible. And so what you're paying  For your internet service that's much more expensive and much less performing  Is ridiculous. There's it doesn't have to be this way  And sonic's customer advocacy paves the way for a better internet everywhere in the united states. So  Please if you are lucky enough and you can find out easily by going to sonic s-o-n-i-c dot com slash twit  Give them your address.

Yeah, I did. How'd you get it so soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, just because I don't know. I guess i'm just important and loved. Yeah good. And do you like it? How long have you had?  Yeah, I mean, it's it's it's beautiful. I went to a best buy before and so I could I could you know  Just see it. They have them there. It's it's it's it's lovely. Um, it does look pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got that same styling that the pixels have with the kind of the clear top glass

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The keyboard has a nice has a nice travel as they say it does. Oh good  Yeah, I can't figure out the screen size is a little bit  Different in the sense that when I use tweet deck i'm getting you know, i'm getting less on the screen. Yeah, because it's it's uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Two by three by two or yeah, I think it's three by two. It's not a wide screen. So that's  That's fine. I prefer that frankly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like, um, I was used to what it was. Uh, all that's fine. It's nice  I mean, you know, it's not like the thing about chromebook is that is the the hardware is the hardware the software is the same  You know, there's no change in life

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, um, it doesn't have the light the colored light on it anymore, right? It doesn't have that much to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the power the power brick  Is oh look how small that is. Oh, that's really nice really nice. I want to get a few of those. Um,  The only of course I got to complain about everything is that's what I do. Um,  so  What I wanted to do was to surprise you and just and and and and halfway through the show say i am on skype on my  New pixel book, but I didn't do that to you. Oh, thank you. Uh, I saw carson was on vacay  I don't know who's at the board today with that. That wouldn't be fair. Um, it's josh. So I try to get skype operating. Yeah  Uh, and I cannot tell you what torture torture it is google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, are you doing the android skype or the web skype?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no android skype web skype  And the problem is that of course it's an app. It's a g-suite account  And trying to install apps on g-suite because it acts like i've got to go to you know, um  the vice president or something or else in my company, which is me  and um  And and and so I thought well it's going to download all the apps will be fine  No on this for some reason it said the up the the the permissions had to be updated on half the apps including skype  And it just says go to play to do it. I couldn't find where to do it  I I tweeted last night. I was screaming  I called google they left me on hold for 20 minutes. I finally hung up when I figured it out  I finally figured out how to get to  The app and then you'd never know what to click on  I only did it by five or six different ways where I managed to click on the app  To get to the page that tells me that it needs things to be updated where I could click some of this is  Microsoft's fault. I might point out. No, it's not skype. This is all all the android apps  Oh, it is android apps through g-suite. It's just a nightmare of nightmare of nightmares  and so um  I can't rely on being able to remember again because it's there like there are like 80 steps  Figure it out. I've gone crazy, but it's designed to do everything you want to do  So that's what we know that aside. It is a lovely machine. It is lighter than the old one. It is sleek. It looks pretty the silicon  wrist  palm palm pads

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really feel good now. Have you tried tethering it to your pixel 2 yet?  Because it spoke but remember that was one of the features automatic tethering right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a grandfathered at&t account which will let me tether

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't done when I get mine. Uh, but supposedly if you just come you don't have to go through all this  You could just say oh I see a hot spot on your phone. I'll use that for the internet. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they don't offer an lte version which which still pisses me off, but that's life  So no, I love the machine. It seems very very nice  It is expensive, but it's sleek and beautiful and thin and wonderful and it's a chrome book, which I love  nice  And then I have pixel 2 xl  2 xl, um  Which feels good in the hand. It's very nice. Uh, you know again, it's so it's so weird that  I had two pixel xls because I kind of thought I'd ruin one but turns out I didn't so I was going to send that one in  For a $400 thing and then right before I'm ready to send it in the screen went black and it won't come back. Hi  So 400 bucks goes away  So this one the the the I compared my working pixel  XL with pixel xl 2 because I have the same screen saver the same stuff very washed out  on the new one, um  Second problem is that the I don't know if it's a burn in or a temporary image  But if you if you if you go to something like looking at all your apps  So the whole screen goes white and you're scrolling you see the line and the and the home buttons  Instantly, it's not doesn't take time to do this again. That may be temporary. I don't know  But wait a minute. You're saying you have burn in already. Oh, yeah, but i'm not sure it's but I saw some reference  I'm not sure it's burn in burn in it could just be image retention on the screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or as google calls it differential aging if you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you get it  After a while just go the best way to see it is to go is to scroll up to see all your apps, right?  Yeah, and then when I do that I can see I see a shadow line. Oh, man

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm thinking this phone is is is jinxed that this is not a good phone. It's not a good phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The screen is probably i'm really eager for you to get yours and see  What you think?  uh, yeah, so so um  But it's you know, it's fast with the battery  Sure, everybody's been raving about um, first day. I was home all day. So it was fine  Second day. Uh, I was at 10 in the morning. I was at 60  I don't know what the heck it was running and I don't like tilt bays  40 loss by 10 a.m  Today, it's okay today. It's so I don't know what I was running  Uh right now. It's a 61 at you know, whatever this is 10 at night though

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm glad I didn't trade in my pixel my pixel xl my old pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This sounds very disappointing. I don't know. I mean, there's nothing wrong with it. It's a fine phone. Is it worth a thousand dollars?  probably not  Um, it has issues google google, you know for this phone that was going to be there a special thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They should have taken more care with this. Hey, what's wrong with it? I think they got a terrible screen  It's always really when I looked at jason's it felt so washed out now. I know they're going to push out new settings  But how's the camera camera's good, but you don't care about that. Yeah, it is  The blue when you turn is very noticeable. You're not gonna see that. Yeah a lot of OLED screens do that. I'm used to that  It doesn't bother me  Um, i'm gonna stick i'm gonna stick with my note eight. Maybe the note eight is the is the phone to get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not screaming about it or anything  But yeah, if I had two working pixels xls as I did a week ago, you might go back  I might I might it's a lot of money  That's where I am

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like my normal pixel my small pixel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're still happy  We should say that stacy has a pixel to  The smaller one and you're very and by the way, I apologize because last week I was acting as if it's not an oled screen  It is it's not an lcd screen. I don't know what I was thinking  It is an oled screen, but it's an amoled screen not a p oled screen, which makes me think it might be a samsung  Uh screen, I don't know. Yeah, but I like it looks good still

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It works  Wow  What else did you order pixel buds either of you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did I won't get mine though  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For I think they come at the end of november. Yeah mine too. Um

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um cj's suggesting that and I don't know how you feel about this jeff  But I am signed up for the android beta on my old pixel and I guess I will sign up for a beta on x  The 2 xl because 81 which is out now has apparently  some uh some screen fixes  Automatic or choices, uh, don't know probably both  Probably both  Um, and of course the iphone 10 is coming out on friday, but you're not an iphone user  You're not because everybody seems to say that  iPhone screen is fabulous. Although apple and I was curious what you would think about this you journalists  I got poo pooed on mac break weekly for my thoughts  But what but it was really interesting this year apple did the most manipulative thing i've ever seen apple do maybe any tech company do  they  Parced who got phones when whose embargoes were lifted when in a way in a detailed way i've never seen before steven levy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was among that was really interesting. Yeah, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there were there were a handful of people who got their iphone 10s last week  But it was a small number steven. Levy was one david pogue ed baghe did not  um  Mashable's lance ulanoff did which I thought was interesting  Uh, he's not your usual suspects buzzfeed nicol and when it buzzfeed did  uh  But the wall street journal did not joanna stern got did not she got a one day wonder  So a number of people got a week ahead. That's not unusual  when the first iphone came out was only the big four steven levy david pogue ed baghe and um,  Uh fourth one. I can't remember a walt mossberg  Uh were the four from the and they were from the usa today newsweek  Uh wall street journal and the new york times they were from the big press. That's 10 years ago boy  We've changed a lot in 10 years  Newspapers gotten as far as I could tell no advance  But weirdly even the people who got it a week ahead of time were embargoed till tuesday  Steven levy was the only one that was only embargoed till monday. He got a 24-hour lead  On everybody so he got the hate that  Well, okay, that's not that's not all a number of youtubers got phones  But also but a lot of big publications did not get phones  And I think joanna stern didn't get one initially the the biggest upset was john gruber of daring fireball  Who's carried out a lot of water for apple?  Yeah, did not get anything and he later he did marcus did marquez brownlee because he's a youtuber  So they favored youtubers a youtube site called high snow bioty  did  So it was really apple really parsed it finally clearly they had marketing  Goals like reaching out to young people and youtube youtubers and stuff like that  But they were very but but some people got it for to for instance neil ipotel of the verge big  I mean, I don't think there's anybody bigger in this business got it for one 24-hour period  Which  Has the further effect and this is to me the most damaging thing of forcing all of these people to do a review  within 24 hours  That's wrong  So all so almost all the reviews that we saw with the exception of levy matthew panzerino  Nicole went a few people had it for a week were based on having the phone for less than a day  It's not long enough to test a phone not long enough to test battery life  Not long enough to look for burn in and other issues with the screen not long enough really even to to to test face id  and to see how it changed over time and different lighting it was  and so  There are some who thought that including some analysts who thought apple must be hiding something. It was it was that weird  So I thought this was I now apple's right to do it they have a right to do it they you know, that's what happens  I thought it was offensive not to the people who didn't get phones but offensive to the public  Yes, who have a right to good solid well  planned reviews  And didn't get them. So stacey, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um  many things one  I hate when I mean any reporter hates when a company  Offers an embargo on something and then somebody else actually has an earlier embargo  That's total crap in most company and most reporters  If they can they will try to refuse to work with companies that work that way. Yeah, you can't right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't say no to this is this is a thing. I mean like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When we were at giga ohm and again at fortune we saw a bump every time the apple reviews came around  So you saw a huge bump in your traffic and we're talking  You know  Million page view kind of days, you know, those those were not crazy and that's all tied to apple  So that's a it's hard to say no to that. I think I don't think it's wrong for apple to go after this audience  I don't know if they're hiding something or they're just like  Seeing an opportunity to change the way that reviews are done  and it's possible  When you go and give your phone to a youtuber who  May be really enthusiastic about technology. They may also be good at it. They may not  Offer the same  Tests that a historical reviewer like somebody who's done it forever. I'll go a step farther. I think they may be much more susceptible

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To bias or they're basically being bribed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's that's true. I mean stephen levy is the  Shiniest happiest journalist I swear out there. He's a smart man, but my god  I've never seen him write anything negative about the companies he covers  so  In  His publication, I mean  Back channel medium now part of wired  That's just weird. Um, so yeah, I  I don't like it  But it's up to the establishment to say okay, you know what screw you apple we're not taking your product at all most

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Most apple coverage is almost fawning and big publications like recode were forced were  Limited. I mean you don't want to miss those those views  So they're limited to writing review of the reviews

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean companies have done this sort of thing they punish people all the time apple's a very vindictive company this way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, I mean I I  And that's one of the reasons it's challenging for me to talk about this or anybody or john gruber because then they get you get labeled  A whiny a whiner and I don't I don't expect a review unit from apple or and I don't take review units from any company  Uh, I buy all my phones because I don't want mostly because I don't want to have anything to do with these pr people  Uh, so I I wasn't bit by this because I wouldn't they didn't offer and I didn't accept but i'm clearly on apple's  You know what list yeah?  Uh, and because i'm not and not sufficiently reverent. I don't know  uh  The fact that john gruber didn't get one and I you know this who knows why but it might have something to do with the fact  That from day one, he said the notch is ugly and a bad idea  Uh, he's normally very reverent

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it could just be apple changing it up and saying, you know what?  I want like I actually so this is this is stories  This is not actual data, but I was hanging out in watching my daughter  She she was testing for her black belt. So there were lots of like teenagers and  young smartphone owners  And most of them were saying really there was this conversation I was listening in on  And they were talking about how the iphone 6 is the best. They it's got a headphone jack. They're all excited  They're like glad about that. They were like talking about the x and they're like  It's so expensive. It doesn't seem like it would be useful and even my parents don't want it  So I thought that was kind of interesting  because apple does seem to be doing a harder sell around this phone than  Normal, but it is a new phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you look at the reviews too, I mean all the people who had it early. I mean, maybe it's a great phone  Nicole and wen says simply put face id is really effing impressive, but that's because it's invisible  um  You know my friend, uh renee richie who got the 24 hour, uh phone  Says the best product apple has ever made  um, you know, I mean I  It's digital trends. Should you buy it?  Our tentative response is yes  We can't peel our eyes away from the gorgeous oled screen and using gestures to move around ios is pure bliss  The verge one day they had it the iphone is clearly the best iphone ever made  Uh and on and on and on  Are the reviews all positive? Yes  Does it deserve all positive views? I don't know  I'll let you know when I get mine in a couple of weeks  but uh  I just  It's their right to do it. You know if I were a shareholder I would say good good on them. They're  Increasing shareholder value but as a user I think readers should complain

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they're taking it they're right they may not complain, but they're going to be taking advantage of because  They're they don't know they don't see the the systemic problem here

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well, and they'll still read I mean  I guarantee when somebody  Gets the phone at you know recode or if you get when you get your phone  People will still look to see what you think about it if they're the type of person who reads reviews, right?

Transcript:  So you can for a thousand bucks. I imagine most people are going to be like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, i'm gonna read a bunch of stuff. Well, and it's not just a thousand bucks because apple's strongly pushing apple care  Plus their extended warranty because the cost of repairing just the screen is 279 dollars. So well, let's talk about that with google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So google extended the so I bought the extra care for the both these devices  Google extended the one-year warranty for the new phone to two years because they know they got problems  So I think they should give me a discount on the on on the extended care. They did

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yours discount not a discount you will I can't remember what the solution was  They either have three years or they're going to refund you  I think they're going to refund you is I think what they decided to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, because the difference is the extent otherwise I just get rid of the extended care  But that that covers accidental damage. Whereas the warranty only

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They had some plan with this. I can't remember what it was. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like I haven't told me quick complaining. Jeff. It's solved. That's what I do. That's what I do here. That's my job

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, wait a minute. You had the click and buzz problem. I have I have the clicking in the background. Is that fixed yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So here's what google's doing for you jeff. They're eliminating the deductibles for warranty repairs  What did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff I think you should go out and drop your phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Given that no, that's user warranty repairs. I never buy these uh, warranties anyway, because I I just never use a phone that long  So if I drop it or scratch a big deal  Uh this just in uh, uh president uh trump has quietly set aside plans to require new cars be able to wirelessly talk  to each other  According to the ap jeopardizing one of the most promising technologies for preventing traffic deaths. This was a proposal last year from  The obama administration that all new cars and light trucks come equipped to the technology enabling them to transmit location speed and other  Information 10 times a second so that your car could talk to another car saying i'm this way i'm over here watch out  And you would for example know when a car is about to run a red light  And your car could stop  Trump in this administration, uh has decided to let industry officials say the trump administration has decided to let the proposal  languish  Partly because of a reluctance to impose costly mandates  Partly because of a reluctance to impose costly mandates

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But no this okay. So this is really strange the v2v stuff like well one. Okay, there's a couple things here  Uh, it was supposed to go into effect in 2017 which is now this has been around for a while  um, but we've now for  Qualcomm just released their v2v  Modules that made it super easy  To implement this either through wi-fi or cellular  So it could be that there's still some standardization efforts. This may not just be like a  Trump is just his admin just wants to dismantle everything  It may be the tech isn't quite ready just yet  so  Before we freak out  We should we should know  a little bit more about the  why

Actually, it's fun to read  If folks can agree so maybe he's waiting for agreement  Ina fried says well, maybe you could leave it up to each hardware maker to decide  But then people would complain about burger fragmentation  the the the real  Problem is not the burger by the way. It's the emoji for beer  Let me see if I can find this which unaccountably has the foam floating  In air the beer is the mug is half full  and the beer, uh doesn't  Touch the foam the foam is just sitting on the top which is  Very strange. That's good foam  That's some pretty that's strong foam  Maybe you drank the beer through the foam and then the foam just stayed there  It doesn't look like anybody else's who design who's doing these emojis by the way  uh  Google's the only one with the cheese on the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although I found a dan pashman piece from uh, 2011 on npr  That said you should put the cheese on the bottom. Oh, yeah, which orients the cheese tongue word in order to maximize

Transcript:  Uh, maybe it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So google now  When i'm in other countries when I want to see what's going on in other countries when I want to get a sense of the  Languages I go to google.de google.fr. You can't do it anymore  And it's just it's google  No, and I have friends. I have a very good friend who is german who lives in london  And every time he tries to go to german stuff wants to translate it  Google let us decide this stuff and let us decide it easily just by going to the other domains  You can evidently go to a settings thing somewhere  But you have to change the whole settings for the crow. It's jesus google. It was fine. What were you?  What are you mucking around just leave it leave it it's google it works

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Enough so why why did how are they justifying this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you explain it leo? I really couldn't understand the rationale

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be in response to countries like france and germany and the right to have forgotten  Well, they said not but or so if you wanted to see what was if you're in let's say you're in germany  And an article has been erased in the german google at at google.de thanks to a request  Uh to the right to be forgotten or gprd  uh  gpdr  Then you could go to google.com or google.  You know eu or somewhere else and get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that why no no they said here?  Um the change isn't supposed to affect how google handles legal requirements such as the removal of right to be forgotten  Okay, google says it's making the change because one out of five searches is related to location and the company feels it's critical to offer  Location information to provide the best results. I thought they always did this because when I was in france

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Even though it's my account logged into my account. I get google.fr  Which is ridiculous. I thought I always did this they always did this  Um, but but but can't you go to the bottom of the page to type in google.de if you wanted to go to germany  You could do that now. You can't do that. Can't you go to the bottom of the page and say i'm not where you think I am  There's some kind of thing they used to be able to do that. No, that's not that's not there  People want local results whether they want them or not  Jeff bezos heart breaks a little  Oh  Albinese amazon headquarters pitches, you know amazon's looking for a  second headquarters  Cringing as he scanned the section touting the city as the economic and cultural core of new york state's capital region  amazon's ceo jeff bezos reportedly felt his heart break a little  While perusing albany's pitch to host the company's new national headquarters  Oh geez, he said you can tell they put a lot of work into this sad presentation  They even provided a concept sketch of our headquarters across the river from their little amtrak station  Said bezos noting that the package included a custom-made  SUNY albany great dames football jersey with amazon written on the nameplate laid out the many ways a new five billion dollar campus would benefit  From being situated nearby such landmarks as the new york state museum  and the egg a performance art center the proposal referred to as iconic  It talked about how the port of albany has one of the biggest grain elevators in the country  Or something and they keep calling themselves the next tech valley  Bezos said god, I don't think that I have the stomach to read the section about how much we'll love their tulip festival  This is the onion, but boy it sure is good  I can hear bezos laughing when he reads it too. Yeah that honking famous honking laugh.

Doggie daycare software. Is there any really good stuff out there and I have to say I don't know  But that's probably better than googling doggy daycare software. I got a better solution captera  It's a free website  with hundreds of thousands  Of reviews from real users like you for 400 different categories of business software  I wonder if they have doggy daycare. I just made that up  I bet you they have like kennel software and stuff like that. Yeah kennel software. Here we go  So did you know that there are many many choices in kennel software?  But wait, you might say how do I choose you could google this by the way, you wouldn't get nearly this complete  So what you do is you go over on the right to the filter results saying that you know only want to see four star reviews  I want one that's web-based  And I want pet birthday tracking and photo management and pet grooming now  I'm going to filter the results and we're going to narrow it down to 16 products. You can look at the thumbnail descriptions  Learn more if you need how about ginger the leading?  Cloud software for pet daycare. Look at that or paw loyalty. It's more than software  Or pet azek i'll add them to my comparison chart press compare now  Then i've got I love this. Oh, they're gonna say how'd you hear about us? Make sure you say podcast  And make sure you say t w i g  That's how I heard it  And then you're gonna look in this end chart and you're gonna get everything you need to know what platforms how much it costs  additional features screenshots, but the best part is more than  400,000 reviews  from actual users  They're carefully vetted this is really a great solution  I don't know why more people don't know about captera, but i'm doing my best to spread the word  Don't wait, you won't waste your time on free trials that go nowhere  You won't get uh, you know, nobody's going to connect with you or call you or anything  That's not how it works. It's a it's free free. You don't even have to sign up. You don't have to give many information  cap  tera.com  Slash twig let them know you heard it on twig to find the right software for your business at absolutely no charge  200,000 software user reviews  200,000 400 categories every possible  category of business software medical management church software  accounting architecture legal and on and on and on I mean, it's really great cloud management compliance  captera cap t e r r a dot com slash  Twig, let me thank them for their support of this week in google stacey kick it off with your pick of the week with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, this week's pick of the week is come come to me. I got mine today, too or yesterday

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's the echo silver

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the echo silver anastasia  Anastasia, no, it is the amazon. Oh, there's the amazon label  I was trying to give it to you guys amazon echo plus and so everybody  Silence your madam ace. Okay. Well, do you actually I don't know if it's gonna sound different or not  It basically sounds a little bit better than the original echo, but the important part here is this has Zigbee

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mine came with a Phillips hue light bulb. So in a fit, that's cute one. That's cute one  So it in effect it replaces the hub

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so here's the thing  if you are like me and you already have a home hub, I'm not gonna recommend this because  If you've got a hub, you probably also have something like that runs z-wave

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which a bunch of other devices like the smart things hub does Zigbee and Z-wave, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can smart things both do Zigbee and Z-wave and I think that's a better way to go for now because there's still lots  Of those devices out there. The other thing to know about this is that  Amazon I just whacked myself in the head with it heavy  Actually, it's plastic

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They say it better speakers though. So it must be it does have better. I can play it for you if you know, it's alright  I we wouldn't know cuz it's

Oh, it only does bulbs  What so when I yeah when I asked it to turn off the lights in my room it only  Did the bulbs and actually this was not just this this is Amazon's new  so  Tied to this Amazon changed their interface for the madam a app  So what you've got now and I'll turn my brightness down a little bit so you guys can see

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll also turn off night light because everything that us I mean, sorry echo does normally  Yes, it does. It's a complete. In other words, it would be a reasonable replacement if you're buying an echo right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's good  Yeah, yeah a normal so if you don't it also adds I should say it has the calling the direct calling  Capability that the new echoes have the old echoes don't have this but here's what happened  The interface is now different on madam a I don't know if you can see so yeah, it's very it's totally different  This looks more like smart things something like that. And what you can do is you can now set groups  So I've got I don't know if you can see my master  That is madam a enabled that means when I stand in my master bedroom  I've grouped all the lights in there and a fan  to  be under the  Echo that's in the master bedroom. So when I walk in there and I say lights on  It's supposed to turn the lights in that room on so I no longer have to say turn on master bedroom  In reality all that does is turn on bulbs so it's only working certain devices  it doesn't do all of them and I'm wondering if that's because  They just started with bulbs or that's part of the bulbs and Zigbee are good friends. So this is something for the Amazon Plus  I don't know but those are it's kind of two things I'm telling you about now  But those are my two picks or one is really not a pick.

I look like I  Don't know an uber driver  This one this was weird. I thought my suit looked better than the sweater  But it's but and they rate it based based on a variety of criteria  And they rate it based based on a variety of criteria and they also get a percentage weighting so it was actually pretty close  What's working in this look pieces work better together compare it to another look you can add another photo  So you can give it your outfits and compare  You know, it's I mean it that's it it has a terrible speaker and no jack  So you can't get better audio out of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, so that's why and you know what I'm actually as I'm I'm thinking about right sizing my echoes  And I was actually gonna dump the echo show. Oh, I like I use that all the time  Well, nobody calls me on it because nobody wants that call you know, no, that's okay

It's fun  so  Employees and honestly share which tech companies don't pay fairly which ones they want to leave some really interesting stuff here is that Netflix  Employees are really friggin happy. No kidding. They're the happiest by far. So they asked I'm I forget how many people did this  I mean it was a you know, not a scientific poll, but it was a good number of employees

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So Netflix employees far down Apple is they don't think they're yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do women and men because that would have been interesting. Yeah would have been would have been very interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So so Netflix is on top like four thousand one hundred seventy four people but all you know, all of them, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't know how many Netflix employees. Yeah, it's it's but but Dropbox next Facebook is third  Nerd wallet twitch snapchat tableau Google's pretty far down there because Google has all these other kinds of employees now, right?  Probably aren't as happy. Yeah, Amazon's way down. That's not terribly surprising  Then they asked I'm interested in changing my job. Yeah  Right Netflix again happy most of them say no twenty couple percent say no, but group on ninety some percent

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  90% of group on people said yeah, I want to change my job. I'm not Google looks to be about  58% I can't I say about because Uber is over happy employees are are happier than Google employees in this respect  Well, they're waiting for their and that Google's happier than Apple Apple's happier than Amazon and they're all happier than Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you look at the at the compensation satisfaction versus job change interest, it's a correlation not surprisingly. Oh, yeah  Yes, more you make like folks. They're fairly compensated and aren't looking for jobs. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah, I found that really interesting. Yeah  The article is in Business Insider and it it is a survey by  I  Forgot sorry somebody. Oh somebody. Oh the blind app. So you have to use the app called blind that is designed to  Serve your service to do this. I guess yeah sounds like secret surveys. So I don't know. Is this crazy  Does anybody still use an Amazon Kindle? I do  I do  After three months I got the new oasis  Yeah, oh, this is the newest Kindle. This is the one it's a little pricey. It's over 300 bucks. It's waterproof IP  Came over the number but it's a two meters for up to an hour. So it's I mean, it's really waterproof  It has float  That's a good question  That's a very good question the life the battery life they say is much improved  I have to say it's a much faster process or the effect if you could show the others  Maybe if you could show a close-up of the screen, I could show you the the page turn  The page turn is much cleaner than before. It's just it's almost instant and they don't have that if there's a graphic  You'll have a weird flicker. But if you're just going from text to text, it's very clean very fast without any of that flickering  I  Guess this left hand or it goes either way the right hand side depending on how you hold it contains the battery  That's why it's got much better battery life. I'm weirdly weirdly puzzled by the it's too bad. They didn't do a type-c charger  It's a micro USB charger but given you're only gonna charge it once every few weeks  I guess I can live I can live with that on off switching a charger  The only thing it has it does come with LTE, you know, their whisper sink  built in  It has you know  Pretty much all the same features 300 dpi is you know, they're say the paper white back lit very nice easy to read  You can adjust the brightness, of course  It I'm using it with Wi-Fi, but you can also use it with LTE. I  Have to say this it's very light very easy in the hand it it it it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know easy to hold if you get tired of holding the book in that hand. Totally totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice okay, yeah, it's very easy to turn the page by touching the screen  But it also has physical page turn buttons forward and backward forward and backward. You see how nice the page turn is  So the main reason I use this is so I can read in bed because it's not  It's it's not as bright as any even a very directional light  So you can read in bed without disturbing your partner and so it's really good for that now  I have to say I'm disappointed. The other reason I got it is they say it'll play audible  Books and it will it has a section for audiobooks and  It sees your whole audible library, which which is nice  I can I can filter it down to just audible book audible stuff and here's my whole audible library  I can download it but doesn't have any speakers. So you have to pair it via Bluetooth to a Bluetooth speaker  Which I did I actually paired it to an Amazon Echo that worked very nicely  But I can already listen to audible books on Amazon Echo  So I'm not sure what the real advantage is here and it doesn't the one thing I wanted it to do  Is the is I call it I can't remember the name of it  But where you as you're listening it highlights the text like Kariyot karaoke and it doesn't do that  Which is a little bit disappointing  This specifically doesn't do that so you can either you're in a when you listen to a book you're in an audible  Interface you actually have the audible app up there. You don't see the text  Which is extremely  Disappointing because that was my favorite feature when you know, they call it immersive reading  When you have the audio and you're watching the text otherwise though  It is it is a really nice Kindle and if you still are if you don't use a Kindle on your tablet  You like the e-ink for whatever reason. I think this is a very nice  Reader  I'm pretty happy with it and boy, it's light  It's very light it would be really nice  I don't expect to have a speaker but it would really be nice if it did the immersive reading  I thought that was such a nice feature. And of course, she can you speak that I read so fast

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I would get behind so I'm curious like what do you mean speed up the audio?  Well, I guess you know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, yeah, I mean you don't want to speak you let me see actually that's a good question because some some you know  Audiobook readers, I think the audible audiobook reader will let you  Read it a faster pace. Let me see. Oh, yeah. Yeah, let me see if I can do that  Yeah, this has speed in fact it'll go 300  Percent. Yeah, okay  So yeah, you can speed it up and I presume then if it had immersive reading it would speed up  But it doesn't have immersive reading. So who knows?  It has a store you can buy as you know, unlike your iPad which you know, it's the buying is separated from the reading  But yeah, I'm happy with it. I really am. I'm very happy with it  I got it cuz I want to a I want to read in the tub and B  I want to take it on a trip. We're going on a sale  My son and I were sailing around the Caribbean for Christmas and it'd be nice  I'd be nice to have something that's a little water-proof, but you're right  It doesn't float so I'm gonna have to attach a floaty to it because here's if it's water-proof it sinks  Yeah, yeah I can dive get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that concludes question or you can glue I read somewhere that I could run  The virtual sim on this phone as my fi and then still have my physical sim in here with my AT&T

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know if that's true. I don't know if that's true. It would be a virtual East dual sim  Because the e-sim doesn't require a sim, but I don't know that's a good one  I will when you get it I will because I have other sims so I could try it  Yeah, I will try that for you and let you know in a couple of weeks. All right now you can go by

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen actually I'm trying to keep Stacy from eating. I want to keep doing this so Stacy's not gonna eat

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's gonna be very hungry. Stop it. I will just leave stop it by the way somebody's saying does it read text?  Yes, it has a very good voice for reading text  But again, it doesn't have a speaker so you have to pair it to a Bluetooth  But it has an accessibility mode that reads all the controls would actually be great for accessibility  And I think the out loud reading sounds pretty human sounds pretty good. So yes recommend it  Is it using Amazon's poly? Maybe I can't play it for you  Because I don't have a Bluetooth speaker paired but it's a female voice and it's yeah, it's very good  It's it's better than it used to be and I didn't mind it before but now it's like you could really listen to it  I think  Well, we've come to the end of another this week in Google  It's time for us all to break and eat some queso and wear our fine queso shirts  Jeff Jarvis lives the queso life
