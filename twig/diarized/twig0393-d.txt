Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis, he's in New Jersey.  There's no color you can apply to Jersey. I'm in a red slice.  He's in a red slice, too, from BuzzMachine.com.  Professor of journalism at the City University of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our governor is up for a job on on sports radio in New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're talking about what's his name?  Christie. Chris Christie.  He'd be great at sports radio. Yeah.  He'd be great. It's a bit of a come down from the job.  He was hoping to get, but it's yeah, I think sports talks pretty good.  Actually, you know, that brings me to Ben Thompson's great article and strata  today. Ben is really a great and insightful analyst.  We've had him on many times on this show and on on Twitter.  His his piece actually from yesterday, Manifesto's  and Monopoly's is his discussion of Mark Zuckerberg's  6000 words screed on Facebook as to what the new Facebook mission statement was.  Facebook went from a one sentence mission statement to a five thousand  statement mission, five thousand cents.  But the line here that I thought was very interesting  is kind of germane to our speculation that Mark Zuckerberg  might be interested in political office.  And he points out that Zuckerberg  as the CEO of Facebook has probably a much better  bully pulpit than any president.  Let me let me read you the paragraph.  Given this reality, Ben Thompson writes,  why would Zuckerberg want to be president?  He's not only CEO of Facebook, he's the dominant shareholder as well,  answerable to no one.  His power and ability to influence is greater than any president,  subject to political reality and checks and balances.  Besides, as Zuckerberg made clear last week, his concern is not a mere country,  but rather the entire world.  All right. So he's president of the globe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I got I got I put like four more reactions to Zuckerberg's essay  on the rundown and they all pissed me off.  Because if if Zuck said if he sat back and just said, you know,  I just want a business, I don't give a crap about the world.  Sorry about that.  You know, that's all I do is run a business to heck with all you all.  Then we'd be smashing them like crazy.  That's kind of what he said all along when he, you know, kind of sheepishly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and self-deprecatingly said, oh, we didn't throw we didn't change  the results of the we don't have that much power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he's always said he cares about a connected world.  And the world's a better world. He's always had that mission.  So now he goes into more depth about it and more detail about what he wants to do  and where he thinks he can help.  And everybody smashes the smash him for trying to take over the world.  That was one theme.  And the other theme, of course, was journalists feeling terribly entitled.  Emily Bell at Columbia, I thought I saw you.  You know, all the tech companies. Yeah.  I didn't begin all the all the tech companies should give a billion dollars  each to some fund to pay for journalists.  No, they should be helping us strategically.  And Steve Waldman, who's a friend of mine, wrote a piece of The New York Times  saying basically the same thing.  And I'm I'm tearing my hair out because as then somebody else  just wrote a piece of something for getting who  Charlie Beckett from London School of Economics,  who wrote a piece saying, well, if you're going to demand they give away money,  which is pretty cheeky as is, why should they give it away to journalism?  Why not health? Why not saving lives? Why not other things?  You know, who's to say that we're so entitled and that they owe us anything?  They don't owe journalism crap.  They owe the public a lot, but they don't own journalism anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, OK, so that aside,  Zuckerberg, I was I tried to read the six thousand word.  And it seemed like a lot.  I couldn't quite get through the whole thing.  It's easy. Did you make it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, three quarters of the way.  Whatever you started talking about civility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's like, oh, stuff.  You just screamed at you and stormed away.  It was a lot of it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I said you need an editor.  Yeah, what I said it did.  It could have probably said the whole thing in a paragraph.  And it but but what Ben Thompson points out is that is the global  aspirations that Zuckerberg's talking about here. Right.  I mean, and of course, that's Facebook is a global company.  It's not an American company anymore.  It's a global.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was Exxon, you know, so so is Walmart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So but I thought what I thought was interesting.  And actually, the upshot of Ben's article is  we we got we should be worried about Facebook  and we should do what we can to reduce its growing influence.  For instance, it should be prohibited.  And I'm not sure I disagree with this.  It should be prohibited from buying companies like WhatsApp and Instagram  or any social media companies, because that just boosts its network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's that's the we have laws about that.  We have anti-crush laws.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it really is an anti-trust because he says it may be too late  to stop Facebook at this point because their their social graph is so massive  and everybody's in it that no one else can get a word in edgewise in effect.  And anybody who does like Instagram or WhatsApp, Facebook just goes,  yeah, we'll we'll take that 22 billion. No big deal.  And and now when you are on Instagram, you're on Facebook.  When you're on WhatsApp, you're on Facebook. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And next week, we'll have stories claiming that Facebook's over.  It's over. Everybody's on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's responding to that, though.  He and by the way, the article, I think there's a very good case to be made.  And there's certainly numbers to back it up.  That Snapchat, which is about to go public.  Snap is actually at its peak.  And in fact, Instagram, as soon as they started doing stories,  started to eat away at Snaps audience, Snapchat's audience.  And that Snapchat may be on the way out just because Instagram  has the again has the social graph.  Stacey, I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was actually just going to one.  Everybody's always too big and no one else can get like once a company  reaches a certain size, that's kind of an accepted argument.  But I don't know if you know this, Jeff, but the it's the  Hirfman Hirshman Hirfendahl Hirshman index for I know that applies  to mobile companies, but has the FTC ever applied it to any social media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what is that? Tell us what that is.  I don't know what that is. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a it's a market share index.  It's the only reason I know about it is because we talk about it a lot  in wireless for like when the carriers are doing M&A.  And I have no idea if it applies because I'm not an antitrust lawyer.  So this would be the FTC in the US Department of Justice, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It measures market concentration.  Yes, it's calculated by squaring the market share of each firm competing  in the market, then summing the resulting numbers.  And actually, the Department of Justice uses this to  pinpoint merger issues, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, when you were talking about buying, I mean, because what you're  essentially making is kind of an antitrust market power argument  against these guys, right?  In social media. Yes.  And so if you can't buy like to art to say, now, the problem is,  these are private companies, so I don't think the DOJ gets a say.  I don't know. Facebook's not private.  Yeah, Facebook's not private now.  So I don't I this is something to pose to someone far smarter than I am.  But I was just curious if there was a there there or a way to prevent market power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was Thompson says it's terrifying, given their power.  He wrote this last year, given their power over what users see,  Facebook could, if it choose, be the most potent political force in the world.  Of course, it doesn't do that because, you know, that becomes  then it becomes a real problem.  There'll be a furor over this.  And so Facebook has strong instead of not to become overtly political.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was I was I was at a roundtable of media executives and Facebook  last week was off the record, so I can't, you know, give any details.  But but I was very I mean, I'm impressed about how careful  Facebook is about that.  And there were times when the funny thing about it was the media people  were pushing Facebook, saying, you know, people are wrong about that.  Just correct them. Just do it. Just just just fix it.  Just just make them smarter.  And no, no, you can't do it.  Whoa, no. I mean, you know, and they and they fake news argument

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  rebound, by the way, in a very damaging way.  And it's now being used incorrectly, in my opinion, to tar all media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I doubt it. Yeah. Yeah.  It turned out to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I was a little I have to say, I was a little concerned about this,  the super super case of false news because it it it had this little tint of.  Well, it's false news because it's it's against what I believe in.  You know, it had it was already had that seed.  And and now that seed is as you know, been planted and bloomed.  And now anything's fake news that disagrees with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly. Exactly. So so so fake news.  I said in a piece I wrote this week that we're stuck in a paradoxical loop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can't use that phrase anymore. I would submit. Right.  No, no, you can't at all.  You never should have opted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should have. And we shouldn't have propaganda lies and fraud.  There's three separate propaganda lies and lies and fraud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Claire Wardell, who's the head of the first draft coalition, is just brilliant.  And it's a coalition of a bunch of news organizations.  Google started funding it.  Knight did Facebook did she put up.  I don't have it. Maybe I have it handy.  She has a taxonomy of oh damn, no, it's on Twitter.  I'm going to say she has a taxonomy of of fakery  from simple mistakes up to full fledged fraud  and and different motives for each one.  Yeah. Fake news is ridiculous.  And now it's now it's used so that anything that one side disagrees with,  it's just fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me go on, though. This is what Ben says.  This is why, you know, going back to, as you said,  Facebook's now very sensitive about not, you know, about staying completely neutral.  And really, as I've always said, it's only motivation  is the simple financial motivation to improve engagement.  Of course, that leads to filter bubbles.  But he says, this is why I read Zuckerberg's manifesto with such alarm.  Zuckerberg not only gives his perspective on how the world is changing  and at least in passing some small admission  that Facebook's focus on engagement may have driven things like filter bubbles  and fake news. But.  And this is the worrisome part from Ben's point of view,  for the first time explicitly commits Facebook to playing a central role  in affecting that change in a manner that aligns with Zuckerberg's  personal views of the world.  It is a manifesto building global community  based on Mark's personal vision of what the world should be.  Come on. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is that's like what every newspaper in the world is built on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One. But these newspapers don't have the power that Facebook does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We should at one point in time, they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know. I mean,  Hearst was able to start the Spanish-American War as objective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anything. I mean, if we're talking about humans,  there's no such thing as objective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But in the other in the old days, there at least were multiple newspapers  and multiple voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Facebook enables more voices than we've ever had in the history of mankind.  So people don't follow them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just like they didn't subscribe to the competing newspapers.  I mean, exactly.  Bingo. Stacey.  Jeff and I almost never agree so strongly.  I'm like, especially about journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey is now very worried. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like what is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hold on. And and one of the things one of the things that Ben is arguing for  is, you know, he Zuck says that, you know,  progress now requires humanity coming together, not just as cities or nations,  but as a global community.  This is, you know, New World Order stuff.  The global community.  There's just one problem, says Ben.  First, he may be wrong.  It's just as plausible to argue that the ultimate end state  of the Internet revolution is a devolution of power to smaller,  more responsive, self-selected entities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Local government, which, well, not necessarily geographically local,  but local to interest.  And Facebook is a platform for just that as well.  Facebook is a platform where you can find people who are like you.  You can speak, thus be found, find, organize and act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so you're going to dispute this this key sentence then, because  Ben believes he's proven that Mark wants to  kind of get involved in global governance.  In other words, he's saying Mark doesn't want to be president.  He wants to be president of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the worst conspiracy theory language.  He says, trilateral commission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. He says, even if Zuckerberg is right,  that it's all about global community, is there anyone who believes  that a private company?  Well, that's not really true, but I guess it's private in the sense  it's mostly owned by Mark Zuckerberg, run by an unaccountable,  all-powerful person that tracks your every move for the purpose  of selling advertising is the best possible form  said global governance should take.  So you you would dispute that notion that Mark wants to rule the world?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. A, B, it's not global governance.  It's a platform that people can do whatever they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But didn't his letter kind of imply that, hey, we can use Facebook  for global governance or some sort of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can use it. No, we can use Facebook to connect people better  into civic dialogue.  It's as he's right, it's exactly the same argument  journalism made for years is that we drive civic engagement.  We get you to care about your world, do something about it.  That's all he's arguing.  And then the journalist, hey, that's our job.  Don't take that away. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He actually talk about things like with site search and raising money.  So that goes beyond a conversation in enabling people to take action.  So I suppose if you look at it, it's like a government's providing a service.  He's providing some services.  Yeah, he'd like to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He'd like to, for instance, with Internet.org, provide Internet  to a billion or two people who don't have Internet right now.  And he's talking about the Internet.  And his vision is primarily Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Internet and a lot of people's vision is Facebook.  I know that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, well, a lot of users, you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. So this is no different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's how AOL was in the early days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It was the I've talked to some Google folks lately,  and I sense that that they're  engaging in schadenfreude, that they said German word time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The shameful joy in the  disappointment of others in the misfortune of others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Google was on the hot seat for a couple of years.  Google was the Internet.  And Eric Schmidt said this, anytime the Internet's going to be complained about,  Google is going to be complaining about it because we're the largest thing on it.  And everybody's going to go after Google. And they did.  And the light stick was wrecked and all this stuff came along.  Now, because of the fake news thing, suddenly Facebook is on the hot seat.  Google's saying, whoo, whoo, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, they're loving it because all of the privacy arguments,  all this stuff now is not about Google, which it used to be.  It's all about Facebook. Right.  Facebook is taking a lot of data. But it's the same absurdity.  But they had the same problem.  If Google had the same problem, Google was taking over the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, Facebook's taking over the world.  Microsoft was taking over the world before them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you OK. So you guys and Stacey and Jeff,  it's your opinion that there's nothing.  First of all, congratulations on having read the almost entirety of Mark's comments.  It's like, oh, Jeff, I what I as far as I read, all like it just seemed like  marketing gobbledygook to me.  I didn't I was very difficult for me to tease any, you know,  initiatives out of it.  Were there initiatives in there?  I mean, Ben's saying the initiative is global government.  I don't know if that's a smart guy. But B.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again, that's trilateral commission talk.  That's anti globalism talk.  It's not only global global now, but somebody's going to take over the globe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he does. And I left out his I left out the first few paragraphs,  which really set the stage for all of this.  And I thought these were quite insightful.  He's very well written, very smart.  But I think he's wrong. He he says that, you know, in the  in his little cartoony way, in the early in the in the old way,  the old world, somebody made something and sold it to a consumer.  Of course, in the industrial era, it got sliced up into three slices,  manufacturing or content creation or, you know, and then distribution  and then consumers.  But what's happened in the Internet era is this whole distribution thing  has become not only commoditized, but devalued.  So so the fundamental impact of the Internet is to make this  distribution itself a cheap commodity, or in the case of digital content,  completely free.  By the way, that's what Twit piggybacks itself on.  We can reach our audience directly because distribution is effectively free.  He says that's why I've long argued the Internet revolution is as momentous  as the Industrial Revolution.  And then he gets Gutenberg Gutenberg, baby.  And then what he's saying now is the funnel is the new model, he says.  And this brave new world power not comes not from production,  not from you and me, Jeff, the car and Stacey, the content creators  and not from distribution, obviously, but from controlling  consumption, all markets will be demand driven,  the extent to which they already are as a function of digitized.  He says Facebook is the funnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that but that's still an old world belt on channel.  Third German word worldview that is  arguing that we're in a production base rather than a service based economy.  Google is a personal services company.  Facebook is a service company.  Content does not have any value anymore.  It's not a product that we need to make anymore.  That's a Gutenberg era notion.  And that's out the window.  Well, that's bad news for you and me and every newspaper and journalist in the country.  We're kind of because because you have the people, the dear people  who are watching us now for even longer than it would take to read Zuckerberg's essay  are a community built around you, Leo and around the shared interests.  And that's different from saying we make a product called content  that you're going to watch the interactivity that exists,  the relationships that exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is more about relationship than it is about a man.  But without content, there's no relation.  I mean, the relationship is based on a trade of information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But content is merely a vehicle for carrying information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I trade, I you trade your attention, gentle viewer and listener,  for my information or entertainment or, I don't know, whatever it is, you get out of it.  So they ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you're arguing and I don't know the distinction here,  but what you're talking about, what Zuckerberg is talking about  is the attention economy kind of concept.  Yes, I think so.  What Jeff is talking about is based on services.  And so, yes, people are giving you their attention in the exchange,  not for your content, but the service you actually provide in their life,  which is things like how do I work with, how do I load my Microsoft  with a different browser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's a service. OK.  I mean, I think that's a difference without a distinction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's a big distinction, a big distinction because it changes  the relationship, it changes the economic basis.  I mean, look at look at Google Home. Right.  Is this content? No, this is a service.  Now it's going to tell me things. It's going to give me information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a distribution mechanism.  Yes. Well, in Ben's, it's not it's an aggregator in Ben's,  you know, worldview in his model.  That's exactly what he's talking about.  That Google Home is the equivalent of the Facebook funnel.  It's the aggregator that that becomes the conduit.  It's the new value to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless I'm playing music, the value to me is not that I consumed something.  The value to me is that I learned something that I wanted to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's Jeff isn't he's not paying attention to it.  It's not seeking his attention.  All it is is providing a service.  Again, it's it is it's not a difference  without a distinction, without a difference or whatever.  You just said, Leo, I can't remember.  I can never remember that phrase.  It's just a really nuanced way of looking at how this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Too nuanced. Thank you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get it. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm sorry.  I apologize, Stacey. You're right.  You're saying it better than I can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just going to sit back and let you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, this is terrible when Jeff and I actually agree.  We just gang up on Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's so wrong with that, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? What's so wrong with that?  I like being ganged up on.  I don't know why. I'm a little kinky.  But I like no, truthfully, I do like being because what I don't  the risk of sitting in this chair is that I gang up on everybody else.  So I want you guys to to speak in concert against  is it unlike Mark Zuckerberg?  I want you to to knock me down for a knock me down a peg.  All right. Well, anyway, OK, we got I mean, I think, you know, I have  I'm trying to get some sort of handle on this.  I've been asking every smart person I know, what did Mark say?  What does that mean? And I think  your your position, Jeff, is Mark was widely misunderstood, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think people what's what's behind the black box?  What's the big mystery? What are they doing? What's going on there?  Well, then he takes six thousand words to say, here's what I'm trying to do.  Here's where I see value.  Well, what is he trying to do?  Also, importantly, also importantly, he says, here's where we haven't gone far enough.  I would I write at the end of another post I wrote about how Trump kills  media and media kills Trump.  I kind of put in my my wish list back to Zuckerberg  and I put it in a comment to his post.  And I think that the I said on the show a few weeks ago  where I think that the Internet is built to speak, not yet to listen.  And Facebook, ironically, is a platform to speak and to show off your world  and signal not so much to meet new people, not so much to understand people,  not so much to have dialogue.  And what he was saying was, I think we know we have to develop this to a next level.  And if we're going to have civic civil  civil, civility in society, we're going to have to have information.  We're going to have to have the mechanism to connect.  We're going to have the mechanisms to talk.  That's what he's saying.  And he's saying, you know, we're only 13 years old.  Mazel tov bar mitzvah just happened. Right.  And and and here's where I want to go with the product and the service  that I that I've made and that I get and that I give you for free.  Let's add. And yeah, I makes money on it.  Hell of a lot of money and more ever more money.  And but it's up to us to how we use that.  But it's up to him to create an architecture.  So I would argue this.  Twitter has not solved the problem of openness and civility, for example.  They've got to work on that in some way or another.  Facebook, I think, has to work on mechanisms where people can tell their stories  and save spaces, meet other people, understand people, be brought into dialogue.  There can be informed dialogue with media's help.  That's a that's a kind of next leap of what Facebook can be  in a civilization as an enabling technology, just as print  was an enabling technology.  And no, it wasn't all controlled by one person difference,  but it was an enabling technology for society to learn how to operate in new ways.  That's what we have now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is Facebook now, though, isn't it still a platform for broadcast  more than a community conversation or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a broad, not broadcast.  It's probably the word there.  I guess to many.  No, it's this cast, but it's cast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's still it's still a talk.  Don't listen. Mostly more so one way media. Right.  Twitter is all one way.  Well, I mean, there's conversations on Twitter.  There's conversations, but it's really pretty much announce, announce, announce.  And I would I mean, just maybe it's only lately.  What's really interesting about Facebook is how it changes from minute to minute.  Like this month's a very different Facebook than it was last month  is very different from how it was last summer.  It's very which is is that I think that's good, right?  It's somehow reflecting a zeitgeist fourth German word, ladies and gentlemen.

Transcript:  These are Walker in Google.  Actually, if you could like to see X-Rex, it's their fifth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I already counted that one.  Oh, did you? Yeah, yeah.  Well, one thing I've so I've been around Facebook  more because of this fake news thing that I'm going to be around a lot more  because I'm going to a conference.  I had a conference a week ago.  I'm going to another one this weekend.  I'm going to another one the week after that.  And Facebook's president, all of them.  So I'm getting a different window on Facebook.  I also had somebody from Facebook  talk to a community of practice that I that I convene in product  development for four and a half hours.  I learned a lot from that.  And what I see is the whole notion, the chaotic development,  the thrown on the wall, get it out there, try it.  They see it as as an organized chaos.  They see it as let's try stuff.  They look at the data, they see if it works, they kill it.  They do the next thing.  And that's hard for us to get our heads around because we're used to institutions  that that work toward permanence.  It's like a snake that sheds its skin every five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's just so society.  Yeah, I mean, I guess it was weird was that you had the permanence of books

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and magazines and newspapers that permanence was what they go.  Sorry, they do it.  Gutenberg, Parenthesis, they do it.  Sorry, they do it. Gutenberg, Parenthesis.  That was a myth of the Gutenberg era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I just yeah, but no, I think before  mass media or media of any kind, it was much more permanent.  I mean, the culture of of of Europe in the in before Gutenberg hadn't changed for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  500 years. Well, indeed, they didn't they didn't respect their own current culture.  So the goal of the scribes was to preserve ancient knowledge before we go.  We're a bunch of idiots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Gutenberg, I think, was the first actually the first shot  in what has become now this kind of.  You know, whirlwind of change all the time, pop culture, pop culture, every,  you know, 15 minutes of fame, Andy Warhol got it wrong.  It's five, 15 seconds.  It's like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  Although Warhol was kind of he was kind of prescient, wasn't he?  When he said everybody in the future, everybody will have 15 minutes of fame.  I don't know how he knew that 40 years ago, but he was right.  And it's only getting worse.  And no wonder people are, you know, like stressed out and dying.  You know, the the I was just looking at a graph at of the life expectancy in South  Korea compared to the United States, and South Korea has started to outpace us  considerably as United States life expectancy kind of not only plateaus,  but might even be going down.  And and as I think of it, it's I don't think it's food or lifestyle or I think  it's a stress.  I maybe I guess it's stressful in South Korea.  I don't know. I feel like, oh, yeah, I feel like this has become unhealthy.  This, you know, and after ever since the election and I'll cop to this.  Farhad Manjhi wrote that great article  about trying to do a week without political news, and he couldn't.  It's it's like he says, like trying to eat  a fruitcake without getting the nuts and the raisins.  It's everywhere.  And we're all kind of stressed out.  And whether you're pro Trump or against him,  the polarization and the conversations become very heated.  And I think we're we're we're spite.  It's a death spiral of attention and stress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that part, that part.  Yeah, yeah, isn't it?  It is. Am I wrong?  Twitter is Twitter is ready to kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The number one thing I hear nowadays is I don't want to  needy needy needy put my fingers in my ear.  I don't want to. I don't want to hear any.  It's like, don't.  I think people are going crazy.  Anyway, I don't know, I really globalized  that into into our life expectancy plummeting.  You are grumpy today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tuned all of that out because I found it stressful.  Exactly.  I'm feeling really little now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

I flip it around to run Android apps or just to browse through Google.  Listen, I love it. I love the touch screen.  The screen is beautiful.  What don't you like? You bought it.  I know, I know, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am the boy who cries lemon.  I know that. I know.  Well, let me tell you the ways.  It's it's it's to me, this is the CR 48 of whatever the next operating system is  going to be. That was the first Chromebook we all got.  It was a black clunky thing.  And this thing is clunky.  OK, so the problem is it's slower.  I am so spoiled.  I am so spoiled by my Chromebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You knew it would be because you had a pixel with eight gigs of RAM or no,  maybe even 16.  I'm looking for a machine to replace this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me tell you how depressed I am.  I cannot buy a pixel.  You can't find them anywhere.  There's there's you just can't be used anyway.  And then I almost got caught in a scam today.  Guy put up a thing on Amazon and I quickly found out it was a scam.  What's wrong with your old pixel?  It's fine, but I'm neurotic and I want to back up.  I want to know what I'm going to use next.  So I see this as the next machine.  That's unfair, maybe because I'm off a pixel.  It's half the price or less or well, but it OK, it's way too slow.  When I'm typing in TweetDeck, I've got a lag in typing, typing.  That should be the scroll.  The scroll is jumpy and bad.  OK, the internal is plastic.  The extra money metal, but the internal is plastic.  To my mind, they took the basic machine they had.  They put on a much better screen.  Screen is beautiful. You're absolutely right.  They put on a metal exterior,  but it's still a tinny.  Yeah,  the Chromebook and all Chromebooks are tinny.  And that's that's disappointing because I put my life on these things.  Now, everything I do is on Chromebooks.  I've got my machine.  It dies. I'm doomed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just mean your life is in the cloud, Jeff.  And you just grab another computer and start working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's doomed because he can't find one as good as the one he's got.  Exactly.  But that one is a good backup.  Just think of that as your backup.  If you had to use it, you could live with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's the other. So here's the other question.  That's why I say, OK, do I do I replace my Pixel C with this?  Right.  Pixel C is a million times better tablet than this thing.  I couldn't get the sound.  I can't you can't get Amazon to load to load on it.  It won't let you do that.  I tried to play a video last night with my just plug in headset.  Couldn't get the sound working.  What I have to go through to get because of G-Spot,  what I have to do to get that to get absolutely on this, you would not believe.  Well, you're going to have that problem with any Chromebook, right?  That's true. That's true.  But I'm just well, but don't forget, I'm either replacing my laptop or I'm  replacing my tablet, each that I have now is miles better than this  combination of both. That's what I'm saying in the end.  OK, and if if it could operate decently, it would be the thing I'd travel with.  Yeah. But I can't type well on it.  I can't scroll well on it.  The trackpad is plastic and crap.  You did complain about the trackpad.  Yeah.  It just doesn't have

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I almost emailed you after our show saying don't buy this because I actually  want to hear me complain.  No, I saw this coming because it isn't.  You're absolutely right.  If what you want is a Google Pixel, Chromebook Pixel, it's not that it isn't.  It's a third of the price or  more than that, but it but less more than less than half.  And neither is it a Pixel C.  Yeah, I don't know very many people who like the Pixel C.  I think you're one of the few on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm weird. I'm admitting I'm weird.  But but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mossberg's comment was on the on the Samsung Chromebook Pro.  He had the pro and maybe the pro be faster.  I'm not convinced.  It might be, but I'm not convinced it will be.  I think what you really want is more RAM.  Well, so the surprise, they didn't put more RAM in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very surprised to make an option.  The Asus, I think, enables here's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are better Chromebooks.  Estelle makes one that's seven or eight hundred dollars.  That's a Chromebook for work, though, doesn't have touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not exactly it's problem.  So I bought this one versus the Asus because of you for one thing, because you are my.  I don't know if it's I don't know if the Asus is any better for you.  Well, I'm not sure.  But but but well, but I also bought this one because of the stylus.  But I have horrible handwriting.  I'm never going to use the stylus.  OK, so the Asus, I think I thought I read that you get it with more RAM,  but I can't find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The 302, is that the one you want to get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so. Yeah, I thought that I thought I read somewhere  there was going to come available with more RAM, but I can't find that anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So as as as a expensive, you know, in terms of functionality, it's very similar.  Sure, yeah, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I wish to they had the twist  instead of doing the 180 to the twist.  So you're not it does turn off the keys when you have it flipped around.  It does, but I'm always worried.  I'm going to catch a key on my briefcase or something.  Yeah, sitting on the train.  So, you know, I know I'm a complainer.  This is limited to four gigs as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the processor in both of the the Chromebook Pro and the and the Asus is  just an M3, which is not a very fast processor.  I know, you know, it's an interesting question.  Why did they?  This the Asus looks almost identical, frankly.  I don't think it's going to be that much different spec wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless I get more RAM.  I know from my old days in the early days of Chromebooks when I started using them,  the four was never enough, just not enough.  Yeah.  Now that you're running you may be running the browser, you know, five tabs in the  browser plus one or two Android apps.  It went berserk on me when I tried to do that.  It was starting flashing and I couldn't I couldn't do anything with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a little odd that they I'm not sure why.  It feels artificial that they've limited it like this.  Why wouldn't they have a range?  Well, especially Dell of all companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Dell does. But Dell doesn't have touch.  I wish I wish exactly.  I wish Dell gave me every option I could have a touchscreen, LTE, eight gigs of RAM,  large SSD. I'd pay twelve hundred bucks for that.  And no, they don't have to have a market for it.  But I guess Dell is out of the custom business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they used to be the most customized.  I think there must be something going on  with Google and licensing because Google, why don't you?  Why, Google? Why? Why, Google?  Tell us why. So here's why.  I'm sort of and will they make another Chromebook Pixel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my plea.  That's my plea. Just keep the Pixel line going.  It's all I want because I know your own people use it.  I know it's not a big market, but you're wildly rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's no question at all.  I completely agree with you that the Chromebook Pixel 20.  What is it? 2014, 2015, 2015.  Is the best Chromebook and what everybody should experience.  But I think most I think they've concluded that the market's not interested in  spending twelve hundred ninety nine dollars for a Chrome OS device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they all they've made, except for the Chromebook.  That's all they've made is the tinny little Chromebooks for education and low end work.  They've never really pushed this.  They need more apps on it.  So there was a story I forgot to put in the rundown,  but there was another story about the new operating system that's rumored  that's going to finally bring together Android and Chrome and how it would do that.  You know, if you could really use great  photo applications on this and video editing on this and that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the Dell might be the the the Dell might.  Because they may have a 13.  You know, this is the one you couldn't find on Dell's site because  Dell doesn't admit to making this yet.  They we don't know what the Dell specs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I even found Dell computers.  It was a weird thing on Dell's site.  I found them in the business section.  I couldn't find a buy button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, there's no buy button.  What gives?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not available yet.  I don't want to resort to my first well-known computer complaints on Dell.  I'm trying to be nice to you.  You might have to you might have to call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I tried to buy one, too, after we talked last week, because I understand what you  I completely understand and sympathize with what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I need a better processor and I need more RAM.  It's a computer.  You know, you build your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you actually Chrome OS is there is a Chromium OS.  It is open source.  So in theory, you could, although it's apparently very difficult,  there is one company that does offer a Chrome OS installer based on the Chromium OS.  But then you're not going to get the updates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's weird.  I wouldn't. It's like an Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're not going to get all that stuff.  For some reason, it really is tightly coupled to hardware.  All right. OK.  I know you're I can't hear you with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I understand exactly what my depression is not about the Samsung.  My depression is about the end of the Pixel Chromebook and Pixel C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  W.W.D.C. They might announce something.  That's not for a while, but.  Google, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or, meanwhile, I'm very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you have to kind of adjust your expectations.  And you're right, if you're trying to buy a replacement for the Chromebook Pixel,  the Samsung Chromebook Plus is not a good choice.  Lisa didn't like it either.  But I'm perfectly happy with it for what it is.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it if here's here, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Go ahead. You can finish up.  I was just going to let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If if you go back in time before I get the Pixel C and I was hauling around the  Chromebook for this to be my briefcase machine, I probably would have been pretty happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because it is light and thin and small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the Pixel C is faster and better than this and faster and smarter.  And an Android works well enough now across all the Google apps that it is better  with identity by far than Chrome is that I now travel exclusively with the Pixel C.  Though that's going to go away, too.  So that's my comparison now.  So as a traveling machine, the Pixel C, the tablet is actually better.  So you know what I was thinking about, Leo?  What?  Surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, my mom loves their surface.  They're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're actually really that goes to Stacey's point is just Jarvis stop  complaining, get a machine and put a browser on it and shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it might be.  You might be right. Actually, that might be.  Yeah, you could get it.  Get a max out of surface, you know, and you'd be very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's thousand bucks, but that's that's not any more than my Chromebook is.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you just told us how you're going to you're willing to pay for this.  And hardware seems to be your hang up and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey, Stacey, I didn't hear that part, but you're exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I did not say to buy a service.  I was thinking surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're thinking it and he just picked up on that.  No, you guys have really been on  surface pro for what you can get it with an I seven and eight gigs of RAM.  Actually, it looks like you can customize even even further here.  Let's let's configure it.  Yeah, you could go up to 16 gigs of RAM.  With you don't need an I seven, but you know what?  That's what I would get.  I would get I seven, no, an I five with 16 gigs of RAM and a 256 gig hard drive,  1399, then you have to add one hundred twenty nine dollars for the keyboard.  You do what I don't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know what I get in terms of being able to do Google Play.  I can't do on it.  You can't do Android, you mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't do my store Google Play.  I don't know if I can do Netflix or not.  I don't know if I can do Amazon download or not.  So that's part of the reason that I carry a tablet around.  Yeah, OK, but but but Google Play is where all my stuff is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the Surface Pro cover with fingerprint ID, another 160 bucks.  Yeah, it's a little it's price here.  Let me go back to Stacy's question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why.  Isn't it possible to easily install  the Chrome OS on most any machine, what's special about the Chromebook  hardware that makes it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a there's a trusted boot system  for security.  There is if you go to the chromium dot org, there's a Chrome OS.  You know, if you're sophisticated enough, there's a Chrome OS  download and you can install it.  And there are companies that make it a little bit cleaner.  But.  Yeah, it's not by the way, it wouldn't.  Well, let's see it.  You can do firmware.  Chrome core boot or you boot, I guess you could get it pretty close.  Might be an interesting project.  Yeah, well, yeah, this is not I think this is not a user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't I don't do anything that's like if I'm going to work on the machine  or work on a product and have it expected to work, then I don't I don't.  Yeah, good rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So otherwise, you'll just need to have Ubuntu installed on it.  You might like Linux.  We should get we should get you into Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I tried that from the original Chromebook.  Did you?  Yeah, I was I did the dual boot thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that actually might be a better solution for you than Windows is get a good  you get a good like Lenovo Carbon X1 touch.  I think someone said that in the chat room.  But Linux on it really.  Yeah, those are that's a really nice, very lightweight, very powerful laptop.  I'm not crazy about somebody's mentioning Amiduo, so I'm not we played with that for  a while, that's a that's a not a good choice.  It's just too clunky.  All right. Enough of this.  All right. Enough of that.  Now, Stacey, I didn't mean to be whiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wonderful, happy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  There we go.  This mustache quite a does it quite fit my face, I guess.  I need to be squishier.  Wait, if I back up, does it?  OK, I'm going to do this all day. All right, I'll stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can size it. Just stop moving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Staying still.  I was going to ask if you tried Google Express because you can now do it from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Home. What is Google Express?  Is that ordering food?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. It's ordering food, which apparently  or Costco or Costco or Bed Bath and Beyond.  Pure. I haven't tried it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So because I buy stuff on the Amazon Echo all the time.  I mean, like every day, I'll say, oh, we're out of, you know,  we were out of Splenda yesterday. I ordered twelve hundred packets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like, dear God.  I'm going to not even silently judge you for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But OK, I don't I'm not the Splenda consumer.  I never touch the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is Google has made deals with lots of  different stores and have you done it?  Have you done it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I signed up so I could do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's do it right now. What would you like?  Why don't you order some margarita mix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I already have margarita mix.  We always have margarita mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Bevmo is one of the let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you should order some tequila.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tequila.  You probably can't get alcoholic.  I would guess you can't get alcoholic beverages.  What good is this service?  I mean, I'm willing to bet, but you can't get lemon and lime juice  and you can get a can of goat milk.  Goat milk.  Curry people.  Donuts, coffee, fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good. They have fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know, but I don't think we have a fries near here.  Let's go to the South Bay because I love fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they have king cakes at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's Mardi Gras.  Huh? It is.  Les ailes bon temps rouler, baby.  Let's let me see here.  King cakes.  Yes, I can get gluten free king cake.  Okay, that is disgusting.  It's all it's all mixes.  It's the.  But they have sur la table, which means you can get some pretty serious  cooking stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're having to look online to see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's just because we're browsing it.  Oh, because you're browsing.  You know what you want.  If you know, if you if let's say I run out of,  I don't know, snacks, I could just I would what I would go.  Hey, Google,  buy me some Doritos.  And then what does it does it query you?  Is there a process?  You have to probably have to put your card in, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yes, you would have.  But don't you it doesn't have your credit card information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could buy a nest.  You could buy a lot of stuff.  All right, I'm going to have to try it because I do do a lot of shopping that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a fee, but it's waived up until a certain time that I do not remember.  I think it's the end of April.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe try express membership free for  three months, free same day delivery, uneligible orders.  Otherwise, membership is ninety five dollars a year or ten dollars a month.  And then there is a delivery fee, you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't  let's see, I think it's the fee for Google Express that is waived.  So you can try it out with the ninety five dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can try it free instead of ninety five.  So I want to become a member.  All right. That was pretty easy.  You're right, because they have my credit card.  And now I could shop either on the web or better with Google Home.  I could say, send me something.  That's kind of neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know what I find with the  the Amazon Echo is it's often stuff, you know, staples or things I just ran out of  and I just rather than make a shopping list, just go.  Send me some.  Which is probably bad for the because of the pollution of the truck and stuff, but.  They don't I don't know.  Is it bad? Tell me it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if it's OK.  I think it's kind of bad.  I would love, you know, I would love to say, hey, add this to my list.  And at the end, like every Friday or something, say, consolidate my list and send  me these items. It's a good idea, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We actually, you know, that was one of the key.  It was one of the key insights when McDonald's started is the consolidation.  Rather than having the ketchup truck go to every single McDonald's,  they went to a consolidator and all the ketchup was put together with the pickles  and with the mustard and then delivered to the McDonald's.  Right. That's right. We would get one delivery a week with a big exactly.  Yeah, that was that was a big  supply chain innovation in the day.  So why not at a consumer level?  Yeah. Do you want this now or for a slight discount in your in your in your  every week delivery?  Imagine if you had that that that habit of knowing every Friday you're going to  get a delivery. Oh, I'm going to add that to my delivery.  You'd buy a huck of a lot more because you just throw it into your delivery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon's funny because they will put them together and sometimes you'll buy  something and they'll say, well, we're not we can't deliver this unless you buy  some other things and then we'll throw it in the box.  And then sometimes you buy six things all at once and they send you six different  boxes. It's just unpredictable what Amazon's going to do box wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they also not everything comes from the same distribution.  That's probably my guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can get  hardware to.  Light bulbs, I can get all my dollar ninety nine LED light bulbs from Max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, if there's a capacitive touch sync,  you just buy that sucker right now because it is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. You just touch your sink and the water flows.  Yeah. Really?  It's really have a very modern home.  I do kind of like the Jetsons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the best thing ever, except when like people come over or I go to other  places and then I'm hitting people's sinks and they're like, what are you doing?  And I'm like, it doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Use the keyboard.  The keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Quaint talk to the talk to the sink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does Andrew have a case built that he can walk the dog on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good idea.  Should I tell you about how Andrew got very upset with me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is in regards to the Logitech Home Hub.  So we had and I don't think this is  Logitech's fault, I think this is user error.  You got the Harmony, right?  This is the Harmony.  Yeah.  So first, the Harmony Hub only accepts eight connected objects that it will control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I broke the Harmony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a bigger one that's more expensive that can handle more, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, they do.  But they don't really market that as much to normal people.  Right.  So I was like, OK, I'm not going to add my light bulbs and all this.  Auto discovery was lovely.  It found a lot of things on my system, like all my sodas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My experience also, because we both did this at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  So I have a Roku 4 Plus thing, I think.  And so I installed that and that was, again, the installation was actually super easy.  The first time it didn't work.  So I should say I tried this.  I tried the Logitech Harmony two years ago and it was a much more difficult set of process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was really pretty easy.  I agree with you. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because if it didn't work, it was basically the most common issue is  apparently needing to add wait times to things.  Right.  So it would automatically do that,  which is great because most people are not going to be like, oh, it's that.  That's a hard thing to think of if you're not used to that.  Right.  So that was really nice.  But I didn't buy the remote control because I really just wanted the Echo turn on the TV thing.  Me too.  And it does break the Roku controller, which I also expected.  And I had my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute. You can't use your remote or Roku remote anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the Roku remote doesn't work.  And my husband bought it because he wanted you can actually plug in the headphones on  the remote and listen to them and that feature just went away completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I didn't have that problem.  I wrote my Roku remote still works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So there we go, because that was my question.  And the crazy part is so because last night,  Andrew, who is a very patient, tolerant person, he must be kind of  he kind of yelled, he kind of had a final.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Straw.  I put up with the lights that go on in the middle of the night in Purple Hue.  I put up with the oven that automatically cooks the bacon.  I put up with the sink that you don't have a faucet.  But this is the last straw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Honey, that and I feel bad because  the poor man just wanted to watch TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lisa, I know it's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I spent like Friday evening, like half an hour going.  Echo, turn on Roku, turn on Roku.  I don't know what you're talking about, Roku.  I don't know what you're talking about.  The stupid thing is, I said to Lisa, come on, watch.  Let me show you how this works before I actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, don't ever do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm learning.  I should have a private session with the Harmony and the Alexa before I invited  spectators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so everyone's telling me the Roku still worked.  But what's crazy is I uninstalled everything because I wanted to go into your

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Roku setup because you can repair your remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I did that. I repaired everything.  Then it still didn't work.  So then I took everything.  I manually removed all the devices.  I took everything off the network.  It's still a reboot.  It still doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that was independent  because I never I never in fact, I wouldn't have done it if I had thought that  that would break the Roku remote.  I mean, you can't you can't.  I don't I don't want the hub to replace existing remote.  I just want it to be an adjunct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this OK, so that means because I'm  like, is this because I didn't order the fancy remote?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. In fact, everybody in the chat, I'm saying no, no, including me,  the Roku remote continued to work for me without a problem, which is good because  I echo turn on Netflix, watch Netflix.  I couldn't.  There's some I haven't I have to sit down and spend some time with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so yeah, so OK, I feel better and I will I will go back to this with renewed  vigor and purpose because I was just like, yes, I did check the batteries for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I do have a kind of a frustrating  period of time where it was turning off the TiVo instead of turning it on.  You know, we get out of sync and we state.  Yeah. And I know so far.  But if you go to the computer app, you you can't do this on the phone.  But if you go to the website and do is you can say don't touch, don't mess with the TiVo.  That's that's I know the Tivo's needed to change channels, but don't turn it on or off.  So there's some refinement to the commands  you can give it when you're actually on online with it.  But it's pretty good.  It's gotten a lot better.  It was already good.  The Harmony one was a fan was fantastic because Logitech, when they bought  Harmony, one of the things Harmony did that they have a database of all the home  entertainment stuff and over time that's become super complete.  So you don't have to enter in codes or anything.  It just knows everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what I loved about it.  I was like, dang, AV ease.  And I thought I really thought this was going to be a quick setup.  And I should never think that anymore.  Never, never, ever, ever is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can show you if I can log into my account, is it my it's probably my Harmony.com, right?  Oh, Lord, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've just been working from the app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the computer,  at least for the setup, you're going to want to use the computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, because the app works just fine.  I know, but there's more you can do, I think.  OK, like turn on my use my Roku remote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Was it the app or the no, no, it was a desktop software, not the app.  It has desktop software that that's put that on the computer and then.  But that's just for the that's like for the fine tuning.  And then you don't have to ever use it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You got my vampire face there.  Let me see that again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just sprinkled holy water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, is that what you call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know this.  We're we're not getting voice over LTE on Project Fi.  I thought we were, but apparently they're now testing  Volte or Volts or voice over LTE calling for a small group of users on Google Fi.  So  we do get on T-Mobile anyway, we get Wi-Fi calling, which sounds very good.  And Vio LTE would sound probably as good if it started using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if we have Wi-Fi calling on T-Mobile all the way back in like the dark ages,  it was hardware dependent. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  T-Mobile started supporting it, but your phone had to support it as well.  But when a phone does, it's awesome.  Like Lisa, who's going back to Verizon, said, I'll miss that.  It's really when we talk, it's it's like I'm at home on Wi-Fi.  She's here on Wi-Fi.  It sounds like we're in the same room.  It's like Skype. It's like this. Right.  It's like Skype.  So if you go to cellular network settings on your Pixel or your Nexus,  let me just see.  You may have an additional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I only had an update on this phone in a while.  Really? You're here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got an update last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you Pixeled?  Yeah, of course I am.  We got the February.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Am I the Pope?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you the old Pope or the young Pope?  I got the  security update, the February security update last week.  You should have gotten that at least, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So where am I going?  Settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Cellular network.  Right. Then where?  Cellular network settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you should see enhanced LTE mode.  If you if you've it's apparently not everywhere.  So I don't see it on mine, I don't think.  So wait a minute. Cellular networks.  I only see data roaming.  I don't have all that stuff.  Yeah.  All that fancy stuff.  So maybe that's because I'm on Wi-Fi.  Maybe you have to go outside.  And and and I don't know.  Still, it's a setting. You'd probably put it on anything.  We think, right?  It's only testing it on T-Mobile's network  because Sprint and US Cellular don't have Volte support.  But if if you're you know, your phone will use T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you move from one place to another, you're on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just depends.  You know how your phone chooses the best network.  So if you're always in a T-Mobile area where T-Mobile is strong,  then you should be able to use it then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Could you now tell which network you're on with?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I have to use that that program I told you.  Yeah, that's smart.  Signal spy, signal spy.  That's it.  Google is making blue jeans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, is this the Levi's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's because they're really blue.  Blue. Oh, my God, they are blue.  Isn't that isn't that horrible?  That's to go with the really blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  phone.  They have a new pixel.  It's really, really blue.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that color blue.  Am I blue?  I wouldn't wear it.  If I were there, I would people would think I was the mailman.  That's about as bad as wearing red pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have shoes that color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're a woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're allowed to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the color of the lower third.  Andrew has a belt that color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, you would blend in.  It's the color of the lower third and the background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd blend in. I could stand up and you wouldn't know I was wearing pants.  Dear Google boss.  Or that you have a lower half of your body.  Dear Google boss, my name is Chloe.  And when I am bigger, I would like a job with Google.  I also want to work in a chocolate factory and do swimming in the Olympics.  I go swimming Saturdays and Tuesdays.  My dad said I could sit on beanbags and go  down slides and ride in carts and a job in Google.  I like computers, too.  And I have a tablet I play games on.  My dad gave me a game where I have to move a robot up and down squares.  He said it will be good for me to learn about computers.  My dad said he will get me a computer one day.  I am seven years old.  And my teachers tell my mom and dad, I'm very good in class.  So she wants a job.  She's from Hereford, UK.  And she got a response to Narpa Chai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Answered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's the here's the reply.  Dear Chloe, I look forward to receiving your job application when you're finished  with school. Thank you so much for your letter.  I'm glad you like computers and robots and hope you continue to learn about technology.  Cute science and Narpa Chai.  Isn't that sweet?  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  He could have sent her a Chromebook if they were still making them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that would help better than that robot.  That tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you were talking about one of the Boston Dynamics robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here you go, kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  German parents have been told.  Destroy my friend Kayla.  She was spy on you.  German watchdog classifies the my friend  Kayla doll as an illegal espionage apparatus and says shops and owners could  face fines for selling her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is how you do IoT device security.  You actually have an effective stick and then companies will be like, oh,  buy better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have visions of parents tearing off the head of the doll with the crying daughter.  The Google told me to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently, in a German law, you may not sell, manufacture or even possess  surveillance devices disguised as other objects.  With the potential jail term up to two years.  This doll was one of the top 10 toys of the year in 2014.  Awarded that by the German Toy Trade Association.  But, but get ready.  This is exactly what you're saying, Stacey.  Access to the doll's camera is completely unsecured.  There is no password.  Hackers could access the doll via its Bluetooth connection from up to 15  meters away, listening in on conversations as well as speaking directly to the child  playing with it.  You know what? You're right, Stacey.  This is you just need a stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, also, this doll is creepy as heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My friend Kayla, does your daughter have my friend Kayla?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, she does not.  Did you ever get this American girl?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She was for like a hot second.  Mine was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we have like three of them.  Yeah, I had the complete set.  And we went to Chicago to the American Girl Doll Store and Museum and had surgery  performed on one of them because she cut the hair off of the doll because she  did not know that it didn't grow back.  She just thought, oh, you give them a little trim.  So we got new hair put in.  My. Yeah.  Anyway, there's a boy now, American Girl Doll Boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He plays the drums.  He's kind of like a super expensive accessory for your American Girl Doll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly like Ken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all Ken ever was.  But Ken was not one hundred and ten dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's my friend Kayla.  You ready?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ask Kayla almost anything.  What's your name?  My name is Kayla and yours is Abby.  She understands you.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so does the neighbor next door.  He's looking at you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's this?  The Eiffel Tower in France.  Incredible.  Nice move.  Kayla, what are you wearing, little girl?  I hear that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's fun.  This is techno panic striking again.  Well, this is actually if it's not secured, that's not good.  Oh, that's secure.  Yes, that part. That part.  But but having a camera in a doll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is the camera available via Bluetooth?  What is that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You couldn't send visual data via Bluetooth.  It's not unless it was really low resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So your parents could spy or something.  I don't know.  Google wants people to be able to see you while you're doing VR.  So they're experimenting

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with a fake face on your VR headset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you pick a different face?  Because that would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you'd only get different eyes.  Well, that could still go to the next photo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they've they've also.  Oh, that's so creepy.  Now, is that his face? Are they clear or no?  It makes believe it's clear.  Oh,  the so so it's still it's still an opaque headset, but your face appears on the  front of it because it's using a 3D scan model of your face that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they apply to the outside.  Really? Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, dude, like I would totally buy like little like cat eyes or like funny things,  but I don't want my actual it actually it gazes and blink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it takes it actually scans a variety of expressions.  So you see his eyes are blinking and looking and  it also color corrects the face to match the lighting of the rest of the rest of

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the user. Oh, Jeff, you would be white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should get this for you, Jeff.  This is weird. It's just, you know, it's just trying stuff.

They're, of course, going to do a drawing again.  So you sign in.  And let me see, should I do this?  I probably should have already have.  I'm already here to have.  OK, yeah, but but I want to get press.  I don't want to or should I apply anyway?  They're not free, right?  No, they're not free.  We want to do Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Talk to your buddies at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But nobody's at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that Matt Cat, what is is Matt still  running the code code for America group?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See the digital defense agents, the defense digital.  Yes, he's still there.  Yep. Yep.  I talked to him. He's he's the boss of a couple of people.  I know. Yeah. Yeah. Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the Wall Street Journal for a long time, when you clicked a link to the Wall  Street Journal from Google News, you bypassed it was an end around the paywall  and you could read the article first click free.  It was a feature that Google offered Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sampling, did Google pay the journal for that?  No, no, no, no.  They offered it for sampling so that you could you could get through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it was a Google program.  It was a yeah, it was a Google option.  First click free Wall Street Journal is pulling out of it.  So now you have to pay.  There's just no way around it.  Paywalls are a are a religion there.  I pay for the Wall Street Journal.  So it's you know, it's part of my job for a while.  Couple years ago, I kind of have to for for the show.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, we could talk about Joanna Stern's article about what was it?  Oh, let's not talk about it.  It's about it's about female assistance,  but I realized I don't have an opinion on it, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why the problem with all female digital assistance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Where was it?  I was told years ago that  GPS in Italy  had to be men because the Italian men wouldn't listen to a woman giving  directions.  Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I always thought that it was  it came from research and it turned out this was debunked, that fighter pilots  were more likely this goes back to the voices in the cockpit that would say  things like pull up, pull up.  They were always female because men respond like when they're blacking out or  getting out to female voices better than men, that gets their mother.  So that that I was always told that's why in fighter pilot,  but they called her bitch and Betty.  Did you know that?  Yeah.  Did we talk about that on the show?  I think we did. I feel like we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like, I have learned a lot about  fighter pilots while participating in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The show is all about the fighter pilots.  However, I have my Siri for my iPhone with a male voice because you have the choice.  But you don't with Google and you don't  with Cortana and you don't with the Echo, right?  You're stuck with that one.  What does that say about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You want to hang around with guys or see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the problem, right?  Right here is the problem.  This is the problem.  You can't have a man's voice because your buddies are you like him better than her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where we are.  For some reason, actually, this is more of an issue.  Does I don't know if Joanna mentions it.  These female voices all sound a little snarky, don't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I hear he sounds snarky.  I don't think the echo sounds snarky and Google doesn't sound really snarky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they do that because if if they what they're trying to do is bend  over backwards not to sound all high, I'm the female assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think so.  No, I think maybe it sounds like that to you because you're thinking women should  only sound available or angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Isn't that the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I'm thinking they don't sound that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Available or angry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that my choice?  Well, that's how some some people that's how they view women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're angry. Yeah, no.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's almost like they chose angry over available, right?  Well, maybe not quite angry, more like passive aggressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's not that way, though, or it's not that way.  You don't think he sounds that way.  OK, Siri kind of does sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. Well, let me see.  OK, you know, you're right.  I don't think the Google assistant sounds that way.  You're right.  And I can't remember what the echo.  Or she just sounds kind of robot.  I would almost prefer a robotic voice, actually.  They  are robotic.  They do sound robotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they sound robotic.  They don't sound like humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we're going to go.  Who are you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Who are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I know a lot of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, she's perky.  That's perky.  She's perky.  She's friendly.  She's enthusiastic.  She's.  You figure you'd figure that an Apple product would sound snotty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it does figure, doesn't it?  Kind of in their in their conscience, consciousness.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Anything else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What should we talk about?  I got I just looking at other stories.  It's a stock.  Did you see that there there we found a  a  sun with seven Earth size that excited me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I watched some of that.  That's very exciting until I realized they said a jet speed.  It would take 44 million years to get there.  Yeah.  It's a jet speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No one's going to travel through space at jet speed.  It's 40 light years away.  It's quite it's a long way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I it's long enough that that's why these people haven't visited us.  It's a long trip.  They need to get like a camper van.  So what I wanted to know is if it's a if it's if it's a red dwarf, does that mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that the the the light you get is is red?  It's red.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Redder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Redder.  So actually, I just I just read a long article by Yonatan's  Zungar, the Google engineer who is his great who is explaining.  It really goes the long way around to explain why barns are painted red.  And that's the kind of thing you do.  Yeah.  In in that I learned that for life, at least as we know it, there's a very  fairly narrow range of colors from the sun.  And of course, we have evolved to see that the sun is red.  Evolved to see that range of colors, not ultraviolet, not infrared,  but the colors, the you know, the primary main colors from the sun.  And and then it goes on to explain  because of the the lifecycle of stars and and and supernovas and novus that there's  a lot of iron oxide, a preponderance of iron oxide in the earth's  crust.  And it turns out iron oxide is a perfect pigment for red paint.  And because it's plentiful, it's cheap.  And that's why barns are painted red.  And not purple, because you've got to get purple from slugs.  I thought it was the sun.  Sea snail mucus.  What do they have to do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where did the sun go?  I get the I get the iron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, what I'm saying is if these are earth, they're earth sized and they do  believe these are, you know, at least several of them are Goldilocks  temperatures, right?  Well, that really limits the range of colors that the sun could be.  It could be slightly redder than ours, but not but not too much redder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or so all of our cheap red barn paint we could bring there and it would still be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  reddish. They well, that's well, that's what's interesting.  If aliens have eyes, they probably see the same colors we do or something close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, dogs and other animals see in infrared.  That's true. I don't know if dogs see in infrared, but other other life forms on  the earth have evolved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Into different ways.  Yeah, for their particular niche.  Super cool stars known as red dwarfs have become popular for exoplanet hunters  because you can see the planets better.  The suns aren't so bright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's like the joke about the drunk looking for his quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's not. He's looking under the light because he can see better.  Yes. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's me and that guy at Exoplanet Hunters.  That's a dad joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Definitely a dad joke.  OK, there's there's an AMA with the NASA scientists.  We do that. It's very open. It's very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NASA is really good at this because  that's they realize if they're going to get funding, they better be good at  marketing and outreach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They should find a really easy to get to asteroid with lots of very expensive  metals on it because that's what Trump would put them to use for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what we want.  Well, gold would be the best.  Gold is the best color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, what are some of the minerals we're running out of?  Like, well, helium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, water would be a good choice these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The transporting water from space is going to be very expensive.  Well, the thing about these solidization plants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.  These seven planets is they're they're much closer to each other.  They're they're five times the distance from from Earth to the moon.  I mean, so you could kind of export things from one planet to the next.  Oh, you could, you know, get all pissed off and move to the next planet.  Trump's president, I'm moving out of here.  I'm going to another planet.  I'm going to another planet.  All right. Now.  Go ahead.  I just want to say, I may somebody said  to the scientists that was your chance to use the phrase prime directive in a  serious way, you blew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The prime directive is you can't do anything to change the civilization of the planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the scientists goes back and says, lol, we don't have a prime directive,  but we do have a planetary protection policy.  Really?  It's sort of like the prime directive, but very real.  Basically, we don't want to go looking  for life only to find that we brought it with us from right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's kind of the same thing.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, oh, hold on.  This just in this just in there's a somebody did a profile on the woman in charge of that.  Oh, and it's awesome.  Here it is. I think it's this one.  Let me just make sure it's a woman in charge of it.  And she talked to this thing in this profile about how  basically everybody hates her.  Oh, it's wired.  It is the article headline is Martians might be real.  That makes Mars exploration way more complicated.  And it's from last year.  And this woman named like I think it's  Cassie Conley basically is in charge.  This is her job is to prevent NASA.  From contaminating life on Earth,  they hate her because she comes in and she's like, nope, we got to spend 10 more hours.  She's like fixing this so people don't you know, so we don't bring bacteria to Mars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that cool? I thought this was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Cassie.  You're right, Cassie Conley.  So there are a lot of women at NASA, actually.  We've interviewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see hidden figures?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. No, I didn't.  But I but I saw the trailer.  Does that count?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you should go see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I took my daughter. It's on my list.  Yes. It would be a good thing to take your daughter to.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. That was that was my excitement over Lady at NASA, whose job it is to ruin  people's lives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, we didn't talk about Uber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, boy, that was unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So a Uber engineer at Uber  wrote a medium post talking about she no longer is at Uber, talking about her  experiences with Uber HR and sexual harassment.  And while she was there,  not only Susan J.  Fowler is in her name, not only did she experience really just horrific,  I guess it wasn't on medium, it was on her blog.  I apologize. Susan J. Fowler dot com.  A horrific experience.  But she noted that female engineers declined.  I think by the time she left from.  It was still not a massive proportion,  but of over 150 engineers on the team that she was on, which was software  reliability, only three percent were women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the time she left, her organization was when she joined Uber,  the organization she was part of was over 25 percent women,  three percent when she left.  But by the time she was transferring, trying to transfer to another engineering  organization, it had dropped down to less than six percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And she was there what, about a year, right?  Yeah.  And in that time, it's just it's almost Kafkaesque  the way she was treated, the denial.  And then, of course, Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber, said, well, I can't believe  I'm shocked. And they actually they've I mean, to their credit,  they appointed Eric Holder, former attorney general Eric Holder, to a  independent investigatory commission committee to to get to the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Ariana tried to cover her tracks as a board member.  Oh, she was furious.  She was furious. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I saw her response.  In fact, it's her response that that led me to Susan Fowler's piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I happened to read somebody's tweeted the piece right after it went up.  And so I happened to I then I watched  the storm, which was fascinating to see.  But I'm sorry.  We've known that Uber is a culture of jerks and worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the beginning, it's the real really the bro grammars thing.  And the sad thing was that the HR was protecting  the bros, the bros and managers who were acting completely horrifically  towards female employees.  And, you know, it was  it's just it's very sad.  I got I just it's terrible.  So  I think this is going to really add to the  the no Uber movement.  What is it called the way you hashtag delete Uber?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Stacey can't have it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no Uber in Austin because you got taxis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know, guys coming in, people who are coming in for South by Southwest.  Let me just tell you right now.  Right, Austin Fair, Asson.  Good.  And Wings with a G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, Austin. Wings with a Z.  Wings with a G would be just wings.  Wings with a Zed wings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I actually was the last time I was out South by Southwest.  Uber is sponsoring the petty caps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My friend is a co-owner in that petty cap business.  It was a good deal for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was I was funded.  I wrote it everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, we have to go back to this because I.  Read this and not only did my head feel like it was about to explode, but.  I feel like.  In watching some of the original comments,  because I also saw this when it came when it went out, because I.  This is the stuff I live for.  So many people were, a, saying to her,  a stop whining or how do we know this is true?  Yes, yes.  Early comments had a lot of that.  But you still see this here is there's a lot of comments in here saying, get thee  to a lawyer, which because that's the only way we're going to hold these guys accountable.  And in one sense, totally correct.  But I think it is so frustrating when women report these things and.  The instant response is, well, God, why didn't you sue when we have  seen women sue for sexual harassment and seen how hard it is?  Yes. So I would like to say, yay, lady, for doing this.  I have a friend who runs a HR at a very  large publicly traded company and has done a couple of these in the tech world.  And she's like, I would never hire anyone who's worked in an HR capacity at Uber.  She's like, none based on this.  Yeah. And that's what we need.  We need people like the board members say,  because I'm sorry, this is not an isolated problem.  And she this woman clearly paints how not an isolated problem it is.  But people who think they are engaging in,  quote unquote, locker room talk in the workplace just frequent stop it.  It is. Yeah, it is enraging.  And there are so many women.  I mean, we see this.  We saw this on stage at the presidential debate, but  it's not funny, it's not helpful.  And if you do it, you are just alienating half the population around you,  your customer base and people like me who are way too aggressive, not too aggressive,  who are really aggressive and will speak out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, uh, uh.  Well, it also makes me sad because this is why there's so little diversity in tech.  It's just not it can be very hostile to not just one of the minorities.  Yeah, it should make you angry.  Well, it makes me angry, but it hurts everybody.  It hurts.  It absolutely hurts everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People don't think that it hurts everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People, it's even if it's not about us, it's wrong.  It's incredibly wrong.  Yeah.  Diversity is is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just a political point of view when it comes to tech.  If you don't have a diverse workforce, you don't have diverse products.  You don't have products that work for everybody.  You have products that work for programmers.  And it's not good for the business.  It's not good for us as users.  So even if you have that, yeah, because people

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  complaining about sexual assault and that sort of thing was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's the pronoun problem, too.  Yeah, all sorts of things, you know, little big and little.  But but obviously what happened to her was very big and is shameful.  And, you know, I think writing a blog post, that's a pretty good way to get back at them.  Oh, it was it was well documented.  I mean, she did a really, really good job.  It wasn't, you know, and she had been documenting it all along.  And at one point was told to stop doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, this is this is kind of different.  So you remember the woman who complained about not having a living wage while  working on customer service for.  Was it Airbnb?  Was it help me out here, guys?  This is like a year and a half ago.  Oh, it was in some Bay Area company and everyone got mad at that company  for a hot second and she kind of came across as more entitled than this woman  who did a really good job, I guess, in.  That line anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's also the Ellen Chow, not Ellen Chow, she's Ellen Powell,  Ellen Powell. That's right.  There's an example, by the way, of  why women don't go to lawyers often because it can, you know, she  who did she sue? She went against was a Perkins.  AP, that's right.  And lost in a very brutal repulsive trial.  And it was damaging, very damaging to her.  That's that's why people don't.  Is she she left Reddit the next, right?  She went to Reddit, was there briefly, and now she's running as we know,  because she was the one complaining at Y.C. about Peter Thiel's presence.  She's running that diversity focused startup with.  I don't know if she's in Y.C. I think she is.  Anyway, but that's exactly why you don't sue,  because you don't want to go through that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Among other reasons. Yeah, there are lots of reasons.  Yeah, I like the blog post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The blog post worked.  I think that was a good way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It had to be really hard to write it without  anger.  It was it just let the facts speak for themselves.  It was really well written.  It was it was it was it was very directed.  She deserved anger.  She deserved a few FUs to the place and she didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She didn't. And of all the complaints  that we've been seeing all along about Uber, this is the one that seems like this  might do the most to change either change the culture or bring Uber down.  I think.  We'll see. It's a pretty big company with lots of funding.  Yep. Google is just having so much fun with artificial intelligence.  This new one is a music playing piano bot.  That digests whatever keyboard melodies you give it and tries to respond in kind.  It's called A.I. Duet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hi, I'm your Tom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's a coder and musician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is an experiment called A.I. Duet.  It uses machine learning to let you play a duet with the computer.  Wow. Making music.  It's like dueling banjos.  But machine learning gives us a different way to go about it.  If I was trying to make A.I. Duet with more traditional programming,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd have to write out lots of rules like you feel like we're at the day's day's  moment, kind of getting closer to how 9000.  This is neat.  This is your time.  Did this in conjunction with the creative lab and Magenta, which is Google's open  source computational music and art project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it analyzed tons of music to understand  how it should continue on rather than a rule set and it learned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about a I haven't seen this, a phone  app that wraps about what it sees through your phone's camera.  It's called Georgiocam.  This is another one from the same group, A.I. experiments.  I haven't seen this one.  Hi, I'm your time. Oh, it's your time.  He's back. They're coders and musicians with machine learning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can now take a picture and have a computer tell you exactly what it sees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wear glasses, vision care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We wanted to see if we could do something fun with this.  And we had an idea.  What if the computer turned the things that it saw into lyrics of a song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could even rhyme about them.  We've got glasses in this spot.  Could be I wear, but maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are two parts in recognition for seeing things and speech.  What can you walk?  She's just thrown up. What can you walk?  Every once in a while, we use the Cloud Vision API.  You can just send it a picture and it returns labels for what it sees,  along with the confidence scores started really getting fun when we brought in a  song made by one of our musical heroes, Georgiomiroder.  Yeah, all right.  And for the computer's voice,  we used an open source project called Mary TTS combined with the Web Audio API.  This let us add effects to the computer's voice and sync it to the beat.  We've got glasses in this spot.  We had our friends try it out and had a lot of fun pointing it at all kinds of things.  Is that food I see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's plucked string instruments on my screen.  Screen, screen, could be profession, but maybe not.  Knock, knock.  Looks like world to me.  Me, me.  Taking that camera operator, you've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  call it Georgiocam.  And it's just one example of how you can use.  I want it. I want it.  How do I get it?  You can play with it and get the code at g.co slash AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how g.co slash AI experiments.  It's it's on GitHub.  Anything else you guys want to talk about before we take a break and do our  picks and numbers and all that stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  That was really sharp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you pissed off some people.  I really did with that five kilohertz tone that really annoying people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.  That was really annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really apologize.  I didn't want to come back.  No, I don't have anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like I feel like we're always on the brink, Stacey, at any given show  of it being your last show of you just walking out the door.  I'm never coming back.  Is that my am I an error on that or is that actually true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I love coming on.  I just I'm a I'm a bantery, teasy kind of person.  We didn't talk about Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be we'll do that in my pick.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, so I did find the taxonomy of fake news.  The Claire Wardell did.  It's on the rundown.  I see it.  Do you want to look at it?  Just real quick, real quickly.  It's kind of interesting.  Authentic, authentic material used the wrong context.  Imposter news sites designed to look like brands we already know.  Fake news sites, its own category, fake  information, manipulated content, parody content.  So there's a range and not all of it is fake news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's much you know, I really was so uncomfortable with this whole fake  news thing and I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  But I think the taxonomy helps a lot because not not all fake news is created  equal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And that's the economic piece.  There's also the political piece, which is propaganda.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Propaganda isn't necessarily lies.  It's it's slanted, but it's not necessarily lies.  In fact, it's best if it has a grain of truth in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're bringing nuance to this argument,  and that's like bringing a knife to a gunfight.  I don't know if this is going to help anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've given up. I don't.  I've decided to.  My new motto is  take a nap.  No more resist. I'm taking a nap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mine is shopping.  Go shopping online at Nordstrom's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Keep the economy going.  I'm going to shop with my Google home.  All right. Yes, this is good.  I'm going to read this. This is good.  I mean, is it helpful to have a taxonomy?  I think it is. I think so.  It's certainly helpful in the process of filtering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We saw Don Lemon on CNN.  Somebody came on and just wanted to disagree with something.  And the guy said that's fake news.  He walked out.  Lemon said, you know, that's.  He ended the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, I'm done with that.  That's it.  Just because you don't like something doesn't make it fake.  And he not only kicked the guy off, he ended the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which was there.  I'm not a huge.  I'm not a huge Don Lemon fan, but Don did great.  I am now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've done that, but this is a podcast.  I can walk out.  But I can't. I mean, that's CNN.  They got this. Something's got to come back after this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey's going to do that to us next week.  I know. That's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any moment, she said, you guys have fake hair and just gone.  Yeah, just duck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wait, no, I've got a better solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, hey, you're not the only one that can do that.  All right.  Let me actually shouldn't have done that because I have to wrap this thing up.  Our show today brought to you by a little robot pal that's happy to be with you.  And you will be happy to have by your side.  I'm talking Curry for Mayfield Robotics.  So cute.  I was just looking at my pictures of Curry and I took pictures of all the Curry  prototypes. It was so much fun.  We went down to Mayfield Robotics and visited.  And I have to say I didn't really get how lovable Curry was until I really  encountered her. Anybody who went to CES and spent some time with Curry  probably will agree. She blinks.  She nods. She doesn't talk.  They were very smart.  They made some decisions about Curry  not to make it too humanoid so that it stays away from that uncanny valley,  that creepy effect.  She's not saying anything but creepy.  She kind of reminds me of Rosie from The Jetsons.  She's kind of tubby, but she's got a lot of sophisticated technology.  She's got sensors in her head, cameras.  She's got radar.  She's got a heart light like ET that can light up in any color of the rainbow.  Special sensors that keep her from falling downstairs.  But she's got like treads in her feet so she can go over door jams.  She can wander around your house.  She can patrol.  As she patrols, she makes a radar map of your home.  And then you can assign names to the room.  So you can say this is the curry.  This is the kitchen.  Curry, this is the living room.  And then you can say things like, Curry,  go check the couch in the living room and see if the dog's on it and send me a  picture back because Curry's camera is connected to the Internet.  Curry also has very good stereo speakers and array mics in there.  She's got four MEMS based array mics so that she can hear and respond,  play music, listen to podcasts.  She can come and wake you up in the morning and then you can say, OK,  Curry, continue to play my podcast.  I want to keep listening to Twig, but follow me around.  And you can go make breakfast, brush your teeth and she'll just follow you around.  If she stands in groups, she'll look from person to person.  She recognizes people, very expressive eyes and her beeps and boops.  You know, pretty soon you start to and this is smart.  You project onto her this personality.  It's so cool.  And of course, when she gets low on battery,  she's smart enough to go back to her home, doc and charge up.  Kids love her.  You can have you have video over with the cats.  I don't I didn't bring her home.  We went down there. I want to I'm on the list.  You can actually get on the list if you want a preorder.  You have to put in a refundable, totally refundable, hundred dollar deposit.  And I have one because I told him I want the first one off the line.  Five hundred ninety nine remaining at time of a shipment, which will be later  this year, probably around holidays or just before, maybe the fall, including taxes  and shipping, curry, KURI.  You can find out more at HeyCurry.com  H E Y K U R I dot com.  This will be I really think I believe your kids will later in life when they grow up.  They'll say, I remember we got our first robot.  It was in twenty seventeen.  She was so cute. I loved her so much, Curry.  And then I went to college and she couldn't come with me or whatever.  Hey,  hey, Curry, H E Y K U R I dot com.  Take a look.  And if you want to put down a deposit,  hundred dollars and it's completely refundable to get curry later this year.  I think it's so cool.  I really I'm excited about this.  Now, now let us talk.  I'm just going to look, Stacey.  OK, you're you got what I see what you're going to do.  But we can open the conversation about this.  OK, this is actually.  Yeah. Can John, can you plug this in?  Because I want to show you the screen on this.  This is the Amplify Wi-Fi mesh Wi-Fi from Ubiquiti.  Ubiquiti pretty much created this category  for enterprise of mesh Wi-Fi routers, and they're really great.  A lot of people use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wouldn't you say Meraki created it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Meraki did. But Ubiquiti's been around longer than Meraki.  And, yeah, really?  Yeah. Ubiquiti's been in business for a very long time.  And the problem with Ubiquiti is they're used in enterprise.  We've used them for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they started out making Wisp equipment for Wisps.  And I knew about them, but I didn't  realize they were doing enterprise routers that long ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so. When did Meraki start?  I remember Meraki when their original business.  Yeah, their original business was to be captive portals, right?  You would have a Meraki router in your house and it would become a captive  portal that you could share with other people.  And then they pivoted.  They pivoted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, because.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. In any event, we don't have to debate that.  But Ubiquiti's been around a long time, let's put it that way.  They make all sorts of great network gear.  And the enterprise Ubiquiti Wi-Fi is the best.  But they never made a home unit.  In fact, their enterprise stuff, a lot of people used in their homes,  but very complicated.  I'd have a Java based browser on a PC to control them and so forth.  So they've created now a home version.  Now there's two. There's the Amplify HF and the Amplify HD.  This is the HD.  So a little over three hundred dollars for three units.  Like a lot of these meshes, this is the base unit.  It has a WAN port for your go to your cable modem and then it had or your DSL  modem and then has four ethernet ports, gigabit ethernet ports.  It also has a USB jack.  And I'm guessing that that's  actually I didn't read up on it, but I would guess you could put a hard drive in there.  It's very nicely designed.  I would say of all of them, this is the prettiest, including an OLED screen  that you can tap. It'll tell you the time of day once you've configured it.  It helps you configure it on the screen.  But it also if you tap it, you can see how much throughput.  So you can see how much bandwidth you've used this month right on the front screen.  You can see its IP address.  A lot of the information you'd want to know is available right there in the front  of the router. And when it's not doing that, it's just showing you a nice time  of day and so forth.  It has a little you can turn all this stuff up, off or down.  Totally control it with the app.  It has a good Android and iOS app and it's got a nice lighted base.  You mentioned this, Stacey, I know you've had the Amplify.  You mentioned these are the base units.  And, you know, the pro on these is there's no wires.  It just plugs right into the wall and these just snap off.  This is just a magnetic ball joint so that the antenna not only can be aimed,  but if somebody some kid comes along and hits it, it doesn't it doesn't break it off,  which is great.  The base unit, as I said, with for a little more than I think,  325 includes two satellite units.  I would say the stick with the HD because this is the one that does AC 802.11 AC.  The other one only does ABG and N.  It also this does all of them plus AC.  It also has more MIMO antennas.  It more frequencies.  I put it I set it up in our home where we already have the other systems,  other Wi-Fi systems, because I have two networks.  And I've always had problems with clashing.  But one of the things that this is it's great to test in that kind of environment,  because many people do have congested Wi-Fi environments from neighbors and houses  nearby. This did a very good job of finding  unoccupied channels and picking the right place to be so that it did not  interfere with the existing Wi-Fi setup.  I found it worked quite well.  I was really impressed with it.  The price is good compared to others.  Ubiquiti has a very good name in this business.  And I thought the software was excellent.  This is the easiest one to set up.  You don't have to configure the satellites at all.  You just plug them in and they work, which I don't know why the other guys don't do  that, but it's fantastic.  It updated itself automatically the day the moment I plugged it in.  And it worked quite well.  Throughput was good.  It was pretty comparable to the Eero, to the Google.  There's they're all about the same.  The best throughput I've gotten and the best speed I've gotten is one that isn't  really a mesh system exactly.  And that's the one you're using right now.  Do you want to are you ready to talk about the Orbeez or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I could talk about them.  Yeah, I.  And we actually talked about them on  the show that we recorded this morning, too.  So you can just skip this part of the podcast if you listen to me there.  But.  We.  I found that the Eero's did a better job  providing coverage to all areas of my house, but I think it's because my house  is long and skinny, so I've got this running in my office.  But I had originally had it running.  This is the satellite and the other ones downstairs in the middle.  Of my house.  So I had this one in the middle of the house and it didn't quite reach the camera  in the backyard, so I had to move it and then I saw less throughput.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, my experience has been because I've tried the Eero, the Google,  the the this new amplify and the Orbeez is I think it really depends on your house  a lot, which one's going to be best for you because I use the Eero's at my mom's  house and it was spectacular, but because of whatever the configuration of our house  and because of where the base station had to be, it did.  The Eero was not as good as the Orbeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, well, I think that's like for our house, it's like imagine a skinny rectangle.  So in the middle of it is we have the main router and then for the Eero's,  we have to set up on each end of the rectangle  and that works really well for us everywhere.  And I've got it, I mean, because I have to have coverage outside, inside,  up on the roof, down in the garage, it's ridiculous.  And that works.  The Orbeez doesn't give me full enough coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I did find that the Orbeez was the fastest of all of them.  I've had the fewest problems with the Orbeez.  Orbeez doing something interesting, they're using it for its dual channel,  as is as are all of them, I think are 2.4 and 5 gigahertz.  And what's nice compared to  other more traditional systems, all these mesh routers automatically switch back and  forth, they really find the best path for you, depending on where you are.  I'm really going to have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was going to say, if your gear isn't optimized for that.  So this is actually something I had with the Canary Flex outdoor camera.  And I've had it with the light switch that I've installed.  They don't actually work.  Their Wi-Fi isn't configured to work well with the Eero.  And I talked to Eero about why that is,  and they blame it on the way that people are implementing Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that that's true. It's a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is. Well, it is.  I mean, a lot of the connected device makers have to do extra work  because they're used to Wi-Fi being one way and mesh is just a totally different  animal for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was going to ask, do you ever get to the point, is it foolish to  everything that there's kind of an open standard for these things and you can mix  and match them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the issue is that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there is a standard.  There's also a wireless distribution standard.  The problem is that these specs are loosely written and companies are very  widely go off spec.  So it's just inconsistent.  And that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It didn't used to matter.  Like in only some cases.  Like Apple is really good at making the best use of the available Wi-Fi  and channel hopping. Their devices are, right?  They put a lot of attention on that because they're freaking Apple.  If you've got some...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to disagree with you.  I have the most recent Airport Extreme and retired it because I never was able  to get it work properly in my house.  And that's why I have been on this quest and I've tried every single mesh solution  and every one of them worked better than the Apple Airport Extreme.  There's also the additional issue...  I was talking about their devices.  Which is...  Oh, the computers.  The actual...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, the computers and phones and tablets.  Not that airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  In fact, Apple's...  Several times Apple iPads have been banned from campuses because of how they handle  Wi-Fi. They're problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are sticky.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They pick a band and they hug that band like nobody's business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, yes, I think Apple works well, but it doesn't necessarily play well  with others. You know what I mean?  If you're the only person using it, it's fine.  Well, yeah. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I don't know.  There isn't a kind of a flat recommendation because it's just...  I think it is very specific to your terrain.  Having tried them all, I really like the Amplify in terms of looks,  in terms of convenience.  You made a good point a few weeks ago that because the base units plug into the wall,  you really don't have the luxury of putting them high up where they'll work better.  And that's true unless you have high up plugs for some reason.  But I didn't find that a problem.  Boy, it was so easy.  This was easily the best setup of any of them.  And I think it works quite well.  I'm going to give this to Megan Moroney.  She's buying a new house and she needs a system.  And I'm going to give that to her.  The Google Home has gone to my daughter's house.  My mom has the Eero.  And of all of them, the Orbi worked best for me in terms of raw speed.  And I've been very happy with that.  Now, Linksys has a new system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm getting that one, actually.  So you and I are both trying all of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which one's best for you right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right now, it's still.  It's hard to say.  So the Eero is probably the best from a coverage standpoint.  I actually really like the Almond, the Securify ones from Almond.  Their mesh networking capability is not as good, but they have some really nice  software features. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I have huge respect for Ubiquiti and the kind of high level stuff that they do.  So that's why I feel like this is probably a good choice in terms of keeping it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, their Edge Max router, though, if you've got it, it's an industrial one,  not or not industrial, enterprise one.  Their Edge Max router.  Has been hit by the Marai botnet.  So if you have one of those, make sure you change the default password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  And we we actually been recommending on security now Ubiquiti's Edge Router X,  which is a $50 four port switch that has amazing capabilities.  It's it's a full operating system.  It's very sophisticated.  And a lot of geeks have been using the Edge Router X because for 50 bucks,  you get an amazing switch.  And in fact, what you could do is you could put your mesh router on one of those ports  and keep your maybe have two and keep one for IoT and one for your home network  and have complete isolation thanks to the Edge Router X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been trying to do that for like six weeks.  No, six months.  Do you have an edge router?  No, sorry, I wasn't doing it that way, but I've been trying to.  That's the easiest way.  IoT 50 bucks.  No, but you still have to like my phone still has to be on the same network.  And my computer still have to be on the same.  It's just not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a pain in the butt.  It is.  We'll get we'll get back to you because you have a pic.  But, Jeff, let's get your number of a week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right.  I gave you one if you want to be one.  Yeah, I got nowhere like two.  So the one number is the quant media says Trump got a record eight hundred  seventeen million dollars in free coverage in January.  I guess I guess you could argue that once  you win, it's not so much free coverage in the same way.  It's it's part of the office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But still, well, Obama, Obama never got higher than five hundred

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  million in free coverage, which says this is how we we we now reward entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you know, however you feel about Trump, there is no question in my mind.  He's incredibly entertaining.  I think one of the reasons people are obsessively reading and watching his  him is because you can't take your eyes off him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's he's he's mastered the extreme of him is Milo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. It's it's it's it's I could take my eyes off Milo.  I tried to watch Bill Maher and I was so revolted.  Did you ever get attacked by Milo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  Oh, I did. Have you?  Oh, yeah. Back in the day.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah. I hope we.  He's business went out of business.  He kind of became sheepish and apologetic for about 30 seconds and then went back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, sheep is an apologetic right now.  We'll see how long that lasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think this actually serves his purpose.  I think I think he wants to be as outrageous as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He wants eight hundred seventeen million dollars a month in free advertising.  That's what he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's another number that I thought was was was worth doing to CNN's a study  of I don't know where University of Maryland.  So the 70 70 percent of the people who attended the Women's March in Washington  heard about it on Facebook, beating friends and family, which was 60 or one percent.  Only 13 percent heard about it through Twitter.  Oh, isn't that doesn't that say everything?  Doesn't that say a lot?  It's kind of the nature of Twitter, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything goes by in a rush and a roar in Twitter.  It's you know, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can't researchers interviewed 528 people who attended the march and found  that in addition to Facebook driving attendance, 33 percent of attendees were  first time protesters.  So I just go back to your Facebook  argument earlier that the impact it has in this way.  There's right after the show, there's a town hall for my congressman here in New  Jersey, the seventh district, and he's and the Democrats are  focused on him for the next two years.  And I wanted to go.  I registered the confirmation, so I can't go and appear.  So I'll watch.  There will be a stream online, which be entertaining.  But the watching the organization online has been fascinating.  They came up with a list of questions,  the the the the Facebook group that sort of the liberals.  And they said, please take along the list of questions.  If you get called on, ask number one, if you get called on next, please ask  number two, you can ask your own question.  But if you want one, please ask number two.  If he refuses to answer number two and you're called on as number three, ask  number two exactly what you wish would happen in the White House press room.  That doesn't happen.  They're putting up memes that just say,  listen, this guy is one of two Republicans  in the state who's holding a town hall.  So be respectful, be decent.  Where is where you sit so you can get called on?  It's just the organization of this.  And by the way, nobody's paid with the organization, the Facebook role of  self organizing groups, which I would go back to our earlier discussion.  That's not Mark Zuckerberg organizing.  That's him providing the mechanism where  you can organize anything from the alt right to the Bernie left.  And it's there as a platform.  And God help us how we organize our own society.  But we're watching it happen for our very lives.  Kind of amazing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. It is.  So that's the world is changing so fast and in unpredictable ways, too.  That's the that's the thing that's  fascinating to me. Yep.  Who would have thought who to thunk it.  And Stacey, you've got an interesting pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I thought this was kind of fun  and I've been kind of playing around with it, not very successfully because  I'm here and my lights are elsewhere.  But I've been playing with the Vivaldi browser, which is a new browser.  And the reason I picked it up and started  playing with it was because you can actually connect it to your Hue lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and wait a minute.  Your browser. Yeah.  To your lights. Yeah.  What do you mean? Well, what happens then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so right now it's just the lights  turn color based on the site.  What? Yeah.  So you go into if you download the browser, then you go into hold on.  Let me do this again.  It's hysterical.  Is it under appearance?  That's that's what.  So I had I was playing with it on another computer, which is.  And so I had to put it on this computer.  Let me find my like.  Where did that is? Because the settings thing is huge.  Oh, under network, I think, is where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that is so funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to find it and we're going to figure this out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is the point of Vivaldi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's the guy who did opera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like it does look operatic, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. John von Tuchen.  Tuchen.  I can't say his last name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says it's a browser for our friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is the so it's a personalized browser.  I mean, it's it's basically a new browser.  Oh, it's under themes.  So you can enable your Hue light enable Hue theme integration.  I will say it's buggy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Requires a Phillips Hue lighting system from on the local network.  Finds the bridge and then changes the changes, the lights to match your theme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that why you had to run downstairs before the show and turn it on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, because I wasn't playing with it on this computer.  So I thought it was connected to it, but it wasn't now.  So, yeah, you click that button and then you connect to lights.  I will say, challengingly enough, it did not find it only found.  Four of my ten or many Hue lights.  Well, Stacey, in all fairness, your house is a little crowded with a lot of stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going on, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I'm like, you know, and I'm not sure the toaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's talking to the to the doorbell.  It's talking to everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yes, right now it's not as cool, but I'm hoping if this becomes really popular,  we could do it because how cool would it be this?  Imagine this with me, you guys, when Twig calls.  Oh, your lights change and my lights just blink.  Yeah. And because, you know, actually, that's not via the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That wouldn't be on the browser either.  You'd have to. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, hold on. Hold on.  Let me pick a browser thing. Hold on.  New mentions in my tweet stream.  That would be too overwhelming.  But like, you know, my husband likes using Hangouts.  He's the only one.  So when he pings me on Hangouts and I'm  like sitting here going, oh, that's Andrew, you know, my lights could come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's like having a ringtone.  Only it's a light tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a light tone.  Vivaldi is free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Phillips, Hughes or not.  But if you have them and you want to play with it, check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is wild.  So, yeah, a browser that changes your lighting color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it changes actually the browser.  So if you do it, the cool thing is because I'm a freak who likes my my  what's it called, the dock on the side of my computer instead of on the bottom  of the top, you can actually change your tabs.  So my tabs now run instead of across the top.  They run down the side in the Vivaldi browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  I know your whole thing is on its side.  I'm surprised your head isn't like this all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like that cute puppy look where they're like, oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  oh, oh, no, actually, I keep you know what?  Your your doc should be on the side  because your screen's wider than it is tall.  So there's more room on the side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you. That's just logical.  And that's how I feel.  Yeah. OK, so now you can put your tabs there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if I want my tabs there.  I guess so.  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it changes like I think Twitter is blue.  I'm trying to think of what else.  Very aesthetic browser.  It's very pretty. It's fancy.  I haven't I haven't spent like ages.  I haven't done like master tabs or done anything crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So hooked on Chrome that every time I try one of these  alternative browsers, including Opera, I just go here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't look right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that is fair.  But this is highly customizable.  I'm going to play with it.  I always force myself if I'm going to use a browser to use it for a week.  Yeah.  And then I can make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It has some nice I'm looking at some nice features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I haven't hated it using it for 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there you go.  I like that. Now I can choose my tab bar position and do like Stacey does  and put it on the left.  And now, oh, what's the start page?  Purple Lake, purple lake, purple lake.  Nice. Start browsing.  I wonder how Facebook looks in a purple lake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, oh, see, they change Facebook to be blue to match your site.  Now go to like red. Oh, you mean like the YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, let's see.  I'm YouTube. I'm YouTube.  Red is the.  Yeah, look at that.  Oh, and so and my tabs would reflect that, too.  Oh, and these aren't just tabs, they're thumbnails.  Yeah. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See? All right.  Fancy. So yeah, give it a whirl.  And let our it's up to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the Vivaldi browser, I think it's Vivaldi.org.  Nope. Vivaldi.com.  If you want to find out more, a browser for our friends.  You know, there's I think the reason that  you see people still write browsers, it's one of those categories.  A lot of times, you know, people go, well,  Microsoft owns the word processor, I'm not going to make a word processor,  but they don't do it about browsers.  And the reason is you can make a lot of money with a browser through search  referrals.  And so, you know, this is one of the few pieces of software you can give away and  actually, you know, make a make a killing on.  It's hard to get the last, though, but that's right.  It's all about it's all about getting a critical mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we actually had this.  I talked with John for because we were talking about bringing open web  standards to the Internet, I think.  So this guy is a very he's got so many  lost causes and windmills he's tilting at.  So, you know, good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's one of those apps that's written in Node and JavaScript and React.  So the only drawback to that, it's really cool.  A lot of you know, I'm seeing a lot of open source projects work that way.  So it's basically a browser written as a brand of browser, but it can be that make  that could make it sluggish. So, you know, does it feel a little slow?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't, you know, today was podcasting and this day.  So I haven't I don't have like a thousand tabs open.  As well as see if it breaks Jeff's non-pixel, it will break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will break his Samsung Plus. That's for sure.  There it is. You can't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, actually, actually, when I was trying to figure out how to get Amazon  loaded, one of the workarounds involved putting a different browser in so that  you could use that to then go into the settings.  I couldn't. It wouldn't let me do it unless I went to Dev mode.  But I could download another browser under Android.  Oh, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  That changes.  Huh?  Ladies and gentlemen, we have completed this journey down the  highways and byways of the minds of Stacey and Jeff and Leo that we call Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let it be known that Stacey and I agreed a lot.  I don't think we disagreed that much, Stacey.  No, we didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm trying to heighten the drama for people.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Jeff Jarvis, professor of journalism, those lucky kids at the City University  of New York, where he's creating a new generation.  Of people without jobs.  Hey, they got jobs.  I was joking last about my son, who really wants to be a journalist.  And you know what? He's smart because he he realizes he wants to intern advice  or he realizes what the future is going to look like.  And he's learning photography and writing and the whole thing.  He can come to CUNY.  I know. I know. I told him.  I said, Jeff wants to talk to you.  I would love to go to CUNY.  I think what he's going to do and this would be my advice is to get some  job experience first, a couple of years under his belt.  I think going to graduate school,  having worked a little bit makes you appreciate it a lot more.  Yeah. You know what?  Yeah.  You can also read Jeff's books.  What Would Google Do?  Public Parts, Gutenberg, The Geek, and of course Geeks Bearing Gifts.  And he blogs a lot at BuzzMachine.com, actually less lately.  But medium more.  More on medium.com.  For now.  And joins us each and every Wednesday,  1.30 Pacific, 4.30 Eastern, 21.30 UTC for this week in Google.  I hope you'll do the same.  Join us live.

And if you can't be here live, you can always be here after the fact on your  schedule, we have on demand audio and video of every show we do.  Starts at our website.  There's video.  Yes, I know.  I know.  I've tried to keep that from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just thought it was audio.  I didn't realize there was video.  Trying to hide that from you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I just download the podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter.tv slash Twig.  Actually, at some point.  I shouldn't say this, but at some point,  I'm thinking most of our audience is audio.  It would be all right just to do these as audio.  There's nothing to see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I wouldn't have to put makeup on.  That would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neither would I.  See?  And Jeff would have to spend so much time getting to be less white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or pink.  Then we wouldn't see Jeff in his famous locales around the world.  That would be sad.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we did video because it's fun.  And if you get to watch the video,  even if you don't do it all the time once in a while, it does.  You develop, I think, a stronger bond to the show and to the hosts and stuff  because you're seeing them and they become more people-like.  It added cost for you.  It adds cost and trouble.  Yeah.  And if I want to move to Ecuador, I really don't think I can do video anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why? They've got broadband in Ecuador.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to build a studio.  I just think I want to go down there, have a microphone, have a nice patio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't they have the highest murder rate in the Americas?  Ecuador?  OK, I'm not going to Ecuador.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somewhere.  I was thinking maybe Costa Rica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going there.  That's a good place.  You should go to Costa Rica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where we're all going to end up.  I don't know about all of us.  I need somewhere that I can go and they would just let me be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have a margarita.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's margarita day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Beautifully timed.  Oh, that was perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here you go, Stacey.  They have margaritas in Sweden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I might go to Sweden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, gosh, it's so cold.  See if we didn't have video.  We couldn't do that, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  We're talking about taking Brian out of a job here, possibly.  That would be terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. Brian will always have a job.  He can do so many things.  Ladies and gentlemen, he's giggling in fear and horror.  Ladies and gentlemen, I do appreciate your being here.
