Also with us from Seattle, Stacy Higginbotham.  Stacy on IOT.com.  She'll be going back to Austin next week.  Yep.  To the beautiful sunny climb.  So Jeff, we were just talking before the show and I was not here last week so I was not present for the attempts to get the Lenovo smart display working.  However, I understand it is now working, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes and no. We tried to get a call going and we couldn't do it.  But Kevin Toffle said I hadn't done something yet.  You could do it with Duo.  But I also have four phones around me so I don't really need it to call.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's a nice, so it is nice to have a, what do we call it, an always on portal to your home is a good way to think about it.  So I actually used similar functionality on the Amazon Echo while I was gone just to check in on the guy house sitting and my dog.  I use it when I'm traveling to talk to my daughter and to show her things.  So again, I think there's a value to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I feel like if when it's, it feels first of all unfinished.  We have one for review and Jason Howell will give us a full review at some point in the future on all about Android and the new screensavers.  But we played with it on the new screensavers on Saturday and it feels unfinished.  It's unfinished. I mean, you're supposed to, I kind of think of it as a kitchen TV, right?  Adjunct. But Netflix doesn't work yet.  You know, it's like there's, it feels like it's an unfinished product.  But I, that's an easy thing to fix in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you guys not connect it? Because Kevin got Netflix working on his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He did. We were told it wasn't working yet.  In fact, a lot of what we got from it was because I can't do that yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can show what's on Netflix.  Did you connect your Netflix account?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're listening to Netflix now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, that was an audio book.  Why that came on, I don't know.  These devices are.  I did hook up Netflix and it's not saying, it's not telling me I can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, these devices are, it is obvious, an exercise in frustration anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think a lot of these get sold on what they can do.  And then they don't always implement everything right away.  I've noticed that in a lot of my connected devices.  And I finally, comedies are getting better now about actually telling you what they do do,  as opposed to what they one day will do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's, I think that's a mistake because consumers get them.  I remember, I'm old enough to remember the days of the Vic 20 computer.  Where, so there was a lot of interest in home computing in the, what was this, early mid 80s.  And some of this was because Apple, you know, had an Apple computer and stuff, but they were all expensive.  And so Commodore decided, well, we'll make a $200 home computer, the Vic 20.  But it was so underpowered and so useless, it almost immediately ended up in people's closets.  And I think it stymied home computing for some years because people said, oh, I tried that.  And the same thing, you know, we've seen that kind of over and over again where people, you know,  try something and then decide, oh, that's not, it's, you know, it doesn't work.  And so that's a risk with these home assistants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a risk with all technology purchases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The netbook killed PC sales for years because people bought, oh, $200 computer.  And it was such crap that it killed PC sales for maybe five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did people actually buy netbooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly the point is that they couldn't resist the price point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to say the same thing about tablets.  There's been quite a swing there, right?  So I reboxed my first iPad and then everybody made fun of me properly because it took over the world.  And now nobody buys tablets anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that, you know, you could make the case that people did buy tablets.  You're just not buying more tablets.  The one they got is fine.  Android, on the Android side, tablets are a flop.  No question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I loved my seven, my Nexus seven. God, I loved that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's another question.  Why did everybody stop making seven and eight inch tablets all of a sudden?  Yeah. Perfect. Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HTC? Didn't they just do it? No. Honor?  Didn't they just do a seven inch? Oh, that was a seven inch phone.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's, by the way, the answer to the question why people don't do seven inch tablets anymore.  The answer is seven or eight inch phones or six inch phones anyway.  I like this. I agree with you, Jeff.  That was a really nice device.  And the Pixel C, pretty much no.  We've been playing with, for a little bit, with the Acer Chromebook tablet.  It's a non-starter. Is it Asus? It's one of the As.  Because it's too low powered.  Yeah. And Chromebook, Chrome OS is not ready for a tablet.  No, it's not.  It's a keyboard OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's not just that. It's just that things like, you know, DRM stuff and other things don't run well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got to get, Samsung has released its S4. They announced that last week.  And I'll have to see if we can, no, that's the phone.  I should say S4 Tab.  And that looks pretty good. That is an Android tablet, but it is an Android tablet with a lot of Samsung stuff.  And it has a removable keyboard.  That looks nice.  Yeah. Yeah. So I guess we'll maybe get a copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about the new smaller windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like that. I have that in the other room.  The Surface Go?  Surface Go. I like it. It's a little underpowered, but it's kind of cute.  Is the keyboard, do you use it?  It's totally usable keyboard. It's a little smaller.  It is? Oh.  Yeah. You get used to it real quick. But, I'm sorry, real quickly.  But...  Is it an 8 inch or?  It is 10 inches. It's exactly the same size as an iPad.  It's the same size and price as an iPad.  It's really what it is aimed at is somebody who might buy an iPad, but maybe wants an operating system, a real operating system.  As opposed to Chrome OS, yes.  Or Chrome OS, yeah. Anyway, it's an interesting marketplace we live in.  I almost feel like, and I look at Indiegogo and Kickstarter, and people are just throwing anything they can up against the wall and hoping that it'll stick.  Which on the one hand is good, but on the other hand you get a lot of weird beasts.  This is the Surface Go.  Oh. Yeah. It's cute, isn't it?  Birdie. Yeah.  Yeah. Birdie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks like an iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like an iPad. This is detachable.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like my Pixel C. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm not a huge Windows fan. I can use it. I can tolerate it, but I'm not a huge Windows fan.  So if you like Windows, it's not a bad choice. It has the kickstand built in. It'd be a good size for either a second computer or for somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that you have the little tiny version of the big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. Here's the biggest Surface. Here's the little Surface. You don't think about that, but they really go together, don't they?  Hi, grandpa. How you been? Everything going all right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the end of Leo's week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's puppet time theater. So the Pixel 3. I really like the Google Pixel 2 XL. You're in the screen. There are a lot of complaints about it.  But I think it's not the greatest OLED screen out there, but now...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm fully used to it. It used to flash on me, but doesn't anymore. And now I have Pi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have Pi. I am a little surprised to get Pi so early. But a lot of the features won't really be fully cooked in the Pi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny how we used to practically wait outside for a new OS version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're not big changes anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This one seems... Pi seems to be kind of significant.  There's a lot of the AI stuff built in where it's going to start anticipating what you need and allocating resources based on what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's the marketing hype. Do you find that that's the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I find that Google is actually pretty good at predicting things. And actually doing it in a way that's less creepy.  So sometimes it'll just pop random stuff up for me. And I'm like, oh, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is this like the Google Now used to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a little bit more running in the back end. I don't think it's stuff that you would necessarily notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. I haven't had anything yet, but I only have had Pi for a couple of days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't noticed anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My favorite thing is that the way they've changed the home button. But we've seen this. We saw this in the earlier versions. Now you can swipe between apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, we've got to remind people if they've gotten it, you don't get that automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, you have to. Is that the case even in the release version? Is that right, Carson? You have to enable that.  So you go to settings, you have to change how the home. I think that makes sense because it is a big change to the way the home button operates.  And is it under accessibility? I bet you it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's the problem. Every time I do it, I forget where it was.  Where is it? System, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  System. Let's go down here.  Gestures. Yeah, that's it. So you want active. Nope, that's a squeeze.  That's silly. Squeezing is silly. I love the squeeze. I forgot that it even exists.  I finally took it off. I squeeze it all the time. Swipe up to home button. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gestures. Swipe up. System. Gestures. Swipe up on home button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then, and so now you can swipe up like this to get recents.  Or my favorite feature, which isn't immediately obvious and isn't in fact given away by the name swipe up to home button, is you can swipe sideways.  And this is right out of iPhone X. But I really like that feature. You use it all the time. My most common use for it, I'm in a site and I'm trying to enter the password.  So I swipe over to LastPass copy and swipe back to the site. It's very convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You learn something every time on Twig. Wow. Pi is here, baby.  How to turn your expensive Microsoft device into a puppet? And how to swipe it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where do I turn that on? Again, I'm in the settings menu. System.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  System. I found it. Gestures. And then swipe up on home button on.  Now, and it's funny, even in the illustration, they show that swiping up, but they don't show the swipe left. I don't know why that is.  Is that a swipe right?  Yeah, you're right. It's swipe right only. I thought maybe it was swipe left too, but it is only swipe right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I did just get it and I don't know if everyone has this or I was belated, but Gmail just suggested to me probably four or five days ago to change my swipe settings.  So basic in is it inbox? No, it's Gmail.  And now it let me customize it so I can swipe left or right to delete things and archive or move things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Has this happened to you? Yeah, I see that a lot. That's the files go feature, right? Or no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but mine has always been if I moved it one direction, it would archive and I hate it because I hate archiving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're talking about mail. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. It's not files go. It's the Gmail. Yeah, yeah, it's in Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I've been loving that. That is like made my mobile mail just like super manageable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't use Gmail, but if I did, I would.  I was like, go for customization. You guys, it's awesome. What do you think the notch? It's pretty clear now.  We're getting close to the Pixel 3 and we now see production units.  There was an unboxing by a Ukrainian tech blogger on his telegram channel.  Wow. And we don't know when this is going to come out. He he shows that it will have Bluetooth.  Well, are those Bluetooth? I don't think so. I saw a number of bloggers say it was Bluetooth.  But look, see, there's a type C connector. So those are not Bluetooth earbuds in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do look like the Pixel buds, but they're not. It would make sense because people hate the fact that there are no type C headphones out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and they in the last one, the last one they offered a Pixel type C headphones. And I think there's also a no, they didn't.  They didn't. No, they didn't. No, no, they didn't. They didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's a frustration. This has been the bane of my existence for the longest time.  And I had to finally pony up for Bluetooth. They did offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did they not a adapter, though, that takes that regular?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they had a dollar, like a nine dollar dongle that I think the phone came with a dongle.  It came with it. But mine broke. And you lose them. At least two more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really hate type C. I really hate losing the headphone jack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's put it that's ridiculous. I should bring it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Can we can we stop complaining so much about notches and actually complain about the loss of the headphone jack, which I feel is like much more mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels gratuitous. Am as Samsung is able to keep a headphone jack in a phone of the same size, it seems with just as many features, it seems gratuitous.  And the fact that Apple did that in the notch and now Google's doing that in the notch, it just irks me. Why copy? Why?  The notch, by the way, seems seems completely pointless, given that you've got a big lip anyway at the bottom.  I don't know. I don't know. Anyway, I can live with the notch. I live with it on the iPhone 10 headphone jack.  I agree with you, Jeff, is a much more serious omission.  Wait, no, that was that was I agree with you, Stacy is a much more I could fuse you is a much more serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Stacy was cutting off my notch hatred. I'm sorry.  It's just it's just like, come on. This is the hatred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the unboxing, which I find to be the most frustrating thing I've ever seen because he's holding his camera with one hand and attempting with his left hand to unbox.  Use your mouse. And by the way, the very first thing it does in the unboxing is take the phone and put it aside.  So now the almost the entire length of this is devoted to him attempting to do with one hand to open paper.  Dude, dude, I know you're merely a Ukrainian blogger on Telegram, but come on.  You're trying to drive us nuts. We've seen all this.  I don't need to. He spends an inordinate amount of time on the SIM pin, the SIM poker.  The whole thing is the worst unboxing ever.  Where's the phone? I took it off. It's over on the left.  It's a. Yeah, I'm thrilled.  It has that I'm thrilled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we get to see both sides of it. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in the back. Eventually is going to get to the ear.  But I forget I give up.  First, all this rustling.  Oh, so this is a this is a pre release because somebody points out that the camera notification has the dog food camera.  I can't is the dog food notification, which means it's a Google employees device.  He's testing out. Oh, somebody's in trouble. Yeah.  But it's completely credible that this is what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what did the new phones come out in October or September for Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unknown. The last time they tried to do it before Apple came out with the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They announced October for the last two years.  Everybody thinks it's October for. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And now it's when they actually come out. I don't know.  I know the fact that they pushed Android Pie out already kind of makes me think they're maybe sooner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I want a new Chromebook.  I was like, I don't want to love mine as fine as it is.  It's ridiculous. I don't need one. I could live another two years on it.  But hey, that's an interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you're the only one. No, we have Elgin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Elgin wants a new Chromebook, too.  Well, he would, because he's trying to he's trying to tell the world that he's the greater lover than I am.  But he's wrong. Oh, you two are going to fight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Fight over who loves Chromebook more pie.  OK, let's talk about this.  I mean, this is the this is, you know, sometimes when I see a I, I start to just think, oh, man, that's just like that's like saying blockchain might as well say powered by blockchain.  It's just but maybe maybe I mean, Google is, you know, the leader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's actually legit when it comes to a I mean, they're not they actually let's put it applied a I so they actually do things.  A lot of this stuff, I don't think is actually available yet.  So I know it's part of pie, but like some of the cooler stuff later this year.  Yeah. Slices, I think.  And I'm kind of curious because doesn't slices sound like, oh, I always forget what they call them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an Android, instant Android apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So even if the app's not installed, it will show you a slice of a slice of it.  And actually, instant apps was if the app was not installed, slice may not do that.  But what slice does is it puts chunks of the app into Google search.  So if you type Lyft into Google search, you'll see the app and it knows where you are.  It'll put in other information for you there, too.  Right. And the ETA for a driver.  So without launching the Lyft app, I think this makes a lot of sense.  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does, although it's bringing.  I hate that they're doing all of this with.  I mean, this says it's your apps.  I hate that all of this is happening within the Android ecosystem as opposed to the broader web  because this ecosystem, what you're going to have is something different here versus the experience elsewhere.  And these sort of things just drive me absolutely bonkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I wonder if slices will work with progressive web apps, in which case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, then they might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So among other things, the AI will learn is adaptive battery.  It'll notice which apps you use the most and prioritize the battery for them.  Adaptive brightness, which learns what settings you prefer in different what brightness settings you prefer in different locales and then automatically does it.  So you get to work, it'll turn it up, go to bed, it'll turn it down.  App actions predict what you'll want to do next based.  Next based.  This will be very interesting based on your context and display that action right in your phone.  So this is a lot like what Apple is doing with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So all it's giving me now is the is the audio book I'm listening to.  So it's doing that where?  And Google News.  So on that screen, it has the recently opened apps.  You can't really see it because it's on the app screen.  Right there it has two things, just two things.  One is the audio book of the Reformation.  I'm listening to how fascinating and it was Martin Luther's 500th birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was last year.  Well, it may be of the thesis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, the nailing of the 95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got I bought I bought a Luther biography that I started listening to that day.  Which one?  Because there's one that I.  One that you like and one that you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's one that has like Sean Hannity recommendations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, this is definitely not Sean Hannity's Luther.  God, I hope.  Eric, no, Max.  Isn't that what is that what Bill O'Reilly was doing for a while is I don't like the  the murder of Kennedy, the murder of no, it is not that it is.  I hope it's the truth.  No, Eric Metaxas.  Yes, Metaxas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the bad one?  Look at the well, look at the blurbs.  It's a it's a very weird mix.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a bad one because it was it was pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So far, and somebody I know who my sister, I think the minister said, oh, the ministers

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hugh Hewitt, Tucker Carlson, the Washington Times all love it.  Oh, I guess I got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You bought a conservative biography of Martin Luther.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he was OK.  So it's so far.  It's been pretty good because one of the problems with Luther is that he is kind of  canonized as the founder of the Protestant denomination.  But he was he was a miserable anti-Semite.  And that is that is so far in the book quite a bit.  Mm hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It acknowledges his is the book that I will recommend highly, highly, highly is the one  that is a is a joint biography.  A different one.  Yeah.  Although this was good.  So here, I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe other people like it besides Sean Hannity.  Is that possible?  That's possible.  But he also wrote another book people like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on a second here.  It's Fatal Discord.  It's about Luther and Erasmus.  It's surprising.  Oh, that I would like to read, actually.  That's really, really good.  No, I don't want to download it.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK.  So Metaxas has written a lot of other books that I understand why.  You know, religious books.  But, you know, anybody's going to write about Luther is going to be.  Who's Bonhoeffer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, a victim of the Nazis.  He wrote a book about Bonhoeffer.  Bonhoeffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bonhoeffer.  Yeah.  Well, anyway, I don't know.  I don't.  So far, it sounds fine to me.  He wrote a book about miracles, what they are, how they happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Called The Forgotten Promise of American Liberty.  Yes, that one also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you can keep it, The Forgotten Promise of American Liberty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to get in trouble for having said this.  I am a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You poisoned me now.  Oh, gosh.  Just read it and form your own opinion.  So far, it's been very good.  My point was merely that I started reading it when Luther nailed the 95 Theses on the Wittenberg church door.  So it's a long book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty much believed that he didn't really do that.  But that's okay.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what's been great about the Metaxas book so far is there are a huge number of myths about Luther, which are all completely wrong.  So I visited that church in Berlin for no reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was not Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The person was not in Berlin.  So there's problem number one.  Yeah.  Right there.  It wasn't in Berlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it was his church and it probably ended up on the door at some point.  But it might have been nailed.  Oh, is it Bonhoeffer who said when they came for the blank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know that was Martin Neumer.  That was Neumer.  Yeah.  Right.  Neumer.  No, no, no.  Wait, how did we get on here?  Let's know.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This show is making me crazy.  We were talking about Pixel 2 XL.  Okay, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the question.  Because when Google talks about delivering the apps via context, it's not really about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the content.  It's about the content.  It's about the content.  Okay, wait.  So here's the question.  Because when Google talks about delivering the apps via context, I'm curious which context  it's getting.  So it may be that you always listen to your audiobooks at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that might be why it's awkward.  Yeah, no.  Because look at what's on my suggestions, which is pretty boneheaded.  Gmail, which I don't use.  Files Go, which I had opened when you mentioned it for the first time in a long time.  Google Fi, well, it's a Fi phone.  Inbox, another version of Gmail, which I don't use.  And then I don't know what this is.  I think it's the Hangouts notification.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, for me, that line is just recently used apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well, where's your line then?  I'm sorry.  I'm looking at the wrong line.  You go all the way up.  All the way up.  And it's this thing.  Oh, no, it's not doing it.  Right below.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same thing.  No.  Not that.  This one?  No, there's another line here.  You can't see because it's too dark.  I don't have a line.  Or maybe.  Wait a minute.  Here comes Karsten with his line.  All right.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Karsten also has a Pixel.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kimi, wife, and Zach.  Those are like people you call.  Why don't I have that line?  Did I somehow screw up?  Does it have to remind you it's your wife?  Did I have to screw up?  Yes.  Kimi, wife.  Is that what Google does for you?  I'm not going to say anything.  But Kimi, that, anyway.  Okay.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a picture.  I don't know.  I'm not sure.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Anyway.  Okay.  So I didn't get that.  That must be a setting.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a setting I ever made.  Karsten, did you put the beta on first or?  And now Burke McQueen's calling me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hi, Burke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, hello.  Oh, I'm a sign up on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, on my other phone, which I did have the beta on, it has Google News and the Daily  which I never ever, the New York Times, I never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Artificial intelligence.  Let's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's artificial for a reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  Well, no.  Google is actually, I mean, some of their suggestions are a little weird, but like I  find that their AI, for example, in Google Docs, or what is it called?  Sheets and all of that.  It actually accurately recommends like we open our show notes or this.  I open my show notes for Twitter every day around or every week at the same time, and  it automatically puts that up at the top for me.  Oh, so if I'm in, yeah.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  It doesn't be too.  Yes.  So my assumption was that this this would be similar except now because it's got location  from your phone.  If you share it, you can just I mean, like things like when I get in my car, for example,  I always open maps.  If they can start figuring that kind of stuff out, that's actually kind of valuable.  I don't know if it's going to be, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what the single use most useful thing to me is the new volume control interface.  So when you press a volume up or down button, you get a little screen that pops up that  shows you your volume.  Shows you don't touch Leo shows your volume shows you your vibration status, you know,  silent vibrating ringer, your music.  So it makes a distinction between ring sounds and music sounds and then lets you with a  touch go right to the settings.  I think that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We did all about Android at IO.  That's the thing we were all compelling over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's to me.  That's like, isn't it funny how just little that and the swipe are the things I care about?  But I'll be interested to see what happens to hold position for a screenshot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is the new screenshot?  So if you do the power button and hold that down, it gives you three options.  Power off, restart and screenshot.  Oh, well, that's OK, but I don't think I don't think I needed a whole lot.  Well, the old way you had to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The old way was hard.  You had to press these at the same time, two buttons at the same time.  That was kind of a pain in the butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Five out of six times I would screw that up.  I would just be like, yeah, yeah, or the volume would go.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now it's a bit weird place to put it.  How do I get a screenshot?  Well, of course you hit the power button to hold it down.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also how it is on the iPad.  Is that how you do it on the iPad?  I don't remember anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think the iPad is still home and power home and power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is those dual button things are hard to do.  All right.  So artificial intelligence.  I like artificial intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the same artificial intelligence that's going to save us from the robots and hatred

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and everything else.  AI is helping us with spam.  It is not helping us with hatred as much because you have the training data and people adapt  very well.  We this is again, I will say, look, we call it a lot of things.  True AI involves applying neural networks to lots of data and having it understand something.  So that's one version.  There's also other types of AI and training.  But when we start talking about all of this, we have to remember that they're learning  based on the information we've given them.  So unless we're talking about reinforcement learning and then they're learning based on  the rewards we're giving them.  And so we can't expect too much from this.  It's not going to be magic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if you want to sign up for digital well-being, it's not in there yet, but you can get in  the beta by going creeped out by that, by digital well-being or by the fact that you  had to do the beta or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, by the concept of digital well-being.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah, I like some of the things.  It's nanny state and more like it feels duplicitous to give them all this information and have  them decide what my digital well-being is going to look like.  Is it notifications that are freaking me out?  I mean, I just kind of look at this and I'm like, here's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that it's interesting because, of course, all these people are doing it and  everybody's doing it now.  Not only is iOS and Android doing it, but YouTube's doing it.  Instagram is doing it.  They're all putting in features that say use this less time how much I use it.  I'm going to sleep now, so do some things to make it less attractive.  All of this runs counter to their business model, which is, of course, the more you use  it the more money they make.  So you might say, well, why are they doing this?  Well, it's obvious why they're doing it.  They're doing it to put the critics at mind at ease while fully knowing nobody's going  to do this, that it's annoying to everybody.  And so it has this kind of great benefit of it looks like they care.  It puts Congress and other critics at ease and it costs them nothing because you're not  going to do it.  That's my opinion.  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Google is very aware that we're trying to move beyond screens.  And so I would say that this is also in preparation for understanding how to deliver information  through other mediums.  So through maybe voice, maybe speakers, maybe hearables.  So I would look at it more broadly as gathering information about what stresses people out,  what kind of information should be on the phone.  So I would look at this almost as a data grab in some ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that funny?  So now there's three good reasons to do it.  Yeah, I mean, when you see Instagram do something that will to design to reduce your usage of  Instagram, either they're under such intense heat that they have to do something or more  likely their research shows and my informal research would agree nobody's going to do  that.  I tried it on the iOS.  I'm doing the iOS 12 beta.  I turned it on and it was so annoying because you wake up in the middle of the night and  you want to play a little Pokemon Go as one does and it'd say you've already done too  much of that today or you should be sleeping and then right under it there's a button that  says or you could just ignore this and keep on going.  And then when you hit that it says you want me to remind you about this at all?  And you say no, never, never again.  And I think that this is that's exact.  My behavior is exactly what people are going to do.  They're going to do it.  I think it's also they're going to be annoyed and they're going to turn it off.  It's ass covering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's ass covering.  It's like the lawyers who insist that now escalators have to have instructions on how  to walk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lisa always laughs when we open a bottle and you know that's got one of those desiccant  packets and it says do not eat or you know our hot tub won't go hotter than 104 degrees  because the state of California has deemed it dangerous to have 105 degree hot tub which  is my preferred temperature even though I can make my bathtub 110 degrees if I want.  Have you hacked the hot tub?  No I asked you know I went to the hot tub guy said well how do I hack this?  He said oh you can't hack it.  But I did just buy an electric bike which has also been throttled to 20 miles an hour  and I know like come on.  But that's apparently fairly easy.  What bike did you get?  Oh you want to see?  I've shown everybody else has seen it already.  I know I figured.  It's a electric bike with vestigial pedals.  In other words they don't really they have to put pedals on otherwise it's not an electric

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  bike but you're not expected to pedal at all.  Oh I thought the idea was it was helping you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that's the idea.  Yeah except sure that's the idea.  Yeah if you want to pedal you can but you don't have to and by putting pedals on there  and putting a throttle on there that is limited to 20 miles an hour you don't have to have  a license you don't have to get permission you can you know it's a bicycle it's a bicycle  see it's got pedals it's a bicycle.  Anyway doesn't that look cool it looks like a looks like a one of those looks like the  motorcycle Steve McQueen rode in the great escape looks like one like an Indian or something  those old-fashioned motorcycles.  Yeah isn't that cool.  Yeah some of it Burke's saying he can hack my hot tub so maybe that's why he was calling.  Burke has apparently hacked time and space as well.  If you have a Pixel 2 you can get Android Pie right now right you just you just update  and you should be getting it soon if you have an essential phone their Android 9 update  is rolling out.  Oh yeah a non-Google phone is getting it.  Well that's what happened with the public beta too there were a number of phones getting  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are only a few essential phones out there so you know why not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Easy enough give you something.  Now let me ask you oh I was I was also saying you can get the digital well-being now if  you go to it in the app store and sign up for the beta and then you wait for your yeah  request an invitation and you wait for your email.  I don't think I've gotten mine yet because I really want it because then I could turn  it off sooner.  Let me just see if I have it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes it's it I think it would be nice like it again there are very few times when  I would be excited about it but I would kind of like like as I'm standing there in like  a daze at 11 o'clock at night just scrolling through you know Twitter or the New York Times  or whatever just be like hey why don't you go to bed now.  My Fitbit actually does that and I'm like yeah you know what Fitbit good plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I get a lot of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd get angry and be awake for two hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's us maybe it's just you and me.  Yeah well we're anti-authoritarian.  Some people like to be told what to do.  We do not.  In fact if you tell us to do something we're more likely than to do the opposite just even  if it hurts us even if it's bad.  So I have not gotten the invitation.  I was hoping by the show I would have you go to sign up for the digital well-being.  Actually you don't do it on your phone you do it on the web and you can enroll in the  beta send the email and some.  What do you look up.  Where did I find this.  It's at Android dot com.  Let me see if you go to.  I think maybe I wonder if you can go from the front page find it go to go to learn more  about Pi.  And then tailored to you blah blah blah just less adaptive battery adapter bright  adapter for this adapt for that getting around just got easier.  Digital well-being great technology should help not distract.  Doesn't that family look really tired like they were up all night on their phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah they've been arguing and fighting and they're trying to get along now but they're  about to get divorced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And mom if you keep feeding the kids these these simple carbohydrates like orange juice  and Cheerios.  Of course they're going to wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why are you judging mom for that.  The dad could have given them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No the dad's smart he's just drinking coffee.  He's drinking black cereal to she's in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are the three of them are eating cereal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's maybe he bought it at the grocery store and you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then you got dummy berries which are probably wax and maybe dad's having that toast maybe  not it's unclear.  Somebody's somebody not at the table is having milk.  So maybe the photographer I don't know why is there a glass of milk just sitting out in  the middle of nowhere.  What's going on there.  Is that for Elijah.  All right.  So the series.  Yeah.  Oh there's that.  Oh hey OK.  Little hit little tip to dad get a pitcher.  You can't pour milk from a glass.  OK.  Just a little tip.  True.  I'm trying to find.  I just did it.  I just did it.  I got to it.  OK.  There there it is.  Have a pixel.  By the way do you like that nice wood grain that's exactly the same wood as used in the  back of the Lenovo smart.  It makes me feel calm.  Display.  So you know it's already.  It's Scandinavian.  That's that Ikea fake.  I'm calm when I go to work.  You can now try you can try digital digital well-being beta now click sign up and you'll  get this form and then they'll ignore you.  Or not.  So are you happy with pie desserts and start with Q.  Yeah.  Pie is I like pie.  What do I do with it.  Had to make a pie.  It had to.  Miriam Miriam Schwarz suggested quiche.  That's not a dessert.  It does begin with Q.  It does.  Nice try.  But quince jam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Quince.  Ew.  Yeah there's is there like a I don't know something with quarters in it that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Case it though.  You might like that as a case.  So case so cheese pastry pastry twist.  There we go winner.  Dessert case.  So I have that case it though.  Yeah.  Oddly enough they don't have quince jam in the suggestions from the verge.  Obviously.  What do they have.  Queen of puddings.  Queen of puddings.  That's probably too hard.  Android Q queen of puddings.  That's a very Baz Lerman kind of a I don't think that's going to make it.  None of these I get quirks that's oh quirks apparently is not a site to go to.  It's a forbidden.  For both and for both insight.  So pie I thought pie is it was a good compromise.  It's kind of short.  All the other ones.  I joke a lot of pie jokes at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah yeah I have jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pie and the nice thing is now we're going to have pie every Tuesday on Al and about Android.  They had Oreo they had Oreo pie yesterday.  That was awesome.  Very inspired.  It's a transitional pie.  A transitional pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A bridge building pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So did you see the article in the verge about the magic leap.  I tried magic leap and saw.  The best minds of my generation.  No Adi Robertson she's saying I tried magic leap and saw a flawed glimpse of mixed reality's  amazing potential.  Yeah it's almost three thousand dollars but it's not well 20 I'm sorry 2300.  It's the creator edition that's a long standing tradition.  Google Glass was 1500 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Remind me will you thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This looks better than Google Glass sort of.  So sort of doesn't doesn't work a lot better than HoloLens.  Well maybe it does a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Magic leap is supposedly building goggles that can change people's perception of reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's Adi.  And she she got to try it she said yeah it's you know it's it's augmented reality it's better than  what you'd get with an iPhone but it's not perfect.  You do carry this little puck on your belt that is the processor.  Well relatively compared to the you know big computers.  Backpack computer.  Yeah true and that by the way that button that's a pause button they call it reality.  So when you when you press it you go back to reality.  That is the traditional VR style controller that you would carry on your wrist.  What's interesting about this is it it is does not accommodate it's  it looks more like spectacles and that's what they were going for with the round.  But it doesn't accommodate lenses underneath it but you can buy prescription lenses that are  magnetic that snap in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I take my Google Glass lenses and repurpose them please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh that's right.  That I bought paid for.  I think Jeff from now on you should wear your Google Glasses.  You don't have to charge them up or your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can you still run apps on them.  I know it's a great device Jeff help in the name of science.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It hurts to break his heart.  Hey I bought a pair and I have never even gotten to who has my does Jason have those still.  Jason can I have my glasses back now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the museum for the museum.  Actually I have to get my eyes out the Museum of technology in my office.  I have I need to take them in for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So would you guys buy this.  Let's let's ask the price.  I thought about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought about it.  Well of course you did Leo.  I buy stuff that's that price because I need to you know it's our job to look at this stuff.  Even I can't like I just don't think this is going to be important.  Honestly.  We are.  We bought Google Glass.  I didn't buy her magically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the magic is actually really interesting.  I really like the hollow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very but it's very limited and have and Microsoft has made no progress.  Zero since they released it.  This is the this is how it looks.  What do you think.  How would you think this is this is you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's certainly not me.  I will not I can't walk around in the world without reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I would imagine it would be less disturbing than than being blocked off from the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah because you are looking at the world through this but it's super stuff superimposed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can move for games.  It'd be amazing.  You could you can move through a space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you trying to talk me into getting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah you have to.  Because we want to see you in it.  I don't know.  Oh I didn't see the back.  My oh that's that's serious too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah she said it was pretty comfortable.  Um and again this is a prototype.  I mean not a prototype exactly but it's not the it's not the finished product.  Um so let me read you Addie's description of of the experience.  By the way the Magic Leap is is the darling of Silicon Valley.  They've raised two point three billion dollars.  First investor was Google.  JP Morgan's put in money.  It was created by Rony Abovitz who was originally creating a movie.  And then said oh well in order for this to work we need to create this entire augmented reality  thing.  He announced Magic Leap in 2012 with a TEDx talk.  Addie writes in which he donned a full spacesuit and spoke for 30 seconds.  Today he won't even confirm it was him in the spacesuit.  Let's see at some point Robertson has a description.  Oh here it is.  It's so in re so she put the Magic Leap on.  When you write about augmented reality headsets you're supposed to start by describing something  impossible like a pastel dinosaur stomping its feet in a quiet office space in Florida.  This but that's where Magic Leap is.  This dinosaur is made of fist size blocks that look like candy and the office belongs  to Magic Leap a mysterious start that's been working in near total secrecy for seven years.  I should clarify the dinosaur also isn't real it exists only in the lenses of the Magic Leap  one a pair of goggles etc etc.  So in reality the dinosaur I see through the Magic Leap one looks genuinely three dimensional  but pieces start getting cut off when I approach it.  When a man walks behind it I can see him slightly.  My headset doesn't account for relative distance so it's impossible for somebody to walk in between  me and the dinosaur no matter how close they are.  It's a wonderful fascinating illusion maybe the best I've seen in one of these headsets  and far cooler than watching an AR model through an iPhone screen but it's not the kind of  revolutionary or downright magical advance that Magic Leap has teased for years.  This is the first time a lot of people have seen Magic Leap remember was it Steven Levy I think  who went no anyway people have gone and described it in magical terms but they haven't been allowed  to talk about it so this is the first time we've really kind of seen behind the curtain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's you really can't show it that's going to be when it comes time to sell this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you can't really guess what best I think it's Best Buy is going to have some that you can go try on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Best Buy someone she talks about it.  Because Best Buy is now a marketing space so it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah oh I'm trying to find it in the article because I don't remember what retailer it is.  Oh AT&T AT&T has already committed oh no they're going to do this later with wireless plans I'm  sorry somebody some retailer will have it in you can do a demo at their store somebody that's what  Microsoft's doing with HoloLens you can go to a Microsoft store and try it. So there will be a way  to try but you're exactly right I mean that's one of the problems with VR as well is that  you it's you got it's hard to do a test drive before you spend hundreds of dollars on these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well and it's hard to find a compelling use case that gets you to spend a hundred dollars I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like I think AR is not hard to find a compelling use case. So AR as it stands today in industrial

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stuff sure it's compelling in consumer type things at that price point I still think it's a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hard even though I think I'd pay this price if it were fully functional it didn't look like I  was wearing you know ant headgear you know if I didn't look like ant man wearing it I would pay  twenty three hundred bucks for it if I could walk around and see what people's names were you know  get you know get reputation information look at stuff and say you know like okay we're going to  be in Barcelona in three weeks if I could wear this around Barcelona and hear and see stuff about  what I'm looking at that would be cool. I had people pointing at you all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well do you want it to look normal like hidden or do you want it to look like a device on your face

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but not quite that. We're a long way off from it being hidden I think that's the dream right is  that it looks like spectacles like normal spectacles but well that's that's why I'm curious because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like I don't want to get beat up. How much smaller do you need it? You laugh but people got beat up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wearing Google Glass. I don't want to get beat up. I don't mind if people know I'm wearing  something kind of different. Okay. Ideally you know they would look like something more normal  but they they're getting closer this is the you know if you wore HoloLens around you'd really look  like you were some strange being. Yeah. And you can't really I mean it's a big backpack.  This is a lot smaller. All right maybe I'll get this.  Sorry Lisa. Oh no no no no you don't have to worry. She's there's to my left there's a hundred inch  projection screen television from Hisense that's ten thousand dollars and she's already decided  she wants that. We're going to review that in the new screensaver so I'm I'm good.  It's a projection TV there back. Well see that the box below that screen it's not it's eight  inches away from the wall. That's the point is that's the projector. It's a very very short  throw projector so you can basically put it where the TV is now put the screen above it  and and so the projector is right there it is it's projecting it right now. Oh that's kind of  interesting. It's projecting it right now from that box below not the big big box that's just  a something that's sitting there. And it's better than. It's UHD 4K it looks like a projection I  would say it looks like a projector. What's the advantage? It's a short throw 100 inch screen  100 inches. Got it got it got it. That's why she wants it. She wants in time for a Monday Night  Football. We want we want Jimmy Garoppolo to be in the room with us. That's what we want. I'm trying  to find I'm sorry I should have highlighted it or something. Would you use something to build an app

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for the Magic Leap because you've got AR kit and you have what is Google's what's it called?  AR Core. AR Core. Does Magic Leap have its own version of AR Witchamajigger? It must but it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's a suck. What they don't say is what operating system what the API or SDK looks like  they don't say anything about that. It may only be in-house. This is called the creator's edition  much like the HoloLens is. So that implies that as a creator of content you would want to get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There again cool use cases but I would say I would wait. I wouldn't buy it. But you should go for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there a resale value? No. No don't don't do it. Actually Leo don't do it. Don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't do it. It's available to creators in city. Oh yeah well that's another thing.  You can only buy it in five cities. Oh which five cities? San Francisco is one of them.  Oh no surprise. Sorry we're not delivering to your area.  Tucson. So but yeah but in if I put a San Francisco zip code I could get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know that's kind of weird too. They're not. Well I remember Google Glass you had to go in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and get trained. Oh that must be it right because you can't just you can't buy it online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right I think we can stop talking about this. Otherwise I might buy it. Otherwise you might buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it. Which is a sport I would enjoy. No this morning as I'm reading about it preparing for the show I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thinking I really seriously thought huh I should I get one. I didn't get the HoloLens. We did get

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Glass. Maybe that was that was the lesson learned. I don't know. Yeah I don't know.  Just wait. Just wait a little bit. You'll be okay. Oh no I no don't don't misunderstand me. I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have any need for this at all. My only question is is it is it important enough that we should

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  talk about it review it from a point of view of having used it or just. I don't think so.  I don't think so. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea.  I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea.  I think we can just leave it at that. I think so too. Yeah. Yeah. Okay I agree. It's a curiosity  for quite some time. It's a curiosity still. And it's not. I think if your viewers would say are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they going to invest in this? Yeah yeah. Well and I'm curious if The Verge is going to create like a  heads-up display curse because remember they did that deep dive into Intel's wireless glasses the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  vaunt. It's like being on the cover of Sports Illustrated. It's the end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it could be if these guys have problems then I'm calling it. I'm going to be like oh you don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  want The Verge to be yours. I'm calling it. You know what I got a good compromise. We'll get  Audie Robertson on one of our shows to describe those scripts. How about that? That's the compromise.  And by the way The Verge didn't buy it either. They went to Magic Sleep headquarters to try it.  So and they got more money than I do that's for sure. They went to Florida in July. That's  working hard. Oh man that's tough work by the way. So this year Podcast Expo was in or is in August  in Philadelphia which is by the way right now not a great place to be. A little hot.  Hot. Next year it's going to be Orlando.  Well you get the cheap. It tells you something about the podcast industry. You get the cheap rooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow so I just looked it up right there's Podcast Movement. That's the one. Podcast  Movement. There's Podcast Multimedia Expo. Oh I don't know that one. Podfest. We go to Podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Movement. You do go. I think Andrew goes to that. Yeah Andrew was at it last time. Yeah. Oh there  you go. That's the one. It was in July. It already was. July 23 to 26. Yeah we just missed it.  That was when Google Next was. Right so you couldn't go. Did Andrew go this year? Why? No  because I was in I was at Google. You see. So next year he can go while you stay home.  There we go. Feed Cheerios to the kid.  Thank you for the correction. It's probably dad. Dad's known for feeding cereal to children.  My father was famous for home fries. My dad was famous for pancakes. Yeah dads are good at

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  pancakes. I was the waffle guy in our house. No I'm the waffle girl but. Mr. Waffle. Dad is pancake

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  man. All right I got a break to the end of the show and I got to hear. Are you both buying new

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  June Evans? That's coming up as we continue with this edition of This Week in Google. She already  talked me into this. What was it? $1400? Okay we're gonna go. She already talked me into that. She  already talked me into that one. You don't regret it. The toaster oven with a camera in it. No I  don't. We've got a lot of good mileage out of that. Time to replace it. Our show today.  My favorite was when I demonstrated it and I said you know you can see what's cooking in it and there  was somebody cooking toast in it right when I opened it up. I said who's in our house?  This edition of This Week in Google brought to you by wordpress.com. I'm a big fan. That's where my  site is. Actually I started using WordPress when Matt Mullenweg first created it in early 2000s.  I was initially running it on my own server but the expense and the time consuming,  keeping it running and all that stuff. Eventually I was doing more of that and less blogging so I  thought I'm gonna go to wordpress.com. It's less expensive than paying for my own hosting. They  manage it. They take care of hosting, security, software updates, giving you time to focus on  what you created the site for in the first place. Your presence on the internet. Everybody needs to  have a place of their own, a home of their own, a room of one's own on the internet, a place where  you put up your best stuff. That's part of controlling your reputation if nothing else.  If you're a business you better put your site up there otherwise when they Google your business  name they're gonna find Yelp or something like that. Even if your business is a very  in the present, not a tech business, but you're cleaning gutters or washing windows or  a plumber, you need to have a website. When I hire somebody new I always check out their website  first. That's how you communicate with your customers. You may say I have a Facebook page.  No, that's not yours. That's Mr. Zuckerberg's. I have a Twitter feed. No, that's not yours.  That's Mr. Dorsey's. You need to have yours at wordpress.com. No limits. Create the ultimate  online hub that's yours and with room to grow as you aim higher. They've got great e-commerce  options. Everything from a simple buy button to a full online store. You can upload images. You can  upload video. You can upload audio. So it can host all of that import and export content to and from  your WordPress website. If you're on another platform, easy to move. Easy peasy. It's your  site, your home, your content. And with built-in SEO, social media linking and marketing tools,  you can grow your audience and reach new customers. They've got a great WordPress app on iOS and  Android that makes it easy to manage your site on the go. Not only moderate comments but post new  content. And you can launch your website with confidence knowing that they have a fantastic  support team. They're 24-7. No wonder 31% of all websites run on WordPress. That's almost a third  of every website in the world. Many great publications. Paul Thurotte's site runs on  WordPress. Steve Gibson's page, his blog runs on WordPress. Sure, he could host himself,  but it's just so much easier to put it on wordpress.com. WordPress plans start at just  $4 a month too, so it's a lot less than hosting it yourself. It's just the way to go. Right now,  you'll get 15% off your new plan purchase when you go to wordpress.com slash twig. Stand out from the  crowd. Create your own website. Put your mark on the world. WordPress.com slash twig. My daughter  did that. She's got poetry on there and video and papers that she's written for school. It's a really  good idea because that way you put your mark on the web and when people search for your name,  that's going to be the first thing they're going to find. WordPress. Oh, and by the way, putting  it on WordPress is a good idea because it's well indexed by Google. That's all that SEO stuff they  do. WordPress.com slash twig. Is June Oven going to be a pick? Should we save it for the end?  We can. I can make it a pick.  Well, it's up to you. Okay, if you're going to talk about it at the end, we'll save that for the end.  That's fine. Let's talk about actually probably the biggest story around Google these days.  First of all, we should say that Google has not announced this, but there was a rumor  that Google was going to work on a censored version of Google search. This comes from the  Intercept, Ryan Gallagher, for China. Leaked documents reveal Google's planning to launch  a censored version of its search engine in China that will blacklist websites and search terms  about human rights, democracy, religion, peaceful protest, all the things that Chinese government  doesn't like. According to the Intercept, the project codenamed Dragonfly has been underway  since the spring of last year. It was accelerated in December when Sundar Pichai met with the top  Chinese government official. And there are huge protests at Google from Google employees who say,  no, we got out of China because we didn't like them for a good reason. They're human rights record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we talked about this last week. Oh, it's over. Okay, never mind. No, no, no, no. I was going to  say the stories kept going. Yeah. Yeah, the story kept going. So last week it had just broken.  Oh, okay. And, you know, Jeff and I were talking about, you know, Jeff, as one can imagine, was  this is evil. Google should draw a line and stick to it. I didn't use the word evil, but I said I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was disappointed. Yeah, and I think that I said before when it comes to Apple, for instance,  working with the Chinese government, that American companies need to stand up and say,  we're not going to do, we're not going to work in authoritarian regimes, even if we could make a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of money there. You could argue that they work with authoritarian regimes right now in the U.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is not an authoritarian regime. Come on. You may not like it, but we do. This is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  comparable to China yet. There are some practices that are actually. But I guess I was going to say,  all right, I guess I was waiting for an immigrant. It's okay here. Right. Yeah.  Anyway, I was waiting for Google employees to weigh in and they did. And predictably,  they are unhappy. So I will see. I'm curious what happens from that perspective if Google,  individual Googlers end up preventing this or what goes on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is that old argument companies make that, well, we have to obey the laws of the countries  we work in. The thing that's different about Google is Google. If you choose to be in them.  Google decided not to do business in China because of its human rights record. And now  they're apparently considering going back. It's of course tempting because there's a lot of money  to be made in China. It's a billion Chinese people who are active avid internet users in many cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll make a prediction. Go ahead. Even if they do everything in China once,  which is a lot more now than it would have been when they left, which is a story up on the run down,  that the rules have gotten worse and worse. Even if they did everything that China wanted,  they'll fail there because you have to be a Chinese company to succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Baidu has said, oh, we'll beat them easy. Come on in Google. Baidu is the Google of China.  So China already blocks Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. So Google would have  to block all that. This is from the Observer. Anything that's anti-communism party content,  any political dissidents, of course that's obvious. Controversial news content,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  pornography- Controversial being defined as things that are critical of government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Revelations of business or political scandals. Anything harmful to social stability,  pornography, gambling, and violence. Winnie the Pooh is banned in China. And that goes back to the  fact that dissidents compared President Xi to a bear. During his visit to the US in 2013,  a meme comparing a photo of him in Barack Obama to an image of Pooh and Tigger went viral in China.  Xi didn't like it. Winnie the Pooh has been banned ever since. Google, do you really want to be in  a country where an autocratic leader can ban an image because he doesn't like it? Because he

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  finds it insulting? Well, I don't know. It's just the world now. What are you going to do about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I find it interesting. This is not the first time Google employees have become vocal  activists against company policy. Not a lot of companies have that problem.  Most employees just go along. There are three. Microsoft and,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  where I put up the third one, there was a story here that said this, that there have been employee  revolts on ethical issues at Google and Microsoft. And what was the third one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitch. No. Twitch. Apple?  Yeah. I wouldn't be surprised at Apple if Apple employees were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're in a highly lucrative field. Amazon. Amazon. Yeah. And there's such competition.  Not Apple, though. Interesting. Either way. And not Facebook.  I think they're secure in their jobs in the sense that if they get fired from Google,  they probably can go work at another company. That's true. So this is specifically, it's a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in nationalinterest.org about what they call engineering insurgency and say that these were  three potential protests around the use of AI. At Google, it was the drone image AI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon recognition. Isn't this what we've been calling for,  though, is that technologists should be aware of the consequences of their inventions and actions  and should be responsible and should stand up. I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I interviewed Jonathan Zunger. Love Jonathan.  For a project. He's brilliant. He was at Google. He was a Google engineer.  He was at Google. He's left to go to start up. He's really smart. And he said that software  engineers have to develop the same kind of standards of behavior as civil engineers did.  Civil engineer would build a bridge and the goal was it better not fall down. If it fell down,  you haven't done your job. So what's the equivalent? It's a lot easier to see a bridge  and see whether it's up or down. But what's the equivalent in software engineering and the  impact you have and the danger you present? And that it's a professional standard that has to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  develop. I think he's smart and right. If you throw that out. So I'm going to take  it a step further. If you build a bridge and it falls down, that is obviously a bad thing.  But what if you build a bridge and it allows movement of populations from one place to another  and thus changes the culture? Because I think the analogy, but civil engineers don't actually  have to think about that. And what we're asking technologists to do is actually that step further.  Because you could say, hey, does your code work? Yeah. So, and usually if you're thinking about  building a bridge, you actually do something like that with under municipal auspices. So  you have a vote for bond issues to build such bridge or whatever. So I'm just throwing that  out there as a thought process, because that's a more democratic thing to think about. And we're  trying to assign responsibility to these people. And I don't know how far many, whose job is it to  look ahead for the impact of some of these things? Not just that, you know, anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, you're absolutely right, Stacy. And it's, it's, it's whose job and how possible  is it to really know the impact? I'm going back to my Gutenberg stuff, right? It took 100 years  to get a lot of the impact in place and we're guessing at it and we don't know. And you're  right. You may be building something that has a positive impact. And my moral panic arguments  is if you cut off potential bad impact, you don't know what you're losing. So yeah, it's hard,  but I think, I think you have to have some ethic of impact, some ethic of thinking about this.  Now, I will not go as far as Tristan Harris arguing that, you know, these are all made to  addict us and that's evil. That doesn't give us enough agency and enough credit.  We're giving people choices that they can make. But we've got to have an ethic of worrying about

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a little bit. It's interesting because I'm sure that the original leak to the intercept probably  came from a Google employee working on this. And since the intercept reports that on a number of  Google sites, people are saying yes. In fact, a number of other Googlers have independently  confirmed the plan to Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Financial Times,  Agency France Press, Vice News and Bloomberg. One source, this is from the intercept,  one source who spoke to Bloomberg characterized the product as a censorship engine. Remember,  Google got out of China in 2010. At that time saying it was because of Chinese government efforts to  limit free speech, block websites, oh, and hack Google. So... And force Google to change Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rather than the government saying this is illegal, don't do this, you choose yes or no.  Right. It's not unlike what's happening in some parts of the European regulation. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we're going to make you do it, Google. Yeah, but I'm looking at the blog post from March 22, 2010.  This followed on the heels of Google announcing that they and 20 other US companies have been the  victims of a cyber attack originating from China. They were looking for the Gmail accounts of dozens  of human rights activists. And it was at that time, remember that? Yeah, I do. Yeah, it was at that  time, this is how they did it, stopped censoring our search services, Google search, Google News  and Google Images on Google.cn, the Chinese version of Google. Users visiting Google.cn  are now simply redirected to the Hong Kong version where we are offering uncensored search.  So that's been the status quo for the last eight years since then. So what it sounds like is they  want to bring back Google.cn and in order to do that, of course, you'd have to comply with  those Chinese government regulations about what search engines can, what results they can produce.  I mean, I guess Baidu does the same thing, right? They're a Chinese search engine, right?  Yeah. Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what's interesting is Baidu has some excellent kind of image recognition technology and that  sort of thing. And I'm very curious what it does with the data it gets in terms of handing things  over to the government. And don't forget, China has their social IQ score that they're playing  with, which if you think about Google participating in something like that gets really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And incidentally, China has started exporting this social IQ to other countries, to  friendly nations. There's no question in my mind that this, you know, not only has China become  authoritarian under Xi, much more authoritarian under Xi, who is now president for life,  but wants to export its form of authoritarian rule to other countries.  Using its economics. I think this Google has to take this pretty seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the other thing that's going to happen is, I mean, we keep on waiting for China  to export its businesses to the rest of the world. And the argument that I hear when I talk to people  about this is the Chinese market is just so damned huge. They don't need to yet. And they operate  under such advantage now. But at some point, you know, Baidu and WeChat are going to come out into  our market and they're going to come with these limitations. I don't know if you saw that the DNC  basically ordered every campaign, every Democrat to not use phones from Huawei and LTC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this came up because there was a local committee was about to buy a bunch of, I think,  ZTE phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they buying Lenovo laptops? I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but it's a very interesting point. I mean, ZTE and Huawei are particularly  suspect because they are at least partially owned by the Chinese military, by the government.  One of them was founded by Chinese military. So their, you know, their ties are very close  to the Chinese government. Maybe more so than Lenovo. I don't know. Yeah, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we've stopped them from coming. They've tried to come in several times  in various guises with various deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a very nice Huawei phone, the P20, that is really a remarkable phone.  And I don't consider it more dangerous.  I always wondered about you, Laporte.  That you were a spy.  I don't know. I mean, I don't know. You know, here's where, okay, this is the far-fetched  brisk. If the Chinese were to invade the United States, they'd have a nice dossier on people  who are using their equipment. If you are a government worker or you're in the DNC,  where you've already been hacked once, at least once, it would make sense that you wouldn't want  to give information to another country. If you're a company, there's always the risk of competitive  espionage. So in those cases, yeah, but I don't think China is going to invade us. So I think  I'm okay. Unless they really want to complicate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I don't think Russia is going to invade us, but they're going to invade us digitally.  Yeah.  They have invaded us digitally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting. So we talk a lot about Russia and their attempt to influence the elections  and so forth. We'll stipulate that that happened. I think that's pretty clear. Do you think China  is trying to do the same thing? Have they done the same thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think China is much more interested in competitive intelligence. So there have been  plenty of examples of them grabbing intelligence from American companies and things like getting  information for, you know, dissidents. So I think that's more of its interest. I don't think China  really cares about invading the US or probably messing with our elections as much as Russia does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they have different geopolitical aims. They're actually a real economic powerhouse,  which Russia is not. And Russia would love to reclaim some of its territories in the  former Soviet Union. China is not. Well, China has its own territorial powers.  They have their own territorial aims.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I don't know. It's interesting.  Hello, South China Sea Island.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm more scared about Facebook getting my banking information.  This is going to piss me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. That's why I brought it up.  This story was so sensationalistic and misleadingly done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's what TechCrunch said. They said that the Wall Street Journal overblow this story,  that Facebook was looking for a chat to partner with banks to do chat bots. But  the journal said in its headline anyway, give us your data, Facebook to banks,  give us your data. We'll give you our users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why I won't pay for the Wall Street Journal is this kind of techno panic,  agenda based pseudo journalism against technology. It pisses me off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, come on. You think that Emily Glazier and Deepa Sithra,  I don't think it's Anna Maria and Rota and Andriotis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They probably didn't. They probably didn't write their own headline. That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The headline, let's throw out headlines are always should be thrown out, right? Because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  headline writers, the headline is how the editors have an impact on the story and know it's going  to get passed around. And so what's the story say? The story says the social media giant has

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  asked large US banks to share detailed financial information about their customers, including card  transactions and checking account balances as part of an effort to offer new services to users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, right. Facebook, like many services elsewhere, including all over China,  is looking at offering a chat as direct customer service, including banking. Not a big deal at all.  It's not about give us this data. They're trying to make it into scare words. The lead could have  gotten rewritten like the head, but it's irresponsible. Yeah. In fact, the rest of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  article goes on to say Facebook's basically and imagine, would you like this considering  a feature where Facebook Messenger would show your checking account balance, maybe fraud alerts?  You ask for it. Yeah. If you, yeah. First of all, you have to say I am a customer of,  you know, the US bank corp and I want this to be in my messenger or let me follow the chat bot.  Now, I don't know why Facebook needs to have this information. Look at all these things you can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  on WeChat. Isn't that what we should have that Facebook tries to do that and data privacy is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sticking point in the bank's conversations with Facebook said people familiar with the matter.  In other words, banks are pushing back saying one large US bank pulled away from the talks due to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  privacy concerns, which is, which is a PR question up, you know, the journals just like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you don't know if it's a PR question or if Facebook's asking for more than it might need  for this. I mean, understanding your customer data is that is, that is your gold right now.  That all the companies think that that's their big thing. I don't necessarily agree with all of it,  but Facebook could be asking for more information than they want to give or to be the point of  control for this. And the banks are like, yeah, you know what, if we give you this,  we actually want a little bit more in return. So it could be PR or negotiation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, we know Facebook would ask for that. I mean, that, why wouldn't they?  Of course they're going to ask for it. They may not expect they'll get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But they're going to say, give us all the, they're going to start the conversation starts with, hey,  give us all this information and we'll give you this. And then the bank says, oh, that's our

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  customers. You're jumping right over right there. This is, that's what, that's what tech crunch gets  better than the Wall Street Journal does. This was the way the Wall Street Journal presents it is  give us all this information and we'll offer you something. The way tech crunch presented says,  no, I can go, I, as a customer can ask for my balance or ask for my credit card purchases  through chat and I get it back through the platform, through Facebook. That's not Facebook  asking them for data. That's offering a service to users. I could be wrong. I don't know the  details here, but tech crunch did a far more reasonable version. Tech crunch just repeated

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the Facebook spokesperson's point of view. That's all tech crunch did. Which I have a little,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Cause yeah, Facebook clearly wants to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We know the disclosure. And by the way, nobody thinks that you are somehow magically influenced.  That's why I do disclosures that I raised money for the Craig Newmark graduate school

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  journalism from Facebook, but I received no money from them and I'm independent of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we also know that you have a bias toward Facebook because you like it.  And you have a bias toward technology. Yeah. Well, I don't think this is any technology. I think,  oh, yes, there's a clear, no, no, there's a clear track record. Facebook has a clear track record.  Moral panic. No, it's not moral panic. That's Facebook has a clear track record of invading  our privacy. It's why I'm not on Facebook. It's a loathsome operation. And I wouldn't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Meanwhile, the journalists, the journalists who want to save you from all this, the journalists  who exposed Cambridge Analytica, the journalists who are against all of this are begging Facebook  for exception so they can make up fake accounts and get your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. So that's why I'm not on Facebook because everybody wants to use-  But who's the bad guy in that? The journalists.  Facebook is also a participant. Because Facebook's holding the rules. Facebook's saying no.  Okay. But that's mostly because they want to keep it to themselves.  Because Facebook's real advantage is having all this information so they can use it for advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's go back to the point that they're not going to use any banking data for advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They didn't vow it. Facebook spokesperson Elizabeth Diana tells TechCrunch it's not  acting for credit card transaction data for banks. They would get into such trouble if they did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They already get credit card transaction data. There are retailers who sell their credit card

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  transaction data to Facebook. So they already have some-  To advertisers as well and media companies as well.  I was at a company where we bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I will say that things like your bank balance being at Facebook is a little worrisome because  Facebook could turn around. People already use it for things like impacting and deciding your  credit score. What happens if Facebook has this information not for advertising but just to give  people a more complete picture of their user base? Facebook already works with PayPal and 40 countries

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to let users get receipts via messenger for their purchases. And I suppose it's possible that  Facebook goes, no, no, I don't want to see that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Listen, Google gets all this now and I'm very grateful because I get-  It's all in Gmail too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all in Gmail and I get my, oh, your trip to Buenos Aires and Google figures it out and they  put the airline reservation and they put the Uber ride.  So I stopped doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They put the hotel all in there.  That's one of the reasons I don't use Gmail anymore. I use my own email service. But I do  forward to TripIt any travel plans I want. In other words, I actively, instead of passively  letting these companies scan my Gmail, I actively send forward, and you can do that with TripIt,  forward the emails to them. And that's, I find sufficiently convenient.  I think it's not unreasonable. Now, the sad thing is, and the only reason we're fighting about this  is because you get to choose what you want to do, Jeff, and I get to choose what I want to do.  But the vast majority of Facebook users are unaware of whatever the consequences are.  And so they need to be protected. I think they need to be protected against Facebook's  overweening desire for their personal information.  But they're not going to be because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In Google, yes, they sell advertising, but Google in many ways uses data to make better products.  Facebook uses data to sell you at a higher rate to advertisers.  There's a slight difference in trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You get something from Facebook. And obviously, the reason people are on Facebook is they consider it,  because I think most people now understand that there is a leakage of personal information,  there's been enough attention placed, that they're willing to do that though,  because they don't want to leave Facebook. That's where all their family and friends are.  Well, the difference is that I'm sharing things publicly on Facebook.  You're getting something of value. I think Stephanie- Oh, there she is. I thought Stacey  just fainted. She walked off the show.  She said, that's it. Facebook's statement today, according to John Constine, right in TechCrunch,  shows more scruples than Google, which last year struck ad measurement data deals with data  brokers that have access to 70% of credit and debit card transactions in the US. That led to  a formal complaint from the FTC. Correction. Google tells us-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To the FTC from Epic. There's a big difference.  Right. Oh, from Epic.  Epic complains about everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Epic complains about everything. The Electronic Privacy Information Center.  Correction. Google tells us that deals are for ad measurement data, not ad targeting,  as we originally published. I guess ultimately, because of the warring stories here,  you believe what you want to believe or what evidence has led you to believe.  I believe fully that Facebook would love this information. I also believe that banks,  like a lot of companies, are saying, well, that's of value to us. What are you going to give us?  We're not just going to give up the information. But I think if they were given something of value,  they probably would. There are privacy restrictions on what banks can tell people about,  I would presume, about my account. Maybe not. I don't know. We're all kind of screwed when it  comes to privacy one way or the other. I can quit Facebook and stop using Gmail. It's not going to  particularly make a difference in how much these companies know about me. Not that I care. I've got  nothing to hide. But I still think they should be. I think they need to be held a little bit  accountable. Don't you? Come on. You've got to admit that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you go to an Alex Jones rant about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not going that far. I think I'm being very reasonable, Jeff.  I was trying to say that.  I'm being very reasonable. I don't think that's unreasonable to say,  this is Facebook's business model. And Mark Zuckerberg has a long and tragic history-  It's media's business model. We just do it badly.  ... of moving fast and breaking things and then apologizing later. Come on. That's their  business model. They never even deny it. In fact, somebody was telling me, we had some kids in here  who had just gone to Facebook and they were talking to a Facebook guy and he said, yeah.  So now our motto is move fast and break a few less things. Even internally they're saying that.  It's fewer things, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we've got to do Infowars story.  Which one?  Infowars story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. We did that before the show started.  Yeah, we haven't done that yet.  Censorship. Alex Jones, Infowars. First of all, I became first aware of Infowars when a lot of our  audience members mentioned it as a fun thing to read. They really thought of it as entertainment.  Now this is probably eight years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how people in Austin- so he's from Austin and we always- there used to be signs around  cafes and stuff and we would just giggle. It was a joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Infowars itself tells you kind of- the name of the site kind of tells you-  it was always a little bit of a conspiracy theory kind of nutty site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alex Jones argued it was weekly world news. It was aliens coming down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And even in his divorce proceedings, Alex Jones said, I play a character.  I mean, it's pretty patently a character. However, some of the stuff he said has been so scurrilous  and damaging, in particular the horrific things he said about the parents of children  murdered in Sandy Hook. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay, I have to-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not even going to let you finish. I'm going to pull a Kanye. What's so damaging is that we have  someone in power who either A, doesn't actually recognize that this guy's just a kook playing a  part and has legitimized him. That's what's so freaking scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I slightly see if you agree with this, slightly change the slant of that. It's the same  roughly, but this comes from Cory Doctorow, a great piece, something about Mark Zuckerberg's  oily rag fire in which he said something I thought was quite astute, which was that in 2016, what  really happened was very targeted advertising, mostly on Facebook, but some other places,  empowered a slimy underbelly of the American people to let their true feelings of racism  out and in fact got them to vote, something that they hadn't done in years if ever.  And as a result, galvanized this, what is it, 30%, 20%, 10%, I don't know, but enough  people, especially given the apathy and the lack of voting from everybody else, that got  somebody in power that supported this point of view. And if that hadn't happened, if this  slimy underbelly hadn't been empowered, then what Alex Jones says and does would be weekly  world news. It would be a sideshow, but the problem is not so much that Alex Jones exists,  but that the people who believe Alex Jones and QAnon and all this bogosity now suddenly are active  and feel empowered and are acting on it. You have Charlottesville and we're going to have on the  anniversary of Charlottesville something possibly worse in DC soon, that those people have been  empowered by all this. And that's what's, I don't think it's the man in the White House.  I think it's that these people, that these, he's empowered by these people and these people have  somehow been activated. Somebody added some water and dehydrated them and they voted and they're  active and they're marching around with Nazi flags and tiki torches. It's violent, it's repulsive,  but I don't think you blame Alex Jones for it. I think he's always been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's got a light on, there's no water they threw on, it was gasoline and he's got a match.  But he's always, that match has always been there.  Yeah, that's true. And the other factor here is media, is that we amplified, we were manipulated  and amplified this. We were used, Facebook was used, Twitter is used. And it's the weakness in  democracy that we believe in openness and information. And it's a weakness to play that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the Russians played and the trolls played the same. Well, God bless it. I'm glad we live in an open  country. I'm glad that there's the First Amendment. I'm glad that there's free speech. I think that  the antidote to this gas fire, this dumpster fire is for the vast majority of right-minded, open-minded  citizens to step forward and stop, get off their butts and start voting and start participating.  Not, well, I mean, okay, I'd be wary of the desire to censor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But censorship is what government does. Editing and choosing is what both platforms and publishers  and bar owners do. Get out of my bar, you're not welcome here. Well, what if it weren't Alex Jones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what if it were 4chan? Because Alex Jones is basically 4chan. QAnon is a 4chan, is a 4chan loss.  Well, 4chan isn't on Facebook. Right. But what if there were, what if somebody came along and said,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  let's shut down 4chan? Well, no, no, no, that's different. That's different. That's not going to  happen. The internet is open. There are dark corners of the internet where Alex Jones can  find his cockroaches and convene. Nobody's shutting that down. Nobody's stopping his speech.  Mark Zuckerberg is not responsible for free speech. He does not run the internet. He has a choice and  a responsibility to decide proper behavior on his platform, as does Jack Dorsey, which leads us to  the real question. I'm curious, Stacey, what's your view is, did Facebook and Apple and Spotify  and YouTube do the right thing in going ahead and killing eventually Alex Jones and Infowars sites?  And what do you think Jack Dorsey and Twitter should do? And Google, by the way, because Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus still apparently carries Alex Jones content. So Twitter and Google Plus are the two who have  not yet done anything about that. Stacey, what's your thought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think pulling the podcast is fine. Alex Jones has his app. Making it easier to find that sort of  thing is fine. And they're apparently really excited and people download it and that's good.  You can have a website. As for Twitter banning him, he does clearly violate or he has in the past  violated their terms of service. So they say he hasn't those days. This is the, this is the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's easily proven. We need to go back in and find tweets where he attacks somebody or he says  he calls for violence or does some of the things that Twitter says are not okay. And if you can go  back and find those, then you send those to Jack Dorsey and you say, look,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  let's say he didn't, but he's still doing billyish and horrible things.  He can be billyish and horrible on Twitter. He can be. He can. Everybody else is.  He can market his. Well, here's a different question. Would, if Harvey Weinstein had a Twitter  account, given everything he's done, none of which he did on any platform, is it within the rights of  Facebook and Twitter to kill Harvey Weinstein's account because they won't be associated with him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. No. Okay. I don't think so. I think as a business putting info wars on Facebook,  Facebook has the right to take it down if they want to. Twitter has the right to take it down  if they want to. I think Facebook not taking it down or sorry, Facebook taking it down,  says something about Facebook that many people want it, you know, that are happy about same thing  with Twitter. I don't, I think Apple deciding to say, you know what, we're not going to act  as a distribution platform for your podcast. Fine. As long as he's still got a space on the  internet, a company should be able to say, yeah, get out of my bar. I agree. It would be wrong,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  however, for Google to censor search results. Yes. Well, there's a question by the EU.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is, this is interesting because remember when Matthew Prince of Cloudflare  talked about- This is a challenging one. Yeah. Yeah. He talked about removing his-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a Daily Stormer. So the Daily Stormer website was using Cloudflare for DDoS protection.  Initially, Matthew Prince said, we're not going to do anything about that. We're an open platform  and we don't want to get in the business of deciding which content we should protect.  After considerable comment, including by the way, and to be perfectly blunt, they were an advertiser  at the time and we decided to decline their advertising as a result, which I have really,  was a very difficult decision for me. The day we decided not to do that, coincidentally,  he said, all right, we're going to block them. I complete, by the way, completely understood  Matthew Prince's point of view and did not, as I'm arguing here, did not disagree with it.  But we decided not to do the advertising mostly because I felt like  that would be counterproductive for everybody. It would be counterproductive for Cloudflare because  it would just stimulate a big battle over this and it would be counterproductive for us. We'd be  caught in the crossfire. Since, by the way, we brought them back, we said, yes, we'll be glad  to take your advertising now. But it was not, in both cases, it wasn't either a condemnation nor  an endorsement of his decision. I kind of understood his decision, both directions, but just not  thinking that doing the advertising at that point would be not good for anybody.  So I said, no, we're not going to take your money here because you didn't believe me,  you don't want to run an ad now and I don't want to do it. So I should probably not even  have mentioned that, but in the interest of clarity, I will. So Stacey, that's a challenging

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thing. I don't know what I would do if it were Matthew Prince's point of position.  So let me throw another thing out here. So Jack said something about we don't want to succumb  to outside pressure. And I wrote a piece the other day saying that, no, what's really happening here,  I think, is that society is negotiating its norms. And the platforms would love us to do that  with a rule set. Here's the rule to follow. We're going to do that anecdotally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could pass it off and say, we'll just do what you say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So we're going to do that instead anecdotally. And what society is saying,  what a large portion of society is saying is, if you have a rule set that leaves InfoWars in with  all their bilious behavior, then it's a bad rule set. No, InfoWars is over the line. You figure out  what the line is, people, but get rid of it. And so yes, there was outside pressure, but I think  that it actually was the system beginning to work. It was society saying, we're going to identify a  line. We're going to identify InfoWars is on the wrong side of it. Now we'll figure out the rest  later, but we think it's a bad thing. We think you shouldn't stand up and distribute it. And so it  was democracy. It was the market working in a way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that happened with pornography, but still there are purveyors of porn, much to many people's  chagrin at a certain point in time. So you could be saying that that line may have been drawn  and Twitter may be like, you know what? I'm okay distributing. It's the equivalent of being, I'm  okay with distributing porn. So, I mean, again, I think it's a legit stance to take. I may not  like it, but it's their right and they can do it. There is an argument that you want to be careful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about banning stuff because it's unpopular or because somebody doesn't like it. But that's not,  but this is people saying that there was a moral. It feels moral to you, but maybe to some, maybe to  Alex Jones, it doesn't. I mean, I don't want to be the sit on the high throne of moral judgment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, uh, hair, uh, inciting the harassment of the parents of murdered children,  no matter how you cut it, it's pretty reprehensible. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and B and you  are the company you keep. And at some level, uh, as I say, the problem is that Zuckerberg thought  he was responsible for free speech. And that's only if he runs the whole internet, which maybe  he wants to do in some countries and does, but that's not, and even in the United States,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  many cases, Facebook is what people do on the internet. I mean,  he's rapidly getting that moral responsibility. But if we go there, the economist had a piece

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  today that almost said, you know, treat them as government. In that case, you could, you'd,  you'd be requiring Facebook to distribute info wars. That's not a world I want either.  So very challenging. It's all that's the, that's the, that's the ultimate lesson here is I think  that there's this kind of presumption that these are easy decisions and why the hell did they do  them before? These are hard decisions. They have many implications. There are hidden dangers here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I think there are also a wide variety of opinions and users and  yeah, I don't think this is not a black and white thing. We love black and white computers,  love black and white, you know, computer purveyors and systems online love it because you can make  it work. But really this is, this is stuff you should be having conversations about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I'd ask Stacey about this. So there's two FCC stories in the hopper. One,  the FCC, Ajit Pai is blaming his Obama appointed CIO for his story that the FCC comment site was  hacked. But instead it was DDoSed as the investigative report has proven, DDoSed by  a lot of Americans commenting that they wanted to preserve net neutrality. Ajit Pai said, hey,  I said it was hacked, but that wasn't my fault. It was that Obama guy told me that.  Okay. On that, that's, okay, that's patently bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  False. Ajit Pai, so-  But!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But! Here's the other story. The FCC has now sided with Google Fiber over Comcast  on one touch make ready, which you're going to have to explain, but it basically opens the polls,  right? To third party internet service providers, the utility polls. So that's good. So which is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and stopping Sinclair was good, killing net neutrality was bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which is it?  No.  I didn't see the R story. Hold on. I gotta go see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one touch make ready is a rule that lets companies attach wires to utility polls  without waiting for the other users of the poll to move their own wires. Google Fiber says the  utilities have been dragging their heels and that's what killed Google Fiber because they  couldn't get up on the polls. Comcast and AT&T wouldn't make their polls ready. One touch make  ready says, hey, you can do the adjustments yourself, Fiber. Comcast said, don't do it,  man. The FCC, stop, man. That's terrible. So this Ajit Pai rejected the argument saying  that startups are unnecessarily delayed when they have to wait for incumbent ISPs  before hanging wires. This is one of a couple of, I think, interesting Pai decisions pro competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and this is something that Wheeler actually implemented or started. They started this way back  in the day and it was a legitimate issue and Austin and AT&T was just dragging their feet forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Could have something to do with 5G too because 5G might require some of this deployment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but it also will help because this again takes some power. Not all polls are actually  owned by utilities. Some of them are owned by municipalities and this takes away some of the  state's ability to say to ISPs they can put restrictions on things. So, Horizon supports this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  one touch make ready because that will help them implement 5G. Oh, 5G, of course. Right.  So, what I'm looking for is a thread. I'm just looking for a consistent point of view from Ajit  Pai. It takes away power from... And maybe it's just I'll do whatever Verizon tells me to do. Maybe  that's the consistent point of view. I don't know. It takes away power from the states.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It does help, but it puts power in the hands of people who actually own that good.  So, yeah, I mean, it's overall a positive thing and sometimes a stop clock can be right,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what, twice a day? And then... And maybe Ajit Pai isn't 100% evil. I don't know. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's... He's not. I mean, he's just... He's a human.  We think. We're not sure. He is human and he is in a crappy spot. I mean,  imagine having the entire internet or most of the internet hating you.  I mean, the lobbyists at Comcast and AT&T, they're used to that. They get paid really good money.  I don't think Ajit Pai does. Not yet, anyway. Not yet. Yeah, that's the right thing, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon has launched grocery pickup at Whole Foods for Prime members. Get on in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Rose, what does that mean? They pack it for you and you pick it up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You order it and they pack it. It's actually a really handy service.  Have you used it? I have not used the Amazon one. I've used HEB,  my groceries. This is not a weird service. So this isn't delivery. This is... You call them ahead or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  go online and you order and then they have it ready for you and you just go get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. You basically, like, if you can do your grocery shopping on your lunch hour at your  computer and then pack it up on the way home. Yeah. Oh, okay.  Yeah. I mean, it's actually quite convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the information says that they have information that people are not using their  Amazon Echoes or other voice-enabled device to buy things. In fact, only 2% of people with devices  that use Amazon Echo have made a purchase so far this year. This is according to two people briefed  on the company's internal figures. Now, 2% of 50 million is still not a bad number.  I buy stuff on it. I buy stuff with it all the time. I find it insanely convenient,  but they make a point. You do?  Yeah. They make a point that you're not going to buy a stereo system or, you know, you're only  going to buy commodities or something you don't have to try. I can't even reorder my dog treats

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on that thing. It is so bad. The interface is terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The reason I use it is because I'm in the bathroom. I'm out of toothpaste. I'll say,  Echo, buy some toothpaste. And I'll say, well, the last thing you bought was this.  We want me to buy some more. And I say, yes. They say, what's your number? I say my number  and that's it. And it comes. Yeah, my experience is not like that.  Wait, wait, wait. You have an Echo in the bathroom?  Of course I do. Actually, my real problem is the Echo in the bathroom is too close to the Echo  in the closet and the Echo in the bedroom. So I have to give them different names because if I say  Echo or the other word, they all go, what? And sometimes the wrong one picks it up.  The ESP doesn't work for you? Not at all. It's supposed to know which one  you're closest to. Yeah, it is.  The worst thing that happens is I'll say, and it's happened today. This is why I'm familiar with it.  I say, Echo, listen to First Up podcast because I like the NPR First Up podcast when I'm  getting dressed. I listen to the news and unfortunately I'm in the bathroom, but the  bedroom one starts playing First Up. So I say, Echo, stop. The one in the bathroom stops. And  then I say, Echo, listen to the daily on the bathroom Sonos. And then I have two new shows going  at the same time. Out of sync.  Out of sync. No, it's two different shows. So yes, they're  Oh, two different shows. Yes. Well, every once in a while they both talk about the same story. So  I feel like the left ear and the right ear are at least, it's very bad. Is that what they call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ESP? I think they call it ESP.  Echo Sensing. Extra Sensor.  Proximity. What is it? Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, don't look it up. It's okay. Anyway, do you read it?  Extra Stolen Privacy. Yeah, extra stolen privacy. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Echo Spatial Perception. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So do you think this is a big deal? The information got a lot of  press over this that so few people have bought things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't know, because there's consistent like when the Echo came out,  everyone was like, oh, this is to help Amazon boost commerce. And people talked about people  with Echos tending to buy more and spend more on Amazon. It didn't actually say that they did it  over their Echos. And I think it's a very shallow way of looking at the platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree. It's just really, so that's just my opinion.  Bad expectations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I mean, of course, Amazon would love it if you bought more stuff with your Echo,  but it's just part of a whole ecosystem. And I am all in on Prime. You are all in on Prime.  You are all in on Prime. And you and you and you, I mean, clearly it's working.  As long as you're buying it from Amazon, do they care how you ask for it? I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I thought was actually a way more interesting story was the one I think that came out today,  or maybe it was yesterday about stolen GoPros and how people fencing stolen merchandise lower the  cost of that. Like, Amazon's price matching algorithms lower their prices and other merchants  lower their prices. And it really frustrates the manufacturers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So thieves go on Amazon selling stolen GoPros for a really low price because  they stole them.  It fell off a truck.  And unfortunately, it hurts doubly because not only is the thief selling a stolen GoPro,  but GoPro now gets lower prices because of Amazon's pricing algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of an interesting, that's one of those cases where, you know, the algorithm is  behaving in a way that, you know, probably shouldn't. And does Amazon really have a  care? It doesn't really, it's like an externality for Amazon, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think the algorithm is a little too algorithmic sometimes on its pricing.  We've seen weird side effects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When people point things out where algorithm, Amazon's algorithms don't work so well,  Amazon has reacted. Remember that Business Week story when they talked about like,  people not having access to prime, I think it was in poor areas of Boston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I know. Terrible. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  I love this Samsung accidentally publishes the official Galaxy Note 9 video, which they  accidentally have done right before the release of every phone for the last four years.  Accidentally.  But it makes tech bloggers happy.  I'm not going to repeat that story. Let's see. There it is, but we're not going to repeat it.  We're not going to repeat it.  I think we could just take a break now and go to your picks, right? Is there anything?  I'll give you guys a chance.  If there's anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would love to leave because I was planning on being done by four o'clock, but we are not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here we go. Quickly, quickly. One ad and then you'll get your pick and you can go. I'm so  sorry, Stacey.  No, no, no.  We started late and I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We started late. Well, that's, that's, I'm like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's on me. That's all on me. I was watching TV.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Actually, this is good for people who like to go quick.  Rocket Mortgage is the entirely online mortgage approval process that unlike,  unlike my last experience buying a house, doesn't take months to get a home loan.  Takes minutes.  I love Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans, the best lender in the country.  Number one in customer satisfaction year after year, eight years in a row, according to JD Power.  Number one.  They're also number one in volume and I think they go hand in hand, right?  They took over at the end of last year from the big bank  who took months to get me my home loan.  And you better believe it. The next time I buy a house, rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  They've also done something to reduce the anxiety of buying a house.  The most expensive thing you're ever going to buy.  It's a big deal too. You want to buy the right house.  You want to buy a house that you and your family will love for the years you're going to be living  in it. So you don't want to be rushed or pressured.  That's why Quicken Loans has created the power buying process.  So it starts going to rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  You don't have to fill out a long application.  You answer a couple of questions.  They can get information, the information they need on income and assets and credit  just from the trusted financial institutions that they work with.  As long as you give it your permission within a few minutes,  they're going to give you what they call qualified approval.  Within 24 hours, they'll give you a verified approval.  Now the verified approval is really cool because that's basically  puts you at makes you a cash buyer.  With your verified approval letter, when you make an offer on a house,  the seller says, oh, no contingency.  You're good for the money.  It's like you got cash.  There's you go right to the head of the line.  So that's very important.  But once you're verified, you also qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.  This is really a nice way to reduce the anxiety.  And this is a relatively new thing.  For the last few years, interest rates have been flat.  They're starting to go up and even a quarter of a percent more.  And you're going to pay tens of thousands of dollars more over the life of the loan.  So that's pressure to buy now before the rates go up some more.  And we don't want that.  We want to make it easy.  We want you to have the time to look at their houses and find the right one for you,  not just buy it because you got it right now.  They lock up your rate for up to 90 days, up to three months.  So you can go house hunting and not worry about rates.  They can't go up.  They can't go up.  If rates go up, it doesn't matter.  Your rate stays the same.  If rates go down, your rate will go down, but it can't go up.  Either way you win.  It's exactly what you'd expect from the best mortgage lender in the country.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Take the stress out of buying a house.  Make it a pleasant experience.  It's fun to look for your new home.  It is as long as you don't have that stress.  And Rocket Mortgage just takes the stress out of the equation.  Now here's some legalese I got to read.  Don't get stressed.  Rate shield approvals only valid on certain 30-year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on Quicken Loans data  in comparison to public data records.  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states.  And MLSconsumeraccess.org number 3030.  But really all you have to worry about, all you have to remember,  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Honestly, the way to buy your next house.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.  Oh, they do refis too.  Thank you, Quicken Loans, for making twig possible.  Stacey, let's get your thing out of the way.  The June Oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, this is the second generation June.  I don't have it with me in Seattle to show you.  Did you buy it?  No, no, no, I have the first generation.  So this the pricing here is really worth talking about.  So it is a very similar oven.  We'll talk about what's different.  It is right now you can buy it for $100 off.  So it's $4.99.  Or you can buy the quote unquote gourmet package, which is $6.99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did I blow it by buying the really expensive one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to tell you and you can decide.  Okay.  Because it's your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Comes with extra warranty and the recipes app and a bunch of trays.  Okay.  How much does that cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much does the gourmet one cost?  $100 more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $6.99. $200 more.  Better be some nice trays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a bunch of them.  So what do we think?  Did you blow it?  Well, the new one is different.  Is it smaller?  It's the same size.  It doesn't have the scales in the feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I like the scales in the feet because then it knows how much you're.  It doesn't actually do that.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is what I learned.  So it has, and they also did away with the knob, which had some extra sensors and is  extra super fancy because most people just touch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, nobody uses the knob.  Yeah.  I use the knob.  I do too, but I can understand why you wouldn't need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah.  So that's one of the ways they cut it.  They also have more volume.  They also have more experience.  So they've changed their manufacturing process.  So I talked to Matt Van Horn and he'll be on the podcast tomorrow if you are a June  aficionado.  As I am.  I love my job.  As one might be.  Yeah.  And I would say what they did, Leo, you and I helped make this oven possible.  Basically, they looked at all the data from the existing customers and they said,  you know what?  Here's what people need.  Here's what they don't.  And they kept the stuff like the fast heating.  So the carbon fiber heating elements, they kept the camera, they kept all of that.  They kept the local control.  And, you know, I would buy this oven again in a heartbeat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It kind of makes sense.  This is an example of a feedback loop that modern technology allows because, you know,  if you buy a normal toaster oven, Hamilton Beach knows nothing about how you use it.  But June knows everything about how you use it.  So that they can improve it.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This does a lot of things.  It does the air frying.  You know, you can use it as a...  Wait a minute.  I can use it as an air fryer?  You can use yours as an air fryer.  I didn't know that.  So you do have to buy a $50 air fryer tray.  But yeah, I've used mine as an air fryer for chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're about to buy an air fryer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't do that.  Your June doesn't.  My June doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah.  Thank you, Stacey.  Leo should say thank you, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Stacey.  Look at all the baskets.  I didn't know all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I can get the June air baskets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're actually real.  Like I have them.  They're very handy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bought a big fancy dehydrator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Yeah.  You can get rid of your dehydrator too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm not.  I just bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, sell it on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I like my dehydrator.  I could do a lot more in that because it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, there you go.  Keep your dehydrator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't need a new crumb tray or wire shelf or June pan.  Thermometer's good.  So, all I really need is these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Stacey, two questions.  Is there anything that this one has that your expensive one doesn't have?  A. And then B.  Is there anything that if you had this one alone,  you would miss that the expensive one has?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would miss the knob on the expensive one,  but I would totally be fine.  And I would totally pay less if I could.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is less than half the original June oven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I have a lot of my friends, actually.  They emailed me and they're like, is this real?  Is this the same?  And I was like, yeah, it's basically,  it's almost exactly the same with the exception of those two things mostly.  And it doesn't have anything that would change the cooking experience.  In fact, over time, when I bought it, they've added many new programs.  So, it's actually gotten better for me over time.  And this comes with all that automatically.  So, I'm like, it's a no-brainer, guys.  If this is now in your price point, go buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A. Toaster ovens are really useful in the kitchen.  This is a very smart internet connected toaster oven.  Has an app, has a camera, has a thermo probe and all of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  B. And it has the preset recipes, which I cannot over-  A. Do you use those a lot?  B. Oh my gosh.  We always use them.  I mean, we-  A. What's your favorite?  B. The salmon turns out really nice each time.  And the chicken, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The chicken breasts turn out really nice.  A. They keep cooking the salmon in the oven.  I should try it in the June.  B. Oh my gosh, yes.  A. I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  B. What do you do to the chicken?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  B. I can just put the chicken breasts in there.  I mean, I'll season it.  Yeah, just, but if I just want to have like chicken breasts handy to throw in bowls or  some weird thing later on in the week, I just spice them up and then pop them in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A. And they use the probe, right?  The thermometer.  B. Yeah.  A. So that way they're cooked perfectly.  They're juicy, but they're fully cooked, all of that.  That's nice.  B. Yeah.  A. Okay. You convinced me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  B. But you don't need to buy this one because you already have yours.  A. Well, I might as well.  B. No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  A. I'm just teasing. I'm not going to buy it. I like my chicken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  B. Leo, you have to buy a second house not to live in, but just to have the more gadgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A. Yeah. That's why I use Rocket Mortgage.  Thank you, Stacey. Go, go, go. It's wonderful to have you. Stacey's the host of Stacey on IoT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A. Oh, we forgot. Okay. I shouldn't have talked about the June. I should have told you  just go check out the Anki Vector. That should be my other thing.  B. The what?  A. The Anki Vector. It just launched today. It is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B. ANKI. I have the Anki, original Anki racetrack.  Oh, it's a robot. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A. It's the Cosmo, but it's smarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B. Oh.  A. Yeah. Yeah.  B. Yeah, they killed the...  A. I have the Cosmo.  B. They killed the... What was the other one? The Orbi?  They killed that one. Oh, it's cute. It is a Cosmo. It's the same size as a Cosmo.  A. Oh, it is. Yeah.  B. But does it do more stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A. It does. And it does it locally. So the Cosmo borrowed the processing  power from your phone. This does more stuff and it does it on the robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B. But it's... They didn't do the original Cosmo.  A. Yeah, they did.  B. Oh, they did.  A. Oh, they did the Cosmo. Okay. So it's got those cute little eyes and stuff.  And you can get one for $199 at Kickstarter. Did you get one? Do you have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  B. Kevin got that one. I still like the Cosmo. I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A. We have a Cosmo around the office because we reviewed it.  Here's... Those are the cute little eyes. Yeah, I like the color better than white.  I think it looks more utilitarian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  B. I think it looks mean.  A. Yes.  B. And Kevin says he...  A. I like mean.  B. I see. I don't like it. It's a cute, friendly robot.  A. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B. They should look mean. Don't be fooled by the cute, friendly. They're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A. Cosmo is cute. Okay. Off I go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B. Fortunately, he's too small to be a real threat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A. Oh, I don't know. He can whack you with that little bulldozer thing on the finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B. He's a little bulldozer on it. Can he move sand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A. He moves those little cubes that come with it.  B. He doesn't do anything useful.  A. He can pick up a cube. Now he can actually...  Now he can answer questions and I think he can actually...  You can send him to go look out the window and he can recognize things.  You can actually program him with Python. You can use TensorFlow on it.  B. You can torture a cat.  A. You can torture a cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B. You can fist bump it.  A. Yeah.  B. This guy is the tech director of AI. He looks like he's eight.  Okay, 12. Brad Newman. He looks like he's just a kid.  Look at him. Fresh-faced Brad Newman, director of artificial intelligence.  And in fact, I think he's in his kindergarten classroom right now.  A. He shouldn't be worried not about being replaced by the robot, but by him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  B. I'm worried about Brad. Forget the robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, Stacey. Bye. Enjoy some queso when you get home.  A. Oh, I was like, what?  B. Because there's no queso in Seattle. Bye.  A. Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  B. Bye, Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bye, Higginbotham. You're not related to Daniel Higginbotham,  author of Closure for the Brave and True, are you?  We'll never know. And now, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Jarvis.  A. She didn't wait a second to get out of here.  B. Yeah, she wasted no time.  A. Our pick of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A. Let's see, which one should I do?  B. Number one.  A. Well, so we have, the number is one because we have children now,  a story from the Associated Press about how their first words are.  B. Oh, my God.  No, no.  A. Actually kind of a decent story talking about how kids are interacting with these.  Oh, sorry. Oh, my advice went crazy. Three at once, four at once responded to me.  But how kids are interacting with these devices and what the impact of that is.  And it's not a full, I was going to scream about moral panic, but it's actually not a bad story.  Saying that they can get answers to things and they can watch neat things and they can ask  questions and then maybe it's not such an awful thing.  B. Wow.  A. So, but so a parent tells a story that, of course, kids say,  goo goo. So when the mother has said, the kid said, okay, Google. The father said, no, no,  kids say goo. And no, no, it was hearing us say all the time, okay, you know who.  And it was mimicking us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B. It was easy anyway, because they do say goo.  A. They do say goo. Right. So it's goo goo. Right. Okay, goo goo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  B. I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A. There's a whole bunch of stuff on Reddit about other words you can use to trigger your devices.  B. Right.  A. And what words people are using, because it's fun to use something besides, you know, the usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  B. If people complain about that, I see those complaints that's a dumb trigger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A. Oh, I do wish you could change triggers. That will come.  B. Yeah.  A. That's really interesting. So first words, okay, goo goo.  B. Well, I think we can wrap it. I know I'm not going to take any more of your time. We got two  picks from Stacey. So that kind of feels like we've done our job. Well, I'm never in a hurry  to get out of this show. I love doing it. It's a lot of fun. And besides, I get to go buy a  Magic Leap headset. I got stuck.  A. Don't do it. Stop yourself.  B. No, stop. I wish I did have that ability to just say, no, you're not going to.  A. I'm not going to.  B. No, you're not going to. But I, you know, what happens is I say it and then I think about it for  days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A. So what's killing me is I know we're going to have a new phone.  B. Yeah, it's going to be expensive.  A. And we're going to have maybe a new Pixelbook.  B. Yep. Yep.  A. And maybe a Pixel brand watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B. You got nothing. You got nothing. I have to buy everything. You just buy Google stuff.  You got no reason to complain.  A. No.  B. By the way, this just in MailChimp has now dumped Alex Jones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A. Yes. Next, he's off of Friends Room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  B. It's one thing to be thrown off of Facebook. But in MailChimp says you can't use our service.  Man, that's bad. Thank you, Jeff Jarvis. You'll find him at the City University of New York.  When does the semester begin soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
