That was a good dance. That was a good dance. I like that. So you got you got the head. You can you can do the head thing with a neck. The head thing like the boop boop boop. No, no, no. You did it differently. You were doing the sideways. Yeah, that was that. Like an Egyptian. Nice. I feel like a bobble head.  Stacy bobblehead Higginbotham. Jeff Jarvis is here. He's also are one of our regular heads. He is blogs at Bugmachine.com and of course teaches journalism to a bunch of very lucky kids at the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism at the City University of New York.  Also in studio with me as always and pro it from our very own network. What's your shirt say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently it says I'm just going to nod and act like I'm listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you pick these intentionally or is it just whatever is in the top of the laundry basket?  Usually whatever is clean. Whatever is going to keep me warm. Yeah. It's good though. It's like an editorial comment on the show. Pretty much. It's okay.  It's a subtweet as a t-shirt. It's a sub-tweeting. It's on this show I learned what subtweeting is. Google's year in search is out. Okay, we got two things. We got Google's YouTube rewind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I already haven't taken this. They promise it's better. It's not better. It's worse. You can't make anybody happy. This time though. It wasn't as cheesy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this time it's not. So normally what the rewind is is a chance I think to kiss up to the big name creators and keep them happy. So they tell a story and they have cameos from all the big name creators in it.  Last year's was the most hated YouTube video of all time. So they decided, oh, we blew it. Here they admit we blew it. This is the beginning of the YouTube rewind.  There's Casey Neistat. That is so awkward to watch. YouTube rewind 2018, the most disliked video in the history of YouTube. 16 million thumbs down. It says in 2018, you made something you didn't like. So let's see what you did like in 2019.  And so now it's all, and I'll turn off the sound because we don't need to hear it, but it's all clips. It's like top 10 clips. No storyline or anything. And it's also designed to make me feel terrible because this is the top five videos.  The views, the views in one year, one year. These are the videos that got the most views. Number 10, 1.9 billion views. Billion views.  Number seven, 2.2 billion. Mr. Beast. Dude. Perfect. 2.3 billion views. He's apparently throws things into things perfectly. Dave Dobrik. I don't know. Jelly two and a half billion.  But that's the thing. Pencilmation 2.9. At least there's animation here. Felipe Neto 2.8 billion. The number one, of course, PewDiePie. Of course. Four billion views. Of course. He's going to be damn president before we watch out.  Well, one of the reasons I think there were so many hates on last year was he wasn't in it at all. They didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's because he was outed as like a disrespectful neo-Nazi little kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's lots of debates over whether he's just being a comedian and really what he's up to. But and so I won't assume he's really a neo-Nazi. But anyway, YouTube clearly decided this is a political hot potato. So we're just going to use through the numbers basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It totally worked, too. This year, they're only the third most disliked video of all time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I forgot to show that. But it's like still millions of thumbs down. There's nothing they could have done that would have won that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will say that I got home from Petaluma and I guess this had just come out and my daughter was all my daughter who is 13 now could talk about with me.  Really?  Yeah, she was like, oh, they put out the year in review and my husband was like, I do not even care.  He was you. I can see his body language. He did not say this. But, you know, I am like, oh, I bet we're going to talk about this on Twig. I should totally listen.  You gotta watch.  Well, what happened? She explained the last year's drama and then she's like, but everyone this year is still so against it.  I was like, well, what do you think? She's like, I don't know. I don't really care about this.  See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting. So she wasn't waiting because she couldn't wait to see it.  I didn't even get through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She just wanted to see how many people hated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, she was there only for the drama, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it came out December 5th, six days ago. Currently, as we were recording 2.8 million thumbs up, 7.1 million thumbs down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe the viewers are just trolling YouTube.  I don't know.  Maybe that.  Yep.  I don't know.  Last year, I remember the hardheads brought it up to me with this whole rewind thing and said, hey, you should go watch it.  Yes, boys.  They were like, you should go watch it. But this year, I haven't heard a thing from either one of them. Not one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does have 58.5 million views. So people are watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a whole thing on Reddit about how everyone should wait 24 hours to watch it just to troll YouTube.  Just like have a zero count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be very funny. But you know, you can't do that.  I think that in future years, these rewinds will actually be a historic document.  They'll be of great interest to historians. Not like next year.  It's going to be a long time.  Back when people had attention spans again?  Saving these?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you watched the Oscars from like 50 years ago?  None of those movies. No one knows any of those movies.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. It's an interesting question.  Now, Google does their annual search trends, and that's gotten less and less interesting because they break it up in so many different ways now.  So this is the year in search 2019. I guess I'll play the video. I don't know what the video.  Throughout history, in times of uncertainty.  Is there is your audio in this? The world looks for heroes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's audio, but it's just going to get us taken down. It's just a like dramatic score.  Just imagine dramatic sweeping music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you got to really go. You got to pause it because they're going to go through a bunch of pictures of famous people.  But Dylan and Parton and Stephen Hawking, the Dalai Lama in 2019 searches for heroes sword.  There's Jarvis.  There's Jarvis.  These are these are superheroes in real life as well as in movies.  These are real life superheroes.  The one-armed guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Search for real life superheroes, though. That's it.  They didn't search for people with superpowers.  That's what that's what fakes this up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. These look like these are search terms. Nobody searches for unsung heroes.  No, they're not searching for unsung.  Unhung heroes, maybe, but not unlike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google is making an editorial decision here, just like any editor.  I mean, they're using their data to tell a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But normally this is just the numbers, man.  And then when you go to the numbers, should we do global or should we do it by country?  Let's do global.  The number one search in 2019 was and this is why they changed it in the video.  Africa is that it's probably cricket, I would guess.  Number two, Cameron Boyce.  She died.  OK, who is she?  I don't know. She died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad I don't know. I didn't.  You're not the only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Copa America.  I think that's the America's Cup, not the Child Online Protection and Privacy Act.  Yes, I think so.  It's got two weeks.  Bangladesh versus India.  Also cricket.  Is it cricket as well?  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. And you can click on it to see more about it if you're fascinated.  iPhone 11 number five.  How about news?  Copa America, Notre Dame that burned this year.  That was big news.  I was in tears watching that.  Cricket again, Hurricane Dorian, rugby.  People, Antonio Brown, football player, Neymar, soccer player, James Charles.  Football?  YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube. Really?  Yeah.  Oh, Justice Smollett and Kevin Hart.  Really?  Those are controversial.  Ah.  And then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were controversial.  Four and five.  Kevin Hart, because of the Academy Awards last year, he was voluntarily stepped down as

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not only that, but also his car accident.  He had a car accident?  Mm-hmm.  Was controversial too.  Oh, did he cause it?  More like, I believe it was more about leaving the scene.  Oh, OK.  The car was all souped up and shouldn't have been souped up and totally not safe for driving.  They drove it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Justice Smollett, what's that?  Oh, that's R. Kelly.  That's the Empire actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, not R. Kelly.  Not R. Kelly.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So in the actor category, it's Smollett Hart, Joaquin Phoenix, Keanu Reeves, Lori Loughlin.  All of those make sense.  Yeah.  Lori Loughlin, of course, in the news because of bribing to get her kid into college.  Athletes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no.  OK, Joaquin Phoenix, what was the news there?  Joker.  That's the Joker.  Joker and Keanu Reeves.  He's just awesome.  His combat.  His mid-combat.  He's just awesome.  So three out of the five.  He's breathtaking.  He was on stage at the Microsoft event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He walked on stage.  For like two seconds.  And people swooned.  And apparently he's back, baby.  It's also John Wick 3, I guess, right?  John Wick, he did a little cameo in that adorable Netflix rom-com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was it?  With Ali Wong.  It was great.  OK.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Be my maybe.  I think one of the reasons people like him is because it looks like he kind of can laugh  at himself now.  Right.  Yeah.  He is also my personal role model for our CES event and Leo's excellent CES adventure.  But we haven't decided who is playing the role of Keanu Reeves.  No.  I think it's me.  I hate to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm just going to walk in and go, whoa.  Yeah, you go ahead and be that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Athletes, Antonio Brown, Neymar, Bruce Hopper, David Ortiz, Alex Morgan.  This is global, which is interesting to see like a baseball player in there.  Movies, Avenger, Endgame, Joker, Captain Marvel, Toy Story 4, Aquaman.  Do we learn anything from this?  No.  Not really.  It's boring.  That's why they made the video.  We didn't learn anything, but maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go back to the songs.  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have songs.  Old Town Road.  Oh, OK.  Love that song.  I don't know.  Seven Rings.  Obviously, I'm not with it.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the yes, it's Ariana Grande.  Ariana Grande.  I saw that was just playing.  OK.  That on the YouTube thing.  Don't get us.  Don't get us.  Take it off.  Take it down for going.  I'm tone deaf, too.  So it's not like I'm even close to where.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shallow, which yeah, that was the Gaga song that she did in the movie.  Senior Rita, Kamara, Kamara and Cabello.  And Shawn Mendes and memories, memories from cats.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because of the because cats is back, baby.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, it's because of the trailer.  No, no, no.  It's a trailer.  No, no, it's a Maroon 5 song.  Oh, different members.  Sorry.  Carson's clearly not.  Carson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that was memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Memory.  All alone in the moonlight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh.  I think I hear dogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TV shows Game of Thrones, Stranger Things, Chernobyl, When They See Us and the Umbrella  Academy.  So what this shows you not is what the most popular TV show is necessarily, but the most.  Some of the more controversial shows like When They See Us was controversial because  it was about the Central Park Five and I think an interest, you know, Umbrella Academy.  You know, that's funny because that was getting a lot of press and then I guess people watched  it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course you did.  It's your kind of show.  It is my kind of show.  You told me to watch it.  I watched about five minutes and I said, I can't, I won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You asked if anybody cares.  Do you not think advertisers would care about this data and figure out some forecasts and  stuff for 2020?  I don't think it's forecastable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's everything is so past.  It's all news, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And to mass, to general.  Mass is dead.  That's what's wrong with this list.  This is mass.  Nobody cares about mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google used to do Zeitgeist, which I thought was great.  Do they still do that?  Yeah, no.  So this was replaced Zeitgeist.  Zeitgeist was the state of the world at the end of the year.  And I think they attempted to be data scientists a little bit more and kind of extract interesting  trends and stuff.  Here, they're just going here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is just a list.  I'd like to see a little more because I like data.  I don't know.  I agree with you.  I like data, but I like data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google likes data too.  But I think that they've been bit by data and they really don't want to look like they're  editorializing in any way these days.  Right.  Right.  Right.  In fact, when we started playing the video.  Thank you.  A little late on that.  Sorry.  If you want to be in the club, you got to jump right on this.  It's a latency here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what you got to agree with Leo very quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They call me the little rocket man of podcasting.  Oh, I'm sad to see this.  We were talking about, you know, we did.  Stacey was here for our twit year end show, which will be on December 22nd.  We talked a little bit about the decade.  This was the decade of Google Glass.  We talked a little bit about it.  I guess we could say the decade ends with the end of Google Glass.  They are one more update to the Glass Explorer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, gee, let me get it out and get it updated before it is too late because I use it so  frequently.  So worth it.  Was it to get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are vulnerable to security threats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, wasn't it cool that somebody on our team ran in the studio with the with our glass  we bought and brought it to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was impressed at the number of devices from this decade that just happened to be laying  around your studio.  We got them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're all in the host office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Paid for every darn one of them too.  So Glass Explorer edition users, here's a little heads up.  You'll need to manually install the final update.  Here's how you do that.  You'll download a signed image file and zip some folders, run a bunch of ADB commands.  You've installed ADB on Windows.  Oh, wow.  Once you've updated Glass, you'll still be able to pair the device to your phone and  take photos, shoot videos or use any side loaded apps.  However, mirror apps, Gmail, YouTube and Hangouts will cease to function.  Bye bye Glass.  So I actually think this is really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're saying that we're not supporting this.  Right.  Here's exactly what you need to do.  Here's exactly what you can expect to happen, which a lot of companies are like, uh, it's  going to just stop working eventually.  Or like what they do with Nest.  They're like, yeah, if you don't update, you just won't get some features.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, I was just going to repeat myself and say this is good.  They're saying exactly what will happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what people do is say what they're going to say.  And then they say it.  Then they tell you what they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Officially wiping their hands of it.  We're done.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I should point out that's the Explorer edition, which was the one that we bought  and the Enterprise edition too is still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, they're aren't they still doing some type of development?  Yeah, I thought so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a business product for, you know, a factory floors and stuff.  So that's not dead.  I don't think glass has much of a future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, really?  What a just say great interest.  You know, like, well, okay, there's Leo on Twitter on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We had a real futurist, Amy Webb, and we were talking about magically.  Maybe you saw that article in the information about how magically peasants sold more than a few thousand.  I think they said six thousand thousand of their development.  I don't even know they were on the market.  They had a developer edition like much like glass.  And they thought they were doing that again.  Yeah, they thought that, oh, we're going to sell.  They said at one point a million, but they finally got a little more realistic and said one hundred thousand.  And they were a little angry at this article in the information by Alex Heath,  who said dented reality magically sees slow sales, steep losses.  He says they're losing 40 million a month.  The funny thing is yesterday to implore.  So we were talking about it.  And by the way, I should point out Amy Webb said I have been to the Florida facility.  I've used the beast, the big one that they showed people like Stephen Levy and Amy.  And she said, it's amazing.  So this is what they were selling was no, you know, I tried the magic leap one and it's just kind of like a hollow lens a little bit.  I mean, it's not it's not that great.  But she said that's not what their technology is.  So sometimes you've got to invest a lot of money and do blue sky research and maybe there is no way to bring it to market.  And that doesn't mean it's not valuable or it's not going to change the world.  It just means it's not ready yet.  That seems reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And it sort of gives you a roadmap for further development.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So I won't I won't ding them too hard.  Apparently they were very unhappy with the information's piece.  The point, according to the information that they went to an all hands meeting and said that Alex Heath was a hack.  Actually, no, they call them worse and a hole.  And the information's reporting is littered with inaccuracies and misleading statements erroneously portrays magic leaves operations and internal plans and overall strategy.  And at the all hands meeting, they said it was click bait and a bunch of BS.  People were looking for the next Theranos.  We work. All right.  And that may not be you know what?  That may not be unreasonable.  I mean, maybe they are losing money hand over fist.  And maybe, you know, this is blue sky.  Sometimes it's, you know, we're years off.  So according to the article throughout 2018, the company burned 40 to 50 million dollars a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what about potential deals with the likes of Microsoft and that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, you know, the big investors are I didn't know this.  And I found this out. Just wondering that.  Yeah. Well, Google, Google, they think they had to or that a seat on the board and Sundar Pichai quietly led the board.  Quietly left the board some time ago.  Sundar was on the board of directors. Google's longtime head of mergers.  Don Harrison was a board observer.  But Sundar and Paul Jacobs, the former executive chairman of Qualcomm, quietly stepped off as director and observer in 2018.  He was Pichai was replaced by Jennifer Fitzpatrick, a Google senior vice president.  But investors include.  It's an interesting list.  Saudi Arabia sovereign fund, right?  Also, Mark Andreessen's Andreessen Horowitz.  And then who was the who was the lead?  I forgot looking through it.  Google, Alibaba, China, Saudi Arabia and Andreessen Horowitz.  They raised two point six billion dollars.  So I while I'm a I'm a believer in augmented reality, I have to say it has not lived up with glass or with magically to its promise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Still, but does it still just just take time because people first of all, self driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We still got a hard to augment reality.  It's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Beyond that, you still have to get people to even believe in it first and foremost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you got demonstrated in a way that people can see.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And again, the closest thing was that was that is Pokemon Go.  Isn't that one of the reasons?  No, no, it's the Hogwarts one.  Oh, yeah, that's the first way of getting people to at least see the potential of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think I think it's important point.  I mean, you know, that's what cardboard did for VR for its short life of fandom.  Right.  And plus, they are on the phone.  You know, we want to do Pokemon Go.  You want to do stuff.  It's OK.  You can do it.  But it's not even anything that new.  It doesn't make you say, oh, wow, I want this in front of me.  So I think that the precursor to A.R.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and the reason people like me are so excited about A.R. is science fiction.  That's that's really not to say that doesn't drive a lot of technology innovation.  A lot of I think what Silicon Valley does is because they read it in a book when they were 18 or 17 or 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're like, make this happen.  Yeah, I want those flying cars.  I want those self-driving cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think that that's augmented reality has a long storied history in science fiction.  And I think that's all you're seeing.  And the problem is when it gets down to doing it or as you say, Jeff, is self-driving cars not as easy as it sounds, not as easy as it is.  It looked.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't remember how we were supposed to have self-driving cars by the time we were by next year.  I'm sad about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were supposed to have flying cars by the time I was an adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, well, that's just crazy.  Well, they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were supposed to have moon hotels next year.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, we're 2010, the year we make contact or 2020.  We do have flying cars, though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The quadcopter car.  You go take a ride in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, if you think about it, flying cars make no sense until you have autonomy.  There's no human can safely fly cars.  Totally agree.  So once we have autonomy, then you can have autonomous flying cars.  So let's get autonomy done.  But that's harder to do, I think, even.  Well, but you're right.  I mean, didn't Elon say we would have it this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing about it is, is you could because it's an empty space, you could build it from scratch as opposed to cars, which are trying to retrofit everything and figure out how to work around everything.  Right.  In the air, you could come up with a standard structure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or argue about it.  Yeah, it's more likely to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Twitter.  May I go there?  Please.  Is trying to set a standard right for a distributed Twitter, which is really fascinating.  There's going to be a lot of argument about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This tweets this morning's tweet from Jack.  Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, shocked the hell out of me.  Yeah.  This morning, Dorsey tweeted, Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers and designers.  It's very small.  Yeah, but it's not too small.  No.  To open, develop an open and decentralized standard for social media.  The goal is ultimately for Twitter to be a client of this standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the rationale is fascinating because he talks about how what we really do is add value with algorithms.  So we want to do it with a larger pool.  You want to be the Google of social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we've been talking, we've been supporting, we've been saying there needs to be CD centralized.  No company should have the responsibility that Facebook or Twitter has.  The watch out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a prick right now.  If this ever happens, and that's who knows, then there will be 100, 1000 social networks with a lot of crap on it.  None of the controllable.  So all the effort now to try to actually centralize things and regulate the big guys because they're convenient to regulate because they're big.  Watch out.  Every effort to control will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Explain the emoji at the end of his tweet.  It's a thread spool of thread.  Thread.  We call thread.  What follows is a thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's a thread.  Is that what the kids are doing now?  If you hadn't left Twitter, you'd know these things.  Really?  You put a thread emoji.  Yes, I use the thread emoji all the time.  See, it looks right there.  It says thread thread.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also notice, notice Jack's world emojis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's citizen of the world and all three hemispheres.  I like that he found all three of those emojis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of cool.  By the way, Jack follows me.  So hi, Jack.  Twitter was so open early on that many saw its potential to be a decentralized internet  standard.  I think that's, I agree with that.  I think we did, in fact, I even called it internet dial tone like SMTP for a variety  of reasons all reasonable at the time.  Yes.  Yeah.  We took a different path and increasingly centralized Twitter, but a lot's changed over  the years.  Well, Jack, yeah, you by centralized it by killing all the third party developer.  Yeah, but he's kind of admitting that.  He's admitting it.  But he admitted that way before.  He's kind of admitting that he's admitting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he admitted that way back when he broke the third party developer network.  I mean, he admitted that that was kind of a bad idea and they wanted to go forward,  but he realized it was kind of probably too broken.  And now look what he's doing.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  First, we're facing entirely new challenges.  Centralized solutions are struggling to meet, for instance, centralized enforcement of global  policy to address abuse.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is in a way, this is him saying, I can't, we can't pass the buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what he did with political ads in essence is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's wrong for a person to be like, this is bigger than my company.  This is bigger than me.  I'm throwing it open to the world.  I think it's admirable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it's great.  If he's sincere, it's admirable.  Second, the value of social media is shifting away from content hosting silos and removal  and toward recommendation algorithms.  Directly wants attention.  That is the key.  You think that's really, that's the, when I, when I ask people like you, why you like  Twitter, that's what you, that's what you say.  It's, it's a way of directing my attention towards something important.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does.  Unfortunately, these algorithms are typically proprietary and one can't choose or build  alternatives yet.  This, if Jack is sincere here and I think he is, this is really quite impressive.  Yes.  Third.  And I want you to keep going.  Yes.  This is his manifesto.  You know, this is what they call, the kids call a thread.  Right.  Third.  But we owe this generation.  There's an emoji too.  Look at this.  It's a spool of thread.  I didn't know that.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know that.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't know that.  Well, this is your, it's your own damn fault, old fart, cause you're leaving all this stuff  and bragging about, I'm not on Twitter and I'm not on Facebook and I'm not on planet Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh gosh.  Gosh, I don't know the secret handshake for threads.  Third.  Existing social media incentives frequently lead to attention being, by the way, you can  tell it's a thread because in, when you're looking at a thread, it will say click to  read the thread.  So it's not that hard.  You don't need a special emoji.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, you do because sometimes the thread is just a correction or something.  In this case, it's a, it's a purposeful thread and he's letting you know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a moron.  Third.  Please don't agree with me so fast.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Third.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Existing social media incentives frequently lead to attention being focused on content  and conversation that sparks controversy and outrage.  Sometimes I would even say the algorithm is all about sparking outrage rather than conversation.  That's my daughter who always calls me on the show.  Rather than conversation, which informs and promotes health.  That's a, that's going to be a challenging one.  I'm not going to answer the phone.  Finally, new technologies have emerged to make a decentralized approach more viable.  That's interesting.  We've tried this.  I mean, that's what status net was and GNU social and app net and pounds.  And we've been trying for this for a while.  Blockchain.  Oh boy.  Oh, blockchain points to a series of decentralized solutions for open and durable hosting governance  and even monetization.  Much work to be done, but the fundamentals are there.  Some of these issues were emphasized by Steven Wolfram in a blog post following his Senate  hearing entitled optimizing for engagement.  Boy, if Wolfram could solve this, anybody could understanding the use of persuasive technology  on internet platforms.  Did he talk about this when he was on triangulation, Karsten?  No, he did not.  That's too bad.  Cause that's a, I would love to know what he thinks about all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can read his 8 million word blog posts.  Yeah.  If I would understand.  I mean, smart man needs an editor.  Love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She says it with a straight face too.  Have you read?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's true.  He's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just need an algorithm.  Indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He also quotes Mike Maznik, which is pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His article.  They keep going.  Cause I want you to, so Dave Weiner has been screaming for this for a long time.  Oh yeah.  I was.  So he responded to Jack.  Yeah.  See if you can, see if you can interpret his tweet cause I didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  I'm gonna have to scroll.  Oh, Evan Prodromo, the creator of status net says hire me cause Evan's been doing this  forever and ever and ever and ever and ever.  There's Dave.  Dave Weiner.  I'd like to see Twitter do this in a different way.  You already have the bugs and scaling issues solved for a global notification network.  Let's add a few APIs and create a new universe.  I think he's right.  It'll happen a lot faster with what he's saying.  That basically open Twitter.  You don't have to open source it, but you have to, but it would be great if you publish  an API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is a lot of people that there is, there are a lot of people who are legitimately saying,  Hey, just open up the API buddy.  So this is kind of like, let me have my business model that I've established and not have to  rethink that, but have this tiny small team, you know, sorry, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is why I think we are, we have not gotten the thing that we all said we wanted.  And the Jack even told me that they were working on is the correction button.  Because once things are out there in the ether, you can't go back and get them back and do  something to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think not having a correction button can be defended.  I think that's a, that's a reasonable defense of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think as long as there's a history of what you do to it.  No, I think, I think, I think it encourages corrections, which would be a wonderful thing  in this world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can correct by a subsequent tweet.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can delete and then correct.  That's what I hate too.  That's the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As bloggers, we hate it.  We hated that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you have to, if you do something illiterate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever this effort is, if it were to go through, I don't particularly see it fixing  what he says third.  Existing social media incentives frequently lead to attention being focused on content  in conversation that sparks controversy and outrage.  It's a business model question, right?  That's, I mean, that's just society.  That's just people, regardless of whatever the platform is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and if you don't, then you get mastodon, which is so boring.  Where's my outrage?  I need my cup of outrage this morning.  I don't know.  I mean, maybe, yeah, you might've pointed out the hypocrisy of all of us by saying,  We use Twitter as a signal for what's important, pointing our attention in the right direction  is what we're really doing is what's the latest outrage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, in my favor, keep going in Jack's thread because he also says, why is this good for  Twitter?  It will allow us to access and contribute to a much larger corpus of public conversation,  focus our efforts on building open recommendation algorithms which promote open recommendation  algorithms, which promote healthy conversation and will force us to be far more innovative  than in the past.  But it will also be possible that you can, if it's an open world, you can build the anti-Jack.  You can build the, I'm going to find every bit of outrage in the world and climb it all  together, right?  If it's open.  Yeah, you could have, you could have Breitbart Twitter, but you could also have MSNBC Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and you could have,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to sound so much like a simpleton or anything, but would this limit me from  putting in mute words such as impeachment and stuff like that?  No, no, of course, you know, the API.  Because that's what happens when I open up Twitter.  I'm fed all kinds of things that I have no interest in.  Mr. Jarvis said it, hey, it works for him.  Whatever pops up is the things that he's interested in.  I don't see that anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think all of us in self-defense have developed various behaviors to protect us from the Twitter  outrage machine because you have to.  And there are certainly ways to do this, but presumably an open standard might have  more ways to do that or have a variety of ways or, you know, I mean, one of the things,  honestly, I guess a legitimate question is how is this different than say Mastodon, which  is a federated open source Twitter clone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The idea would be that maybe you could bring it, maybe it's a little bit more professional.  Maybe you don't have to all be on the same server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you don't.  That's what the beauty of Mastodon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you always had to be on the same server.  What am I thinking of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  Right, Stacey, you're thinking of the other one now.  The entire point of Mastodon is that you can create many, many different Mastodon servers  and it's federated.  And if you wish, you could follow somebody on another server.  They can follow you on another server.  So your, they call them toots.  Your toot can go to different Mastodon servers.  Mastodon is great, but Mastodon has everything you would want in this kind of tool except  the network effect, except the massive users.  And this is the problem you're going to face with this open and decentralized standard.  I think Dave Weiner is right.  If you just make an API, but then Twitter loses completely, there's control of its  own control.  Yeah.  So what Jack, I think Jack's thought about this longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, okay, but hold on there.  So, so let me play with that for a second.  So then you, then you go to the WordPress model, right?  Which is the WordPress, the code base is open source.  WordPress is the first company to build on top of it.  Others can build too, but that gets them, you know, a third of the, of the web.  Twitter could shift to that model where it makes its code base basically open source,  but then it builds that value add on top.  Which is what he's saying.  Okay.  There's all this chatter out there, including this, this, you know, Twitter old.  We're going to build, we're going to build value on top of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but WordPress, a lot of the value from WordPress comes from there's, there's the  WordPress hosting business and there's also the people who build on WordPress businesses  for like various.  Thank you.  I was like, what is the word for those things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Stacy, that's not what I'm saying.  Yes.  So, so, so the code, so you benefit from the open source contributions to the code base,  right?  Um, but you can build your proprietary thing on top, which is exactly what we're pressed  it.  So then the question is, would I be willing to buy tweet deck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is the, what is the revenue share between Twitter and like the, the new version of tweet  deck that they have access to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And this can be a whole different model.  You subscribe to Twitter's smart person recommendation engine and Twitter goes to some effort.  To find experts.  Samir, remember Samir Aurora?  He's working on a really fascinating thing that starts building expert networks.  It's very, very potential there.  And he hasn't really talked about it too much openly.  Uh, but, but, but then Jack's talked about this.  When I met with Jack last time, he talked about trying to get to experts.  So he's been thinking about this.  So I subscribe to the media walk network and, and Twitter has to go to some effort to vet  people and do other things.  They add value to it.  What is that?  What is that definition of value at?  Um, or, uh, Leo sponsors the podcast geniuses network.  Um, and you can get that.  And so it's not just everybody.  Then it becomes what's the bad of this side.  The bad is does black lives matter happen in that world?  Do things bubble up in a way that by virality is always presented as bad.  Yeah, that's not the virality.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not the bad thing.  Black lives matters does happen.  What it had, what doesn't necessarily happen is as you say, it doesn't bubble up.  Nobody sees it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it might depend.  I mean, if you subscribe to, if you subscribe to social activists or whatever causes, then  you should start seeing it.  And maybe that leads to a place where journalists become useful again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but the point, the point of, yes, Stacey, that's right.  But the, but, but living while black, the hashtag, I wouldn't have seen it.  The fact that what was presented to me through this network was where the value really was.  I said, Oh crap, that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it trending that presents those to you?  Is that how you learn about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's because a friend of a friend of a friend sees it and eventually it gets to me.  Well, that could happen.  I think I guess it could, a decentralized network.  So Stacey, as a B2B person in your business, could you imagine a high value add business  social network?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like LinkedIn?  Sorry.  I on Twitter, I guess that's what I already have.  So sure.  I can't imagine.  I mean, I don't follow.  I follow people who are in my industry.  So I don't follow like my friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I feel, I guess my basic issue with this is it feels like Jack has jumped on a bandwagon  that I've been riding for decades, almost as long as Twitter has been around.  And we've seen every one of these decentralized solutions kind of, not fail.  Failing is a strong word, but kind of.  Fizzle.  They just don't, yeah, they don't get the momentum.  And I join them all.  There's a new one I want to join.  I read about in this thread called Scuttlebutt.  I want to try that one as well.  But another decentralized social platform, you know.  But I feel like what happens is because everybody's on Twitter and Facebook, that's where people  go.  That's where you go.  They've got the critical mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it?  There's something every, it seems like there's always something around the corner trying  to be the next Twitter or the next Facebook, but nothing is proven to lure people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We always use the canonical example of Facebook taking over from MySpace and saying, well,  let's see, it could happen then.  But I think these guys have gotten so big and they've reached so much of the potential  audience at this point that it's virtually impossible at this point for somebody to come  along and say, we're going to beat Facebook at its own game or we're going to beat Twitter  at its own game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about something like Twitch or Discord, which do have, they're making their way out  of the gaming arena.  I mean, is that, that might be where we're seeing the next Facebook and Twitter is and  what next wave of social media happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because that's what's going to, I don't think it'll be a duplicate platform.  I think it will be different and a unique way.  I mean, I've even said maybe Fortnite is the next social network.  It certainly is for a certain group of people.  So it won't look like Twitter or Facebook.  It'll look like something different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is interesting.  This is Fred Wilson's Twitter feed, who was a board member of Twitter for quite a while.  He is very pleased at what Jack is doing.  He wrote about his feelings on this three and a half years ago.  The idea of turning Twitter into a protocol and allowing an entire ecosystem of applications  to flourish on top of it is breathtaking in its ambition and importance for all the reasons  Jack outlines in his tweets for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he's, and one of the things that's cool about it.  Biz pops in.  Oh, Biz is in there.  Oh, he says, thanks Fred.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We won't control, he's speaking first person plural.  We won't control it.  It will be free open protocol like SMTP.  Dave Weiner, nice to hear from you Biz.  I've been hitting a different wall with Twitter.  I want to cross post and I can't because there is so little overlap between what services  are willing to accept.  This is also interop, which is a more immediate opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hi Dave, says Biz.  It's been a long time.  Oh, it's like all the old gangs coming together.  Oh, it's time for BloggerCon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just going to, I'm going to join the thread and said I had pizza for lunch.  Do it.  Just to really bring it back to the good old days.  Interesting.  So I'm, you know, I'll watch with interest.  I applaud this.  I think Jack's thought about it and sees he's honestly, it feels a little bit like  Jack's looking for a way out.  Just like Larry and Sergey looked for a way out last week.  Gracefully.  Yeah, because it's, it's getting ugly and I don't have high hopes for it because I feel  like we've seen this before this we've we've and it never seems to make a difference.  And honestly, this besides us, are people looking for what's the next Twitter or the  I don't think people are looking.  No, of course not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why would you find things that are more interesting or serve your needs?  And sometimes you don't even drop the other ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Look at Tik Tok.  I was like, nobody was really looking for it.  People are still checking it out, but they're not leaving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I had a long conversation with Alex Lindsay at our Christmas party.  Alex is convinced Tik Tok is the next big thing bigger than Facebook, bigger than Twitter.  It's going to be huge.  And I spent some time with it because I wanted to honor his opinion.  Right.  And it is my my considered conclusion that it will be a it's another flash in the panel  be gone in a year or two.  It is not going anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's interesting is the first effort for a Chinese company to leave China.  Wow.  There's a guy flying on a broom on Tik Tok.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hear the Harry Potter theme that guarantees a takedown.  I erased it because it is so such an assault on your sensibilities and it's for people.  You know, I know why Alex loves it because he's short attention span.  He loves it's quick.  It's fast.  It's I have no problem with that.  That's what Instagram stories can be.  It's worse than Instagram stories.  It's just quick, dopey hits.  And it's fine.  It's rough.  It's it's entertaining, roughly entertaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what social I mean, the social networks are entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep. It's got no staying power.  It's I just I think Tik Tok is another flash in the pan.  We've seen a lot of you know, I don't I don't think he has any state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it'll I mean, it's not a.  A Facebook or Twitter, but it's it's it's a new vine.  It's not even a Snapchat.  And it's just a new way for people to share things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say, I think it's actually maybe I don't think it's  a social network, but I do think it's a very valuable form of entertainment  for young people today.  And it's how they're telling their stories and communicating who they are.  And I wouldn't discount that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They may rush to another club.  I think musically was I think now that the ante is so high on Tik Tok  that it's too much work for people.  What's what's going to happen is what happens with all of these networks.  You're already seeing it. The big names, the brands are coming in.  They're going to spend lots of money making elaborate Tik Toks.  A few big Tik Tok stars will emerge as they did on Vine.  Right. And they're going to put a lot of work into it.  We were just looking at the unboxing videos by the three top Mac YouTube  people using Aries and Reds, three red cameras.  And it just deals out your daughter completely.  And at some point, she's going to say, I can't participate.  It's an entertainment medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then I said, no, because she shares things with her friends  and she follows friends and she does not want to be a.  Tik Tok star.  And I know there's lots of so she's not she's in it for the fun  and for the creativity, so and there's nothing saying that she can't do that.  And if her goal isn't to become, you know, the next whatever.  I don't think I still think that's valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's it's not a communication medium.  It's an entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And honestly, what's going to I want to try it just to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd love to. I'd love to get.  And do the hard heads use it? No, no, no.  But is that because you don't let them know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're free to use whatever they want.  Most of the time they use Snapchat or Instagram.  But the thing is, and your daughter uses Instagram, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's on it, but she doesn't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think the boys are interested.  Now, Queen Pruitt is interested because her friends are are watching things on it.  But it's just like what Miss Stacy said, it's an entertainment thing.  It's funny. They're not creating any content.  They're just consuming it. Right.  But it's short, short attention span stuff, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tali in our chat room says Tic Tic is amazingly.  Tic Toc is amazingly fun and great for artistic people.  But the main reason it'll hang around is because they've proved  they can adapt and change.  I love the unique style of creativity there.  I hope it hangs around. It is very much like Vine to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the only thing that comes to my mind is it's just like Vine,  which I had no interest in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter bought it and put it out of business. Right.  Let's take a break.  Come back with much more.  Stacy Higginbotham, Stacy on IOT.com.  Mr. Ant Pruitt from Hands on Photography and Hands on Focus on Photography.  Hands on the Focus, Hands off Your Focus  and all the other great shows and Tic Toc for five minutes.  Tic Toc. We're going to do the Tic Toc show.  We actually I'm embarrassed to admit created a Tic Toc channel for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Last week. Oh, I know. I was told. Yeah.  Queen Pruitt mentioned that you're on Tic Toc now. I said, huh? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have the best social network, social media people.  Masako and Jerry do a great job.  Masako is always going around with a camera tape. Yeah.  Anytime anything happens around here, there's it's I feel like we have  in-house pop.  You have to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll just say you have to be careful with Miss Masako.  You never know. Recording it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Mr. Jeff Jarvis, who is teaching us the future about the future  of journalism, our show today brought to you by Worldwide Technology,  the future of enterprise technology.  Worldwide technology has been around for a long time, about a decade.  And I'll tell you what, once you become a customer of worldwide tech  and I know many, many, many, many enterprises do, they  you just never stop because they provide the kind of service and support  you're looking for.  And a lot of that is because of their ATC, their Advanced Technology Center.  They started building this 10 years ago.  It's grown like Topsy more than half a billion dollars in equipment in the ATC.  And it's for testing.  It's for research.  Their engineers use it to spin up proofs of concept and pilots to test products  before they show them to you to create a sandbox  so that you can look and choose the perfect solution for you.  But here's the beauty part.  The ATC is also open to their customers.  They offer something they call Lab as a Service.  It's a dedicated lab space within the ATC where you can perform  programmatic testing on that vast technology ecosystem that WWT has already built.  It's kind of amazing.  It's such a...  And you can do it, by the way, virtually.  See, there's the Tanium Proving Ground Lab.  So if you're looking at Tanium for your business, you want to understand more,  you can go in here, you can set it up, you can play with it, you can create pilots.  You can really bang on it.  It's available 24-7 wherever you are in the world.  You don't have to go to St.  Louis to use it.  It's available anywhere.  It's amazing.  This ecosystem creates a multiplier effect of knowledge, speed and agility  anytime, anywhere around the world for customers, not just the labs, the hands-on  labs with case studies, articles, all the tools you need to understand enterprise  technology before you buy it, before you use it and after you buy it to understand  it better, it's just amazing.  WWT is a trusted partner who stays with you over the years and you're going to  want to know more.  So I know how you can find out more.  I do.  Go to www.wwt.com slash twit and create an account and join the ATC ecosystem.  WWT simplifies the complex at www.wwt.com slash twit worldwide technology, delivering  business and technology outcomes around the world.  We're going to be going out and visit them in the spring.  I'm excited.  We're going to do a show out there.  Details to follow.  Thank you, WWT for supporting the show.  So Tim Sweeney of Epic is in a battle with Google.  Epic, remember very famously did not want to put its Fortnite, the hottest game of  the last few years in the store, in the Play Store because they, they want a 30%  cut.  So, but the problem is if you're not in the Play Store, it's hard to prepare for  people to get it.  It's risky to get it.  So Epic went to them and said, look, we would like to put Fortnite in the Play  Store, but we don't want to give you your 30% of in-app purchases.  It's a free app, but there's a, but they make billions.  Tim Sweeney made $7 billion last year on in-app purchases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do they have a similar deal with Apple or are they just like, well, Apple, you're  so amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.  The thing is Apple, you got no choice.  There's no side loading.  You have a choice on Android, right?  Exactly.  And so honestly, and I think there is, as I remember a case going to the Supreme  Court about Apple's monopoly.  Honestly, Apple has a monopoly on apps you could put on the iPhone, but Google  does not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see the information?  Jessica Lesson did a story about getting their app approved by the Apple Store.  It was designed to rile, rile people, but it talks about the approval process in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  death and it used to be pretty painful back in the days.  It's still painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's more painful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But people are willing to do it because eyeballs.  Yeah.  I have to.  If you want to be on the iPhone and ever in the U S anyway, the iPhone is very,  very dominant.  No, I didn't inside our app store ordeal.  I love Jessica Lesson.  She's been on our shows.  She's great.  It all started with the price.  Peter Schultz, who leads our product and engineering teams, walked into my office  and told me we couldn't charge what we had planned to for upcoming news app  because you have to follow Apple's own tiers.  Oh, and I don't mean T E A R S.  I mean T I E R S.  They wanted 30, $30 a year, but that's not in the Apple tier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It goes on to talk about things like the way they advertised was too over the top.  It talks about.  They rejected the app four times.  Yeah, they rejected it because they had some of the some of the stories they ran in the app  were on the free site, so they changed the way that worked.  They had to change the way a lot of things worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I'm a subscriber, so I already have the information and I put the name of the app,  by the way, is great.  Top tech, top 10.  And it's actually very useful.  What's their number one story?  Alex Heath's story about Twitter building to bidding to build a decentralized social network.  They do.  They do really great work.  In fact, they've gotten better year after year after year.  But this is it.  Yeah, and they're what I love about the information and Jessica is they don't mind  speaking truth to power.  And it's a risky thing.  You don't see a lot of developers complaining about Apple's process too publicly because

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  no, because they know that it's a lot of power there buttering their bread.  Yeah, essentially what I don't get about this.  This thing with with Epic is it takes a lot of.  Uh, cojones to come up to someone and say, hey, I want to use your platform, but I want  to use it on my terms.  I know you can give me more and more eyeballs and get more people access to my game, but  I want to do this on my own terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're making the calculated decision to do this based on the fact that they think  demand is higher than in Google won't say no.  They just think they're the ones in power in this play in this situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We talked about it briefly on all about Android last night, and I wonder because I don't have  data in front of me or anything, but I wonder is Epic sitting at a point of plateau right  now for its growth.  Maybe that's why they want to be in the store.  Right.  So what what prompt them to say, hey, you know what, we need to give Android a try and  we need to give the Google way of doing it a try.  But we still want to leverage our strength of, hey, we are Epic and Fortnite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's Epic statement they gave to the verge.  Epic doesn't seek a special exemption for ourselves.  Ravis, we expect to see a general change in smartphone industry practices in this regard.  Okay.  Good luck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, with that statement, it's okay.  You're trying to pioneer something for the people behind you.  Great.  But still, you're going into an ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think the threat here, though, is a threat of litigation.  We believe this form of tying of a mandatory payment service with a 30% fee is illegal  in the case of a distribution platform with over 50% market share.  So I think that's essentially saying you got to let us in because otherwise we're going to sue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google said, okay, we'll meet you in court on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And by the way, Jessica Lesson's story says the biggest problem,  as you pointed out, Stacey, with the App Store, the biggest problem they had,  if we want to launch, we had to disable a part of the app  that allowed users to preview information articles and subscribe to read them.  The reason is, of course, that information subscription doesn't go through the App Store.  And Apple wants that 30%.  Yeah.  And so this is a problem.  Honestly, we've gone back and forth about this on all of our Mac shows since the day it started,  for years.  And on the one hand, developers, if you do it yourself, you have to provide bandwidth to  store your app, which is expensive.  You have to promote it, which is expensive.  You have all sorts of issues.  You go into the App Store, yeah, Apple takes 30%.  But before that, you get storage bandwidth promotion.  They handle the transactions in the background.  All the headache is gone.  And so I think, honestly, a lot of developers say that's not the problem, the 30%.  The kind of unknown quantity that getting approval is is a problem,  because you get rejected for weird reasons.  You don't understand the reasons.  One of the logos for getting rejected for people.  Yeah.  And sometimes Apple seems like they enforce it unevenly and so forth.  She points out, I tried to download an audiobook from Audible on my iPhone and was told why I  couldn't.  I always hated this, because Audible and no Amazon subscriptions are allowed.  Amazon won't allow that, because they don't want to give 30%.  There are a lot of subscriptions, though, on iPhone that go through Apple.  In fact, it's a great convenience for the user, because it uses Apple Pay.  You just double click, and it recognizes your face.  It's very fast.  In fact, I think that's really the secret sauce in a lot of Instagram ads these days,  is it's so easy to pay that you're likely in a befuddled half-asleep state to buy underwear.  You will never.  Buying heated underwear and colorful hats.  Sounds like the voice of experience.  Heated underwear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a long, painful story.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Long story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You didn't really.  It wasn't me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was me.  You didn't really.  You're a thief.  It wasn't me.  No.  Wasn't me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's cozy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't me.  Sounds like a story from the Christmas party late enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I missed this story.  I'm OK by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The information did get in.  The bad news, Tim Sweeney lost.  He's not happy about either the Apple or the Google VIG, the 30%.  He says it's grossly out of proportion with the cost of services that two companies provide.  Epic has its own store, by the way.  And when Epic takes their cut, they take an 11.5% cut.  They don't take 30%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's their prerogative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Well, we'll see.  I suspect we're going to see...  This is a big company pushing back.  And they have deep pockets.  And I can see them saying, we ought to take this to court.  Go on to court.  This is one we'd like to get a review on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll get my popcorn ready for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm kind of with them.  I don't know.  The other thing that Apple provides from the end user's point of view is the security,  because they check the app carefully for security flaws.  Well, at least in theory, it seems like they're more interested in the color of the font.  In theory, you're more secure in a curated app store like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think about it again with the simpleton mind.  Oh, hello.  I hate you, Siri.  Hello, C-R-Y.  Think about it from a simpleton standpoint.  Let's look at, say, a barber wanting to get started in business.  And they go to a particular venue and get charged booth rent.  They pay that booth rent because they know, hey, I can get foot traffic here.  I'm going to have a lot of my facilities taken care of right here.  I don't have to worry about all that extra overhead and so forth.  I can make up that 30% with the extra foot traffic that I get each and every week.  What's the difference here?  None of this seems unfair in my opinion.  Epic is just, again, getting a little bit too big here.  Let it go, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what if there's only two salons in town and so you've got to go with one or the other?  That's more apt.  Yeah.  There is a case to be made that maybe with economies of scale, so the longer they do  this, the better they get at it.  Should they bring the pricing down to something more reasonable?  Google set 30% because Apple set 30%.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the point of monopoly is that you establish a monopoly,  then you don't have to bring the prices down.  You can set it to whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With that said, then Epic could just stay in their own lane and instead of charging 11%,  make it 15%.  Why not do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they can't get on the Google app?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm saying Epic just continue to do what they're doing now.  They did and they charge 11.5%.  Instead of charging 11.5%, make it 15%.  But they don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what they use as an example of how they are equitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They clearly want some more downloads and some more cash if they're trying to get  into the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They may just be trying to meet the demand for Fortnite on Android devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Look, it's a better experience.  We've even said this.  The first time they were started to offer a Fortnite for a side load, there was malware.  Right.  So it's a much better experience for the user if it's in the Play Store.  Everybody knows that and that's the leverage Google has and that's  absolutely the leverage Apple has.  There's no other choice.  So at least Google gives you a checkbox and you can say, I want a side load.  Apple, by the way, is moving in that direction, I think, on Mac OS.  And I think that's the other point of this a little bit might be the subtext of this  might be to threaten Apple and Microsoft.  You know, this isn't working on the store, on the mobile, and it really won't work on  a desktop because Epic has a desktop app.  They do.  They would be really upset.  I remember when the Windows Play Store started, Gabe Newell of Steam was very upset and said,  this is the end.  They're trying to kill Steam.  They want they want all app purchases, all game purchases to go through them and Microsoft  take its percentage.  And that's the fear, I think, of people like Sweeney and Newell's.  They've got their own fiefdoms.  They don't want to have to pay these VIGs.  And I don't blame them.  I don't blame them.  And I don't know if it's good for consumers or not.  That's another that's a more complicated issue.  Let's take a break.  I want to do a change log.  It's a big change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I even added some stuff.  It's a massive change log.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is the biggest change log we've ever had.  In fact, I think it's pretty exciting.  There's some good stuff in here, but stay tuned.  We're going to first mention our sponsor ExpressVPN.  By now, anybody who watches our shows knows that a VPN is the only safe way to sit on  an open Wi-Fi access point.  I think a lot of our listeners use ExpressVPN even at home because it doesn't slow you down.  That's one of the amazing things about ExpressVPN.  It does keep your ISP or your carrier from snooping on what you're doing.  It stops that hacker in the open Wi-Fi coffee shop from seeing what you're up to.  So all of those things, privacy and security.  But there's also an advantage to ExpressVPN that's pretty cool.  It can help you take your TV watching to the next level.  What?  Well, unlocking movies and shows that are only available in other countries.  See, when you use ExpressVPN, you get to choose the default.  The simple one-click default is to go to the nearest VPN server to you.  But you can choose any of a hundred countries.  And that means you can go to those countries and watch, for instance, Netflix in that country.  You want to binge on Doctor Who or Star Trek?  You can't watch it in Netflix US, but you can in Netflix UK.  Simply change your locale to England or the United Kingdom and refresh Netflix.  And suddenly you've got all the shows.  ExpressVPN hides your IP address and lets you control where you want sites to think you're located.  Think about all the Netflix libraries you can go through.  If you love anime, use ExpressVPN to access Japanese Netflix.  It's not just Netflix.  By the way, there's a list on the website, but Hulu, BBC's iPlayer, YouTube, I can go on and on.  A lot of streaming sites are suddenly open to you with ExpressVPN.  By the way, to be clear, this is not illegal.  In fact, I even asked Netflix, what's the deal?  And they said, well, we tell people we don't want you to use a VPN because it's going to be a bad experience.  It's going to be too slow.  But we don't.  Honestly, if you want to use it, go ahead.  We won't stop you.  And with ExpressVPN, it's so fast that, in fact, I left it on.  I was demonstrating it yesterday during iOS Today and I forgot to turn it off.  I downloaded the iOS 13 update.  I didn't watch TV.  I was doing all this stuff with ExpressVPN running until I realized, wait a minute, I'm on Tokyo time.  Oh, I left it on.  That's how fast it is.  I love ExpressVPN.  There's never any buffering or lag.  You can stream in HD.  No problem.  It works everywhere you want to be.  Of course, Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, but also Linux, also media consoles, smart TVs, and more.  Yes, you can watch what you want on the go or even on the big screen.  We love ExpressVPN.  Privacy, absolutely.  They're reviewed by an independent third party auditor just the other day.  And they said, yep, it does exactly.  Their privacy policy is exactly what they do.  They do not log.  In fact, the trusted server technology ExpressVPN uses absolutely prevents the server from running to the hard drive.  There's no way to log.  Every time you log in, you get a nice fresh new server.  You don't ever have to worry about what you're doing being tracked by ExpressVPN or anybody else for that matter.  Right now, you get a great deal.  Three extra months free when you subscribe for a year at expressvpn.com slash twig.  Three extra months with a one-year package.  That is the absolute best deal.  Get it down below seven bucks a month.  Support our show.  Watch what you want.  Protect yourself at expressvpn.com slash twig.  We thank them so much for their support.  And I thank you for supporting us not only by being an ExpressVPN customer, but by using that special address.  That way they know.  Oh, they watch Twig.  Expressvpn.com slash twig.  Now, get ready.  I wanted to start the changelog early today because it's going to take a couple of hours.  It's time for the Google changelog.  Hit the button, Karsten.  The Google changelog.  Wow.  Where do we start?  I'm going to tell you my favorite thing.  As a Pixel user, Google has announced, I think this is really interesting, that they're going to start updating the Pixel monthly with features.  And this is smart because, you know, the Pixel 4 got a lot of negative.  I think unfortunate negative reviews.  I don't think deserve negative reviews.  This will make the Pixel 4 and all Pixel phones more desirable.  The new update, which is being pushed in December, lets you blur backgrounds after you take the picture.  Even pictures you took years ago.  If you forgot to turn on portrait mode, you can use portrait mode.  This clearly is a.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In that demo, isn't that entire photo blurry?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't got it yet, so I can't tell you if it works.  I don't either.  I look forward to trying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got it and it does work.  It figures out which of your photos are portraits.  And instead of the pop slider, you get a blur slider.  Oh, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, I have this too.  It is neat.  How do you get it?  Now, you got it because you got the December update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you have to update, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, I actually, so I had a little light bulb notification that I had never seen before.  It was either yesterday or the day before.  And I touched it and it was like, hi, we've updated your phone with recorder.  This blur thing and one other thing.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  By the way, because we were talking, I was showing off on the Pixel 4 this really great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  recorder, which does transcription.  You asked Jeff, can I use it on my 3A?  Yes, you can.  It's on there now.  Isn't that awesome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I downloaded it straight.  You can download the app on its own and it's killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's so good.  It really is a great app.  So you go to the sliders.  It says, I know this is a portrait.  I don't know.  I can't tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was struggling just to find a selfie of myself.  It doesn't have to be a selfie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It can be just a picture of anybody.  So where is it?  Yeah, see, I still have pop.  So they're going to replace pop with background.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it can tell that's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not obviously a portrait?  Yeah.  So let me go to a different one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pick a different one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a portrait.  That's a portrait and it's not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a portrait.  Slider, edit, pop.  You got pop too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So well, it's not being pushed out universally yet, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Bundy, when you had that slider, I guess it gives you a little more control on how far  to the edge of the subject you can get because the previous.  It's doing it automatically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was not super good.  Granted, I was using it on a picture of my son whose hair is epic and hard to do.  I just think I don't have the update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Otherwise, I'd show you.  This is clearly a portrait of Lisa, right?  There's no question about that.  And I still have pop at the bottom.  Not that pop isn't great.  How do you even get to that?  You have to hit the control sliders twice.  I'm not getting that even.  Oh, twice.  Twice.  So there's one and there's two because it comes up with the filters first.  So all right.  Well, Stacey's got it.  So it's out.  It's coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even have pop.  I just have light color and blur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what happened on this other image of mine.  I love this one too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, what did you just say, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All I have is light color and blur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.  Light color and blur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, because I have light color and pop.  It doesn't for this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You either get light color and pop for non-portrait pictures or light color and blur.  So is Buggy.  I feel so privileged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a lucky, lucky man.  It didn't work for my selfie that I found, but it did work for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got to use AI, right?  It's trying to figure out.  Try to hide.  God, they hide things.  Geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have a great new feature and you're never going to find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is pretty deep in there, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now it says pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yours says pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's I guess the wrong photo.  I thought it was going to be more of a...  If it thinks it's a portrait, it will be.  It'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it thinks it's a portrait, but it's not.  It's new chiffon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I will say because my image has decent contrast, that does look pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks great.  So yeah, contrast is something it's using for sure.  Ants photos are too good to be...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you see that Mr. Bondy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go to the overhead shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's slamming buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is the TriCaster stuck?  Go to overhead shot.  Go to overhead shot.  You can hear him slamming the buttons.  That's the direct screenshot.  I'm trying it.  Okay.  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry.  Go to overhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So look at...  Yeah, yours worked.  You got blur and that's really beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty good blur.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this was not shot with what they call bokeh in the background.  This one, I see all ants pop.  And that's got to be a portrait.  So I don't have it.  Here.  Here is another feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll show you it online.  I'll give you my son.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't care.  I don't want to see it anymore.  Here is another...  He can't have it.  This is going to be an eight hour...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Google change log is the log.  Let's go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh-oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stacey's impatient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everybody wants to see it.  Stacey's gone mad at Karsten.  Here is...  That is a great picture.  Is that Zach?  That is Alex.  Alex has great hair.  And here's the blur at the bottom.  Oh, yes.  See, that works pretty well.  It's kind of like Apple's where, you know, because his hair on the edges,  it's a little soft on the edges.  Right.  It's going to get a little confused.  That's all right.  That's really good.  That's really neat.  All right.  Enough of that.  I don't care anymore.  Put an end to robocalls with our latest update to call screen on Pixel 4 in the US.  Sorry.  The Google Assistant now helps you automatically screen unknown callers  and filter out robocalls before your phone even rings.  That's awesome.  Thank you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Karsten, turn off your mic.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm breathing hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's not the breathing.  There's a machine.  There's a hum going in the background.  Yeah, there's a machine that Karsten's standing next to.  Something got really noisy.  I think we need to fix the fan on or something.  I don't know.  Improved calls in Duo.  I've been using Duo lately because my daughter is an Android user  and she wants to make video calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We use it a lot more now since we relocate it.  Yeah, that's right.  The family can keep in touch and it's nice to see how everybody's face lit up  knowing that app was on the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Remember what the Facebook portal did was if you move off center, it follows you  and it's doing that.  Watch, here's the demo.  And then if somebody else...  Karsten.  Watch, here's the demo.  If somebody gets else, it gets in the picture.  See, they add the other person.  Oh, it's a DuoBomb.  It's a DuoBomb and then it zooms in.  She's not doing it.  It's just it does it automatically.  I like that.  That's pretty slick.  I like that.  I'll use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That reminds me.  So way back in the day, remember when...  Was it Hangouts came out and you could put like hats and stuff on your head  when you're talking to people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we would stick pictures of other people's faces and Google would figure out what to do with that.  So that must have been kind of the beginning there of developing something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When a bad connection leads to spotty audio, a machine learning model on your Pixel 4 predicts  the next likely sound and helps...  That could cause problems.  It's going to do sound interpolation.  What?  It also reduces choppiness on your video feed with this Pixel 4's 90 hertz screen.  So Duo will do 90 hertz.  And on Pixel 2, 3, and 4, you can now apply a portrait filter.  So if you want that blurry background, this is something Skype does.  It works so poorly on Skype.  It looks like it works equally poorly on Duo.  I would not use that one.  It'd be worth a try though.  Recorder app.  The main point of this though is not these features,  but this is going to start happening every month now.  You're going to get live caption on your 3A.  Remember that feature I showed you where I'm watching YouTube video?  Oh yeah, I've been waiting for this.  That's awesome.  That's a great feature.  Digital well-being is going to get a new focus mode.  Flip to shush.  Flip to shush is very useful.  That'll be going to the Pixel 2.  What is flip to shush?  You could do it already.  If your phone's ringing, you just flip it over and it's shushing.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do I have to turn that on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's in the settings.  It's already in there.  Yeah, but it may not be on by default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I am totally doing that right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And improved on-device locations on the Pixel 4.  So this is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Another thing I noticed they added to photos with the blur is a color pop option.  With the blur?  Yeah.  Oh, I have the pop now.  It's with the blur though.  You can...  Blur and pop?  Portrait photos...  Now with blur and pop?  On portrait photos, it will black and white everything that's not portrait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so now that it knows your head, you can make everything black and white instead.  Color splash.  Color splash.  Gotcha.  And that's the Google change log.  Nope, that's just item one.  What about Chrome 7 tonight?  Just item one.  We have a long way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God.  Okay, let's talk about Waze because I thought this was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, let's talk about Waze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Waze is going to let you show unplowed streets and black ice.  You can report that along with police officers and accidents, which I think is amazing.  That's huge.  That's huge.  Oh, and I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why?  When I get behind somebody who like there's a kid in the car and in New Jersey,  they're reporting every single pothole, which is every six inches.  So this is all dependent on how good the incoming data are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pothole.  How about black ice?  Jeff, explain, what are you Easterners?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know you wusses out there on the West Coast and you former Southern wuss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We didn't like black ice in the South, dude.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that like blood diamonds or what?  What is black ice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can hit them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ice on the roads that you can't see.  I know what it is.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The road is already blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because there might be people listening who have never heard this before.  It's invisible ice, which is actually terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty scary when you hit it.  You hit it in a patch.  The only way that Waze is going to know this is if somebody reported it.  And how long?  It includes the street isn't plowed yet, but what if 10 minutes later the streets plow?  It's a real data problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, then you know, because Waze will ask you if you pass a place and you've like,  it will say, is this accident still here?  Is the street still unplowed?  And you could be like, no.  Yeah, you respond.  Yeah, you should respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a one button thing.  I'm sorry, I'm being grumpy.  There's a car on the side of the road.  Well, yeah, and it doesn't affect me.  And why do I?  Why are you telling me?  Yeah, don't tell me.  I see that a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slow down and it creates traffic.  Because no, not in Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The people pull off all the time to do things and we keep going because we're Jersey.  We know how to keep going.  It's OK.  That's the one time I'd like to be in Jersey.  We'll see West Coasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am excited that Google.  I was excited that Google is going to wake your alarm up or change your alarm based on the weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell me about that.  That's kind of cool.  If it's raining, it's going to get you up earlier or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  It's just going to give you different music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it's cold outside.  Oh, not that song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's AI generated piano.  And I don't know if you remember from a few weeks ago when we were listening to AI generated music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was crap.  That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not ready for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I hate AI music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll probably wake up today so I can turn that off.  It's so awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get up.  It would make you wake up.  I imagine, I mean, if we can hear how bad this is.  What if you're like a concert pianist and this wakes you up?  You would just be like, this is my nightmare.  Rage.  Rage.  Rage wake up.  Get off my piano.  What are you doing on my piano?  It sounds like an eight year old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Damn cats on the pianos again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, an arpeggio.  Stop.  There's ice on the intersection at Fourth and Main.  Watch out for the black ice.  You could go to Spain.  Suddenly you're spinning.  Suddenly you're gone.  Okay, that's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got some pipes, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want it to be a musical theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is going to come out in the Lenovo Smart Clock first.  It calls it impromptu and eventually it'll reach phones and other smart displays,  but they don't say exactly when.  The music is all created by Magenta, an open source music tool built around machine learning  and sounding just as bad as Amazon's.  Maybe worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess you don't have to pay for that.  That's why they don't want real music.  Could they pay John Legend to croon a few bars for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, take some of that money you're giving Issa Rae and put it into music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's a good song for a hot day?  It's getting hot in here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm pretty good at drinking beer.  I think the weather is kind of an interesting thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what is it?  I didn't understand that part.  In fact, I didn't even see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It picks the song based on the weather, which it made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have to really investigate deeper, but I'm so amused by it.  I haven't done it yet.  You know, I have a Hello Doorbell and I have a Google Nest Home Hub Max in the kitchen.  And when somebody comes to the door, it's great.  Almost instantaneously, the doorbell rings and the Home Hub says somebody's at the front  door and shows me a picture.  But lately, it's played a horse clip-clop sound.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you doing that, Sprucey?  That's very good.  I was doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Florence Ions.  Hers is doing it too.  Hers is too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you activate the seasonal things from the Nest Doorbell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  If it's Christmasy, that's probably what it is.  It's not Christmasy.  It's just the horse-clop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hers did that last night before the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a sleigh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did have some glitches with it because they remember they pulled,  they turned off the Halloween ones, but they forgot to make it so you could actually take  it off so people's doorbells were still doing Halloween for a little bit.  Maybe this is a feature they're still working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think of this in general, Ms. Stacey, being all things IoT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Special seasonal doorbell things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no.  The alarm with the weather sink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's bizarro.  Just because I just don't understand what song choices have to do with the weather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Riders on the storm into this life we hope we're born.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ms. C, considering if you're somewhere like right now here in Northern California where  every morning you wake up, it's sort of gloomy and gray, do you want your alarm to  give you some gloomy and gray song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because some people might want happier music.  I like the idea of having variety in my music.  That's fine.  I used to have a Here Comes the Sun alarm clock and I hate that song with a fiery passion now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is nice if it changes it automatically based on if it's foggy out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe based on your calendar, if you have a day full of lots of meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give me that 1812 Overture.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Give me that.  Sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chrome 79 is here.  It's a, you know what, we're in a browser war which is great for us as end users.  Google, the Brave browser, our sponsor, Firefox, Microsoft's new Edge with Chrome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember when we used to talk about there's a new browser version coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we haven't in a while but this is a big one.  Predictive phishing.  So it can kind of-  Predictive anti-phishing?  Yes. I think that's probably a better way to-  A password checkup tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's going to determine whether you're an idiot and it's going to phish you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. The password checkup tool I've used for a long time as an extension but it's now going to  be built in. So if your password has been revealed in a breach or you're using an unsafe password,  it will let you know. It'll say, you know, that's been in a data breach. You should not use that  again. Which is, I think, a good idea. Real-time-  That's been a data breach associated with you?  No. I've seen this password. Well, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It tells you if it's seen.  Yeah.  Yeah. If it's seen your account.  If your name and password together.  Yeah. It knows your account number when you're browsing in Chrome, remember?  Because it-  They're using a-  So I have to stop using Leo Laporte 1949?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. In order to determine if your username and password appears in any breach,  this is Google, we use a technique called private set intersection with blinding.  That involves multiple layers of encryption and allows us to compare your encrypted username  and password with all of the encrypted breach usernames and passwords without revealing your  username and password. In other words, they look at a hash of your name and password and compare  it with the hashed database. And if there's a match, then the chances are good that it's been  revealed. That's how have I been pwned works.  Yeah.  Real-time blacklisting of bad sites. For a long time, safe browsing has been around,  the safe browsing API. But because according to Google, thread actors are changing sites  and domains fast-  Wow, every half hour?  Yeah. There's a 30 minute delay in the safe browsing updates. So there's a new option.  You should probably look in Chrome and in the sync and Google services section,  allow the scanning of bad sites in real time. So it will actually look at the data you're getting  from the site for known signatures. It's like an antivirus for websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You should do that if you have kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, Google's right to tell you this. You are sending your web browsing history to Google.  You're still going to anonymize it, of course, in URLs and all that. But in order to do this,  it has to do it in real time. Predictive phishing is  warning you when you might be entering passwords on a site that is suspected of phishing.  And so it basically will prevent you from being phished because the site looks like Twitter,  but it's not or this or a little like mixed content. That's been going on for a while.  Oh, with this release, Google will start slowly to block mixed content on HTTPS sites.  Mixed content is not a bad thing. Sometimes you have, for instance, a login that is HTTPS,  but the whole page is not. This is going to start blocking those. So webmasters get that back,  get that fully encrypted. Tab freezing unloads all the tabs that have been inactive for more than

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  five minutes. That doesn't mean it closes them, does it? Or it just means it just stops considering

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  them active? Yeah, I think it leaves a little tab there, but it's not doing anything in the  background. But that's not on by default. You actually have to go to chrome colon slash slash  flags to turn on proactive tab freezing. That's a great feature. That is a great feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think because especially if you're on a Chromebook with the teeny weeny resources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I close tabs, but a lot of people like Jeff, just leave their tabs open. Are you a tab?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I only have six open right now. Oh yeah. You probably have an empty inbox. Don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am not inbox zero. So I don't subscribe. I filed them away though. Oh no, no, no, no, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't touch them. I like seeing that I have 23,000 unread emails in my inbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a moment on this show.  Search, because Google didn't let you delete emails for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what made me realize, oh, oh, okay. I just searched them. It's a database. That's all it is.  New UI for the Chrome profile section, a back forward button caching. Okay, this is  experimental. A special cache for the back and forward Chrome buttons. So if you go back or  forward in your browsing history, instead of, you've seen this, you were on a site,  you went to the pay and then you press the back button and says, oh, hey, I have to reload the  page. Now it'll just get it straight from cache rather than going to the website and reloading.  And that will speed you a little bit. Another one in Chrome's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Will paying to see if the state has been updated since?  Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, or what if you're like, because usually they complain because they're like, now I have  to do a full resubmission. But well, let me read you what Google says, enables back forward cache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Note this feature is highly experimental and will lead to various breakages up to and including  data loss. Whoops. And it's in Chrome colon slash slash flag. So it won't be on by default.  Lots more, lots more. The new Chrome 79 is here. Google assistant now supports Google keep. This  is huge. It's the main reason I didn't use Google keep is I couldn't add items to it through my  Google assistant. Now, yes, now you can not only add items, you can create a new list.  And this command, uh, I'm going to, I'm not going to say it out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, G ask keep to create a new list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Or add buy groceries to my honeydew list. And maybe it will make the list. If you don't  have it, I know you have to play with it. How are we going to work again? Yeah. Well, it's also  going to work in any do any list and bring. So maybe there's an API or something. I should,  by the way, not yet. If you're a Google fi subscriber, free Google, a little one of those  Google dots available right now. Right. Your account home mini is that home mini mini's.  You go to fi.google.com. As soon as you go there, it'll say, Hey, through the end of the year,  while supplies last through the end of the year, price not included. You can't get pink. Cause I  tried. Yeah. I had to get black. A gift is here. Yeah. Isn't that neat? Oh, you, oh, I'm glad I  told you, you didn't know this. Jeff's learned something today. If you pay for one of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  things, you just clearly you're crazy. I'm just like, you can get one for buying all kinds of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  stuff. They're putting them in the cat and crunch boxes. Now. Okay. Exactly.  Yeah. To see if you have this option. I don't need one, but it's free. Yeah. I don't need one

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  either. No, don't do that. Don't do that. You guys, that's a bunch of electronic waste that gets

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  generated. I'll find something to do with it. I'm going to use it at the school. I've been  driving around with a Google assistant in my trunk of my car. Cause my daughter said it doesn't work.  I just put it in my trunk. Here's how you do it. You, it's going to be rolling out to integrate  Google, keep any, do any list with your Google assistant to see if you have this option, open  the assistant settings, go to the services tab. If you have notes and lists as an option, select  the service you prefer off you go. Any juice could use that for a long time. I'm guessing it's not  going to work with my Apple reminders, but oh, well. I was a wonderless guy. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just killed it. Keeps good. It doesn't have,  I let it go. I ended up going back to Evernote. I have grocery lists there. What was Gina's thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina Trapani. Oh yeah. She had to do dot text. Yeah. And that was a fully text-based to-do list,  which was awesome. Really simple and direct. I loved that. Boy, there's a whole lot more.  All of them. We're doing great. All Google Fi supported,  Android devices will get spam call warnings and wifi calling all of them now, all five features  on all five phones. I didn't realize you couldn't, but there you go. iPhones are Fi compatible. Oh,  oh, so, okay. So this goes beyond pixels. Okay. Yeah. So this is weird because you can put a Fi  chip in a lot of stuff and it's not fully Fi. It doesn't do like the network switching, right?  It just becomes a T-Mobile. I don't know. So yeah, any Fi compatible device, including iPhones,  get spam call warnings, the ability to block specific numbers. All Android phones on Google  Fi are getting access to the enhanced VPN network and wifi calling. It's in the Fi app on the phone  settings menu. So just go to the Fi app and see. That's nice. We mentioned the Fi Nest Mini.  AR core phones can now detect depth with one camera. So that means your Pixel 3a  can do depth now with its back camera there. This is a new feature of AR core. So see the cat,  see the cat standing in the middle of the chair, see the cat behind the chair. That's an example.  The cat appears behind the furniture instead of standing in front of it.  It's because it's now got 3D depth. Yeah, that's AI. AI at work, baby. I'm confused.  Computational AR. Does it help if I say that? Is that a deep fake? It's not real. It's a AR cat.  So now does that help? Now it looks more like a real deep fake cat. Google maps. People will

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think there are cats in all these places where there aren't cats. What will we do? Or simulating

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sex acts with cats? Well, that's what deep fakes is all about. Let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Uh, no, I thought it was about Vladimir Putin, Leo. I didn't think it was about sex with cats,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo. No, it was sex mostly. Next on the list? Google will let you attach emails to emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's emails all the way down. You can now attach emails to other emails in Gmail without downloading  them first. That's great. Don't know why you would want to do that. Why would you want to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have, there are times when I want to forward things. It's a better way to forward. Right.  Why is it a better way to forward? Well, let's say, next year, next year, and Ant just got an

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  invitation to go see somebody's booth. He could just drag it over, drag it out of his inbox,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right onto my mail. As opposed to forwarding it. Well, hold on. Do you get the whole chain of  emails or can you just attach one particular segment? That's the part that I'm curious about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because I'd rather just have that one particular message and not the whole thread. I'm guessing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's just that message. The attached email becomes a .eml file that's attached. You can attach as  many as you'd like and when you click on the .eml email attachment in Gmail, it'll open in a new  window. I bet you it's just the top. That's exactly what you do with Outlook. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because that would be helpful because there are plenty of times when you're like, did I say  something I shouldn't have said? And not even like terrible things, but stuff you don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people to read. Incognito mode arrives on Google Maps on iOS, so you can tell it,  don't send back to the Google where I'm going next. Don't send it just yet. Don't send it yet?  Yeah, wait until I get there and then you can send it. And now, ladies and gentlemen,  we conclude the world's longest Google changelog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I had a migraine and I took some migraine medicine and it's just knocking me out. So I'm  kind of terrible right now. We can wrap this up. Are you? No, this isn't. I just I am yawning a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  lot and I'm sorry. No, I was I thought I thought you were doing. I honestly thought you were doing  a long changelog joke. Oh, no, no. Sorry, I was giving you credit for your wry humor.  I know what I want to do. What do you want to do? Because you wouldn't let me make fun of Peloton  less because you got all huffy about it. So you're going to let Ryan Reynolds do it. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's the best. All right. You guys seen it? Can I play this? Is it going to get us pulled down?  I don't think so. Watch. Here's a poor person who is the same woman from the Peloton ad. Is  it the same woman? Oh, yes. Yes. She's looking sad. She's at a martini bar with her friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, friends looking very concerned. You're safe here. New beginnings to new beginnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're drinking martinis. She's really drinking the martini. Wow. All the way down.  Nice. She's going to drink her friend's martini. It's an avi. Oh, that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it ends with you look great, by the way, with the gin there.  Oh, she needs the Peloton because she looks great. Well played. I didn't even know that was a take

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  down of a Peloton ad. The reason it's Ryan Reynolds is he owns Aviator Gin. Yes. Yes.  And our sponsor Mint Mobile. He's apparently making way too much money. Aviation Gin.  With which you would make an aviator. Aviation is actually the drink. Okay. Sorry. Is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good gin. It's a good gin. Yeah. It's aviation. I actually looked up where I can buy  it. I was so pleased with that commercial. Oh, don't go buy it for that. I mean, it's fine if  you're in a hotel bar, but buy a better gin. I mean, like buy a more interesting. Let me rephrase

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that. You presume I buy good gins. I go to Gary V's family's wine store. I've shopped for years  and years and years. They don't have a big interesting gin collection there. It's a wine  store. I was going to say, well, this is about wine. Oh, no, no, no. The second floor is all

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  hard liquor. Bevmo, baby. Bevmo has all the gins. Really? Yeah. I actually went to a gin tasting  last night and I tasted Hapusa, which is a South African gin. No, no. Hapusa is from Goa, I lied.  And then Wilder, Wilder, I can't say it. And that's a South African gin. What was your favorite?  Surprisingly raw, I did not like the South African one, but when it was with tonic,  it turned into just the best beverage. I was very excited. So there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just running down here. I don't mean to. Are you sure it's a bad grain? You had not a hangover?  Oh, yes. It was. I'm sorry. It was a bad joke. That was too easy. We were pouring little tiny,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like half ounce tasting pours and I only had three. So that's one and a half ounces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am going to be mad for a moment at Verizon. It's so easy to be mad at Verizon. Oh boy. It is.  They bought Yahoo, you may remember, and they're closing down Yahoo groups. There is a group of  internet archivists who have been trying to collect. God's work. Doing God's work. Do you  know how many there are 5.6 million groups on Yahoo groups. And in just a few days,  the data is going away. It'll be gone. It's a racing history. Yeah. So the archive  is trying to save as much as they can. They've already saved 1.8 billion messages. They've been  doing this for a while. Ever since they found out Yahoo was going to shut it down.  And this is only for groups, right? This is for groups. And this team  published a message saying Yahoo has banned all the email addresses the volunteers are using to  download data, making it impossible for us to use the scripts we're using to capture the groups.  Oh, that's just.  Yahoo has said to the group, the resources needed to maintain historical content from  Yahoo groups pages is cost prohibited, prohibitive as they're largely unused.  The people had via the people, the archivists violated the terms of service.  They suggested the number of users affected was small. Well, yeah, they're volunteers.  128 people regarding the 128 people who join Yahoo groups with the goal to archive them.  Are these people from archive team.org? If so, their actions violated our terms of service  because of this violation, we're unable to reauthorize them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yahoo is just a jerk. Clearly Verizon. I mean, Verizon is a jerk. Yeah, there is no more Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been subsumed into the.  So as of today, they've extended the deadline for requesting to download data to Friday,  January 31st. Now, the point of this is that many of these groups are abandoned. All of the messages  were public. They're not downloading private messages. No privacy violations.  You have to be a member of the, you know, the administrator of the group to use  Verizon's download tool to archive the group. And since many of these millions of groups are old  and nobody's around, they're not getting downloaded. So I think it's a worthy thing to  archive. Yes. I agree. I hope Verizon listens. They won't. And says, oh yeah, you know,  there is some history here. I had a bunch of Yahoo groups. I didn't use groups. I did have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  throwaway email and I just decided to log into that. And there's nothing in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. They got rid of a lot of those emails. Yeah. Did not know that.  So 1.4 million groups have public message archives and estimated number 2.1 billion messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Give it to the internet archive and just let them deal with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They got a lot of them. They got a lot of them, but they didn't get all of them. So  anyway, that just wanted to bring that up. Verizon notorious for doing the wrong thing  until they get caught. So maybe now that they've been caught, they'll go, oh, this is bad PR.  We maybe we should fix this. Spotify end of the year for Spotify. They have talked a little bit  about podcasts. You may remember that Spotify spent a lot of money on podcasts. They bought  podcasts, a production company, Gimlet and anchor the podcast production tool for $300 million.  Later, they bought Park cast the crime mystery and sci-fi producer spending around $400 million.  Spotify's goal is to become the premier producer of podcasts, the leading platform for podcast  creators. Apparently it's working for them. They are showing significant bumps in the number of  listens. Let me see if I can find that number because I saw it here. 500,000 podcast titles  on Spotify listeners have grown by more than 50% since the start of the year, 50% growth  since January, 39% increase in podcast hours consumed by listeners quarter over quarter.  The most consumed podcast on Spotify, the Joe Budden podcast with Rory and Mal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't know that one. I've heard of it, but that's about it. It's like, I, I unaware of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The big chat. We don't know anything anymore. Yeah, no, that's right. We're old.  Well, and the only thing that's bad about Spotify is, and they aren't doing it always,  but if the things that are exclusive to Spotify, right, you have to have the Spotify app to listen  to. You can be Spotify free tier, but you have to have the Spotify app. And of course that gives them  advertiser metrics. They can, they can then, they know all about what you're doing, how much you  listened, how long you listened, when you listened to who you are. And they can use that with  advertisers. That puts pressure on us and other independent podcasts because a, we can't really  do that because we want you to listen on whatever app you want. And we don't want, we don't want,  and also we don't want people to spy on our users. We know that privacy is important to you. However,  we have some grave concerns and we're not alone. A lot of podcasters are really starting to be  concerned now that because of stuff like this, there's going to be incredible pressure from  advertisers. Hey, we want to track your listeners. And if, and if you don't let us, then you're not  going to get the ad by, or starting to hear that. And a number of other podcasters, if there was a  video I posted on YouTube by another guy who said, this is going to be a real problem. Ad Tech is  coming to podcasting and Spotify is leading the charge, frankly. Their number one categories,  comedy, society and culture, true crime, news and health and fitness. I don't see technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on that list. So there is no tech there. Well, Spotify is for more normal people too. It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're happy. We're happy. In fact, there's a whole thread on our Twitter forums, the Twitter community  about our people who listen to Twitter weird.  They're weird in a good way though. The answer is in the best way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I used to use Spotify for podcasting, listening to podcasts, but my friend Todd Moore,  he had that passion app Playopod and I've been stuck on that ever since. But I get why people  want to use Spotify. It's a nice app. It's straightforward. And like she says, normal  people can use it without an issue. 75% of UK marketers are looking to increase

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  their spend in podcast advertising. It's a very hot category. This is an article from The Drum,  which is a UK blog. Some analysts are saying that audiences react more negatively to ads on podcasts  than other ad formats. I don't think that's true of our audience, but podcast ads have a net  positive score of negative nine globally versus plus 43 for magazine ads. Out of home ads-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's probably because you can skip right past a magazine ad. You can't skip past or you can, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  TV ads, positive 32. Radio ads, positive 27. Podcasts, though do beat mobile display ads,  negative 11 and mobile video, negative 13. This is from Cantor Ad Reaction. This is what they do.  However, global head of media, Cantor says, podcasts are becoming increasingly embedded  in consumer and business marketing due to the ease of handpicking audiences and serving relevant  and tonally appropriate content. Tonally appropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tonally appropriate. Have you ever heard that phrase referring to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's totally appropriate. Spotify lets advertisers target podcast listeners directly.  That's the key, right? Samsung and 3M are among the first brands to test the tool.  It has since made the targeting even more granular.  Oh good news, Barack and Michelle Obama are on board to co-produce exclusive podcasts for  Spotify because they're so good money. Apparently, they're spending a lot of money on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting to think about your post-presidential career.  Podcasting.  Well, I mean, the Netflix show, they're doing things that are not the traditional speaking to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  banks kind of thing. Michelle Obama's autobiography is easily the top book of 2019, right?  Oh yeah. Easily.  Really popular. All right. I think we should break because Stacey is ready to have some more gin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. Oh wait. No, I had a story. Oh, but it's not a Google story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay. It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Today, this is near and dear to my heart and any super nerdy tech people,  Cisco finally said that they were going to sell a standalone networking chip that is not part of  their gear. And I know that many of you guys are like, eh, who cares? But as someone who's covered  Cisco for like two decades, this is a huge deal for them. And it also shows how much power,  the disaggregation of the computing infrastructure that the hyperscale data center guys have really  kind of made. So I just thought that was pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there anything particularly interesting about the chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's probably offers a lot of networking speed. What's interesting is Cisco has never  disaggregation has never been Cisco's game. Right. And they have done custom chips, but if you did,  if you bought Cisco gear, you would get a custom chip, but that's the only way to get it. But now  they're like crap. Google's building their own switches, Facebook, Microsoft, everybody's doing  it. We can't sell our boxes at a pre-meal anymore. We might as well just give them the silicon.  Interesting. So that's where they're going.  Interesting. Okay. That's it. It's just super nerdy. And I love it because of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will it empower new ideas in internet routers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so no. So Cisco was kind of, it helped fund it, but it was a little behind the impact that  software defined networking was going to have on them. And that was the big sea change in networking  in the last probably decade or two, which is the separation of the control plane from the data  plane. And so when you think of this, this is about the internet as a whole and has in big data  centers. This isn't for consumers, except as we consume product from those companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Royal Knight in our chat room, maybe puts this in perspective. He said, this would be like Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  licensing their search technology. Thank you. Yes. It's a big deal.  It is. It is a huge, big deal for Cisco. It's their secret sauce and they're letting  other companies use it. Right. And that's to me, I mean, because again, covered them forever and  they like had a lock on their gear and they were never going to take it apart. But today they took

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it apart. Interesting. Yeah. Thank you, Royal Knight. Thank you, Stacey Higginboth. Let's take a break.  Your tips and picks and numbers and all that stuff coming up. But I first have a tip for you,  a better browser. It's brave. Now we were just talking about how Chrome is doing all these  changes to Chrome. One of the beauty parts of all of this is that Chrome is an open-source browser.  It's based on the Chromium platform and many of the features in Chrome go into Brave,  but not all, only the good stuff. Not the feature, for instance, that blocks you block origin,  my favorite ad blocker. Brave has built-in ad blocking, but Brave will work with all the  Chrome extensions because it's based on Chromium. What I find is I don't have to install as many  Chrome extensions because Brave does so much to protect my privacy and security just right out of  the box. In fact, Brave is built by a team that's focused on both privacy and performance. Brave is  a lot faster because you're not downloading all that weird JavaScript and the ads and all the  weird stuff. It's up to six times faster than the competition. Unmatched speed, online privacy. Yes,  of course, it blocks ads and trackers right out of the box. It's a better user experience and it's  free. Since every operating system, even Apple, allows you to have multiple browsers, download  a copy of Brave. It's on iOS, it's on Android, Mac, Windows, even Linux, and try it. I think you'll  see it gives you all the benefits of Google's Chrome without all the googly bits, all the  sending signals back. I'll give you an example. When you use a private browsing tab in Chrome,  Google still sees what you're doing. It's just not saving cookies to your hardware. With Brave,  that private window has Tor, so no one sees what you're doing. Not Brave, not anybody. You're  completely anonymized. That's really nice. Brave also has some wonderful features that Jeff will  like because, of course, ad blocking does have one negative impact. It's great for you. It  improves your security, lowers your battery usage, lowers your data usage, speeds up websites,  but it takes money out of the mouths of some very deserving websites. Brave was trying to figure out  how to do this and they've created a way to reward publishers with their fair share of web revenue  with BAT tokens, Basic Attention Tokens. The idea is you can either buy BAT with cash or you can  opt into privacy-respecting Brave ads. They're very non-intrusive. I've turned them on and earn BAT.  Then you can say to content creators, I'm going to award you with Basic Attention Tokens  so that you can continue to do the great work you're doing. I think this is a great solution  to help fix the web, improve privacy, and give publishers their due. It's just one more reason  you want to definitely look into Brave. I am a huge fan. It's all I use now. Go to brave.com  slash twit. Now I know you're smart. You can just go to Brave and download it. You could Google it  and download it, but if you would, please go to brave.com slash twit. That way they know you saw  it here. We don't track you. We don't send Brave information about you. The only way they will know  that you saw it on Twig is if you go to brave.com slash twit. Yesterday was about Big Tech. Today is  about us. Brave.com slash twit. That helps us when you use that URL. It helps us, frankly, continue to  do privacy-respecting ads on our podcasts. I love it that Brave is a sponsor. Thank you, Brave.  Save battery life. Speed yourself up. No more trackers. They are really ahead of the curve.  Brave.com slash twit. My favorite browser. It should be yours too. At least download it and try it.  The best thing to do is go into settings when you download it. The defaults are all fine,  but if you go to the settings, you'll see how much more granular you can get. For instance,  I hate it when websites pop up notifications saying, would you like me to notify you? I hate  that. So you go into the content section of Brave settings and say, no one. No one should bother me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  with that. When did that phenomenon start? Oh, I don't know. It's terrible. It's been driving me nuts.  Every single thing you see. Just go in the settings. It's in the content section. It's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  little bit buried. That's why maybe you didn't notice. It's in the content section. You can  turn it off and then notice I don't ever get those. Yeah, you don't have those. I love it.  Jeff, let's see. Where should we start? Yeah, Jeff, let's do a number. Jeff never gets to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a few. I think I'll do this one. This is a feel-good one.  The first community of 3D printed homes at the bottom of the other section.  3D printed homes. Alexis Ohanian. I saw this on Facebook because I'm on Facebook because I  would find out fascinating things there because if you're on Facebook, you learn things about the  world. I just listened to Jeff Jarvis and he's on Facebook. So Alexis Ohanian and Gina Sanders,  who I knew from my days at County Nast, had a post up about this. So the effort is to do in Mexico,  a community of people of homes. Look how cool this looks. They're very nice homes. But they look like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they're 3D printed. I guess it's like a concrete printer. But that's a stick. Yeah, you make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks good. It looks nice. It's a place where Adobe's in the culture. It looks like Adobe.  Yeah, that's awesome. Right. Oh, I love it. And it's for people who are making like $3 a day.  So they're less expensive because they're 3D printed. They're less expensive. In 24 hours,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the house goes up. What? You don't have to frame it. Oh, that's awesome. Isn't it? That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  great. I would like to see this that isn't decorated by like Insta-worthy people. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But sure. Yes, exactly. Hey, you get to decorate it any way you want. It's your house. That's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  point. I'm not. I'm just kind of like, let's be real. They don't look like that. No. Well,  they do. They're concrete. One or two does. But when you move into something like that and you're  living on $3 a day, that's it. You don't have a $20 throw pillow. Yeah. All right. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if you don't decorate it, they look like concrete. They're made out of lava.  Yeah, they're very. That's pretty cool though. Yeah, that's fine. I don't have a problem with  that. You get to make it whatever you want. And why is Alexis involved in this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if it comes out of a... Is he donating to it or?  I wrote a badge. I just don't know. I saw him on Facebook. So he and Gina were there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just think he's a great guy. And the fact that he's married to Serena just helps.  Oh yeah. And he's a stay at home dad. I just love that. So nice. Or travel around the world,  dad. Stay at home. Well, stay in the hotel, dad. Let's put it that way. Stay in the hotel, dad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's awesome. I also like how he is now Alexis Ohanian Senior because his daughter is Alexis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that I didn't know. I didn't know that. Yeah, cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So with 3D printing, according to Jason Ballard, who's co-founder of Icon, which is the company  doing this, you not only have a continuous thermal envelope, high thermal mass and near zero waste,  you also have speed, a much broader design palette, next level resiliency and the possibility of a  quantum leap in affordability. This isn't 10% better. It's 10 times better. I want a 3D printed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  home. That is super cool. Well, first I want to deal with the homeless problems in places like  San Francisco where you get some land and deal with this. Of course this is for low density,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but nonetheless. Yeah. Why? Cause you got to bring in the... Well, cause you're not going to do a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sky ride. Yeah. You can't do a sky ride or a high... What are the skyscrapers? High rise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  High scraper. So just to put this in perspective, these are the... before the homes were built,  these are where these people in Tabasco, Mexico, what they were living in. So Stacey, I'm just  going to point out. It ain't the decor. It's just having a wall that's not made out of palm fronds

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  or corrugated tar. No, but Stacey's point was that it's all American dumped. Well, let me see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see. I'm going... This is the assets provided in the press release here. Let's see  the first 3D. Let's see some non-fixed up homes I'm trying to find. Are there any? I've not seen  anything in there. Maybe they fix them up for you when they built them. I mean, you got to say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like how it looks like rope. I'm not a fan of throw pillows myself. I think it's a... No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just saying that we're registering this, which is probably pretty spare and very small.  I mean, it is small. We're registering this as far cuter. I did. And you know what? In  four years or maybe three, this is going to look similar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really? It's a different lifestyle. It's concrete, baby. That ain't going nowhere.  It's concrete. Yeah, this is not a home front. I'm not saying it's concrete, but it'll be...  No, from an aesthetic standpoint. I understand. Look, they got a professional decorator in,  professional photographer. They painted the door blue. I don't like that shade of aqua. Could you  try a little bit more aquamarine? And it looks good. Turquoise, please. It's a press release.  But I still think it's cool and I want one. Stacey, what do you got for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In addition to just bitter apples. Bitter, bitter apples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, you raise an important point, which is it's often the case this is all dressed up,  you know, and Americanized. But you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, yes, it's good, but it's not real. That's not real. Anyway, let's talk about something real  and expensive. And tomorrow and Friday, we will be releasing our IoT gift guide.  It is exciting. It's IoT gifts that do not suck. But first off, this is what I gave Kevin,  actually this year, which is the Philips Hue Sync Box. Every year I give Kevin a present,  make him write a review about it. So what is it? Now I'm using a Hue Hub. What does this do?  So this is the Hue Sync Box. It is expensive, but you plug that into an HDMI input. So any HDMI  input, you use these lights and it turns your television. It does the light in conjunction  with what's on your screen. So he ran a, he did a thing of altered carbon that shows it  at the bottom, a little video. And there it is, the light is basically, it becomes an extension of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's wild. It's ambient. It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is a nice way if you have Hue products to bring this functionality in. So for  him, he found, so I bought him the Sync Box for $229. Then he found a package of those two lights  and a Philips Hue Hub for $130. I think you can buy the two lights for $130. And if you don't have  a Hue Hub, you have to spend like, I think it's $60 for that. So this is not cheap, but it is like,  he wanted it for Stadia gaming and for movies. And he likes it.  Wait a minute, you can do it with a game too?  Yeah, they have two products. So one is the Sync Box, which is HDMI. And then they have a cheaper  one that is for video gaming. And that is, what is that called? The Philips Hue Play.  And that syncs with your tele, your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would, you know, I might use this in my man cave. It'd be kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, I mean, like anybody who watches movies and like, again, it's kind of a splurge,  but it's not like a crazy splurge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's using the Hue light bars.  Yes.  To do the lighting. So that's, you probably wouldn't want to do it with light bulbs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, if you do the bulbs, so if you use the bars or you could use the Go lights too, that  are on the bottom or anything to do like splash up on the wall. But if you use the light bulbs,  you basically get surround light. So instead of surround sound, you get the light happening  behind you. And he says for things that he's like, I may do that for things like explosions.  Yeah. It's a little pricey. It's, you know,  that's why it's a good gift. In my world, a gift is something you would never buy for yourself.  Cause it's like, that's extra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could give some poor Mexican family a 3D built home or you give yourself the Play HDMI

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sync box. I'm going to slide off camera now. Take your pick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just teasing. This looks good. I actually, I actually want to buy this, but I'll also  just to make myself feel better, buy a 3D printed home. Donate a house to someone.  I'll donate a house when I buy the Hue sync box. Maybe I'll put a sync box in the house.  Along with the step in the game of

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  the house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ant Pruitt, what do you have for us today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine is totally, totally random. This harkens back to traveling a couple of years ago,  or maybe it was last year. And the fire alarm went off in the hotel that I was staying in.  And I decided to take that opportunity to go and shoot with it because, hey, I'm a photographer.  I might as well go out and make the most of this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I see. So this is the key if you're a photographer constantly having that camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The camera was literally right next to the door in the hotel room. I grabbed it and I went out  and shot while we waited around on the fire. Did you have pants on?  And yes, I did.  And I went out and shot and I figured I'd do this little video of a speed edit,  just to show people a part of my workflow, but also just share the story of, hey,  keep your camera around because you never know the opportunities that you'll have with  photography. And sometimes you can get some pretty cool stuff.  This one, all of my nerdy friends noticed that it said 404.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the number of the fire engine as well as file not found.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's just a little walkthrough of just the speed edit of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is where hands-on photo is so great. It's kind of  a how to do stuff. And that's Ant's new show. This is not part of hands-on photo. This is on Ant's  YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's on my feed. I thought about that and I was like, man, I remember waking up at 330 in the  morning. And the thing is this happened twice at this hotel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Always have your camera. Always have your camera. You never know when something's going to happen.  That's right.  What is your YouTube channel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  YouTube.com slash Ant Pruitt. I'm the only one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, and always have your camera and always take off the lens cap.  Okay. I got some very dark shots of you. It's not going to work very well.  Thank you, Ant.  Thank you, sir.  Our show appears on the network live every Wednesday, 1 30 Pacific, 4 30 Eastern, 21 30 UTC.  If you want to watch live, you can watch Stacey punch me.  We edit those out later. You can also get on demand versions of the show at  twit.tv slash twig or subscribe in your favorite podcast application. You know, you could,  I wouldn't even be hurt if you subscribed in Spotify. In fact, that'd be a great thing to do.  Whatever app you use, if you subscribe, then you get the show automatically the minute it's available.  I think we can wrap this up. Ant, what are you doing this week on hands-on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ooh, hands-on photography. I still have two things in mind, so I haven't decided on that one.  What was your last one on?  But what was the last one?  What was the existing one?  Twitter.tv slash hop.  I can't remember what I did last week on hop because I did it early.  Oh, you did an early hop.  I had to do it early.  What was it that you did?  Social media and cropping.  Oh, I critiqued someone's photos. That was part of it.  Fun.  But focus on photography. Please check that one out.  That's going to be fun tomorrow. We have Lisa Carney joining us. She's an outstanding graphic designer.  I will say if you go to Netflix and look at all of the thumbnails that you see that shows the  different shows and movies, I'm pretty sure she's done most of those.  Oh, nice. She's really good.  That will be a lot of fun.  Fun to talk to.  I can't wait to see it.  Tune in for that tomorrow. Focus on photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Again, Twitter.tv slash live if you want to watch what we're doing. Of course,  you can always go to Twitter.tv slash hop or Twitter.tv slash fop to get ants latest  shows. Thank you everybody. We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
