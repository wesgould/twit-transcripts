Stacy Higginbotham is here Stacy on IOT  Haven't talked to you Stacy since the IOT  debacle of  2016 so let's we'll talk about that in a moment, but also let me introduce mr. Jeff Jarvis back home after his  jaunts  Around the globe he's professor of journalism is in his office at CUNY. Yeah also blogs at buzz machine comm and  Has written many many wonderful books including what would Google do public parts geeks bearing gifts about the new reinventing the news business  Hello, you two. I missed you. We got a band back together. I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello. Hello. I'm excited to be back because it means I'm home. You've been traveling a lot and you're gonna travel again

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to San Francisco next week. I am but then I'm done  Really that's it for this for the season for the season for the CES is see what CES will be the next thing so good  Stacy will be hosting several panels at the structure conference in San Francisco this coming week  election day I  Would like to be at a conference on election day and the day after I would like to be with a large group of people  Because I think it's just it's fascinating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To this David Patrick has his conference the day after election day. What's his conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Techonomy. Oh, I'm gonna be at that one, too. Oh  Then you are traveling. Where's that? I think it's in Half Moon Bay. Oh  So you can go south but not north is that what you're saying? I'm pretty sure it's it's somewhere outside of San Francisco  Jeff don't tell me like I just got something wrong the other day and I had to switch some flights. So  economy not as bad as Paul, Thurado actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Went to the airport and realized he hadn't booked a flight  Somewhere and just I guess assumed that there'd be a plane for him  And Mark Zuckerberg is gonna be at that I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mark Zuckerberg since 2008 he likes to David. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very very very good. Can't wait  Anyway, let I do want to go back in time a couple of weeks cuz  Two weeks ago the internet sort of went down at least got slowed down a lot Spotify Twitter github  because of an attack a denial of service attack on  dying DNS which  What is a one of the major DNS providers apparently for those companies?  And it turned out the attack was originated from Internet of Things devices particularly camera and routers  Made by a Chinese company called shung my and then sold by a variety of different companies and was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna argue with you already. Yes  These are not Internet of Things devices. They're devices that happen to be on the Internet. Okay, keep going  That's actually one of the things

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dig down on that. Okay, that's one of the things that came up was what is an Internet of Things device  Okay, so let me before we say that let me say why this was an issue  These simple dumb devices are often manufactured in the million sold in the millions IDG  Estimates six and a half billion and this is probably where this definition is critical  IOT devices and another something like five and a half million a day going online  These devices typically are made cheaply sold cheaply and never updated often  They have the default password built in to firmware. That was the problem with these shung my devices  So it's easy for a virus like Mirai the virus that was used in this attack  So just scan the Internet law try logging in via telnet and get in and then put a virus on these devices  In fact, these devices are so simple that the virus sits in RAM. So if you reboot the device  It just it's clean  But it's then sitting on the Internet ready to be hacked one more time  so the what happens with this is because there are so many of them you can compromise a  Great number of devices which makes it much easier to do a D dos attack  These devices sent GRE packets which were routing packets to dine DNS packets that could not ignore  Nor could it block because it was coming from so many IP addresses  So first thing is IDG's estimate of IOT devices. I  Mentioned that on Twitter. I think on Sunday and everybody said that's that can't possibly be right  Stay six and a half billion. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay  There's so much to unpack here. Yes. I feel like I'm just gonna be beaten on a wall, but let's let's start  all right  These devices so this is one type of attack  So we're killing all of the Internet of things based on it that devices that are on the Internet being used in a D dos  So we're gonna talk only about D dos is we're not going to talk about other security issues with IOT. So that's parameter number one  number two  These devices are routers. They're network DVR. So they're security cameras and  They're also there are a couple printers in the list  These are devices that connect directly to the Internet they don't most what I would think of as a modern kind of  Internet of things device that we typically talk about when we think about these things  Those connect either through a server. So they've got a different type of architecture  So they don't connect directly out or they might even connect through a hub  The other thing to know about these is their their Linux servers  These are not like a light bulb your light bulb is gonna be freaking useless  If it were part of a D dos attack because it just doesn't have a GRE packet or even a right packet  Yeah, so those are a couple things to keep in mind. I'm not saying this is great  This is really truly sucky and I'm kind of glad it happened because people have been putting stuff online for for decades that are not  Secure so hard-coded passwords in these routers dumb  I mean Mariah just goes through and the source code for Mariah, you know, basically creates all these bots  That's why when you when you reboot it in like 10 minutes or so, it's gonna get infected again because  You know, you're not even dealing with a person you're dealing with bots that are like boop boop poke. Are you open? Are you open? Yes infected  So I don't know. Okay, so that's that's kind of all of that  and I just I get really frustrated because  We haven't been building things securely for a while

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I mean you don't have to defend IOT. This isn't an attack on IOT. It's merely an attack on bots  It's merely an attack on poorly designed IOT

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's not even IOT. It's just poorly designed connected crap, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, these are cheap knock cheap devices for the most part. Well, how do you define an internet of things device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well up until now  I've never I don't even call things an internet of things device to be totally honest  I call it the podcast called IOT. Yeah, I do it's called the internet of things  And when I define the internet of things I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Seinfeld don't you get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what so what are the devices you cover on the IOT podcast? Those are internet of things devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, most of my devices are smart home stuff or sensors and buildings

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there is you're right. Those devices can't be used in this kind of attack  however, they are they do still pose security vulnerabilities for instance because  They are on your network if they can be compromised a bad guy can use them  To then compromise other devices on your network or hack that is true  So they because they're sitting on the internet in a way that isn't necessarily particularly secure. They offer a vulnerability

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the issue is one  There's always you can't secure anything anymore for the most part. There's the sense of like  Security is no longer a set it and forget it. It's an ongoing  Pintesting challenge, right? So if you're going to build a product and connect it to the internet you have to be prepared to conduct  Uh pin testing every you know, however long I mean I would agree with you but but but you can cover

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  99% of the cases with some very  Simple things that even  Even those things aren't being done for instance having firmware that's updatable  You all those shang mai devices are now being recalled they're hoping and of course it will not happen  people will send them back to get the firmware updated so  Rule one like the ring doorbell. You have to be able to be updated remotely  So that if something's discovered it can be fixed people out that also freaks people out  Well understand what it has to happen. It's not it's just like windows has to be updated  These devices have to be updated acknowledging what you just said stacey. Nothing's perfect two  They can't have hardwired backdoor passwords. That's ridiculous in this day and age  I would say that's number one. Okay, maybe even yeah, I mean that's just so stupid

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right. Hey, don't tape your front key to the door. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what it is, too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so there but but you do the basics you're going to thwart a lot of this stuff  I mean, it's not it's not I mean there are of course lots of edge cases and we're seeing that now with  Operating systems from microsoft and software from big companies google and others  That is really well written software. The latest attack on android d d rammer is a highly sophisticated attack  Uh, not that a script kitty couldn't do it once it's been weaponized, but it's a it's incredibly sophisticated  And yes, you can you know, there's always going to be stuff like that, but you can eliminate the  vast majority of problems  With some simple stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here's what you should look for which is my specialty. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is I want to understand this first from the other side for one second

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you have to do to fix the internet so that it is not vulnerable to ddos attacks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are there are things you could do but it's very hard. So  Steve and I talked about this on security now a lot  We talked about it recently last two weeks one thing used to be if you just made isps  reject traffic  That that was spoofed the cat a spoofed ip address that didn't come from their network  So if you're comcast and you say outbound traffic from comcast has to come from a compact array the compass comcast range of  ip addresses or we're going to reject it that would have helped until  these days because  Initially all these d dots attacked had to come from computers  And so they had to spoof their ip address. Otherwise, it would be easier to stop them now because of the proliferation of  Small internet connected devices. They don't they no longer spoof their address  They're coming from real addresses because there's so many of them you can block it doesn't matter  So now one thing steve and I talked about yesterday is routers  Should probably have some software on them that watches for this kind of outbound  traffic  Because just as an isp should be responsible for traffic exiting their network  You probably should be responsible for traffic exiting your home router your home router your home router to give you  And again, these are this is like cherry picking there's going to always be edge cases of things that are going to get by this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you get the vast majority it really improves things because the reason the reason i'm asking that is is that if you have  a bunch of dumb crappy  Cameras out there  Uh trying to get dumb crappy hardware made better is going to be really hard to do it strikes me that that that you've got  To try to fix it at a different point. Yeah, there's always going to be dumb crappy crap out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we talked about this  Dumb crappy crap  So I talked about this with andy ellis who is the csO at akamai  Um chief csO cto csO  Um, and he also pointed out that this is while these attacks are huge today  In a couple of years, they're not going to be as significant because the internet itself  Will be bigger so  Everything will scale up which is kind of an interesting and super hopeful statement  Especially because he was like, you know, we're not going to be able to stop this  There are things you can do like some of the things leo mentioned i'm not sure I agree with him

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's right. Are you kidding? Yeah, I know he's super smart and he's akamai but  There are still the problem really is that for instance dns servers. This is there's a small number of these  the 13 canonical  dns networks  Are are vulnerable because there's 13 of them  And you can say the internet's scaling up and it's gonna be bigger  But what he's what I think what he's saying is he's pitching  Uh a point of view that comes from cdns and from it does and yeah, it comes from companies like cloud flare  Which is oh don't worry about fixing security. We're just going to mitigate by throwing bandwidth at it  And I think that that is a very funny attitude

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So i'm not saying that we should not do security but getting isps to like block ports is  Is actually quite difficult his other solution was actually to charge them for it  I don't know if you guys remember was a blue frog. That's how you get him to do it. Yeah  Yeah, the spam. Yeah, remember when spam was like a big deal and they started like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sending packets back to isp did not want to block port 25 for ages the the smtp port  Because they didn't want to pay for the and think about if you have millions of customers the tech support  Costs are not insignificant when they call up and say why is my mail server not working?  But they eventually did they were forced to buy things like this and they now do you can't run a mail server on your  Comcast network for that reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is upsetting too. I mean, it's it's it'd be nice if people could run servers out of their homes for things and would be  That'd be great

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm gonna push you though on the iot thing stacey. I know that you know, you don't want anything to to hurt the ecosystem of iot  but  But really  This is a recipe for disaster reddit what regardless of what you or andy says putting all of these dumb cheap devices  online  Is a recipe for disaster. This is not something that can be ignored at this point

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So we should have I I'm actually a huge believer in  I'll just say it finds out the wazoo for

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  poorly designed devices and services and block it or say you can't sell it anymore in the u.s

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but but but you're gonna have people making stuff on their own

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was gonna say most of the mariah botnet computers now aren't even in the u.s  So they're coming from all you can't block the sale of saying you can try to fix the crappy crap or you can try to fix

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The throughput or you can fix the target

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a good point  So right, I mean it's the same. Well, you should do all of it. I mean  Yeah, yeah, sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the same problem I have with the fact that if somebody has your name and your social security number they can ruin your life  What's wrong with that picture? Right, right that we should you shouldn't be able to do a transaction with such little information  You got to fix the transactional requirements  So that simple little leaks aren't going to be a problem anymore  same here  Um, if if if just simply being able to throw out a volume of pings is going to bring down  On the whole freaking internet then that's something  A nuclear attack won't something's wrong with that picture. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, yes, but I will say  A lot of companies are doing fine things and I want to if you want to have a connected device  Here's what you should look for. Let me just give you some takeaways here  No hard-coded passwords  uh  Things that when you install the device it forces you to change your password new links as routers do this for example  You want a vendor that allows over-the-air updates so they can switch things because that's going to happen  You also want a vendor that is  Monitoring things and you may not know this or you know  a lot of the major  Companies who offer these devices have some sort of monitoring system to see what their devices are doing  And if something happens with them and you also want to have a bug bounty or a security program  so people can report things to you without  Being worried about being sued for example  so  Those are and then as a consumer  You should pay for quality and  If you're and this is hard because like if you're an smb and you're buying a network dvr  You're looking for what's resolution?  you know  What can how many how many like how much memory do I have on this thing and then how much does it cost you're not saying?  Gosh  Are this is going to open?  Right. Am I going to help take down the internet with this part of the problem with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In several of the things you just talked about is that the people who have to make that buying decision don't pay the price for  Uh the security problems they're causing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, oh and somebody pointed this out. I forgot to say it again. Um  of  Having the ability to monitor your network traffic to see if it's spiking because otherwise you're never going to know because it's not  Right, so that's important. I don't think that's out. Do you do you know of any routers or anything that oh, yeah  A lot of routers will do that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Huh? Yeah, go check mine. They're the more expensive more complicated more difficult to use routers  I I think there's some hope in this new category of routers like the ero and the the luma  Um link sis is doing one like that where they're managed not by you but by the manufacturer  so  Eero has a very simple and they're a sponsor. I should mention. Uh, ero has a very simple app  That really doesn't give you a huge amount of capability certainly doesn't let you kind of do that kind of monitoring of things  But they have the ability to mob because you're logged into the your ero account to do that now whether they do I don't know but  uh  That's one way to solve this  is  I mean if you're a business you don't the owner of the business isn't paying attention to security that you hire  People to do that for you and you use appliances, you know, we have big security  Appliances between twit in the outside world and we have a professional guy running it  Uh, that's how a business does it?  If you're a home you need that kind of support. You can't be expected to do that. I don't think

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I do think our internet service and our wi-fi is going to be delivered as a service going forward

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go. So that's the way to describe what I just said, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then people are going to be pissed because people still don't want to pay  Like i'm i'm constantly shocked at people when i'm like, oh, yeah my eros they were like 500 bucks for three. It's too much  I know  They're like I could buy a router for 80. That's also the opposite of where cable's going, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cable's being forced by the FCC to let you buy your cable box rather than leasing it  What you're basically saying leo is you're leasing the service  And it's another damn monthly fee and we'll get ripped off for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you don't have to get ripped off for it. Maybe your cable provider doesn't actually provide you the wi-fi service  Maybe you get it from another company. It doesn't have to come from isp could be very helpful here because they see all that outbound traffic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, they really are very active on this  Yeah, aren't they?  Uh, well anyway, I just I it's old somewhat old news, uh, but I  You weren't around and I really wanted to get your your take on it. I'm glad I asked  Um, you have a lot to say about it. I have opinions and I believe you probably and kevin talk about it on your iot podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We did we did I actually had  Two security guests. Yeah, one's one's actually coming out this week. So good. Good. Good. Good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're much more up on it than I am probably  Um, although we do talk about all of this quite a bit on security now as well. This is obviously  Oh, yeah, no better place a big a big source of uh our conversation  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does steve ever get scared?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He never shows it  But I often do  And uh, and I ask him are we losing you know and things like that, but no he's he's extremely  Positive about what we can do. He often if we have a little segment called you're doing it wrong. He'll often  Call out people who just are kind of incredibly stupid  But you know a lot of what we talk about nowadays and this is I don't think this this is kind of what I was alluding to  Is that hack the hackers white and black hat?  uh are becoming incredibly sophisticated in their ability to suss out problems  That they could take advantage of if you look at how this d rammer  exploit  Works on android and this is the exploit that uh that is potentially

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Going to be a huge problem for all android phones because it's it's hardware based  it it is  Incredibly  Sophisticated I don't even know how they figured this out  And I couldn't in any cogent way describe this to you in less than 20 minutes  Um, but it is it's a bit flip in ram basically that they use then to root a phone and that  If as it's once it's weaponized that technique can be used to root your phone remotely in minutes seconds even  And the problem is very hard to fix and according to some it's not really clear that even the google pixel is affected by this  And it's you can mitigate it a little bit with firmware updates  Uh, but not 100% so the nexus 4 the nexus 5 the g4 from lg moto g  From last year in the year before the galaxy s4 the s5 the one from one plus  um  All have been successfully rooted  Using the d rammer tool and this requires me to download an app though, right? Right. So it'd be a malicious app  Got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I always I always like knowing what I should avoid. Yeah, there's so we often talk about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's there's exploits and a lot of exploits require physical access. I don't worry so much about those  There's exploits that require you to do something stupid like most windows malware requires you to execute a program on your computer  But then there are worms network  based attacks  Like mirai that require no interactivity on your part. That's just to infect you and those are the most you also add in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fishing which requires you to say something stupid, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stage fright which predated d rammer could be uh could happen to you from a malicious mms that you wouldn't have to  Open or look at  Because the way the media player worked on android is it would automatically render that mms  Pre-render it download it pre-render it before you looked at it. So that's an example of an exploit  That did involve downloading something on your on your phone, but you didn't have to do anything  You didn't have to install an app or anything  That's why but that was fixable and has been and for anything new been fixed problem with course with android  There's a lot of older stuff that will never be fixed. It's similar to iot  Where a lot of android devices are very inexpensive phones the manufacturer the carrier and the user are not going to fix it  And so they're going to be sitting out there forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's another thing about this though  Worth mentioning not we we assume it's cheap stuff. But actually I saw in the list of devices the ubiquity  Router and I I was like, what the heck is that doing on there? There's a fix for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We talked about that yesterday as well. Okay, but it requires you running  You have to update your firmware  You have to download a shell script and update your firmware

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but the thinking was one that a lot of these or some of these not all of them  Are designed for sitting in an enterprise where they have someone who's monitoring the traffic and who's doing a lot of the stuff that  A homeowner isn't necessarily doing so my my tip on that is be careful if you're buying enterprise gear

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're assuming a lot of point they're assuming you're going to keep it up today. Yeah, that's why I said very important  Iot device needs to be able to be updated remotely firmware needs to be able to update remotely  There was a problem with the ring doorbell another sponsor where if you took the doorbell off  You could analyze it in such a way as to get the uh, the homeowners, uh, wi-fi password login and password  You'd have to remove it. You'd have to put it back  it wasn't an easy exploit and to my knowledge was never exploited because  as soon as ring learned about it before it was public they  Sent a patch down the line and all ring doorbells in the were patched and so as soon as you connect your new ring doorbell  It gets patched if it's not so that's that's very very important  By the way, I want to say one more thing about d rammer because you said you have to download an app  But if you combine it with something like stage fright, which maliciously sends an mms to an unpatched phone  Stage fright can then be used to invoke d rammer  so  This is why it's really dangerous you can you can daisy chain exploit  So all you need is one wormish exploit that can be done without any interactivity  So we are seeing d rammer being used in the wild by taking advantage of the stage fright bug  Which it gets it on the machine and then it's activated

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, oh another dumb question. That's my specialty. Yeah, what uh, how does um the doorbell?  Mama prevent  Uh fake mamas from coming in and and downloading new mother's milk. I don't know. Sorry that one  How does

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But boy the phrasing was dope boy  I was blocked that metaphor  That's that's the second key which we've kind of alluded to which is authentication is really important on all these things  You can't have a default password  so, uh  So it has to be built into the firmware of a doorbell that you know  You don't take firmware updates from strangers is what you're saying  You you can only accept firmware updates that are signed by the manufacturer, but we have a good  We have a very good mechanism for that kind of authentication jeff. It's called uh, so you feel confident in that. That's oh, it's excellent  pgp signatures excellent, although

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  although  This isn't this isn't for wi-fi and it's not it. It's a it's a token issue. Sometimes people will do  Manufacturers will get a little lazy and they'll just pick a default token. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They use the same one on everything. Yes that we've seen as well  Yeah, no good. I said good authentication  Not not dopey authentication good authentication, but there are by the way, it's well known. They're very good authentication methods when I download  updates for linux for instance  In every case or even install linux in every case. There's an authentication  System that allows me to verify that that came from the person who says says it came from came from the manufacturer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh  Okay. Okay. This is important. This is relevant. I was in dc yesterday  I think it was yesterday and I was at a panel  And one of the big topics thanks to mariah was iot security  And I have to tell you guys that the washington fix is not going to come  it's it's not happening because  when I was doing this I was a amazed at how  Wrong some of the information that was shared on the panel was of course, but two two  And there was okay, so there was a congressman staffer there was a head of enforcement for the fcc. There was a lawyer  There was the a representative from the consumer electronics association that puts on ces  And then there was someone for the center for democracy and technology see I may see dt see anyway  So that's the panelists  They were focused only on the device. I asked about encryption, which you know in washington is a problem  And they didn't even want to talk about it  And they even said the cloud security like securing database passwords and stuff in the cloud  Was also not on the table. It was tangential  and so  That freaked me out to no end because these regulators  Are trying to build laws. They're trying to think about repercussions for things if you're the ftc for example  You're thinking about fines and how to enforce things like  Maintaining good database or good password databases  So so yeah, that's that was kind of a downer  So I went to a conference today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the four square conference not that four square but held by lizard and it's off the record. So I can't but last night  editor ross orcan interviewed john brennan the head of the cia  Which  It was fascinating and actually I was very impressed with brennan was glad I was glad I was glad I was glad  To say but the discussion that then ensues always ensues in these groups is  You know  Encryption and backdoors to encryption and is it really encryption?  And the desire to have secure systems and the desire to have  local control  Just it's going to be in constant constant conflict

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, well I don't know why you call me a grumpy because you guys are just brussels  Grumpy because you guys have just brought me down man. I was all cheery and happy  Is there a new device we can talk about? Yes, let's take a break  Let's talk about something that's got to be happy. I got toys. Let's talk about toys. Actually. I have the scariest story  Was not widely reported. We talked a little bit about on sunday the scariest story  I think of the year coming up in just a second. So stay tuned but first a word  This is happy fresh books if you're a freelancer if you've got a small business  I can pretty much guarantee  You didn't get in business because you loved sending invoices and keeping track of finances and running your accounting  Unless you're an accounting business, but then you're doing it for somebody else  I bet you people who run accounting businesses don't even do that like doing their own invoicing and accounting  It's just not the fun part, right?  So fresh books lets you do the stuff you got into business to do the thing you really enjoy  You're really good at and handles the stuff you need to do to keep the business running  It started for me when I first started using fresh books 12 years ago for invoicing  And it is simple and easy and wonderful  But now fresh books has been completely redesigned to give you so much more  They've launched the all-new version of their cloud accounting software  By the way, if you're an existing fresh books user, you can stay with the old interface if you want  But you should try the new one because it's been redesigned from the ground up to be  to fit the way you work  So that you don't feel like you're doing accounting but i'll give you an example that I was talking to the fresh books guy  And they said, you know most small businesses freelancers don't even know if they made a profit this year, let alone how much  They made they just don't even know they assume well i'm paying the bills. I think i'm okay  Fresh books without any additional effort will tell you  It'll let you know  What your accounts receivable are what you've been paid this year what you've paid out  In expenses this year so you you get something I would I would call it a balance sheet  But it's much easier to read than a balance sheet by the way, we'll do a balance sheet for your account and so forth  It all starts with the invoices. You can create professional easy invoices in less than 30 seconds. No formatting. No formulas  Your logo's on it  You get paid faster because there's a pay me button on every invoice and by the way your clients want to get rid of the paperwork  Too, so they tend to pay you up to on average four days faster  Uh, and you'll also know whether they've seen it which I really like the clients sometimes you know  The bad ones will say oh I didn't get your invoice. Uh, I didn't I didn't see that  Well now you can say well, no, I can see you saw it. You opened on october 27th at 3 p.m  Whoa, yeah, so I did  There's a super handy deposit feature so you can invoice for a payment up front as you kick off a project  So you don't have to pay out of pocket. I mean I can go on and on I want you to take a look  It's very easy 30-day free trial if you just go to fresh books.com  If you're trying to do this with some other system that's complicated hard to use you don't  You shouldn't have to learn double entry bookkeeping to do what you love. You just need fresh books  You'll get all the stuff behind the scenes that your accountant wants  But and you'll get the stuff in the dashboard that you can really use to see how you're doing  To invoice to keep track of what's going on fresh books.com slash twig saved my life  Now let's save yours fresh books.com slash twig all I ask when they say how did you hear about us?  Just write in this week in google would you that way they they'll know you heard it on the show and we'll keep getting the ad revenue  Which is important?  Because all these donuts don't come cheap  Uh, we are talking with stacey higginbotham from stacey on iot  You might remember her from a giga home and in fact if you follow her on twitter, it's giga stacey s t a c e y  She's in austin, texas  Uh and from new york new york just off time square jeff jarvis. He's at the city university in new york you're doing uh,  What are you doing some sort of election thing at cuny on tuesday? Oh, yeah, I was gonna talk about that later, but we're doing uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  election land which is a joint venture of many folks including  Uh google, I believe facebook. Uh, if you just google election land  And I just screwed it up. Uh, it's a it's a pro publica effort and it's looking pro publica. I love it is great  Please give him a kiss for me  We're going to be the the headquarters at the cuny  graduate school journalism newsroom for this for this effort which will be looking at any efforts to  suppress voter  Oh efforts around the country whatever that whatever that means means, you know bad polling or or thugs showing up or whatever  It's a pro publica google news lab by nyc cuny first draft coalition, which was started by google  Univision usa today and others and so we'll have all the headquarters journalists here at cuny in the newsroom next tuesday  and  Uh, it'll it's all kitted out even google's helping us bring new networks that work better all kinds of great stuff  And we're broadcasting and then we'll get reports in well the social media desk our social media journalists will be looking at we'll be looking at  Trends that are out and finding out where there's where there seems to be reports of problems  We'll also get you know reports in we'll turn that back around to newsrooms around the country so they can report on it  And then i'm going to be doing um, I think i'm going to be doing i'm going to try to be doing  Uh facebook live on my mevo  Much of the day just me blathering they wanted me to do the official one  I said no, you don't want me to do that. That would be a bad you've been using that a lot though

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been watching your dot nyc and you have a new show  Well, we're trying some new experiments. Yeah, and uh, it's fun  You're really using facebook live to great advantage. We're trying it. We're trying we're trying things

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so we're trying to move so we're gonna have two two facebook live feeds  One is the official one where we'll they'll be saying what's going on  we're refining the trends and then i'll be blathering on about the election and showing off my pin and  You know, that's why they don't want me to be official and then we'll have a uplink to uh,  Any broadcasters we're coming in doing remotes from the newsroom and we have journalists and 60 journalism students and these news organizations  It's gonna be quite quite something  So if you want to if you see any problem with your election any problem at all  I'll tell you about one myself in a second  Uh, just uh google election land and you can go you can text election land  To six nine eight six six you can find that on that page or click a link there to submit a report  Now let me tell you that's a good thing to be doing  It's a very good thing to be doing and and we'll know what's really happening and and and no this is not about rigging the election folks  This is about voter suppression  What is pressure? So let me tell you my little oh go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was gonna ask how you guys were dealing with like no phones being allowed in polling places  or  No phones being allowed in the voting booth. I think you can I don't know but yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you can have them at bullet places. You know why they do that by the way. I found out this on this week in law  Because if you were going to buy someone's vote you would need proof that they voted and of course you can't follow them into the booth  so, uh  One way to do this would be to for you to snapchat or post an instagram a picture of your ballot  From the voting booth and so the reason they that's illegal in many states and the reason they don't want you to bring a cell phone  Is there is so that you can't use it to verify?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That you're which I understand. However, I think it's  Been antiquated because of the joy of voting and showing people who are voting. I think is I think is a better

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Result, I agree. I agree. I agree  And you know we did by the way and then i'll let you tell us your story  But we did a great triangulation on monday with two of the founders of verified voting.org  Which is about making elections. It is about rigging. It's about the making elections fair  uh using or not using technology  Using technology appropriately in elections  And it was really a great conversation with ron revest who was a legend in crypto circles  He's the creator of the rc cipher and rsa  and his his colleague  About uh, you know, which which county it's by the way very hard to rig an election in the u.s  Because every county has a different system which systems are used  But there are some troubling still these direct electronic voting systems are still used in three states and these are uh, kind of eminently hackable  Because they don't have a paper trail and so  Most areas now though have a form of paper trail auditing and one of the things we talked about stacy was  Vote star which is a proposed system  From your own register of voters in austin and it's not yet in place  It won't be for this election, but it probably will be in a few years  um a new way of voting  That is a a tamper-proof and reliable star vote. That's the name of it auditable  Uh snappy because one of the things one of the criteria is you you want the criteria is that you want the results in a timely fashion  Um, it's really great. Anyway, if you haven't listened to a triangulation, um from monday on our election, uh fraud  Issue, please do listen to that because it was really great. In fact, i'm very pleased that um,  one of the candidates in  california for um, uh, uh,  He was running for what was he running for I think assembly  Or maybe secretary of state ron nearing he came by he's he's a uh, republican but very tech savvy  Um asked me if we were going to cover these issues, you know safe voting electronic voting. I said yeah use it he's he's now  Passed that show around tweeted it and told people all about it because he like many of us is worried about  This kind of uh using of electronic means it aren't really very you know  The internet of things all over again, you don't want the internet of voting machines  bad idea  So you had a suppression experience

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mentioned one thing first quickly which is that uh, give a shout out to my friend to our friend craig newmark that we needed to feed these  Uh hungry journalists and and I went to craig and and asked for some support for the school to do this and craig stepped up  So the pizza's on craig craig's list. That's great. So yeah, so so  Because I never know my travel schedule number what's going to be i've been on absentee balance for years  Yeah, me too. Yeah, and I get the absentee balance  We have four of them in our house and the kids were home and they we all filled out our ballots  And then we all mailed them two of them came back to us  Why?  because on the back of the envelope  the  Voting commission, whatever it's called in my county puts on a sticker with the name and address of the voter  And a barcode so that they can verify this is from voter  Number, you know voter x and this is the only one we got from voter x and we're going to throw away that outside  Envelope now that we know voter x is voted so we can't vote again  But we're going to separate that from the inside envelope with a ballot, right? That's the system  So they need the voter's name and such on the outside and they need to have it barcoded so that they can handle it in mass  Well, guess what the usps bought new equipment  The new equipment couldn't tell the front for the back it read the barcode on the back and it sent it back to us  So that's imagine if you're it's really sad and imagine if you're a snowbird  Let's say that you have a an absentee ballot and you're down in florida  And you voted and you don't know it but you're going to get back  After the winter is over back to your home in new jersey and you're going to find your ballot there sent back to you. Wow  That wouldn't be so good. It's a real problem and it hasn't gotten much attention

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As long as it's not this one of the things as long as it's not  Completely widespread and it's not partisan, you know, like it's it's evenly distributed  Although I guess you could argue that people vote by mail might be more likely to be older republicans. I don't know exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're actually service mail voters are  Democratic more often really interesting  I think early voters were democratic early. Let me see if voters by mail. So here's something kind of cool

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been doing this on facebook new york times has a bot a politics bot that will message you  Did you have you seen this jeff?  I actually this is the first time I liked a bot  Really? So every morning i'd get a a message on my facebook messenger from the bot  And then you can enter it. I don't look embarrassed  Well, yeah, so it's so like in the bot is nick  He write he's an actual person today's big news the weirdness of 2016 in a nutshell fbi new emails  Then you can click tell me more it'll give you more you can ask it gives you some canned responses  How so will it and then?  After it runs out you can say give me a menu or thanks and it gives you a thumbs up  And i've actually this was one thing I kind of liked they've wound it up now  I think I got a survey asking if we would like more of these things  But here's one that just came in at 9 a.m  Oh my daily forecast and then i'll ask it for the latest polls and it gives me the polls  And uh, and so this is oops, I have to log in never mind. That's a long one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do me a favor and go to get purple.io  Is that another bot?  It's another bot and it comes from one of our entrepreneurial students and it's quite the hot pot  It's being talked about a lot in a lot of circles. So i'm not a huge fan of bots, but I have to say that one was pretty good

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this one is interactive election update. So this is one to sign up for before election day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or even now yes, and and and and it's it's intended for a millennial audience  but uh  It's conversational but she'll enter in as a human  too occasionally  And answer questions that aren't being answered and so on and rebecca harris is the name of the entrepreneur who was in our program  And it's it's getting quite the attention for her while i'm signing up right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You obviously don't want a lot of these uh, and I think it is kind of aimed at millennials, uh, because they  By the way, here's a new story. Did you see amazon has introduced a new book reading app for kids?  No, no, uh, oh, this is it. It's called rapids amazon rapids  And it's book reading via messenger. Do you have my over the shoulder shot there karsten? I don't know if you've got that  He says he sort of does let's just find it here it is so i'll launch it and so  Uh, oh it looks like a crash. So i'll reopen it short fun short stories for kids. Let's just do a sample story here  Gordon just got a strained text  And then you tap  Alien, where should we land? So earthlings don't see us gordon earthlings  And you tap yeah, we won't so this is a story book. Oh, it's cuter than I thought it was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought I thought that's using the text format. I thought it was gonna cut up war and peace in a tweet link

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, it's kids kids and young adult books  But oh, okay since they're comfortable with they say by the way get some reading right and reading a sentence at a time  It's not over the modern comic book. Yeah, and it's always it's always dialogue  Although I understand that there would be there could be other there could be pictures and videos and so forth  But it's it's a it's whenever there's a back and forth dialogue. It kind of makes sense to do this  I don't know. I kind of this is rapids. It just came out the i this is the free sample that they give you but you can also  buy  these short stories  If you're an amazon customer  Rapids three dollars a month. Oh, that's how it works. Okay, I didn't know that so you subscribe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's that's super fun. Remember when the japanese people there was that trend I think of  Novels via twitter like people were writing  So, yeah, I I think it'd be fun to have more storytelling options in playing around with this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So why not kids reading kids reading nothing wrong with it in a format that they're comfortable with  I the picture showed him a tablet which probably makes more sense than a little phone, but well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I mean because there's not a lot of like  If you look at kids books like my my daughter first saw a phone like a landline phone in a picture book  What's that mommy? What is that? So you think about it? It makes sense that you would have this kind of oh my god  Bringing transit bringing all that in

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're getting she's getting so old now. She's asking about phones and records and  Mommy, what was it like to walk inside a bank?  All right, you want a scary future story this we talked about this a little bit uh  on the twit so google has  an ai  That it's a neural network learning network  uh that has devised its own crypto algorithm  That no one knows how it works. There are  Three parties in this alice bob and eve  Each network was given a specific goal alice had to send a secure message to bob  Bob had to try and decrypt the message  And eve had to try an eavesdrop on the message and try to decrypt it, too  Alice and bob started with a shared secret key  They weren't told what encryption was or how to encrypt or what crypto techniques to use  They were just given a failure condition  And they did it  And they came up with a crypto algorithm that solved the problem  and  Researchers don't really know how they did it  So now they've got the bots talking to each other and we can't understand it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I think that that story is very scary just because of the picture they used in the head  I'm like jeered god

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, I think it's fascinating and i'm sure it's just you know, artificial intelligence research. That's the terminator surely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is the terminator. I did know the terminator. Okay, but  There's got to be a filter over it. The filter is extra scary. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, very clever. That's sebastian anthony writing in ars technica uk  So I think that's interesting, don't you?  Artificial intelligence used to create crypto algorithms  That even its creators don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Know how it works this this sounds scary and it may feel scary, but we've got to remember  Computers are not people and when we start thinking about ai we always anthropomorphize them and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We assume the worst

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we assume the worst but we also like why would we expect to understand computers talking to each other?  I don't understand my modem, which is computers talking to each other

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great point some some people do I just want to point out  Okay, you may not but that's ones and zeros sheldon does I understand what it's doing  It's demodulating and modulating ones and zeros and it can be but you couldn't speak its language, but we couldn't speak it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what i'm getting to like we understand  Like I understand what it means. I could create a device that would would understand you would okay  And so the point here that we should focus on is that we can't create a device or create a translation engine for it. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so we have no idea what it did  And maybe I you know, who knows maybe they do  We had jerry caplan and speaking of i'm gonna give another plug to triangulation the week before jerry caplan  You may remember from go he's been a serial entrepreneur created on sale a lot of great stuff has a good book on  Artificial intelligence and unlike many of the people we've talked about ai with he says yeah exactly what you say stacey  Why do we assume that it's going to be we're anthropomorphizing it? These are just dumb machines. It's not  As smart as they get they're never going to be more than servants. It's not a problem  He doesn't believe in the singularity in other words

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man, uh masa  I can't think of his first name. Is it masa the chairman of soft bank gave this whole present? Yeah masa yoshi son  Yeah, masa yoshi son  uh  He gave this whole presentation at arm tech con all about the singularity coming and there being a trillion connected devices and  Wa I was kind of like it's easy to say  It's hard to do  Yeah, I mean just connecting, you know a hundred devices in my home. There's i'm not closer to the singularity at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, in fact, everybody uses technology. He knows we're not even there's so long  Google pixel i've been playing with it and I told jeff last week not to buy one. Maybe I shouldn't say that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Oh, I go again. So I still home and I haven't opened it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I just don't know, uh, you're lucky you've got one google apparently is missing the  Ship date for a lot of people  Uh, and they're sending 50 play credits to pixel buyers with missed delivery windows. I ordered a the small one  the pixel five inch pixel, uh with 128 gigs in uh, extra black or whatever they call it and um  They just debited my credit card and it's now moved from what is it processing to  And you know, they have these code words it's I think that's where my google home is. Yeah mine too  Supposed to come next week right after the election

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exciting i'll be in california. I won't even get to open it. I installed a plug socket just for the google

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, yeah, I know where where are you putting it? It's going to be in my closet

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, what what

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why do you want it in your closet? It's the only room in the house that doesn't have an amazon echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're gonna just have to move one of the echoes. Come on. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I spent a lot of time in the closet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, go ahead you can talk about it it's all right, you know, you're among friends, um, mine mine is actually going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm putting mine in the bathroom. So it's no it's a little stranger. Our closet is off the bathroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's kind of closet bathroom  I don't have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I thought you're gonna say you don't have a lot of square footage

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought he's gonna say I don't have a bathroom. That's what's really confusing. Um, no, uh  Because uh, I think that I will use the google home in the morning  Right as i'm dressing as i'm getting ready for work that kind of thing  So it will be somewhere where I can talk to it, uh from during my morning ablutions  Um, and because I think that's how i use it  Although it has apparently good speakers, uh that that are better than the echoes speakers

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can play music while you're in the shower that's we actually have a sonos speakers installed in our bathroom for that very reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a sonos play five in my bathroom  Hey, have you yet received the update so that you can use your amazon echo to get your sonos doing stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but even if I had I I haven't been home  Um, apparently not  I know so i'm like  I have a box full of gadgets. I've got two two new routers and some other stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody said I should rename it the google throne

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The air freshener add-on it does look a little like a new air freshener. I I have to admit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh google says adoption of the pixel is surpassing the nexus 6p or did in its first week  But the problem is they can't make them fast enough  Actually, this is from app boy, which actually has pretty good data. Google's not saying but app boy looks at  Which devices are downloading apps and so forth pixel has reached 0.016 percent of market share pixel xl  0.02 percent of market share  In one week took the 6p two weeks to get to a similar level  Google all right, but google still is you know, not in the  Phone stores, which I think is going to hurt it only verizon has the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  pixel yeah, but teemo has this deal where if you bring your  Your pixel into them they give you like half off. Yeah, but only on the 32 gig model which baffles me  That's weird. I don't that you'll use more data  exactly  Bingo  You can't store anything on this device. So you gotta use data

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, leo, so i've got to make the decision finally

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you saw the uh, the the one picture  that convinced  one tech editor  Yeah, the pixel was  The right phone was better than the better than the iphone  I took a photo with the pixel says  Uh vlads of all of the verge that changed my mind about the iphone, but you know, I think this is extremely  Not useful because I think you could take any camera phone even kind of a crappy one and in exactly the right circumstances  Get a great picture. This is just down the street from you  A rainy night in new york is always beautiful. Yeah, but it's you know, it's dark  um  Sometimes some people say that the iphone over does the grain in dark. I don't know  so  It is it is truly an excellent camera I will I will grant you that  Um, I I like the form factor. I think uh, it doesn't bother me. It's not waterproof. Although that bothers some people  um  If you're going to use an android phone, I think this is the best android phone so  But you already have a 6p, which is the next best  You're not helping leo. I know  I want you to do i'm not i'm not upgrading you're not  No, you're gonna stay with a 6p

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, i've got the 5x which is even worse phone than i know and i'm still not upgrading. Why not?  uh  Too much money. It's very expensive. It's it's expensive. I've got to buy an iphone to work my gadget magic

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So isn't that interesting? So a lot of the stuff that you're playing with can't be done on android

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's almost always the case like once apple bought test flight, you know all android users were screwed  Wow

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Test flight is not nearly as good as such solution for developers as android is test flight allows you to  Give beta versions of your program to users with that, you know kind of bypassing the app store  But it was so easy to do an apk on android that uh, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need test flights on an android, but if you've got if you've got a shortage of time and energy  You're going to develop for the iphone first. I guess you're right still  Especially for these products. They're expensive early adopter products

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and iphone people are early adopters who buy expensive products

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wouldn't say they're early adopters. I mean, I guess you're right  I feel like I feel like android people are probably more early adopters on most things but  Someone's got an iphone in the house. Yeah  And it's easier. You don't have to have like 58 apps. You have your iphone app

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what would really put me? Uh, I think over the top on the pixel and make it my daily driver  Okay  Uh is if they would just freaking get your messaging story straight  I don't know what to use for messaging. They want me to use google's messages, which is terrible  I like hangouts, but if alo would just become the why is alo not yet the default?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Messaging app on the pixel now. There's a new version. Is it is it 2.0? I haven't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who's using that I couldn't find kevin tofu the other day for the podcast I had to find it  So we do skype so i'm like paying him on skype then i'm like well  I found him on alo  And then i'm like paying him on hangouts it was just ridiculous i'm sending this message to kevin  Like six different times we just have a time so because you don't know which messaging client he uses

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can use facebook messenger. I bet facebook messenger would be my  But I don't really want to use facebook for all my sms's either. Oh, I didn't even think about facebook. Yeah  You know what facebook by the way is the lingua franca for most of most of us if you can you can always reach  Through facebook almost always you can never reach me through facebook. I know because you don't use it. You're the one person  I know facebook announced by the way their earnings, uh right before the show  And they beat the street in almost every respect  1.67 billion monthly active users

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

All right, we could talk about tango and daydream  Both emerging for the first time into the wild but first a word  From our favorite registrar of all time hover.com. I'm so glad to welcome him back  We use hover like crazy whether they were a sponsor or not. I'm all in on hover  In fact, steve gibson who was looking to move his domains?  And he asked on twitter. What should I get and the consensus was hover and he's very happy you will be happy to  Domain extensions, of course.com. Net but all sorts of fun niche extensions  like dot design  Dot tech I have i've registered a ton of domains at hover  For all sorts of silly purposes partly because it's it's so easy to do. I am a huge fan  Of hover.com. I have let's see. I registered you might like this stacey. In fact, i'll give it to you if you want  giggle ohm

Transcript:  What can I say picture ohm giggling i've known that man for eight years. He seems like he would giggle  He doesn't he's not i would say he's not a giggler. Yeah god. I would think he's a giggler

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I have twit dot agency twit dot careers twit dot company twit dot equipment twit dot expert  Twit dot tv, of course twit dot watch twit live.com twit live tv twit questions.com  It's so easy to register a domain name and it's so affordable at hover and what's great about hover  You don't have to if you've ever used some of those other guys  You you think you've registered the domain and then there's page after page of check boxes  Do you want this do you want that do you want this do you want that never with hover?  For instance, you know, you want who is privacy, right?  So people can't look up your phone number on on the net because who is is a public database  hover gives that to you free and automatically as part of your domain registration  hover doesn't do a lot of extra stuff. They only offer domains  And email so you focus and get in the domain name you want and then get back to work  Unlike most other domain providers. They do include who is privacy  With all supported domains so your information is confidential  And if you already have a bunch of domains as I did scattered over a bunch of different providers save money by bringing them all  To hover with volume discounts the more domains in your account the more of a discount you get automatically  No more digging through help articles to find out how to get your domain name working either  And if you ever have a problem hover's famous  no hold  humans  Online tech support. It's awesome  They will help you and they will not put you on hold and they will not hang up till your job is done until they've solved  But look if look at all the website builders portfolio tools personal homepages that support hover everything from weebly and and wordpress to tumblr to facebook  google plus  flickr  twitter  It makes it very easy for you to do the integration you want  hover dot com  I'm a big fan. It's who I use to register my domain names and I highly recommend it  It's who steve uses and now you get 10 off your first purchase if you go to hover  H-o-v-e-r dot com  And use the promo code twig hover.com promo code twig to get 10 off  Your brand new domain names. I have I just looked 54 domain names at hover  I use them for my email too  Which is really nice. I mean the email gets forwarded to gmail. This is by the way a really great tip  And I I don't know why everybody doesn't do this  If you know you may move email providers from time to time  Maybe you use your isp now you want to use google?  Maybe you were on yahoo mail and you want to get off you don't want to tell  Everybody oh, I got a new email and constantly do that  simple  Simple go to hover.com  And get a domain name like your family name I have leo laporte.com  And then that's going to be your email address  And then you have you work with hover and they will forward any number of addresses to wherever you want  I have it forwarded to to gmail. It couldn't be easier  Very good use for domain name. It doesn't have to just be for a web page  Hover.com use the offer code twig and save  10 percent  Uh apparently there is an animation  Oh, that's right bleak. You did that for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're getting a home though. I am getting home. Yeah, it's on the way  Um, so if this and that actually changed today  They took all of their recipes down. They're no longer recipes. They're now applets  They're controlled by the people who the they call them the service providers. So the people who make the apps

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this is what the pin board guy was getting upset about. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I guess this is this is what's happening now is this is the new if this and that so all of your old recipes  So if you're like me and you had a bunch of recipes, they're all now applets and they still exist. Okay  You're going right now only service providers can create  Applets so no more can I give you a recipe of the day that you create? Oh  So now only people who control the channel get to do it eventually they're going to open up so it's going to be plug and play

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know what? They probably decided people don't want to go to the effort of making a whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Recipe a lot of people didn't I mean to be fair to be totally honest, you know making a recipe requires you to know  in advance

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

You see you have to do all of this, you know stuff  But this is then thatting. Yeah, but it's great and I use it all the time, but I bet it doesn't have the  Home automation stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So on the home automation side and actually microsoft just announced flows  Um, and i'm not i haven't played with that flow. Sorry flow. I haven't seen that yet  But on the home automation side for ios users, there's an app called stringify that you can use  It doesn't have all of the things that if this than that had though, so it's pretty limited

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's going to happen to my recipes? I'm logging in they have they have now turned into applets, but they're not changed or turned off  They're not changed. They're fine, but I can't make a new recipe by hand

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but they're going to open up a maker tier  Eventually  So if you want to be on the maker tier, I don't know how that happens  Maybe if you have a lot of recipes that you've made  Then eventually you will have that power again  But you can browse. I mean there's there's lots of lovely recipes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm bringing the recipe to you. I bet you what they found out was that's what people do  Yeah, right is that they they just click on other people's recipes  So they have a bunch of collections applets we love 15 applets for outer space  I used to have an applet that would tell me whenever the international space station went overhead  But the problem is it does that 20 times a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is why there's probably a ceiling on my show your show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, oh well, we know there's a ceiling we reached it  there's about a quarter of a million people who will listen to this kind of programming and  maybe that that number will go up over time it does kind of every year five or ten percent increase, but  We have a total unique audience of somewhere over five million  And I figure that's probably everybody  That's all the case you can find everybody  There's a lot more scrape the bottom of the geek barrel  I I gave a presentation to tech tv when they were really kind of going downhill and going more mainstream saying  You know, there's what was it? I can't remember now. There's 41 billion 41 million programmers in the united states  If you made a channel that they loved you wouldn't have to worry  But they didn't I guess, you know, it's too fragmented a crowd or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or sorry click on automatic  They're a sponsor of this fine. They're a sponsor of the show. Yeah automatic my applets  Oh, I see. So that was organized by provider  Post trip info to evernote and then here's some more  But I can't I can't just create one anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, if you wanted to connect your automatic to something that no one has ever thought was reasonable, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Terrible terrible. I don't like it  Zapier we use it. We use it here right karstens screaming in pain. We use it here all the time  Why is karsten screaming in pain because we use it all the time for all sorts of things for instance  uh when I  I wonder if that's going to break my pin board. Um  recipe  I think I use zappier. I don't know. I think I did so you're safe  So one of the things that we do for this show and all the shows that karsten produces that I host  Is I use pin board as a bookmarking tool. So whenever i'm surfing the web if I see something I want I click my pb  Button and it will automatically open up a little pin board  Window which I can then put some tags into usually twig  The week number this is week five seven eight  And all that and then what it was doing it was just going to pin board  Which is a delit was a delicious clone that came along when yahoo destroyed delicious  Um, but karsten said boy it'd be a lot easier if you took your pin board  Feed and put it in a google sheet for me  And he sent me a template for what he wanted and it was very easy to do but I did it with zappier karsten. I think  So it won't it won't impact. Is that how you put things on the rundown?  Yeah, so it's easier for he still builds the rundown but now he can do it from a google sheet to a google sheet  So he just copies the line and I put the line in the format and paste it in so it's much easier for him  And I don't know, you know, we've been doing this workflow for 10 years. Yeah, karsten's the first guy who said, you know  If you just put in a sheet, it would be a lot easier for me  So anything I paste anything I bookmark on pin board now goes to a google  Uh sheet on google drag fact I can show you probably you also label it per show as you yeah  It's a tag the tats of the tags are four. So it's leo's links. So this will give you this is what it looks like  Um, it's the date. I pinned it the headline the actual link and then the various tag numbers on it  And uh, he uses the tags  You probably don't use it all that much but when i tag twig that means that this would be something that'd be good for twig  And you can see i've been doing it. Uh  Oh, oh, I should start a september tab. I mean an october tab  It's november. You don't really care. Yeah, I had a september tab and I never meant  I was gonna break it up because they're gonna get longer and longer. Do you delete them as you go?  Okay, so but see this is automated from zappier  Yeah, by the way, I don't know where we're gonna use this article but I think i'm gonna use it right now  Uh, I bookmarked it and I think we should this is this is the  started a fire this is the um, this is the uh, uh, uh, uh, unknown danger

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Profit income is net income is profit. It's it's the most as opposed to operating income operating  Is that just I think operating is just minus your cost of goods like it's it doesn't take into account

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know about stock. Hey 5 billion in profit. Nothing to sneeze at for three months  I'd take it i'd take it  Now let's see here's the other bets  197 million in revenue  For an operating loss of wow 865 million dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's less it used to be 900 and something 980. It was 980 last year

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For this quarter last year, but that's a lot to lose almost a billion dollars a quarter  Those are bets. That's big bets

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But wait youtube did you see the youtube numbers and they're not real  There's an analyst who is saying that youtube was making 10 billion dollars for google. So they don't break google doesn't break that out  It does not but maybe it should that feels pretty material

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, uh as somebody who's effective tax rate  Um edges personally close to 50 percent because i'm in a high tax state  Google's effective tax rate is remember mine mine 50 like half  google's effective tax rate 16 percent this year  And if I could do the irish run around in the dutch sandwich, you better believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every percent counts every percent counts

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, it's getting better they lose money the the big bets lose money, but it's getting better  Oh, I love this story. Uh, but that's because i'm an old hippie and I don't and this might be another one for snopes  Because I got this message  saying  We should all check in  to the standing rock indian reservation  because  Someone had heard that the law enforcement this is where of course the  The sit-in is going on in the protest of the north dakota oil pipeline the dakota access pipeline  Somebody said that the law enforcement agents were checking  uh facebook  Check-ins to see who was in the sit-in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So ours technica wrote there is no way your facebook check-in is confusing north dakota cops

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was my reaction as well, however  One and a half million people checked in on facebook in standing rock, north dakota

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, it's not hard to express solidarity with something that you think is not great with a click

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't gotta go anywhere. I don't gotta sit. I can eat. I don't have to worry. Nobody's gonna arrest me  That's the low point in participatory democracy right there. There are 140 roughly 140 protesters, but they're one and a half million check-ins  Yeah, yeah, it is kind of kind of that but I but it shows again this is  You weren't here last week where we showed how that simple register to vote announcement on facebook  created massive spikes  In voter registration like an order of four or five six times  Higher voter registration. It's just this is kind of all about an ongoing segment on this show  Wow, facebook is big

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know what what?  Well, I was so this is so frustrating to me because one people will feel like they're being activists  With their clicks. Yeah, and they're really doing anything. Yeah. Well not just that but  facebook controls  what people see not just with algorithms, but their ability to censor their platform because it  It's their platform. I'm not arguing with their ability to do so but we can't feel like what if facebook suddenly decides it really supports  This particular pipeline, um, which I doubt but  it's just  We're not doing anything and we're feeling like we're we're putting all our agency in something that ultimately doesn't deserve it  Sorry. Yeah, stacy cranky, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like a vote  Uh, it's like a way of standing up. I mean I I understand and you should also  donate and spend time and participate physically  look at jeff he went and canvassed in the  Pennsylvania I mean  Yep, that that there's nothing there's no substitute for that  But there's also room if you're doing that to also show how you feel about something to take a stand to change your  You know facebook or your twitter avatar to  you know  a logo or a  Country's flag. I don't I'm not against that unless it's the only thing you do and then you go see I do care

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's less that it's not actually  It's not actually that it's more that facebook or twitter or anyone can decide  To stop showing that at any point in time if they have it, but they don't  They have in other cases think about like breastfeeding moms getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they got a lot of heat and they changed that  Finally, I think they're smart enough now to understand that they should be careful about that kind of thing  I know they're still doing it. They took down the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Famous vietnam girl napalm picture. Yes, they did. I was just thinking I was like

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then they changed their policy but again, but that's facebook. Isn't it? They do it then apologize later  but I I think they also understand and they're increasingly understanding that  Any small thing they do has a huge impact and so they've got to be very very very careful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of like seeing the erosion of white privilege in real time  If you think about like the decisions they make and you're like, oh boom or not white privilege male privilege just privilege

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Privilege because because they could be oh, yeah, right, but it privilege privilege is privilege  um  Vine shutting down twitter's cutting nine percent of its workforce. Some of that will be the people who do vine  the vine  I love this mike article. We talked about it on sunday  Inside the meeting the change the fate of vine forever apparently 20 of the top creators of vine gathered according to mike  Mic the mike network  Was it last year the year before  Saying we're losing viewers vine. You're not making the changes the platform you need to make so here's the deal  If you pay us 1.2 million dollars each  Make some product changes  Open up a more direct line of communication to us.

Transcript:  No, I mean either no, but I like a suit tux. It's good looking guy. Apparently all their stuff disappear

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh will eventually they can copy it off. Yeah  No place to put it the creator of vine  Uh who sold it to twitter for I think 30 million dollars  tweeted  Simple tweet four words  Don't sell your company  Is he going to give the money back? I don't think so  Can you buy it back for a dollar? Maybe they've actually created a new app. Did you I actually tried it out?  Before the show that's why I was retying my bowtie. It's called hype just came out today on ios  As far as I can tell it's periscope or meerkat. It's a live  Streaming platform, I guess to maybe they're hoping that the the vine stars will come back  But this is so different from what vine was vine was heavily edited six second  Videos, this is live streaming very disappointed to see that. I my bow tying did not get into the popular today section  Uh vine is a little more. Um, I mean, uh hype is a little more  Different than periscope because you see your circle  And these sparkles are like thumbs up or hearts and you can see I don't know what those images are  You could put images in video. You can actually produce it a little bit more  Uh, and then there's uh comments. This is a uh  a vine replay  I don't know how to get out of it because  I'm because ios has no controls  Has no controls  Wow, look at all these people tony tommyhawk howie easy kourtney courier, they all got more hits than I did  And I guess nobody wanted to know how to tie a bowtie  Oh, there's cally lewis  She's using hype h y  pe  It's kind of snapchat right? I mean it does feel snapchat. Yeah  It's snapchat meets periscope maybe  So what is happening here maybe there's audio she's got a lot of people watching  Yeah, she's talking and showing up close up of popcorn  Oh, there you go. Oh, she's learning how to use it is what it is  So that's as like as with a lot of us this is you know, we're just using it for the first time  It's ios only no android. It's not a  It's ios only no android well  Remember old vine it took a long time to get vine on android. It wasn't on it. It did it's right. Yeah

Transcript:  Once again early adopters. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh family is suing amazon because their hoverboard destroyed their entire house  Oh, this is bad. The hoverboard was sold. That's a bad fire  Hoverboard was sold on amazon  not by amazon  but uh  the  Owners in nashville contend that amazon and its various subsidiaries had information about the dangerousness of the product well in advance of the january 9th fire

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a man of amazon is liable for everything that it's sold in its marketplace. E

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  No one was hurt although it sounds like it was close six members of the family  The father rescued two of his children from the second floor of the burning home  Dear god, uh, yeah, no kidding  um  The lawsuit says the seller of the hoverboard listed online w deals is a sham organization  Registered to an apartment in new york city  They haven't responded to uh the lawsuit  so  Um, it alleges the suit alleges a family was sold a counterfeit product from china not a brand  With a samsung lithium ion battery as listed on amazon, although these days that wouldn't necessarily be any insurance of safety  a text it sounds like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead  This sounds like they're suing amazon because they can't sue anybody else precisely

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are actually 10 defendants including amazon and retailers, but you know, you you sue whoever has the  Uh deep pockets tennessee product liability law holds a seller responsible if the manufacturer can't be found  And they they have not been able to get the manufacturer as with I would guess many hoverboards  You know  And by the way, this underscores something that amazon does. I don't know if people know this  You do if you spend enough time on amazon, so we we order everything on amazon and  If you're not like paying attention  like  We get we get like we ordered some lemon pledge and we got like a like a hand wrapped  box of loose lemon pledge bottles in the mail from las vegas it wasn't  Because even though it was on amazon  There's all sorts of levels. There's lots of people who use amazon for fulfillment lots of people who use amazon to sell but fulfill it themselves  When you're buying on amazon you're buying you could be buying from a lot of different places that you don't even know about  And amazon themselves do some very odd things. I have a good friend  Who sells a product on amazon?  It's a water ionizer. He has the made in china puts his companies  During the manufacturing process company name on it the name whatever brand name they made up  He buys advertisements for it and it's on amazon for sale on amazon, but amazon is algorithmic  So all of a sudden his sales like in one day went to nothing  And he looked on amazon did a search for his company's name and the product and amazon was selling it his product with his brand name on it  Less than he was selling it for they had determined algorithmically  They could and it just happened so he played a game with him  He lowered his price and then the amazon price went through the roof because they figured well  I can't match this price  We'll just see if we can get somebody and sell them to it for a lot and this is all done  I'm sure not by a human but completely algorithmically  So amazon is a very you're not often you're not buying from amazon. Sometimes you're not even fulfilled by amazon  It's completely a third party  Often I think  And I have some evidence for this because we've bought some expensive stuff  It's just some guy who's reselling using amazon as a conduit. He never has the merchandise  He just routes it through right?  And I think that's what happened with this hoverboard. It was just an apartment. He wasn't he never had any merchandise to sell  So be I think you got to be careful and this is this gets down to bag buying batteries and  Apple report cables apple reported like 90 percent of all the  Lightning cables sold on amazon were fraudulent  Were fake were bad cables even though they had the made for iphone logo on it  And they're suing because they're probably suing amazon as well as whoever's doing this  Because amazon doesn't do any oversight at all you put you can make anything you want to listen  You can make anything you want to listen. It's like buying  On ebay, even though you don't is it a seller marketplace? Yeah  So the key is  buy stuff that's sold by amazon  Fulfilled by amazon, right?  I think a lot of people get burned by that some some as you can see literally

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have to ask because hoverboards were last year's hot christmas gift  Yeah  What is I I don't feel like we've seen something or did I miss it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, we saw a few things  Of course everything everything goes through here. What is that robot that uh,  Uh megan had anybody remember there's a cosmo or osmo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The o-mate maybe the one that talks to the echo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe that was it  It plays games it has it's done it was designed by  Some folks who used to work  at um  Pixar so it has a lot. Yeah, maybe it is the o-mate

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, are you talking about the toy talk stuff? No toy talks very cool, too. I like that. We've interviewed those guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see if these guys yeah, may is this the o-mate? Uh, no, this isn't it. Although this is kind of cool, too  It was cosmo

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cosmo anki's robot. Oh, it's funky. That's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, now this I don't know, you know if this will be the toy of the holiday  But we played with it. It was really super cool. The only negative is it's kind of pricey. It's like 150 bucks 160 bucks  but kind of like the little  BB-8 wasn't bb-8 was very expensive. That was the toy last year, right?  I  This thing look at this look at its face. It has a lot of character  Makes sounds and stuff if it really you feel like it's kind of looking at you and it recognizes you it has a camera on it  And it oh my gosh, how fun? Yeah, sorry. See see. Oh that is neat 179.99  How neat now how now how much would you pay?  But anki did those that great racetrack which I have because I gave it to my son for christmas and he never wanted it  um  So maybe you can buy my daughter's stuff for christmas. Yeah, maybe i'll send you my anki racetrack. That's actually pretty cool  Um, so this is like bb-8 only a little bit smarter. I like they have a girl playing with technology. Yeah, exactly  And it has one additional feature, which I like it has an sdk and you can write software for it in python  So that's kind of interesting right so it starts is just kind of a plug and play consumer thing  But it can get a little bit more sophisticated  So there's my vote for at least one of the hot toys of the year  All right  It's too expensive though to really be a  Huge one, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a hunter boat was expensive. I i'm just thinking like a hot tech hot tech kind of thing. That's the hot tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right there robots the cosmos robots or a tesla glass roof

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So have you ordered yours already leo can't order it can you if I if I did I could we already have solar city panels  I'm a little disappointed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, see, this is what happens when you're an early doctor

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My tesla is also off obsolete because two weeks ago or last week elon announced that all the new teslas have 18 cameras and  Two hickeys and they'll be self-driving and I mine doesn't have any of that stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the what do you think about  Him decreeing that you can't make money with his self-driving car

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's eon in a nutshell. That's yeah it is but it's really a troubling

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is the end of the ownership like kind of yeah concept but we've already been there  I mean remember when amazon and the kindle and blah blah blah. I know same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But jesus you spend a fortune and you can't use it as you wish to do what you wish in life. It's that's just  Eee

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are still other alternatives

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is uh, let me just show you the new model s because of course you have to pay for the enhanced auto pilot  Which is going to add a little bit. Um,  Six thousand dollars extra six thousand. Oh, and did you want full self-driving capability? Well, let me check that box that adds  four thousand dollars, okay, so  What does self-driving doubles the numbers of active cameras from four to eight enable full self-driving?  I only have I think one camera on mine. You only have one on yours as well. I should say stacey  Please note self-driving functionality is dependent upon extensive software validation and regulatory approval which may vary widely by jurisdiction. In other words  You may never get it  It's not possible to know exactly when each element of the functionality described above will be available  As this is highly dependent on local regulatory approval. So this is very typical of elon, which is you know,  He's selling the sci-fi he's selling the dream not the reality but here's the part you're talking about jeff, please note  Also that using a self-driving tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine  But doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the tesla network details of which will be released next week

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's restraint of trade. It's something wrong

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it illegal though probably not  You can you can say when you sell something it can only be used this way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, wait, no, we just there was just a legal decision that I think affects this. Oh  You can now hack your car. Oh, yeah, that's the librarian of congress. Okay, so that's an interesting case which

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as of the 1st of november  And this is a two-year trial  You can hack your car or your device and this all comes from  Uh, the you know the dmca which makes it illegal to reverse engineer  Protected software which allows things like john deere to say  You can't maintain your own tractor because we don't want anybody to steal the code in our tractors  And so the copyright office  Which rules on these kinds of things the library of congress runs the copyright office last year  a full year ago  said  We're going to allow for the repair of digital repair of vehicles  We're going to allow for circumventing protections on copyrighted systems  For consumer devices next year and it just went into effect  for a two-year period  The security exemption for researchers  Only applies to good faith testing in a controlled environment designed to avoid any harm to individuals or the public  We're not talking about testing your neighbor's pacemaker while it's implanted  We're talking about a controlled lab in a device owned by a researcher  but  It for researchers. This is huge remember ed felton in going back to voting princeton professor  Who was able to show that the d bold voting machines were eminently hackable?  D bold sued him saying it's a violation of our copyright  You can't do this kind of research  So this is uh, this is very important and very good news and I hope that it gets extended  Sony sued george hotz remember  For hacking a sony playstation

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that gives you the right to modify does it does that not mean you have the right to use as you wish  To modify the use

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think this applies to this. I think uh  I just find it offensive  You know when you buy a computer you can't use it to make it, you know  Most of the terms of agreement say you can't use it to make nuclear weapons  Well, this is not making a living but i'm just saying this is a long-standing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, but no really really  So so you buy a pair of scissors and you're told you can only use this  Uh to cut, uh your kids, uh  Costumes you can't use this to start a tailor business  Give me any analogy where you will buy something and you are told you cannot use it  To your own end

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you can't use your apple computer to make nuclear weapons well, okay, but that's that's a security

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Issue as opposed to a that's not that's not oh, oh, oh, yes, you can you can use any competitive  Yeah, you can use these scissors to cut clothes, but only if you sell them through ramazon  Only if you if you uh buy the fabric from me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that mean we have to talk about oracle and google and yeah, and it's uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, it goes to the u.s court of appeals for the federal circuit. So it goes up to the circuit court  Uh, and then after that would be the supreme court

Transcript:  My tip of the week is very simple for years. We've told you you need to get a password manager  It's really a key to security and everybody says so is having good long strong passwords  Problem is the best passwords are the hardest to remember so a password vault is great  You keep all your passwords in there. You let it generate new ones for you  You remember but one password the password that unlocks your vault the one we use and steve gibson's vetted  We've talked to joe segrist the creator of  On our shows, uh and really believe in and recommend and even use business wide we use the enterprise version is last pass  Very good news today last pass has gone free for one of its key premium features  They still have a dollar a month premium subscription, which i'm going to continue  But in the past if you wanted last pass to work on your phone as well as your desktop you had to pay  That is now part of the free last pass  So there are really for most people the free last pass is everything you need  It does everything you want. Um, and it is a must have you get  Cross-platform access which is now free  You can save passwords. It'll fill passwords in on android. It does a beautiful job works on ios somewhat  Generates passwords works in all browsers very nicely secure notes. You can share passwords in notes  Which I do with of course with my family  Which is very handy  It supports two-factor  And then there's a few extra things including family sharing and additional two-factor  Options if you pay the dollar a month, I pay the dollar a month just because I want to keep them around  And we also have the enterprise edition everybody in the company has access to that  And we've give free last pass to everybody in the company

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because do you have does it offer this is a it's kind of a weird use case, but I have  My passwords, but then I also have our thing passwords for like the apps that my husband wants to know too  Is there a way to bifurcate that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can be like each of you should have an account and you can share  The passwords that you both need  Okay  That's what we do. We have exactly that situation where I don't he does  Lisa doesn't need all my passwords, but she needs passwords to some of the critical stuff like, you know  Internet of things devices stuff like that. So I just share those with her  Okay, and yes, that's built in and that's part of the free service the family sharing is for up to five users  So if you want to share to a more than just your husband

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But your daughter's too young to give any passwords to it. Oh, I have not given her any more control than what she has already
