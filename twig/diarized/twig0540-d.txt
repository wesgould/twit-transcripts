Transcript:  Hey everybody.  Happy holidays.  Leo Laporte here with the last This Week in Google of 2019.  And as we do traditionally, we've decided to take some of the best moments from  2019 and put it into a year and best of that's what's next.  Podcasts you love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From people you trust.  This is Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is Twig.  This Week in Google episode 540 for December 25th, 2019.  The year's best.  As I say at the beginning of every show, This Week in Google isn't just about  Google, it's really about the Google verse, which includes Facebook and Twitter,  online journalism, blogging, everything online.  Of course there's a lot of Google in it, but sometimes there's some Facebook in it too.  And actually, frankly, Facebook often makes some of the best and most interesting  conversations on This Week in Google, going way back to January when we talked  about Facebook's 10 year photo challenge, which by the way, resurfaced every few,  every few months on Facebook all through the year 2019.  Is it a threat or just something fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to use this as my number.  I was going to use this one.  I was going to put it up here.  Oh yeah, I got something to say about this one.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That woman's thinking is exactly how I think about everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're going to read Surveillance Capitalism, Stacey.  It's a great book, 625 pages, but read it and then we'll debate it.  And you haven't read it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can we talk about that story?  Can we talk about that story?  Let's do the 10 year meme.  So this is the Facebook 10 year challenge.  This is complete and utter bull.  It is moral panic.  Great example.  Oh yeah.  Great example.  If you use social.  Wait, moral panic or tech panic?  I'm going to give you some pack, some moral panic.  I'm going to give you some facts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let me give you, let me give you the story first.  Kate O'Neill writing in a Wired.  If you use social media, you've probably noticed a trend across Facebook,  Instagram, and Twitter of people posting their then and now profile pictures,  mostly from 10 years ago.  And this year, she said, I put out a flippant tweet, me 10 years ago, probably  would have played along with the profile picture aging meme going around.  Me now ponders how all this data can be mined to train facial recognition  algorithms on age progression and age recognition.  I agree with her.  That's exactly what this is all about.  You disagree, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So yes, let me, so I went through this today.  So, so number one, this is absurd because two years ago, Google  showed that they can, they can, they can compare the same person in  photos from infancy to current.  There's, there's, it's been done.  Number two, this would be a really crappy data set.  Uh, Facebook also has data of people who are identified from ages to ages.  This is pure paranoia.  So, so I went in and I had the conversation with her and her  editor, Nick Thompson on, on Twitter.  And, um, and I said those things and I said, this is, this is kind of ridiculous.  Uh, Nick came back and said, oh, so then, then the response was, well,  is Facebook is doing this for money?  Well, Facebook, by the way, says we didn't come up with this.  Right.  And so it's, it's, it's, it's yeah.  This is moral panic.  This is an example of the kind of paranoia that is now bred.  A simple little thing comes up.  People have pictures from 10 years.  This is cute.  This is fine.  Right.  Few years ago, we all would have joined in and said, fine.  So now there's this presumption of some horrible motive and  some horrible conspiracy.  It's a conspiracy theorizing.  It is moral panic.  That's trying to blame everything and find a noxious, uh, motive for  everything that anyone sees on technology.  And this is the danger, my friends.  The danger is this kind of crap.  This kind of fake news will lead to regulation of the internet for us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Holy cow.  You could not be more wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had a fit.  Well, Stacy, the story is just wrong.  The story is just wrong on every count.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Her, her thinking, her thinking on this topic is what I am identifying with.  Not the entire story, but I would say this is actually a positive.  This is where we want to get people when they are about to use technology to ask  themselves, is it worth the exchange of data that I'm about?  What is going to come of this?  I think that is actually so smart.  It's like, tell me the harm.  It's like, hold on.  It is like teaching people about interest rates, which have a purpose, but  also can cause people harm.  I'm not saying usury.  I'm just saying interest rates and associated with credit cards.  Right?  Now, the other part of this is she's not saying it's evil or there's harm.  She's just wondering if it's going to be, you know, used for image progression.  And Google has shown that they can do this.  Facebook might need that data.  Another company that puts these out might need that data.  And this sort of data has been collected in the past through fun,  cutesy apps and used for exactly that purpose.  So it has a basis in fact, to wonder about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, so her boss, who I like a lot, Nick Thompson.  I'm trying to find the tweet right now.  This is what I object.  This is what got me going.  Okay.  What?  Yeah.  Cause you are really upset.  I'm very, I was very upset about this because it, because it is dangerous.  And I want to, I want to read his tweet.  And again, I have immense respect for Nick.  He's an excellent editor.  Wired under him.  Wired has been just great.  Uh, and he came back and we had it, there was an exchange and he came back and said,  what I said was fair.  Now I'm trying to find it because I'm between too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course, this is relatively benign, but I don't think it's a bad thing to alert  people to the fact that this kind of data is something these companies want.  And, and you should be aware that you might be giving them this kind of information.  Might, might, might.  People are not aware.  I just want to give you one more data point, which is a study that just came out  from the Pew research center, three quarters of Facebook users, 74% in their  survey did not know the social networking behemoth, according to tech  crunch maintains a list of their interests and traits to target with them.  With ads, 74% of the Facebook users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do they know that the New York times does that wire does that and timing does  that?  They don't think Facebook does it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They certainly don't think anybody else does it.  And they only discovered this when researchers directed them to view their  Facebook ad preferences page, a majority, 51% said they were uncomfortable with  Facebook compiling the information.  27% said the ad preference listing Facebook had generated wasn't accurate.  88% of polled users had some material generated for them on the ad preferences  page.  So the big number, the takeaway is three quarters of the Facebook user survey.  And I think it's probably accurate.  Pew's very good on these three quarters.  Didn't even know that Facebook targets them with ads based on what they give  Facebook, the information.  We go back to the, I found that tweet.  So this is, so in, hold on a second.  In regard to this, it's a, I think a value to say, Hey, you know, this 10  year progression thing, here's the kind of thing companies might want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Nick Thompson, we get wire editor respect them immensely.  I think he's great.  Right.  His tweets said this, let's say you wanted to train a facial recognition  algorithm on aging.  What would you do?  Maybe start a meme like 10 year challenge.  Period.  That is fake news.  That is misleading.  That is lying.  So I come back and I say utterly unnecessary.  Google photos two years ago demonstrated that it already attracts people back to  infancy by their images.  Facebook has a better repository of people tagged over time.  There need not be an a various motive to everything.  Social you see somebody else came in and said, well, that's not really the  article says.  And I came back and I said, yeah, but his tweet said this and I wanted a  contrary tweet.  Nick came back and said, fair.  And Facebook has now responded that they didn't start.  Also they could add as the article states that it's not entirely clear that  having better facial recognition, aging AI does anyone harm.  Okay.  We had to go through this exchange to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you didn't.  Because if you read to the second paragraph of the story, she says my intent  wasn't to claim that the meme is inherently dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But what happens?  What happened when her own editor tweeted this, Stacey?  And we know people don't read up.  However, it's more.  However, defines moral panic because this is trying to panic people about  something that is actually true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff, Jeff, you're wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're panicking because we've seen Microsoft to do this with that aging thing.  This is the kind of data companies do want.  They have actively pursued.  Google did it, as you said, and just because it happened once, doesn't mean  other companies aren't attempting it.  And there isn't the need for a larger data set.  We know Google does this all the time.  They created this would be the graphiest data set you could imagine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no tech in half, half their brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Would use this.  Okay.  The point isn't.  Okay.  The point isn't that the point of this article isn't that it's happening.  This way.  No, no, no.  The point of the article is that people should ask these questions.  Jeff, you're missing the forest for the trees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're focusing on the precise data that she's talking about.  But really the largest is trying to get people panicky and concerned about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  something that is not trying to get people aware that giving their data away

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in a fun little game that a few years ago, everybody was saying that's like

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  saying, yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  That's the point.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is gathering so companies use these games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just a fun little game.  It's like a few years ago, which game of Thrones character quiz on Facebook?  Well, that's just a fun little game.  What could possibly go wrong?  Which game of Thrones character are you or which, which Simpsons character?  You there?  There's no harm to doing that.  We know now there is.  Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the basis of the Cambridge analytic.  We know now there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This does a speculative paranoid.  What if there didn't exist?  Well, we don't know.  First of all, you don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't know.  I think you don't know what the company Facebook is not going to lie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Facebook's not going to what the Nick Thompson Facebook's not going to lie.  Nick Thompson, the editor of Wired, paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook lies all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeff, it feels like your concern is is making you see this as something way.  You're like just too sensitive to this.  You're this is like someone protecting free speech on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't think that's overblown, too.  I don't think that's my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is overblown.  This is panicking everybody.  I'll stand here on this technology show to defend the Internet against this kind  of moral panic and idiocy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the saddest moments in 2019 for us this week in Google was the official end  of Google+, which frankly, I think was the best social network.  So when is so April is Google?  Mike is, of course, the last Google Plus user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, April 3rd, isn't it?  Is it April 2nd?  Oh, coming up.  Yeah, I just I just got a thing saying save all my photos.  Are you saving all your photos between Google Plus and Flickr?  And what are you going to do, man?  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I already have all my photos and there's there are multiple efforts to do.  So Google has its own process for downloading.  I downloaded all my posts and some of them are I put a lot of work into  and they're very evergreen.  So I'm probably going to repost them on my blog.  Good.  But but we do have.  I mean, like I said, I wrote in a Google, you know, Fast Company piece  a couple of months ago.  Most of what was great about Google Plus was killed in 2014.  And so it's kind of been a shadow of itself for the last few years.  So it's at this point, no big loss to a certain extent.  That's that's a heresy in some circles.  But the problem is.  A lot of passionate Google Plus users felt like this is the one  social network I want to use, is the only one I want to use.  And all these smart people that I've gotten to know really well are here.  And we have these great conversations and everything was great.  And now nobody knows where to go.  Facebook's off the table because they're horrible.  Twitter is annoying to a lot of people.  And where else are you going to go?  So people are going to, you know, they're going to plus spora  and they're going to we me and they're going to all these social networks.  Nobody's heard of.  But what's happening is that the Google Plus community is being  is going off to 20 different social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And so it's diaspora, but it's no longer.  That means it's gone.  It's being destroyed.  Right.  And I actually blame Google for this because they did create  something of value.  They really pitched it hard.  A lot of people went all in.  I mean, Mike, you know, maybe it was ill advised to put these full length  articles on Google Plus and nowhere else.  But but you did it because you believed in it and you really like the  conversations there and how could Google just let that go?  And this is why people no longer trust Google.  They see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This feels like and this drives me nuts.  I mean, the web is no it's no different than the rest of our lives.  There are places I like to go and talk to people and hang out.  And I spend my time.  I put my effort in.  I've worked at publications that have gone under, for example.  There are coffee shops where I hang out with my friends and they are no longer  around or someone moves.  The world moves on.  And I know this feels really mean, but I'm kind of like.  You know, it didn't work for them.  They shut it down.  OK, I if you want your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Clearly, we're a Google Plus lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I wasn't, but I've loved other things like, I mean, all of my giga ohm  stuff, only half of it exists.  I've lost my entire podcast catalog from Giga and I'm like, all right.  That's life. You know, it's life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've got I'll tell you why it hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it hurts, but just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I'll tell you why we need something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we, though? Yeah, we do.  A part of it, though, because then we stagnate.  I mean, then you go and create other communities or take your ideas  that you learn from other people.  And then we I mean, think about it in the physical world.  You know, there is no analog in the physical world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If there were, if there were things, there's towns.  Yeah, it's like a town has disappeared.  That's a big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. But those people left that town.  I'm not saying it's not a big deal.  I'm saying these things happen in life and you just have to accept it  and put you down your roots somewhere else and do it all over again.  And that's what people that's life, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just I understand what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing that has to be said, though, is that Google plus  the original version of 2011 to 2014, to a lesser extent afterwards,  was a really, really special social network.  I mean, it was really every social network for some reason.  And I certainly have no idea why this is has a certain zeitgeist,  has a certain feel to it, a certain tone, a certain, you know, Instagram  is so different from Twitter or Facebook, even though it's owned by Facebook.  And the essential nature of Google plus, there were things that were achieved  on that social network that you just are unheard of on other social networks.  One of them is lots and lots and lots of people actually turned  strangers into close friends in real life.  And I'm one of those people.  I have 15, 20 people who I go visit  and who I know personally and who I didn't know until we started  following them on Google Plus.  You learn you have a lot in common.  You have a lot, you know, you you gang up on trolls together.  You do all the stuff.  You do hangouts.  And then they're great friends of people in Belgium.  And like I went and stayed with a great friend  that I met on Google Plus in Switzerland.  You don't you don't hear about that kind of stuff on Facebook.  Basically, what you're doing is you're kind of hoovering up  all of the all the friends and acquaintances and coworkers  you've ever had and maintaining some superficial connection with them.  On Google Plus, you're like everybody was a stranger  because you know, nobody's family was really to speak of.  And you make these great friends.  I don't know why that was the case.  We used to have these things called hurls, hangouts in real life,  essentially meetups.  And I've never heard of a social network that was so conducive  to real world friendships.  People had in the early days of Twitter and it stopped soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But in the early days of Twitter, there were tweet ups.  And it was very much like that.  But Twitter became mass appeal and that ruined it.  And I think one of the reasons Google Plus was great is  because it wasn't very successful.  Exactly. The people who were there were great.  But what is what are the other lessons to be learned from this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google can do social no matter how much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I would I would submit I will not.  I think we need to have a.  I don't think we can trust any company to do this right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get a WordPress blog and do it yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's not social.  Ultimately, it's only a little bit social.  I mean, honestly, and it's been tried in this.  So I know my solution isn't a good solution, but we need a federated,  open network that and, you know, I we had hopes that, you know,  Identica, then StatusNet, then Mastodon would be that they have the right backbone.  But somehow those communities never gelled properly.  But that's how it has to be, because if a company is in charge of it,  all sorts, A, they could kill it, but B, they start monetizing.  Instagram was a great site, great social network until they put an ad  every ninth post and they started adding all these features like stories  and the influencer.  As soon as the influencers arrived, Instagram went way downhill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about something like Pinterest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe Pinterest is the answer. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's a high quality.  I is it very social?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm trying to feel more like people put stuff there,  but that doesn't feel like there's interaction.  Yeah. Yeah. Right.  It's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's where people interact become cesspits.  That's not that's not a crazy idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I keep I keep wishing Mastodon would succeed because  from a technical point of view, it's the right thing.  Nobody owns it.  It's federated.  You can create your own server.  But the communities that have been created on Mastodon,  I haven't found one that really attracts me at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. The problem is that every social network  is either a failure, in which case it's not worth using because  nobody's on it.  Or if it's successful, they will ruin it in order to squeeze every nickel out of it.  That's why it can't be commercial.  That there's the only two social networks we've ever seen.  Google Plus was different for a while.  I mean, people say it wasn't it wasn't popular.  And I mean, it's way more popular than lots of other social networks  that have emerged since that people think are popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It has great features, though, like unlike Mastodon,  which really is a Twitter clone, it was a threaded conversation clone.  It was great with images.  People like Trey Ratcliffe showed that it became a fabulous place  to put your images.  Google mismanaged it almost from day one, establishing  this crazy circle system that no one wanted to maintain.  And then, you know, I mean, they just they they killed it  death by a thousand cuts.  And it's it's tragic.  And it's a really good example of why Google or any company shouldn't be in charge  of social. And yet no one's done any.  I wish they you know what Google's open source.  Yes, slack is slack for many people turned into that.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, maybe that's it.  And you know what? I would say we had a so the former gigaomers  we actually had we we took our slack channel.  Right. At the end of the show or at the end of the company.  You still do it actually still is alive.  And for the year afterwards, we actually even paid for our own private slack.  And we did it because we had a lot of value in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And slack such a pig as an application.  It's hard to support it.  Oh, there's no, no, it's just a terrible.  I mean, it's written in electron and it's just big and heavy.  And it needs I don't know what I don't.  It's not bad. I mean, I know people are doing it.  Discord is another very popular  social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I can I propose I have to I have to say something?  Yes. Let me just say this before you do, which is Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Please open source Google Plus and let us take it back.  It is early to talk about this because it was only announced yesterday.  But it is to me, maybe the most interesting  and could be most important story of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, can we guess? Yeah.  123 Libra. Libra.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. Yeah. Facebook's cryptocurrency.  And already France has said, hold on there, big boy.  You're not so fast, Mark Zuckerberg  has has the chair of the House Financial Services Committee.  This is going to be a very Maxine Waters.  This is going to be a very interesting story.  It's not going to happen till next year.  And it takes some understanding,  you know, and a little bit of research to really get what's going on.  I'm going to refer, because I think they are the smartest guys out there  to the Wired article by Stephen Levy  and Gregory Barber, the ambitious plans behind Facebook's cryptocurrency.  Libra. The deal is complicated.  First of all, maybe it's not even quite appropriate to call it Facebook's,  because, as Facebook will point out, Libra is a nonprofit  out of Switzerland, Global Coin, the Libra Association.  They're the Switzerland of digital coinage.  The technology is open source.  The control of the block chain will be out of Switzerland.  The Libra Association will consist of up to 100 founding members,  of which Facebook is just one.  Each of them will put in 10 million dollars to fund the association  and receive interest earned off the reserve.  It's an NGO, in other words.  Actually, no, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have some skepticism about this part, but keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It will be NGO members. Libra is not an NGO, but it is a nonprofit.  Each member will be empowered.  I guess it is ultimately a non-governmental organization, though,  in the most truest sense of the word, because  and this is what scares banks and scares governments.  It will be a global currency.  Not pegged to the US dollar, but tied to the dollar, the yen, the euro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Could I throw out a challenge just now for just a second,  just as the discussion continues, is to think about this  as if Facebook were not mentioned at all, right?  To take that angle out of it and say, does this make sense?  Is this a good thing for people? Is this a bad thing for people?  Then we can add Facebook back in.  And there's perfectly legitimate things to talk about there,  as whether or not they're a proper.  You're right, because Facebook kind of tilts it.  If you say Google, I want to think about the the the the theory of this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so we totally can't.  But before you do that, I want to bring up the fact that I have  in covering technology, I'm sure you guys have seen this too.  There are tons of independent standard settings boards  or organizations that have been created, but are yet dominated by one member.  And I think it's important when we're talking about this  to understand how much Facebook has here, it does say that it eventually  will step back, but we have no guarantees there.  There's a lot of decision making that happens in these organizations.  And it's entirely possible for an organization with a hundred  different groups involved to still be dominated by one or two major players.  That's all I want to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fred Wilson, a great investor, Fred Wilson  says, think of Facebook as the Satoshi  of Bitcoin, the creator of Bitcoin and Librecoin like Bitcoin.  In other words, Satoshi released it into the world.  Facebook came up with the technology and is open sourcing it.  I think it's also important to say that  Facebook understands the value of this not being Facebook.  Some of the articles out there have described this as Zuck bucks.  That's the phrase I like. And face coin.  If it's dead in the water says, Marcus, I'm not sure who Marcus is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is David. Is it David Marcus?  Oh, he's the Facebook executive who came up with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes. OK. He was president of PayPal.  So here's how the Levy article begins.  Near the end of 2017 on a Dominican Republic beach with his family,  Facebook executive David Marcus wrestled with the question he'd been pondering  since his previous job as president of PayPal.  How would you build the Internet of money?  A friction free global digital currency  would be a boon for many people with mobile phones, but no access to banking,  which also coincides with Facebook's commercial interests, because that's the  the other billion or the next billion Facebook people.  Right. And who better to develop something  like this, Marcus wondered, than Facebook with its global reach and massive user base.  He was at the time head of Facebook Messenger,  and he texted Zuckerberg saying it's time to talk about creating a cryptocurrency.  He wrote a memo that laid out his ideas and Zuck quickly endorsed the plan,  saying the approach synced with his ideas.  They were thinking about this for a long time.  And with Messenger, Apple has kind of in in in iMessages payment using.  Well, it's Wallet shows the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the path, right?  The Chinese model that you can do everything.  It's WeChat.  Not Wallet. WeChat.  WeChat. Thank you. Thank you. WeChat.  But this is more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it would be a currency that Messenger would run on.  Facebook Messenger would run on.  But listen to the main.  So to your point, Jeff, what if we leave out Facebook,  but we mentioned the other partners, Visa, MasterCard, PayPal,  Coinbase, Stripe,  VCs like Andreessen Horowitz and Thrive,  Kiva, which is that micro lending nonprofit, the NGO.  Even though this will not be a lending platform, let's be quick to add.  Yes, but there but they but maybe the lending would occur in global  coin is the idea. Women's World Banking, Vodafone, eBay,  Lyft, Uber, Spotify.  These are all partners in this.  There's no banks, of course, because if you're going to pick one victim of this,  it would be banks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, the other one is not in there is and it's not a victim.  It's somebody who victimizes customers around the world.  The world is Western Union.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, this would totally replace that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This this is this is that's that's one key to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I notice I notice M Pesa isn't in there either, which is the African  payment platform that is basically widely used in lieu of banks.  But Stripe is in there.  Pay you is in there. PayPal is in there.  So there is an interesting group.  Mercy Corps.  Ribbit Capital Union Square Ventures is a really interesting group.  So you were trying to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So there's a couple of things about this that we should look at.  One is there's a lot of value in understanding what people are buying,  what people are spending money on and how money flows around the world.  And seeing that in almost real time, it looks like.  And again, I don't know the math behind this, but unlike something like  Hyperledger, it looks like the block chain process behind this,  the math behind this will make that sort of information public.  So a company like Stripe, Spotify, even Visa and MasterCard,  who actually already have access to this data, it behooves them  to have something like this where they can see what people are buying to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Facebook says that none of the information would go back to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I'm not I'm not just worried about Facebook.  I'm I'm curious what it means to make transactions public.  So I've talked to people in like the FBI and about digital currencies,  and they love this because you can find out who owns what and see what's happening.  So there's a lot of information and data being available.  Like if we're all excited about search data because that shows intent.  This is like the next best thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sad to say that Mark didn't take my advice and call them Zuck Bucks.  And actually, Libra is facing a lot more headwinds.  I wonder if we'll ever see Libra cryptocurrency.  That'll be a story for 2020.  A story that is continuing throughout 2019 and into 2020  is China continuously stepping up their use of technology to surveil people.  It actually really came to our attention this past July.  Speaking of malware, the Chinese Border Patrol.  If you cross into the border near the Xinjiang region, which is  I think it's in the Western area where the local Muslim population,  the Uyghurs are being repressed.  If you cross in, you will be forced  to install malware on your phone that downloads your text messages,  calendar entries and phone logs, scans the device looking for  70,000 different apps and stays on the device.  Motherboard got a copy of the malware.  And in fact, I guess this is a German newspaper, Suddeutsche Zeitung.  They they sent a reporter who crossed the border,  had the same malware installed on their phone.  In fact, if you want, you can download the malware from Motherboard.  So why don't you install on your phone and get back to us?  The border crossing is from Kyrgyzstan into China.  And I guess the theory is, well, what are you doing over here?  What are you doing here?  Well, I think, though, it's just I'm really worried.  I'm going to be going in the fall to the Middle East, to both Israel  and Jordan and Oman and the United Arab Emirates.  I'm I'm I'm actually trying to figure out what my strategy is going to be,  both for going into those countries, going from Israel into Dubai  and then to top it all off coming home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just buy six burners.  I think I have to have a burner for every country.  Not to mention two passports.  Oh, man. Yeah, because you get one for the US, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, jeez. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jeez. Well, when I went to Israel not too long ago,  instead of instead of stamps, they put two little  they just give you two little very not pasted cards,  an entry card, an exit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you have to have it when you go out so they can take it.  But then you can throw it away. Right.  Yeah. Russia. I was never there. I know nothing.  Russia does that, too.  Oh, so that there's no evidence that you were in Israel.  That's the point. Clever.  I wasn't here for this next story.  Google got a lot of heat for this.  I don't know if they deserve to Jason Howell, Stacey Higginbotham,  Kevin Toffle.  Is your face worth five bucks to Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you hear the story about someone who apparently was propositioned  five dollars for face for a face scan by a Google employee?  So apparently your face is only worth five dollars.  And I guess that's actually quite a bit. Is it?  I feel like it seems low. But, you know, they did a study

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  probably in 20 either 2012 or 2014 where they bought people's  Social Security number for a cookie.  So, OK, I feel like by comparison.  Wait, what flavor?  It was a chocolate chip cookie.  OK, that's that's a pro. That is plenty. All right.  So, I mean, good trade.  That's more of a barter as opposed to a dollar figure.  But I feel that five dollars for a face is fair.  What did strike me is the fact that this guy was like.  And it's not five dollars cash, it's five dollars at Starbucks or Amazon,  I believe. It was an Amazon gift card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, Amazon or Starbucks, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, which I thought was hilarious because, you know,  Amazon probably could use some faces themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's true.  Someone notable that they're not giving out their own Play Store gift cards, but  also that makes a whole lot of sense that they wouldn't do that.  I mean, five dollars aside, if this person or anybody offers five dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for Google to do that, does that does Google still have the right to scan  their face and other photos and such like are they getting anything other than the five bucks?  Are they getting any extra privacy over their data?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a really good question. Like I have to imagine.  So what happened, at least in the ZDNet story, and I think there was one on 95  Google of another person that, you know, they had a report of this happening,  but they were sitting in the park.  Man walks up to them and offers five dollars to scan their face.  They say, I work for Google.  We're collecting data to improve the next generation of facial recognition  phone unlocking. So pretty, I mean, reasonably specific as far as what they're  saying that they're using it for.  Who knows if they have more and more uses for this face scan than just that.  But that's what they're telling people.  And then they were given a phone in a case that made it difficult to discern  what the phone was.  Many people are are positing that it might be the Pixel four because there might be a sensor  on the Pixel four that would facilitate face scanning in order to unlock.  And then you use the phone to take a selfie at different angles to get the different kind  of direction shots on your face.  And then you're handed this five dollar Amazon and Starbucks card.  And I have to imagine if you're agreeing to this, you must either sign something or maybe  there's something in the app that you're taking the selfie with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did give him a contract.  He just didn't read it.  Oh, which is unfortunate, because I'm like for for five dollars.  I would like to see what you're giving.  Oh, yes. Well, I mean, he's writing about his friend who's an engineer and right.  Who is probably like, yeah, I'll give him my face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's whatever. Yeah, probably one of those.  They've already got everything.  So what's what's my face?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, his his exact quote was, yeah, well, I wanted to see what they'd ask me to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. I don't care what they're going to do with it.  I just want to know what they want me to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Curiosity. Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, without seeing the contract, we don't know much more.  I'm actually wondering if this wasn't a face scan, but a face scam.  Oh, in that maybe this wasn't Google at all.  Because that's a really good question.  Yeah, I'm thinking, you know, why would Google have to go out and do this  when they have between contractors and regular employees, you know, 80,  90000 faces to scan already?  Well, I don't really see the point of them going out in the public and doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What they don't have is someone playing with their phone, trying to unlock it.  That's that's what this was for.  This was I'm I'm with Jason.  I think this was testing the Pixel four's unlock feature.  So they needed someone to be able to kind of look at it from various angles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that could well be.  But I mean, when I was at Google, most of the people I work with actually  carried iPhones. So if you wanted like a new user group, you got it there.  It's trust me, they have it.  Hmm. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't know that I read anything about them actually.  Like like in this report, there was nothing in there that said  that he was actually unlocking the phone with his face.  They were just scanning it from multiple directions.  I just wasn't sure if you know, they were actually using the Pixel four.  Nothing. Yeah.  And I'm not sure that we've heard Google say anything.  If it was a scam, they probably would have by now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is an assumption.  I naturally ask Google what it would be doing,  but the company didn't immediately respond. OK. So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's call Google.  Let's see what they have to say right now. Right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish, you know, that would be so awesome.  If we had a hotline like a bat phone to the Google PR team,  I mean, it'd probably be the PR team, but we had an actual Google person  who would talk to us, I'd be even better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we would.  We would do it like three, maybe four times before we realized.  They always give us the same answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's more effective, actually.  Just, you know, OK.  We have nothing to announce at this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. We have nothing to announce at this time.  OK, well, that that bit is done.  I guess we're done with that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Google's been doing some work in secret.  NASA, which was a partner in this work,  inadvertently published a paper which they almost immediately unpublished.  But but before  too long, people were able to get a copy of it. Of course.  The Google research paper was titled Quantum Supremacy  using a programmable superconducting processor.  Quantum supremacy is a term used by quantum computing folks.  In fact, I'll point you to a really good and completely impenetrable  blog post by the guy who coined the term, Scott Aronson.  He's it's actually really great.  Scott Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ.  He talks about what quantum supremacy is,  but I will attempt in my own way to define it.  It is essentially a proof that quantum computing works.  If a quantum computer can do something  significantly faster than a Turing machine can do,  then that's quantum supremacy.  And in fact, in this paper,  it was asserted that the Google quantum computer was able to  to solve a problem 50,000 times faster  than the world's fastest traditional supercomputer.  So it's a it's not a task you would want.  Right. It's not solving a problem that anyone cares about.  But it is it's merely a demonstration that you could do it.  The proof of concept.  It's it's kind of a random number thing, but it was able to do it,  according to the paper, in three minutes and 20 seconds.  What would take the world's fastest supercomputer summit?  Ten thousand years.  But if you read the blog by Scott Aronson,  you'll realize that it's kind of it's more complicated than that.  It's more complicated than that.  So if you really care about quantum supremacy, it's probably worth reading this.  He basically confirms the post saying, yeah, you know, I was involved in this.  I've been trying not to tell anybody for a long time.  It's been a big secret.  Google pulled the article because they want to make a big splash when they announce it.  It probably would behoove everybody to to understand a little bit more  about what this means.  It does not mean that a quantum computer is around the corner.  By the way, he says I did not create the quantum supremacy phrase.  It was coined by John Preskill in 2012.  But he's widely considered to be the guy who first anyway,  that establishes his bona fides for this article.  And he talks about what the problem solved was likely to be and what it means.  And it doesn't mean a lot of things.  So this is this is important.  It might, in fact, be the kind of thing that you'll look back and say,  oh, I remember back in 2019 when we first he likens it,  Aronson likens it to Kitty Hawk.  Yeah. So the first flight of the Wright brothers,  which, by the way, didn't become public for months, right?  Certainly didn't imply that we'd be able to fly across the country  or across around the world.  It was just a jet airplane.  Just hot.  But it was the first time.  Humans flew for any length, any appreciable distance.  And that's kind of what this is.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what does it mean to Bitcoin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting question.  Some people brought this up.  I don't know if it means anything for Bitcoin.  It would mean maybe if you could create a Bitcoin miner out of a quantum computer,  which, by the way, that's years and years off, you could perhaps make a some money  but that's not likely.  Remember, quantum, these quantum computers have to be supercooled.  They're very expensive to run.  They're very difficult to create and they're incredibly unstable.  Right.  So it's not a practical solution.  Sounds like the perfect computer.  Yeah, just what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you think your computer crashes a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're an evil, rich monster, what do you do with it?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Nothing. It doesn't it doesn't mean anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not worth the trouble even for even evil rich monsters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not unless you've got the research means of NASA and Google.  No, but it's fascinating.  And if anybody watches our shows and is interested in this kind of stuff,  probably really should read Scott Aronson's blog.  His blog is scotaronson.com.  But you could also search for quantum supremacy FAQ.  You'd probably find it pretty darn good.  I doubt there's more than one.  Here's another one I wasn't here for, but I think probably it's the highlight of the year.  Why does Jeff Jarvis hate dark mode so much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dark mode is for suckers.  OK, I'm so happy you brought this up.  I was wondering if it would end up making it in here.  I'm curious to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're starting with it because I'm vindicated.  OK, Moto says it's all BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, this this guy on Gizmodo says it's all BS.  I said it was good enough for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adam angst tidbits explains an exhausting detail that except in  extraordinary situations, dark mode is not easy on the eyes in any way.  Well, how is that Samantha Cole reports?  The researchers found that people with the stupid stigmatism,  light text on dark backgrounds aggravates the condition, making text harder to read.  What's more, as Suzanne Mayer, a university of Passau,  researcher said, who conducted multiple studies and found which  design screws with our brain in all the studies.  Participants were better performing in the positive polarity condition,  otherwise known as not dark mode.  They detected more errors and read faster  when dark text was presented on light background rather than the reverse.  So I just want this on the record that I'm not insane.  My hatred for dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I'm not done.  I'm not done with light mode.  Light mode is the way to go.  It's the way God made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, John, could you just kill the lights in here?  It's too bright for me right now.  It's far too. But thank you.  This is what we need to do.  Thank you. Oh, there we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I know it has some opinions.  I'll just start.  I'll just throw out the two times that I have really like I like dark mode on Twitter,  where reading comprehension doesn't really matter as much because it's very short.  And then I also like it when I am in a professional setting  or like a conference setting.  And I'm trying to type without everybody else being really aware of what I'm typing  and that I'm typing in dark mode is awesome for that.  So those are my pro dark mode moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I appreciate dark mode when I am in a dark environment.  Like, I think that that is an very honest  like application of why dark mode can be very useful.  If I'm in a dark environment, like if I pick up my phone off the bedside table  or whatever, it's dark in the room and I look at it, it's a bright white.  That does irritate my eyes.  It's like, I mean, it's it's not like discomfort or uncomfortable,  not discomfort, uncomfortable.  But but at the same time, like a darker mode is more pleasing.  So I can prefer it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Your eyes are smart.  They figure it out. I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So when I have a migraine, dark mode is the only way I can get online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pull it out the migraine card.  Yeah.  Pull in the migraine card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pull in the cranky old band card.  Come on, I got to do the migraine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, it's a thing.  I battle with this and I'm one of those people that see better  at nighttime than I do in the daytime.  And it's been that way for for about as long as I can remember.  As a matter of fact, just within the last hour,  I was walking the hallway and I had on my sunglasses and I had to think,  oh, take your sunglasses off.  You forgot that you were wearing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  I want you to do the show in the sunglasses.  This is your new look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK. Yeah, I would.  But I'm I really do.  With the Anna Wintour from Twi.  I do get better use out of the dark mode on my eyes because of the sensitivity.  I like having a better contrast when I look at the screen and heck,  even sitting in the office with Mr. Howell here.  Yeah. When I get I get here before them most of the time.  And the office is dark and I'll have on one little lamp because that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you look at your dark mode with sunglasses on?  Are you double dark mode?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have super duper dark.  Not on purpose, but I have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. Here's the next question.  So when you're on a plane, sunglasses, a lot of fight going on.  Now, a lot of fighting going on these days on on the rates on planes.  And when I get on the plane, because I'm global services,  bow down before me, I get on the plane before the pilot does.  I get on first.  I go to the seat on the aisle.  I always raise the shades.  I want the shades up.  I can't stand people. The shades down.  Are you a shades up or shades down person on plane?  Good question. Good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a good reason for this, though.  I am a shades up.  But that's because I am a aviation nerd.  I love airplanes.  So I'm always looking out with my sunglasses.  Shades. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm a shades down, Jeff.  I can't believe it. We don't agree on anything. Shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, again, you know, for me, it mirrors my dark mode  rationale. Like it depends on the time of day.  If it's daytime, I want the shades up.  If it's nighttime or if it's like early morning,  that's probably the more applicable time.  Like if I, you know, travel to the airport and it's like five  thirty in the morning, I have to catch a flight or whatever.  And the sun's going to come up.  And I do want to sleep a little bit. Sure. Shades down. That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I'm also the same person that discussed last week  that I wear my glasses just sparingly.  Yeah. And it's and it's clearly helped my eyes over the years,  because I don't have to wear them all the time the way most people.  Oh, it's vanity. It's pure vanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And no, no, I don't wear my glasses all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't deserve it.  And it's because I hate having a filter between me and people I'm talking to.  Yeah. I feel like.  I don't know why I just I don't want to walk to the bathroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  from bed without glasses on.  I can't talk to anything without glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. I'm yeah, my eyes are probably about as bad as yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like I'm sorry to hear that.  Yeah. Yeah, it's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I just want on the record here.  That's good.  His motto says dark mode is for suckers.  And you see how it says it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we should all heed what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's it. I never quote his motto, but now they're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, a large part of what he's saying here is that it's it's a trend.  Like dark mode is a trend.  Therefore, people like it because people like it.  And I mean, yeah, there's probably a little bit of truth to that.  Sheep bulls, dark mode sheep bulls.  But I know that I like it for reasons outside of that, too.  I think at certain times a day for me, it's more aesthetically pleasing to my eyes.  Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are people that are following the trend because they've heard about it.  But again, there's people like me is just for comfort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Comfort. Yeah.  And some people will tout the battery savings and everything.  Andrew makes the point, like, if you really added it up,  you're probably not saving that much.  A lot of dark mode is not true dark anyways.  It's like a shade of gray and you're still burning battery.  You do that.  So what are you really saving?  And you have to be on the, you know, an AMLA display so that you have to have  the right display technology for that to even matter.  So anyways, I don't know.  If you like dark mode, now you have the option at the end of the day.  Isn't it nice to have options?  Yes, it is. Options are good. All right.  Happy we got it.  I'm happy we got the most important story out of the way at the very top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I'm not having I'm not having pixel for envy.  No, I just I just I'm I'm a 3AXL.  I'm very happy with it.  I just facial recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you been have you been paying attention to some of the reviews  that seem to be dropping like crazy right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, what I know you're going to tell me about them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't like I find myself being less than excited.  And I think one of the big disappointments for me  that I'm hearing from multiple reviewers, almost all of them is just battery.  Yeah. Battery, I feel like is just that's just one of those things  on an 800 to 900 dollar device.  You had the nail battery.  And if you're not, you're doing something wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the 90 hertz display, I'm sure it looks great.  But is that really necessary?  Do we really need 90 hertz on our phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Necessary? No, I would say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but it's nice to have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It doesn't even work all the time.  They get it in there and then they turned it off

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because they know it's going to just kill the already small battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the weird thing is it only works when your screen is on full brightness  or like a of 75 percent brightness. Right.  So if like you really have to make that choice, like I want no battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the anti dark mode.  Yes, it is the anti dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the bright mode.  Mr. Jarvis, you said you wasn't excited.  But if you were a Pixel 2 owner, would you be excited?  I'd be very different. Very different.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'd be excited to just upgrade to something new.  It's been a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I had before. I had the Pixel 2. Yeah.  And now I have the Pixel 3A.  3A. And the 3A is very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you miss the squeeze?  I miss the squeeze. That's what I was going to ask.  I just need the squeeze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stacey, you should try squeezing your 3A.  It doesn't work. Squeeze the bottom.  Oh my God, it worked!

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been squeezing this thing for, I guess I need to adjust it.  But it's only on the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's only the bottom half.  So it's not the side. OK.  No, no, not the bottom bottom.  It's the bottom half.  Yeah, it's the bottom half of the sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So I've been squeezing it kind of at the midline.  So it doesn't do it. Oh, it did it there.  Oh, Carson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're choking the phone.  There are sensitivity settings.  Hug the phone.  I know. That's a nice little booty squeeze.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just I was sad because I really use that a lot in my day to day phone interaction.  So I was like, I kept squeezing it and it was like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like she just hugged her phone and.  Right. Just hug it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't choke it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. I disable that feature.  I do too.  Yeah. I just found like no matter what sensitivity I had it set to,  it would fire when I didn't want it to.  Same here.  It's like, stop it.  Like, I don't need you all the time, assistant.  I don't need you right now.  All right. Same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think after five years of carpal tunnel,  maybe my hand grip strength is so weak that I never unintentionally squeeze it.  But I. Oh, boy.  Apparently, I can't even squeeze it when it's there.  But like, it's so great because I hate talking to my phone  because I set off everything in the house.  And so the squeeze is just like, oh, I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do something.  I can just imagine 100 devices saying, yes, Stacey, yes, Stacey, yes, Stacey,  yes, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also just added the drag from the bottom right corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. In order to launch the assistant, I think I have that on my swipe up on it.  Oh, yeah. I can show that if you if you really want to see it.  Yeah. So you have to kind of go in a in a diagonal from the bottom.  And that does your system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I never really got into the gesture UI on my phone.  I just like it old school.  And so this is the pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is two. This is the two.  That's the two. OK.  But everybody at home uses the gesture interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I turned it off. OK. I just like using old stock button.  And on the four, which you will be getting at some point soon here, too,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you do have the ability to opt for the three button versus the gesture.  So that's still the same.  I'm not savvy enough for gestures just yet in the new Jedi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you won't get if you do that, you won't get the super assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right. So that's kind of crazy, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like right now, there was news that at least with the Pixel 4 at launch,  if you have if you don't have gestures activated, then you can't access assistant.  Makes no sense. That makes absolutely no sense.  You can't you can.  You still get assistant because you can't access assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you don't get but not super assistant.  Awesome. Super.  The one that the continual conversational version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that still like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you can bring one, why can't it do the other?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what is super assistant?  I feel so lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get continuing conversations, you get something else.  I don't know. They were they talked about it at the at the.  So a lot more contextual at the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's more resident on the device. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, exactly. More of it's on device.  So you get a little bit of the faster response.  So what it like reverts to old dumb assistant.  Like, oh, you're not using you just got this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Weird. You just got the footman, not the butler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. So this is this is a trend I think we're going to see more and more,  especially as some people have G Suite either. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Oh, yeah.  That's what you go psycho. That's for you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Not only that, like you can't you can't be you can't have it on your device at all.  It's not that you can't have G Suite account as your primary account.  It just can't be there at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Otherwise, either at all, which is just what Google.  Weird. These are the people who pay you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is so weird. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's probably to do with like the the limitations around G Suite  are mostly about things like privacy and parsing the data.  So it could be the way that Google's handling that data is not compliant  with what they've told their professional customers who want their data to be kept secure.  It's not for folks like you and me, Jeff.  It's for folks like corporations, if that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know. But they're Google.  They have they have quantum supremacy. They could fix this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. I want so badly like I recommend to everyone.  They're like, should I do G Suite?  And I'm like, are you a Google user? Then no, don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no point in it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What what other option would you suggest for a professional  who wants to have like a small but high end productivity suite?  Please don't say Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's about it.  Question. That's about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's about it.  Like me, if you're on a Chromebook and you want to have your own domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. That's about it.  I can't think of anything else that would be seamless day to day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of baffling to me how the G Suite over the years  is always the punching bag for stuff like that.  Never fixed continually the punching bag.  It never gets any better for G Suite users.  Meanwhile, they're the ones that are paying.  And I know Google is the same problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sixty five. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's I mean, that's really the only other option, which is  I'm sorry, I'm not doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so I mean, and that's not all that's missing from the four  RCS support, which the Pixel three has.  The before does not is not unsupported on T-Mobile and Verizon at launch,  even though the three is supported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't quite understand that story because I thought it also  put more on this on the on the particular carriers,  not necessarily the device.  So it's more on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's it's about it's about the carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is about the carriers. It is the carriers. Absolutely.  Because the headlines that I was that I've been seeing have read as if  this is Google's fault.  They they screwed up and didn't make this available when I mean,  I always thought it mattered most on the network, not necessarily on the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could say that if this was a big priority for Google,  a big enough priority for Google, Google would have made whatever relationship,  you know, or management that they needed to do with the carriers to make sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they could say this is not a device that's going to sell in the billions.  So who cares? So, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why do they care? Yeah, there's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which I mean, yeah, which is unfortunate for Google's next big market  or messaging push, you know,  because RCS was yet another messaging solution that was going to change  everything from story to history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And on the plus side, you guys, it's been what, six months or so  since Google's last launched a messaging protocol.  You know, wait a look at the bright side.  I'm trying. I'm in light mode today.  Oh, wait, no, I'm in dark mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We can we can automatically switch between light and dark mode  throughout the course of this episode.  We'll put you back in a dark mode for this.  Dual band GPS is hardware that's supported on the Pixel 4,  but it's not activated at launch.  So that's another thing that Google is kind of holding off and say,  as somewhere down the line will activate it.  Just point after point after point, it seems like there's all of these  asterisks involved with the Pixel 4.  And I feel like in years past, yes, people  poo poo the next device and then they get in like, oh, well, actually,  it's not that bad. And maybe I'll find myself there, too.  But I'm just getting kind of disheartened by a lot of these things right now.  And maybe that's because I just don't have it in my hands yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the difference.  You need to see what works for you and your personal experience on it.  All these reviews that have been out there  the last couple of days have been pretty downing.  And I get it for the most part, but I don't want to just put all of my stock  in those just yet, because, like, for example, MKBHD, as big as he is,  he has a different perspective when it comes to these these  these devices and a use case.  I remember him making a comment right at the end of his video,  basically saying, you know, most people I wouldn't recommend this phone for.  And so I wanted to ask him, how do you define most people  and what is the phone that you're going to recommend?  Cut off. Yeah. You know, is it the iPhone? OK.  Why is it the Galaxy Note? OK. Why? Sure. You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but coming from someone who has the reach and the respect in the industry,  you know, as MKBHD does,  and he's kind of been a pretty big fan of the Pixel phones until now.  So for him to say, like, I have a hard time recommending this for everyone.  That's kind of a big that's a big deal in my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And see, when he went into the rant about the 90 Hertz display  and then you top that off by saying most people,  do you really think most people know what 90 Hertz on a display is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most people probably aren't even going to know that the 90 Hertz display is  is going on or going on, you know, depending on the brightness setting,  whatever that is. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's why I'm like, why wouldn't he recommend it for most people?  You know, just just for little comments like that.  But I'm not taking a dig at you, Mr.  Brownlee, I'm just curious if you can get this message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just want to say to wrap this up.  I love my Pixel 4.  I think it got a lot of heat undeservedly.  I think it's a great little phone.  And as of just a few weeks ago, Google's announced  they're going to continually add new features with monthly updates.  So I have to say, as much as we've been dissing the Pixel 4,  I'm pretty happy with it.  But that's just one of the many stories we'll be covering next year  on this week in Google.  We do it every Wednesday, and I hope you'll stop by on behalf of Jeff  Jarvis and Stacey Higa Botham.  I'm Leo Laporte.  Have a wonderful holiday.  And here's to a very pleasant, peaceful  and Googley 2020.  We'll see you next year. Bye bye.
