Let's not forget there is a cloud, a cloudy day today, but the sun is about to shine because  here she is, Gina Trapani, back from Washington, D.C., where she fixed the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  In one fell swoop.  In one day.  In one swell foop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina blogs at smarterware.org.  She also works for Fast Company, fastcompany.com slash work smart.  And are you working on another book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I am not, but I am building Think Up for expert labs.  That's exciting.  That's really my full-time thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's writing in PHP these days.  Yes.  Forget English.  Code is poetry.  Code is art.  Also here, there he is, Jeff Jarvis, BuzzMachine.com from his book Lines Study.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm trying to make you believe I've read any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He buys them by the foot, ladies and gentlemen.  He's also the author of The Fine.  What Would Google Do?  That's the book right there.  Look right behind him.  You can see it.  And also with us, we have a newbie, be kind, from gizmodo.com.  Joel Johnson is here.  Hi, Joel.  Hi.  How's it going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you do for gizmodo?  I am at the moment editor-at-large, which I think is just kind of like a blanket term  for retirement, right?  Yeah, out to pasture.  Yeah, that's what's taken.  No, I pretty much do feature stuff, but I still blog here and there.  So it's kind of all over the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's awesome.  Well, we're glad to have you.  Welcome to the show.  I wish I worked at Google.  Thousand dollar bonus to every employee that's worth about $20 million and they all get a  10% raise.  Kind of a little harder to figure out how much that is, but the guess is that could  be worth, what, $20 billion.  Well, a 10% on a total cost basis of $20 billion is about a billion dollars worth of raises,  according to Business Insider at the Silicon Alley Insider.  That's nice.  Merry Christmas from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did it say, please don't leave us in the memo?  Please don't come to check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You read the confidential internal only memo.  Well, you said this like Googlers only.  So I don't know how they got this memo, but basically it implies we want to make sure  that you feel rewarded for your hard work and we want to attract the best people to  Google.  That it should say, I mean, you can continue on.  Please don't leave.  They are kind of, what is interesting is they say we did a little research.  We found out you valued cash more than stock options.  So in effect, they're taking money out of the options and shoveling it over to $1,000.  But I have to say, they've raised the bar for me here at Twit.  Now I'm in trouble.  T-shirts, t-shirts, t-shirts.  I was going to give you all t-shirts.  Are we all going to get $1,000 on this podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody on this podcast gets a 10% raise.  But that is, it is a reflection.  We hit the nail on the head, didn't you, Gina?  It is a reflection of the fact that there's a brain drain to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it really kind of feels like a stop the bleeding move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is a thousand bucks enough to keep you from going to Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  A thousand bucks is a nice, hey, you know, thanks.  I mean, that's a nice little bonus.  It's not enough to keep somebody from going to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to have a big Christmas party, right?  I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it depends on how much you're making too, because those senior engineers or those  mid-level engineers that they're really afraid of losing, I don't know if a thousand dollars  is really all that much to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But 10% could be pretty good.  10%, yeah, that's worth it.  And actually, the stories we're hearing is if you go to your boss at Google and say,  I'm leaving for Facebook, they will throw lots of money at you if they like you.  They want to keep you if possible.  Obviously, it's not been enough money for a number of senior engineers, but nevertheless,  Google told TechCrunch that this is, MG Siegler ready for TechCrunch, this is competitive  compensation.  Actually, it's funny because MG said, well, is this memo true?  Google's response is, well, while we don't typically comment on internal matters, we  believe that competitive compensation plans are important to the future of the company.  Somebody in the comments said, that's akin to saying, what did you have for breakfast?  And responding, breakfast is the most important meal of the day.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's a non-answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think it's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder how many of those big hires Facebook got from Google were already rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, they already got the options.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so they weren't doing it for money to go to Facebook.  And so no amount of money, you're stuck in a thousand is not enough.  How much is enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Well, the whole thing is a little bit, it kind of feels a little pedestrian and it's  sort of strange.  I don't want to like, smudge a billion dollars or whatever they're going to have to pay  out in payroll.  But the whole thing just kind of seems a little bit like, I don't know, just to do something  company wide doesn't seem, doesn't give the kind of attitude that you would think Google  wants to show their engineers that they're really progressive and doing something crazy.  So what does Gawker do?  Every time I've ever gone to Nick and said that I'm leaving for Facebook, he says, that's  fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what Nick stops beating you up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right, I won't hit you again.  Nick lets you out of the basement.  Well, I just want everybody to know you're all getting a pair of socks hand knit by my  mother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's sweet, actually.  My heat is off in the house, so I need.  Oh, you look cold.  You got like eight layers on, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, we moved into a house that heats with heating oil, which I didn't know they did  outside of Ireland or something.  So I'm waiting for a truck to come around and pour oil into a tank in my garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember those days.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Heating oil.  When I lived in New England, I'm sure, Jeff, you know this experience.  The truck comes, they pump oil once a month, they pump oil into a big tank in your house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In my first apartment, I'd lived there for six months and one night I decided I wanted  popcorn and I got absolutely enraged that the stove didn't work and I called the gas  company and an absolute fit and they told me you have to call to get it hooked up, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Six months, I'd never bothered.  Never cooked a thing.  Not a thing.  What?  You need to have gas?  Anybody got a Samsung Galaxy Tab?  I think today's the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we've we got one.  I haven't actually used it to be to be completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, go ahead.  Make judgments anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we don't need it. We don't need to do what Dvorak does.  Dvorak will look at the box and say, no, I can tell you right now.  That's my Dvorak impression, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not good. I don't like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Set it up.  Yeah. So Matt Buchanan, one of our senior guys, had just put up his review.  And, you know, there have been some other reviews out there before.  It's not like we're the first ones to put anything out there.  But Matt pretty much said it's garbage.  In fairness, there's a lot of things that seems like they're doing right.  But the fundamental size issue, like the seven inch tablet,  seems like it's just not like really a good size.  You've got phones which are a certain size and they're pocketable.  And you're always going to take that around.  And you've got the iPad, which is less convenient.  But, you know, it's it's a nine or nine point seven inch screen.  But this seven inch size is just a weird in between size.  And it could be that maybe Jobs is right, that, you know,  nobody really wants a seven inch screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. T-Mobile, the first to have it.  But a Sprint tells me that they'll have it Sunday.  And I'm supposedly getting any Wi-Fi only yet.  No, that's what you're that's what you're holding out for.  Now they're all reaching another darn handcuffs on me.  Sprint's going to have two to two data plans, a two gigabyte  with unlimited messaging, $30 a month, five gigabytes with unlimited messaging,  $60 a month.  And I imagine T-Mobile somewhere in there,  although T-Mobile tends to be a little more competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, nowadays you can get Virgin's  Wi-Fi, that's a good deal for 25 bucks unlimited.  So why pay them for the contract? Just Wi-Fi it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because it doesn't have Wi-Fi.  Now you know why, because people like you.  And by the way, that Virgin is Sprint. They own Virgin Mobile.  So I think we're just Virgin uses.  No, they know initially was Virgin uses the Sprint network.  A couple of years ago, they bought it outright.  So I think the reason you're getting that cut rate on a Wi-Fi from Virgin,  it's 20 bucks less than the parent company, is because they're moving to 4G.  They want to kind of want to clear out the 3G units.  I don't know. I mean, they'd like you to buy.  They do make an overdrive now that is dual 3G, 4G.  And I think that that's the reason they're saying, well,  we'd like to sell that at the Sprint stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just got a test unit of the clear wire one, the 4G,  which I haven't used yet in New York.  Unfortunately, it's not a Wi-Fi. It's a dongle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have 4G in Portland, Joel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there is 4G up here.  And I don't really I mean, I've played around it with 4G, everything,  at you know, whenever it's set up.  But I just use a good old 3G at home.  But yeah, Portland was one of the first test markets, actually. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I thought. Yeah. You were that's the first place they put clear wire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And there was a lot of talk when it first came out that,  you know, just like Wi-Fi and everything before it that, oh, we'll replace ISPs  with it and, you know, we won't have to use wires anymore.  But just from anecdotal experience, like, I don't know anybody using it like that.  So people are just kind of using it like slightly better 3G. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  T-Mobile says the Scalaxy Tab will be to, I'm sorry,  $399 with a two year contract.  That's rough. Or $599 with no contract to get a plan.  $25 a month for 200 megabytes of data.  That's that's more like the AT&T pricing.  And then for 40 month a month, you get five gigabytes.  So I think if you're a heavy data user, the 40 is better than 60 on Sprint.  So T-Mobile. But then now in that, you should really check the area  because some areas T-Mobile has is HSPA plus, which is actually pretty fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just can't imagine using a tablet or something like that for two years.  Like, like what an Android tablet is going to look like two years from now or a year.  Really good point.  It's like and you know, I buy tons of stuff, but I always sell it really quickly, too.  You know, like I just bought a new Air, so I'm selling my iPad,  but I'll probably get another iPad.  And, you know, it's like this whole cycle.  And I don't mind paying service fees for connectivity,  you know, 3G or whatever from the companies if I have to.  But I don't I don't want to sign contracts for every single gadget that I own.  That's just so silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I agree. And boy,  so what did what did your reviewer not like about the Galaxy Tab?  Was it was it that the Android didn't scale?  Besides the fact that the seven inches is the wrong size, was it?  How did the Android look? Did it scale well to seven inches?  That'd be my concern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, actually.  So you know how like when you have an iPad and you're and you're using  iPhone apps on an iPad, they look horrible and nobody does that.  So apparently on the tab on a seven inch screen,  taking an Android app and scaling it up is just it's not, you know,  it looks a lot better because the screen isn't that much bigger.  But that's kind of like the core of his negativity about the size is like  if you scale it up and it doesn't really change the way you use it that much.  Why bother?  Like, why bother having this whole extra device? Right.  So, you know, I think a lot of the criticisms, too, though.  This is typical Android problem, which is  if you're if you're operating outside of the Google experience,  like whatever their core Android distro is,  it's always a crap shoot on how good the manufacturers are going to tweak it.  And also, this is the first real implementation outside of  third party Chinese crap vendors who are making a proper tablet.  So, I mean, I feel like if you're really hard core into Android,  again, not having using not having used it like that,  I don't think this is any indication that Android is going to be a bad platform  for tablets.  And it'll probably get a lot better really quickly.  But it just seems like maybe this hardware isn't quite what people want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Looks like a team T-Mobile, anyway, is pushing entertainment.  They're pushing the Kindle app movies, music.  They see this as a as an entertainment, kind of like an Arcos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that's what everybody's pushed with tablets, even even Apple.  You know, like Apple will talk about productivity and all of that stuff.  But like if you I see most people using iPads in public on,  you know, on planes, reading things like consuming stuff and, you know,  not to get into the whole what is an iPad for argument.  But I think the reason that you see Amazon advertising the Kindle against  the iPad or like this the BlackBerry tablet that's coming out,  it's going to have, you know, is very entertainment focused for for rim.  It's incredibly entertainment focused playbook.  I think, yeah, yeah, the playbook.  Like, I just think that that's what people as a gift and at this price point  and at this like dollar amount, like this is what people are.  It's easier just to say to people, this is going to be for watching movies  and playing games and reading books than, you know, well, it's like a net book,  but it's not quite and it has these limitations.  And so, yeah, it's definitely like a all these media players that for years  we've been trying to get to take off Arcos and that whole PMP  Windows stuff years ago like these these tablets for all the extra capability  they have, that's still a lot of their core use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about the Google apps themselves?  I wonder how they look on it, because that would be my real goal for it  would be to, yes, watch entertainment, do email,  you know, and do the read the times, do that kind of stuff.  I'm not a game player, so it's not really going to matter to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I like games on the on the iPad and the iPhone, but yeah,  it's got to have most of the people I know who use the iPad use it  as a productivity tool as much as anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I mean, and I definitely do, too.  But I also feel like geek geeky use of iPads is maybe not the best.  It's maybe not indicative of the way most people are.  Yeah, that's probably true.  But I also think it's going to change a little bit, too.  Like you have to give these products time to expand and grow  and you have to give mainstream audiences time to understand what they even own.  So I think like you had with the iPhone,  and I don't think this was all a grand plan by Apple.  But one of the brilliant things about the iPhone was that it came out  and it had a few things that it was it was better at doing,  like browsing the web and just kind of the general interface.  But it couldn't do a lot of other stuff.  And Apple is really good at kind of like doling out a little more capability  and a little more capability as you go forward and teaching the audience  what they can do.  And so I think productivity on all these tablets is going to be  secondary, you know, as people go, hey, I'm you know, I brought this  so I can watch movies, but I'm going to try to edit a spreadsheet  and maybe this won't suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's always what it looked like.  The iPad looked like its success was that it filled a lot of niches.  And yeah, it's not good at anything. Yeah.  Well, I'm not sure I'd say that.  I mean, it's good. It's great.  It's great for watching movies.  It's great for it's actually pretty good for reading.  You're right. It's not as good as the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's not, you know, it's better to watch on a TV than an iPad.  And I love the iPad.  I think it's a great platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's if you were going to buy, if you're going to buy  a device other than a phone.  Well, I guess the wrong way to say it.  If you were going to buy an iPad, given the current choices,  do you think you'd go for the seven inch Android or Dell's five inch Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, gosh. Well, Dell's is a joke.  Wait, we look at that ad. Have you seen the Dell Streetcat?  It looks like they're holding something that's swole swole up.  It's just wrong.  It's just it's like a big candy bar like they're holding a Hershey bar.  It's just terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's funny that you say that because it's still smaller than, you know, in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but it's smaller than the iPad, too.  So there's but I'm saying is it's it's almost like uncanny valley.  There's an area in between two decent areas, which is a phone.  You know, the four four point three is as big as you can get, right?  The the Droid X or the EVO. Right. Yeah.  And the iPad, which is is the right size for the iPad.  And there's this those two work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the thing to me and this is, you know, tenuously about about Google.  But I do think there's when I hold an iPad and I use it,  I feel like it's right on the edge of being too small.  Like there's times where I'm like, oh, I wish this was just a little bit bigger.  Really? But I also don't want it to be bigger  because I want it to be portable and to carry it around and all of that stuff.  So I think a lot of the magic in any device screen size is finding  where that point of tension is, where it's like, OK, this is  I wish it was a little bit bigger, but I'm glad it's no bigger.  And the iPhone does that very well.  And the iPad does that very well.  And all of these other explorations of screen sizes,  I don't think there's a magic number, but I think it's it's  there's probably a magic zone that Apple's probably somewhere within it.  And there's not a lot of room to play there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So Steve is right. Steve is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know, are you are you tempted by any of these tablets yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, not yet. It's going to it's going to be a while.  They got the other way.  I'm not going to be tempted until Google says this is the right  version of Android to run on a tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what they're saying now?  And 3.0 is imminent, right?  Gingerbread. Yeah.  Although somebody said 2.3 is out coming out soon, too.  I'm very confused.  So there's 2.3, maybe an interim thing, then gingerbread,  because they already got the the gingerbread man.  And and and then but that but it turns out that it's honeycomb.  Really is what you want.  I'm very confused. Google's message is not clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It isn't. And this is an Android problem. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's hurting them, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're selling a lot of phones. God knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at some point, it becomes a generic device, I think, is that,  yes, there's the magic to the iPhone.  Fine. And the iPad.  But then beyond that, I went to the quadrangle force.  You know, wait a minute, just real quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at the phone in her hand.  They need to hire. This is the Dell Streak Ed.  They need to hire models with bigger hands.  Yeah, they do. We talk about players. Yeah.  Because look at that.  Just it looks there's something just.  Not right about it.  It's like, look how big that is.  I don't know. She carries it well, though.  She carries it well.  And then he's got one.  And look, they both have weird chocolate bars in their hands.  It's just not it's.  You're meant for each other.  Yeah. Oh, you're one of the three other people who have this phone.  We must be true love.  So that's a Dell Streak. That's a five inch.  Seven inches, not quite right.  Part of this also is really the operating system.  Apps have to.  This is this is what Steve actually said in that  earnings call, he said, it's a developer issue.  They're not thinking like developers are thinking like hardware manufacturers.  We can make it with he says, but we're software guys.  We think, yeah, but how is it going to look?  And can you make software that fits on a four on a three and a half, four, five,  seven and up screen that works in all of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's also, though, pocket size, right?  I think that the streak is the largest possible thing that will fit  well, at least a man's pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you know what, it'll fit in my jacket pocket or coat pocket.  But you know what? Yeah.  Jeff, you're the last man who still wears a jacket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it doesn't fit in my ironic overalls from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, gosh, but gosh, there you go.  But no, I think it has to fit in the in the breast pocket of your shirt, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I guess who even puts a phone in the breast pocket of their  phones or for pockets at best and maybe belt clips if you must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he got rid of his pocket protector, so just don't make fun of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're telling me that you think it's superior to have a belt  carrier than inhabit your front pocket pocket, like my pocket pocket.  No, because, well, I have keys in one and wallet in the other,  and I don't want to sit on it, so I can't put it in my butt pocket.  So it's got to go on the front.  And really, am I nerdy for putting my phone there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think you're supposed to put anything in your front pockets, I think,  except for handkerchiefs is like the only thing that is possibly supposed to go in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You want to know the real truth half the time.  I got two phones in my front pocket. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we're all outliers, you know, like if you've ever looked at a Scott  Evest and been like, well, maybe then you're like really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Joel, that's all I know.  This is a Scott Evest shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like Scott Evest stuff, but I'm just saying if you're at that point  where you're looking for cable runs in your shirt, like you can kind of.  It's a word within.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So that's why I keep my front pocket, because I have a hole there  that can go right up through here to the headphones and go around my back.  And it's never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All I'm saying is you're part of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just feel that it camouflages my man boobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And not accentuate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You took on geek boobs.  Oh, it might accentuate them. I never thought of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing, it accentuates just once.  You're like, you know, you got the like, uni boob.  I mean, that's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This really has changed my entire perspective on it.  So I'd like to rescind everything I said before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you were right.  They're agreeing with you.  Don't put it in your breast pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I think to get back to the size of things like it,  you're never going to put an iPad in your pocket,  which means it might be the right size, you know, and all these other tablets.  Anytime they should. This is so typical.  I mean, I've seen it hundreds of times over the years as a gadget blogger.  It's like they'll show you these model pictures of people using it.  And it has absolutely no relevance to the real world.  So you have to actually look out in the real world and see what people would do with it.  Or what I often do is take stuff and show my friends,  like at a bar or something, and say, like, what would you do with this?  And if they wouldn't put it in their pocket, then, you know, it's not no way else is going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're talking about Android, some Android sales numbers out.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  Gina's got a but you haven't set it up yet.  The Google TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not yet. I haven't received it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have mine. I've talked about it already a little bit.  Yeah, I'm going to ruin me.  You know, I'm really tempted to unhook it, but I'm going to wait until Gina.  You know, here's well, we'll talk about it in a second.  There's a there is a deal.  Have you seen this? This is the new Windows mobile phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw you showing.  I was watching your demo a little bit.  It's Windows. It's mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's sad.  It's slightly had this.  It's actually very snappy.  Had this come out before the iPhone and the Android phone?  You'd be going, this is the amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would that have come out before Android and iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, well, I guess not.  Not in that way. I guess not.  But you like it.  Well, it's fine.  But we already have Android and iPhone  and BlackBerry, if you want to be really generous.  And is there any logic to it?  Is that how the UIs are?  It's fine. I love it.  Yeah, you know, it's a nice UI.  It's it's it's very usable.  It's very it's I'll tell you what.  There's a lesson for Google in a couple of areas.  First of all, because Microsoft said this is the hardware spec  and you must adhere to the hardware spec,  all of them have the same five megapixel camera,  the same gigahertz processor.  This there is a varied amount of RAM and storage.  But essentially, you know, essentially you're getting an 800 by 480 screen.  There's a certain consistency across the hardware that is a good thing.  And that's one of the problems Android has.  But of course, Android is open.  You know, I was thinking about this this morning.  Google, of course, knew that that would be an issue,  but they chose from a philosophical point of view.  We prefer to open source it to keep the open handset alliance  to let the manufacturers do what they want with it because  and it's worked for them.  We're going to talk about those numbers in a bit.  But on the other hand, I think Microsoft can quite reasonably say, yes,  but look, this is a very consistent experience across the board.  This is the Samsung focus, which is very much like the Captivate,  the Galaxy S that Samsung has Android on.  So just think of it kind of as a Galaxy S.  Are you taking Pilates?  Yeah, every three times a week.  You should see my core.  I'm working on my it's all about the man boobs. So  so these are the tiles you see, and you can have your friends in the,  you know, you can have these everybody has a tile.  It's very people focused and socially focused.  So you see how quickly that works, though?  So you can see, I mean, there's just these are recent calls.  I don't see us there. We don't have tiles.  Well, you don't.  You would have a tile if you tweet or Facebook more often.  So I think you're on here somewhere, Jeff,  because I think you Facebook recently.  These are Facebook posts.  It's very social, like even if you go to the camera app.  You know, this was a little disconcerting at first,  because it's not just my pictures, it's other people's pictures  show up in the camera app.  So all my friends pictures are showing up here as well.  Those look pretty nice.  It's very pretty.  I mean, that this is that background is randomly chosen from my from my photos.  I mean, they've done a nice job with this.  It's a very good camera, by the way.  It's a five megapixel, very comparable to the iPhone.  The detail and the and the accuracy, I think, are very good.  So this is this is a great thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But if they stick with it, like if they actually follow through,  which has been Microsoft's problem in devices for the last few years,  they've got a great start.  Like I think they'll end up selling quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've only sold 40, according to some reports, 40,000.  And I have to say, when I went in to buy this, I was the only one.  I thought I was buying an iPhone.  I don't know. I went in half an hour before the store opened.  It was kind of quiet.  There was like nobody.  And then they opened the door.  And I'm the one guy standing in front.  I can remember waiting in line at this AT&T store three years in a row  for an iPhone where there's crowds.  The big deal. They're opening the door.  They're opening the door. Guys, yeah, come on in.  I'm here to buy a.  A focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's not going to be a big consumer.  It's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you know how many they had, Joel, in stocks?  Two. Two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, like that's all they had actually gotten in to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had two.  So when you hear T-Mobile said, we're sold out of the HD7, you might ask.  And how many was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's OK.  I mean, how many G1s were sold three years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is better than the G1.  This is infinitely better than the G1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These will be sold through like channel partnerships and, you know,  there's these are going to happen in the same kind of consumer way.  And if they end up nailing some of like the Xbox integration

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and stuff like that, where they did nail the Xbox integration, it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But extending it so that it becomes like if you have an Xbox,  that it's almost essential that you have a Windows 7 phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's my there's me. That's my little me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's cool. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And my achievements go right to the Xbox.  Some of these games can round trip from the Xbox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also, don't forget that, you know, Kotaku this week had a all  but confirmation not to plug a bunch of other Gawker sites,  especially Kotaku, which is horrible. Just kidding.  But like they we've pretty much  Microsoft's confirmed to both me and Kotaku that without confirming  that their Kinect technology is coming to their phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so you could wave at the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So eventually these phones are going to end up being  little Kinect projectors, too.  And that's pretty amazing.  Like that gives them a hook that Apple, you know, is working on clearly  from the acquisitions and patents and such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This doesn't have the voice everywhere that Android has, but it's pretty,  you know, it's close this week in Google.  Let's see.  You know, it's it's it's pretty decent.  I mean, so that's Bing.  I think I was saying other things, so it didn't it only heard the Google.  But, you know, I mean, it does it does.  It's actually not a bad phone.  It sinks, by the way, with my Google accounts, although you have to.  It's a little non intuitive.  You have to choose Outlook to sync to the Google accounts.  But once you do, because it's using EAS, but once you do it, my Google,  all my stuff, Google propagated over as well as Facebook and Twitter and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So is this going to be the phone that sort of big companies  with IT departments based like heavily in exchange are going to want?  I mean, is this going to be the phone that they feel comfortable with?  I mean, I feel like Xbox and exchange or Outlook, you know, kind of are.  It's a very, it's a very consumery phone, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to tell you, I mean, it's not it's not a businessy phone.  It's not a BlackBerry, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but everybody, all those consumer or all those business phones  are moving in a consumer direction.  And think how many times, you know, a couple of years ago,  you were hearing complaints from sysadmins saying, you know,  we've got all these execs wanting iPhones on our network.  And how do we integrate all that?  And, you know, all the phones are moving together.  I don't think there's going to be a big difference between business and and consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I guess in a way, that's the point is that this looks very much this.  I mean, it's unique.  And they were smart to do the tiles because you look at it  and you immediately know it's a Windows phone.  But it's very much influenced by Android and and iPhone.  And, you know, it's it's basically the same hardware as everybody else is doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of like it. It's just it's not to their credit.  The thing that all the hardware and all the phones in the world right now  are, you know, except for things in the periphery are pretty much the same.  So the only thing that's really differentiating differentiating things  is UI and is is design.  And the fact that Microsoft is taking, I mean, they're leading in some ways.  They're going in a different direction than Apple, which Google did not do at all.  Android, for as much as it's done right, is pretty much,  you know, a feature for feature clone of iOS.  And, you know, it's I think it's surprising that Microsoft is the one  that's gone in that direction.  But devices, E&E has always been that that group within Microsoft  that's been willing to take those risks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This feels much less geeky.  This I can see why they might and have pitched this at  feature phone owners, you know, and non geeks.  I mean, it is it would be a logical upgrade for somebody with a feature phone  who is scared of the complexity of smartphones, particularly of Android.  This is very I've given it to a number of people who said,  can you figure it out? No trouble.  I mean, it's very easy and and it feels to this day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Android, I love them.  It will throw me once in a while. I'll miss the logic of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we know that we know that about you.  And this has things that Apple does not have that are very nice in Android.  A back button, a search button.  It has you press and hold to do, you know, kind of like the right  click style, contextual stuff.  All of that is intuitive, I think, for and really is not there.  And in fact, when I go back to an iPhone from an Android phone,  I really miss the back button.  It's like I just want to do what I was doing a second ago.  What I got to exit out. I got to go to the but even the.  What are notifications like on a Windows phone?  Notifications are very much like Android.  You can really see how they've kind of cross pollinated.  They come in at the top in a bar here.  There isn't a pull down thing. You have to tap it.  But it I think it's better than iPhone,  although it's a little more modal than Android.  It's not you know, Android still is the winner on notifications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. Oh, yeah.  That is the one thing that Google is just dominated, I think.  And I'm shocked that iOS does not have anything even close to it.  Oh, it's ridiculous. It's yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, and I hear, you know, you hear.  Apple people.  Shh. They they they say things like John Grubberow say things.  Well, it's just better.  And I'll say, well, feature by feature. What is what?  No, no, it just feels better.  I just like it better. It's more aesthetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The pixels are aligned perfectly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like, no, no. But what's the feature?  No, no, you don't understand.  It's not about features. It's about fit and finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's about all of those things, though.  It can be about all that's very subjective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And to say this phone is better because of my subjective opinion  that it has a better feel is not it's not an argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a welcome to gadget reviewing.  Oh, yeah, I can imagine.  I mean, that's basically first of all, I think it's totally fair  to say that something has a feel and you can quantify what feel is,  if it's precision, if it's responsiveness, you know, and the iPhone  and the iOS stuff does.  You saw everybody, I think, or all the geeks saw the the touchscreen grid  test where they showed how the iOS devices were more accurate than,  you know, Android, which was slightly more accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I've been around a lot. I'm older than you, Joel.  I remember when people said the same thing about windows  and mousing. Oh, the Mac mouse is direct drive.  The Windows mouse isn't. It's just not quite the same.  You know what? Give me a break.  That's why Windows and Mac just completely  just slaughtered windows in the marketplace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem is an aesthetic argument doesn't guarantee sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not only does it not guarantee sales, it doesn't resonate with anybody.  It's it's an elitist argument. It just feels better.  My Mercedes just drives better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a bit it obviously resonates with, you know, 100 million iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's talk about sales in just a second.  I've been meaning to take a break, but we will get to those numbers  in just a second before I do, though.  I have to tell you about a great company called Citrix  that just feels better.  It is actually Citrix is kind of like the the Mercedes of remote access.  If you if you know the name Citrix, you know, you're working in enterprise.  You know all about Citrix and the consumer products are just as good  and really easy to use.  I'm going to give you an example.  Go to Assist Express, which is their support product.  Now, look, you're a geek. You know a little bit about support.  In fact, I know a lot of people who listen are in IT or support software.  But all of us, at least at the very least, support family and friends.  This is a program you will like.  Now, if you do it occasionally, they do have a day pass.  But this is really aimed at the professional support person.  And the monthly fee is so affordable.  And it means you can have unlimited support sessions.  You can do even you can even have eight going on at any one time.  So you could start an installer, a scan on one machine,  move to the next, move to the next.  So it's very efficient with your time unattended support.  But best of all, the people you're supporting don't have to have it  installed ahead of time.  All you have to do is send them a link.  They click the link 30 seconds later.  You're in fixing their system.  I want you to try go to Assist Express free for 30 days.  I've been using it for more than 10 years, and it's better and better and better.  I can go on and on about the great features.  You know, they go to Assist Express.  Users say they get this is a recent study, 40 percent increase in productivity  by using go to Assist Express.  And I believe it because I see how fast and easy it is to use.  I just use it with family and friends.  If you're a pro, you're going to love it.  Try it right now by going to go to assist dot com  slash twig twig, go to assist dot com slash twig.  30 days, absolutely free.  It is the best remote support product out there. Period.  But you don't have to take my word for it.  Try it free for 30 days.  Android smartphone sales top 20 million.  20 million in the third quarter alone.  Forty four percent of the market.  Now, we always say how big Nokia is in this.  Twenty only twenty nine and a half million.  So while Nokia is doing well, Symbian is doing well,  is still the best selling worldwide.  Android is coming on strong.  It's not hard to imagine a quarter or two from now.  Android being easily the best selling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that answers your earlier question about not sticking to one size and one spec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that that does, doesn't it?  Google made the right choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they made the right choice if they want to have their OS on the most devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and if you're Google, that's what you want. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, in theory, I'm still a little iffy on how much revenue  they're actually bringing in from those mobile devices.  But maybe it's just about getting the groundwork out there and, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doing something. Absolutely.  There's just tons of value that's going to come back in terms of advertising  opportunities, data back and all kinds of things.  Schmidt has said he said last January that, you know, he has the he and she  who has the most installs will have the most developers will get the best apps  and around and around that virtuous cycle goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's there.  There's a really important point with the Windows phone.  The key for Microsoft, they know it is developers.  Yeah, they've got to get apps on here.  They have actually quite a good set of original apps, but they need to get  the key apps like Evernote and so forth.  And if they don't, I'm not going to switch because I need my apps.  Gartner Group says that Symbian will continue to outsell Android,  at least in the next quarter due to pricing.  It's interesting.  The number of total number of smartphones, according to Gartner,  I think Gartner is pretty good on this, is 81 million units worldwide  in the third quarter, but that's still only 20 percent of all phones sold.  So the market has lots of room to grow.  Android in the in the second place spot with 20.5 million  one year ago, take a guess.  Are these your numbers, Jeff?  OK, take a guess.  They got 20 million in the last quarter, the quarter a year ago.  Two. You have one point four million  to go from one point four to 20 million  in just a year.  Their share of the worldwide smartphone market, 25 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's that's I hate to bring it up, Gina,  because I know every time we do it, it's like a stab to your to your solar plexus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not going to bring up Wave again, are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because it does explain why something like Wave can be seen as a failure to kill.  When you see that's the hockey stick standard they have.  That's the kill. Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bemoan that a little bit, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's public companies in this tech industry have to do that.  And I don't think that that's a I mean, if I had to double my  or whatever that is, it's not even doubling.  If I have had 20 times sales every year, I wouldn't be around.  What company can do? Very few companies can sustain that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's true.  But but I understand that the Wall Street expects it in the tech industry.  But don't you think there'll be a lot of great companies out there  that only groove 10 percent or 20 percent a year?  You know, it's an interesting thing in the news business is people are talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  creating, you know, the low profit company.  And and I didn't fully understand that till I looked at Craigslist.  There's a great example.  Because it is because it's a choice.  And is he not operating under there?  It not operate under its fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders.  That is eBay. And that becomes the fight.  So you kind of need permission to be low profit.  But that strikes me as a failure.  I have my students come to my class and say, I want to be not for profit.  And I say, no, no, no, I'm going to turn you into a greedy bastard.  And and sustainability and profit are good.  But I get it, Leo.  I think you're right. There's there's there's not a middle ground.  There's not a way, you know, Google's success does give it some freedom,  but also becomes imprisonment for them.  Imprisonment, how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they have to grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow, grow.  They have to grow, grow, grow, grow, grow.  You think they have to do that again next year?  Yeah, that's hard. That's really hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Schmitz, Eric says the biggest challenge they have is growth and it's the double edged sword.  Right. Grow this much. You have to keep growing that much.  It's really hard to grow that much when you've already grown that much.  Well, you have to enter new markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Google entered the cell phone market because you couldn't grow search that at that rate.  So they enter the cell phone market and they were able to do that.  But then it can't be in this.  I mean, you're not going to grow another 20 times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And then B is then you get worse and worse and worse at right hand meet left hand.  Chrome and you know, meet Android.  And how does all that work?  And that becomes harder and harder and harder.  And that has been a lot of Google's problem lately.  So size is its own enemy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gartner also says component shortages are more likely to hit Android than Symbian.  I would imagine iPhone as well.  Things like these screens.  I know these Super AMOLED screens are, you know, in great short supply.  NAND, memory flash, that kind of stuff.  So you could see that you might not be able to grow this market just because you can't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the next market for Android has to be feature phones in developing countries.  Like, you know, the reason Nokia even exists still in any form is not because of the smartphone stuff.  So ignore all the smartphone Symbian stuff.  It's all of these handsets they're selling to India and maybe China less.  I don't know in China specifically, but they're selling developing economy phones.  And so if the materials cost for these older smartphones, especially Android phones,  could get down low enough and there could be like a local company that localizes the interfaces and things like that,  it's entirely possible that Android could come in and start chewing through the feature phone market in India.  And if you do that, then all of a sudden you have hundreds of millions of units a year open  that isn't even the smartphone market necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting.  I would never have thought the feature phone market would be desirable,  but that's us geeks again saying, well, why would you want a feature phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think the idea, well, an idea is that like the division between feature phone and smartphone is really goofy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. It's not really a feature phone.  It's like a less smartphone.  A simple phone, a phone you can text, tweet, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We kind of used to say like a smartphone was a phone you could put apps on or before there were even apps,  but something where you could put software on it and that made it a smartphone.  But then you got like Mossberg calling things super smartphones and the whole thing is silly.  Like it really at this point comes down to cost almost than anything else.  Like is it a cheap phone that gets like a crazy long battery life and is durable and local people can fix and support?  Like that might be an iPhone, that might be an Android phone, but it's like it's external factors at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a news story last week about just that.  I can't remember who it was.  I'm looking up now and not finding it.  That said that there was development effort.  It's like the, you know, it's the Holy Grail, like Negroponte's $100 laptop.  Ah, yeah.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And those projects have always been ridiculous.  Like, I mean, no offense to Negroponte, who I have a lot of respect for, for other things he's done.  Like the $100 laptop idea is so silly because there's you're basically creating a whole new market that has it doesn't even really reflect what the existing markets reflect in those places.  Like if you look at Africa, like the most common scenario in any, you know, Africa is a big thing to generalize.  But you have a lot of people just using like one phone in a village, you know, of 50 people or whatever and trying to do like these one laptop per child projects that have no greater infrastructure within capitalism is a really weird way to try to distribute that stuff.  I think it's a lot more likely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right.  And the next three billion people who are going to come on the Internet are going to come on through phones, they say.  I think so.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And the more phones that we can put out there, the more connectivity they have, the more they'll be able to learn, the more they'll be able to do transactions and economics, the more they'll be able to do all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the beautiful thing about Android is for as much as it frustrates me that it fragments just like, you know, all these open source operating systems do, like all it's going to take is one person in those local markets who knows better than any of the Western companies what they need to take that baseline of Android and do it.  And then all of a sudden that could be another millions and millions of customers for Google that they didn't even know they were going to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, Joel, the other key to this is that we tend to think one phone per person or two phones per person and our five phones per person for us.  And instead, what it is, is multiple people per phone.  And I saw a story again.  I can't find it right now, but an entrepreneur in developing world was creating the infrastructure to be able to have multiple accounts on one phone.  So I gave it to the phone for a while to that's transitional, transitional.  But we want the transition.  The transition is good.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if they distribute these phones with Google Voice built in, they're really they're providing the service to text and the call to which is just kind of more opportunities for actual advertising.  Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google Voice might be the killer app for a feature phone.  Interesting.  And carriers like it because they do a lot of infrastructure stuff like voicemail.  You don't have to do now.  Moving along.  Let's see.  We did the Galaxy.  We did the how about now that you're getting your Google TV, more more blockage and more stuff I can't get on more stuff you can't get on it.  Now, in fact, sci fi.  Why would sci fi block the freaking Google TV?  Come on, dudes.  I'm sorry.  Is it Sifi?  S Y.  I know it's sci fi and fancast.com back door.  Fancast is the Comcast Xfinity thing was a back door to Hulu.  I actually was using that because I get a lot of the Hulu shows that way.  Apparently that's been blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're going to just keep seeing this forever.  There's never been an industry like the content industry that loves to fight, you know, like the video content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that a problem for Google TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what happens is this.  I went to the quadrangle four square conference today, which has no relationship to the four square we know and it's a bunch of CEOs in the audience.  And it's all off the record, but nothing of note is said because they're all public companies.  And Tim Armstrong and Michael Eisner announced a deal today in which Eisner, you know, who knows his crap about making entertainment, is going to make some stuff that will have an exclusive period on AOL.  And Mary distribution and content.  And so I asked, you know, are we going to are we now at the tipping point where we see something major come and and make it make the Internet work as a entertainment medium?  Is that, you know, are we going to find Howard Stern as he's threatened to go to the Internet?  Are we going to find the next modern family kind of brand works on the Internet?  And, you know, they they said, yeah, because they want it to be that case.  But I think when that happens, you start to see the unwrapped, the unbundling and unraveling of TV that a channel is a level of curation that we needed in the past.  You know, like a newspaper that the need of which goes away because you're going to find stuff wherever.  And of course, Google becomes the mechanism to be that new curator at a curatorial level.  And channels are what it's only part of the process of killing them.  Someone else at this thing said a big executive said when asked about Braze Media said the broadcast channels are toast.  The fact that Fox and cable.  Yeah, they fought for a week.  And, you know, the government is stepping in here in a very non-market way.  This whole idea of retransmission fees is a false propping up of the old channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the FCC's requirement.  What goes along with must carry, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That you can either demand carriage or demand money.  And if you're local, if you're if you're if you're Fox carrying the the World Series, then you demand.  Now you demand money.  And Cablevision tried not to try to negotiate and finally did cave.  But I still think this is the beginning of the end for the channels because they're all going to get get carriage.  CBS now brags that they're they're depending on on carriage fees as much as advertising.  Where does that money come from?  So we're going to pay more for our cable for more channels we don't want.  It's going to hit a big bad point.  And then out of nowhere, some big brand is going to is going to create a hit.  It's a hit on AOL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We keep waiting for that to happen with the guild and with Dr. Horrible.  And if Felicia Day is not in it, I guess it's got no hope.  But we keep waiting for somebody to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know what it's going to be.  But I think it's you, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, this is different.  So that's episodic television or episodic content.  And then we also talk about news content.  I think that that's going to happen first.  The stuff that we're doing on Twitter, for instance, is much it's much easier to move  to that from CNN or from that.  That's a natural little harder for episodic television.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So something organic could be a personality like Stern reality.  It's reality.  Reality.  Absolutely.  So something's going to break here.  And when that happens, well, you're going to find it obviously through digital first.  There may be some of the guys said this conference day aftermarket for that on a cable channel  or broadcast channel.  But it's but it's its first release is going to be the Internet.  And so when that happens, the whole need to have channels pretty much goes away.  And so what you're seeing are the death throes of the old channel structure.  Now, last piece of this, though, is that so cable vision tried to basically unbundle Fox.  It basically said, hey, folks, go watch Glee.  Oh, we've mentioned the Glee again on the Internet.  Don't watch it on Fox because I really want to pay him this money.  And of course, it didn't happen.  But that's where they're going.  But the problem for cable vision was they got unbundled themselves first.  They forced me to buy all these channels.  I don't want is worse than forcing me to get all these shows.  I don't want to pay for now on Fox.  And so there is there's a tipping point that's waiting to happen and they're going to resist  for a long time.  The cable networks will benefit from this new world, but it's going to be a painful  transition.  The channels will not benefit and they'll die and we'll have a new world of TV.  But it's going to be a really ugly transition, just like the transition of news and newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry for the no, I think that this is it's very interesting.  And, you know, everybody's trying to figure out how this how this is going to play.  And somebody said in the chat room, and I think this is absolutely true.  Still, people, 90 percent of people watch TV on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yeah, I think the death of of television is pretty exaggerated.  Like the corporate I can dream, Kenny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think that you're going to see this.  You're seeing the cracks in it, though, aren't you?  Yeah, we've been seeing the cracks for 15 years.  Like, don't be impatient.  These things take time.  In the words of the Wicked Witch of the West, these things take time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We all work online and make our living because the Internet and we're all in our way, you  know, geeky Internet people.  But like, there's still huge, huge content industries.  The lion's share of that stuff is being produced through the old media structures.  And they're not they do tons of stupid stuff.  Don't get me wrong.  But like, they still have a lot of clout and they creatively are still where a lot of people  end up going.  So, you know, Joss Whedon has a great success with with Dr.  Horrible, but that didn't stop him from going on and making dollhouse, you know, like,  because some of these are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, in fact, he did Dr. Horrible during the strike because, you know, it was just something  to do.  Dollhouse is where his money is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a dream that Nick Denton, my friend Nick, your friend Nick, our friend Nick.  He's not my friend Nick.  The rest of the rest of the three of us.  I never met him.  I don't know.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Well, it's on our backs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is someone like him, right?  Right.  A talent like he like like Nick can come up with a new concept of reality TV, let's say,  and celebrity TV and the new TMZ TV doesn't appear on a channel.  It appears here because he loves the independence of it.  That he can make something good enough for TV, but he's going to make it cheap.  He's going to make it different.  He's going to make it for TV and it's going to work as a business just like.  Right.  Right.  Is not going to be as big as CNN was, but it's profitable.  Right, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  But it's I mean, it's it's a dinky compared to that.  But that's the new future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The effort to make blockbusters blockbusters will always be possible, but they will become  ever and ever and ever harder to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there and because of the Internet, cheap Internet distribution and cheap means of production,  you can see a lot of small, profitable, you know, little fishies in the sea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  So what does Google do?  Back to your question now.  What does Google do about Google TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm a little worried.  You know, just by the way, the boxy box is like any minute now.  In fact, I just checked Amazon.  It said in stock.  So it's not just Google TV.  It's a lot of devices.  Maybe the boxy box will be the one.  I don't know.  But what's clear is the content providers have made a very big distinction between watching  a show over the Internet on a computer versus watching a show on the Internet on a television.  It seems to me an arbitrary distinction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does completely arbitrary and kind of nutty.  They haven't for whatever reason, the content providers for video haven't been that inclined.  I think a lot of it is they watch music get really steep.  They watch Apple take a chunk out of music and they're really afraid to let that go.  Yes, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it's also, Joel, you're right, because it's ad supported, which is Google's whole  business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But I think you're almost, Jeff, I think you're almost on something where I feel like a lot  of the...  That's usually where I am in life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On to something, on to something.  On to something, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, stop right there.  Go ahead.  It's all about content, I think, ultimately, and it's about things that people want to  watch.  Well, we want it to be all about content.  Absolutely.  Well, I think it is, though, but I think it's about the amount of money it still takes to  create the kind of content we want to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's going down.  That's those blockbusters you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not going down in certain ways.  I think the middle is going away and expensive things are more expensive and cheap things  are cheaper.  Here's the risk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the risk.  And I think that this is a very real risk, although others don't, that if you do things  like block Gina for all of this stuff that she wants to watch, she's just going to go  to BitTorrent.  The real risk is this is what the music industry realized is if you don't make it digitally  available legally, people will get it illegally.  So that's when they finally came around and said, all right, well, we better everybody  but the Beatles.  We better sell it on iTunes because otherwise people are going to see Rob us blind.  And they gave up on these backhanded measures to preserve it by lawsuit and prosecution.  And they said, all right, we give up.  We're going to sell it digitally.  I think they've got to do this.  And it's not that it's not that the business model, blah, blah, blah.  It's going to come down.  Fundamentally, people are just going to steal it from you.  If you don't do it, they're going to steal it.  If I want to watch a sci fi TV show and I don't get it on my Google TV, I always have  BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but I wonder how much of that I think I don't think they're losing as much to piracy.  I certainly don't think they're losing as much piracy as they always claim.  They will increasingly.  But I think that maybe I think more they're just losing possible sales.  They're losing the opportunity.  It's an opportunity cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, but it's still a significant opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're talking about Comcast, we're talking about the people that are actually distributing  a lot of this content and a lot of the channels.  They're still making money hand over fist.  So they're not in a situation where the initial borderline profits.  I mean, Hulu just had what?  A $250 million revenue quarter, I want to say.  Maybe it was a year.  That's good, but that's chump change for a big media company to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, in fact, the media companies see it as incremental value.  They don't see it.  They see it as we already made the show.  We'll let the kids watch it on their computers.  But they damn well better not watch it on the TVs because that's where we're making the  money.  But that's all I'm saying is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry.  All I'm saying is that I think there's something that hasn't quite been done yet, which is  to make something that is a cultural has the cultural impact of a madman or a soprano's  or something that I keep thinking that I keep thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think I want to do an audio because it's so cheap to do audio.  I think there's got to be a Matthew Weiner out there who can't get on HBO or AMC and  says, what if I just did not even a video version, but an audio version of this?  I'm waiting for the if somebody did The Wire on audio and it was so compelling that you  had to listen the next week and the week after that, something like that could tumble.  It's it's we do we acknowledge it's a house of cards and it could be tumbled if somebody  would just come along and tumble it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's their motive to own it.  I think that's the key.  You know, Howard Stern has talked about this now and it's the.  That's what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he wants to own it.  When the creative when the creatives finally say, I give up on these Fakatka networks,  they haven't had a choice.  They don't realize yet that they have a choice.  So they're just doing it the way they've done it all along.  They're going to Hollywood with their script in their hand.  But they don't have to do that anymore.  When they start realizing that eliminate the middleman, they go direct to their audience.  I think that they could change the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, did you see the commuter the movie made entirely on the Nokia and eight?  No, I just sent you the link.  All right, let me see on on on Google Docs.  I just got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, I will never get it because you're there.  Oh, I see.  I can't I can't somehow make that.  I mean, I could get rid of you and play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel like we need more just we've been making that crossover.  And also, we I would love to see Howard make that make that shift and then kind of  younger filmmakers can can kind of emulate that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is why it takes 15 years, Joel, is because it takes a generation  that doesn't have it in their head that you go to Hollywood with your script and you  beg and plead and say, can you please greenlight my deal?  It's not about money.  I think it's about habit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's a lot about money, though, too.  Like even if you have a huge success on the Internet that you produce, using all the  opportunity that technology gives you, there's still a lot more money.  I disagree.  And I think I think, yeah, I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I think creatives are not driven by money.  They're driven by control.  They're driven by a lot of things.  And and I think that you're going to see a new generation that says, first of all,  that doesn't have the expectation.  If you're a rock and roll band and you look and say, geez, I want to do as well as  Aerosmith and ACDC did.  I want a triple platinum album.  Those days are are going away.  And I think musicians are going to rapidly come to the conclusion.  I just like to make a living.  And I think that you're going to get to that point as well with content creators.  People want it's not just money, it's control.  It's it's a relationship to the audience.  It's there's other stuff.  Yeah. And I think Howard's a very good example.  Now you got half a billion dollars.  Yeah, I'm serious.  I mean, you're in that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's control. But a good look at the bottom at the bottom of the Google Doc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like this. This is the end eight.  So now, but they're not really this is on YouTube.  They're not releasing this in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no. This is to demonstrate the possibility.  And obviously, we know you can do a cheap camera, but it still it still says that you  can do it. Amazing. They put it on a nice holder and it looks pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm seeing really good, high quality, Hollywood quality stuff done on DSLRs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we shoot we shoot everything with DSLRs now and they are amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Why buy a camcorder?  You'd be nuts to buy a camcorder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you still want writers and talent and all that stuff.  That's where expense comes in.  But you're not paying gaffers to sit on their on their ass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gaffers to sit on your affers.  So the commuter.  Let me see here. Let me get the highest quality.  This is from Nokia, UK on YouTube.  You know, only three hundred seventy nine thousand views, which is kind of in.  How long has this been around?  Not that long.  So this is shot on an eight camera phone.  Yep. The whole thing. Wow. Looks good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the N8 has a pretty good image.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably 720p, right?  I think so. Yeah.  Oops, I'm sorry. You're not seeing anything.  Well, we pushed the button.  We see that the ad for SquarePace.  Yeah. Yeah, that's what you're seeing.  You see my ad copy.  So this looks pretty good.  Ozzy, it's OK. It's just a movie, Ozzy.  Well, that's the point is that the means of production and distribution  are virtually free or very low cost.  But creatives are, you know, talent is what's valuable.  Well, somebody to write and edit, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that I feel like Google to bring it back to this,  because this was actually where I where I had initially meant to go,  is I never quite understood why Google doesn't fund some content.  Well, they're doing journalism, right? Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's why.  Because they'll find themselves in the exact same pickle  they were in with Google Books.  They are in channel conflict.  You know, by the way, they'll play to the way  choose to point into their own stuff at the expense of others.  And then you're going to find that that becomes an antitrust issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, that that guy in the star of the movie, you know who that is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he looks familiar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, slumdog millionaire. Oh, right.  Dev Patel and Eileen Rivera just told me.  Yeah, the commuter.  You know, obviously, Nokia probably spent a lot of money,  millions on him and the director and the writer and the shooters.  But I know I think that those talents aren't  aren't restricted.  There's got to be a whole generation growing up with these skills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you get rid of the middlemen and you don't go through the sieve  that is Hollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're not building a big house for some guy who made the deal.  So you get a little more, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at this, Leo. I'm on TV.  Right. I'm on TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You put me here. I'm on TV, Ma.  Yeah, I think it's I think we're you know, this is why it takes a long time.  Not it's not that the technology takes a long time.  Old habits die hard.  It took more. It took it took almost 100 years  after the invention of movable type for anybody to do anything  but print more Bibles.  But after a while, people said, oh, you know, and novels and plays  and the reformation happened.  It just takes a little while.  Now, I think it's happening faster with the Internet than it than in 80 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it just I realized I wrote these the syllabus for my class  and new business models for our new M.A. degree in in entrepreneurial journalism.  And I realized that what I have to teach is disruption.  Yeah, that's right.  And that's that's the lesson.  And so I'm going to I'm going to have the students take on a weak  underbelly of something in the old media and do a plan of how to disrupt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting is I sitting here on this new on this new media approach,  which is essentially a ball, a 65 centimeter inflated ball.  And and I realized that I'm only here for a few years  and then somebody is going to come along and disintermediate me. That's fine.  I you know, I think that that's exciting.  You want to live in a time where these things kind of.  Get get tossed up and and and and disrupted, and that's good.  And I think it will get disrupted.  I think you're right, Jeff, that Google's role is not as a disruptor  that they and they probably are smart enough to think we can just sit back.  We're just providing the pipes, providing the means, providing the search.  I want to talk about they're doing something interesting with YouTube, though.  We're going to talk about that.  Something called topics.  But before we get there, I would like to talk a little bit about Squarespace.com,  which is a tool for disruption as well, a way you can create a website. Look, if  the other day I was looking for a business, it didn't have a website.  And I said, you know, I don't go.  What do you, huh?  Do you do you do you think a business these days can survive without a website?  And maybe you're scared off and say, well, I'm not going to do a website.  I don't know anything about it.  And I can't figure out how to find a designer and go to Squarespace.com.  They start with these 60 great templates  you can customize without knowing anything about design and get a great site.  If you go to the examples page here,  you can see featured sites, blogs, design and art.  But there's also e-commerce.  There's restaurants, there's wineries, there's plumbers.  It's all here.  Any anything that look at this is exercise equipment.  These guys, this is a big business.  They created a website very easily on Squarespace.com.  Now, they get some real advantages here.  First of all, all the hosting, all the technical stuff is done by Squarespace.  All the updates, you don't have to worry about security ever  because your software is always up to date.  Squarespace takes care of that.  All the bandwidth is always there.  You never run out of bandwidth on Squarespace.com.  They have very sophisticated Java based VPS solution that  I don't have to get technical on you, but it really  you cannot bring a Squarespace site down.  Here's a lot of restaurants use Squarespace.  If you have a small business and you don't have a presence on the Internet,  I can't imagine you're listening to this show, but maybe you know somebody.  I think the people who listen to this show are the kind of people  that businesses come to and say, I need a website.  What do I do?  Just tell them Squarespace.com.  In fact, tell them Squarespace.com slash twig.  They can click the try it free button.  You know what?  Alex Lindsay was in a restaurant the other day.  He, they didn't have a website before he left the restaurant.  He whipped out his laptop.  He set up a site.  He's, you know, there's no credit card or anything.  You just set it up and you've got it.  And he literally put together a site using their templates and said, here,  if you want it, uh, you know, I'll transfer it over to you.  Here's the password.  It's yours.  That's the kind of thing I mean, and it starts at $12 a month for hosting and  all the software, everything you need.  If you do use the promo code twig, you'll save 10% a month for the rest of your  site, the life of your site forever, basically.  So do use that promo code twig when you set it up.  This is just a great solution.  They, uh, things like, uh, we use, we, on our inside Twit blog, we use  the Squarespace iPhone, uh, uh, app, not to, not merely to post, but  also to moderate comments.  And view site stats.  It's really great to make sure you don't have spam in your comments,  that kind of thing.  That's just fantastic.  Squarespace.com slash twig.  Try it free for 15 days.  You can even import your existing site.  If you have one movable type WordPress, type add or blogger, APIs are supported.  And then if you decide to buy, use the offer code twig and you'll save big  every single month, 10% a month.  I love Squarespace.  Lots of friends using it.  We use it for our blog.  It's just fantastic.  So interesting move.  Uh, Google's going to add.  Now, one of the things that Google does right now, when you go to YouTube,  you watch a video, you get related videos.  And actually, I think that's a bone of contention because if you're a content,  like I'm a content creator, sometimes those related videos, I don't really  don't want them to show up.  You can't turn them off or they're inappropriate.  Now they're going to do something called topics.  If you, I haven't seen these yet, but apparently they're  starting to appear on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tonight they seen it reported.  It's supposed to show up in test tube, which is there like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you have to go test tube.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  There are labs area and I'm not seeing it in mine right now.  Um, but yeah, no, these topics are basically going to be, they're  going to look like tags, but they're more than that.  Um, I've seen that, uh, this is Tom Krasik writing for CNET said that  they're the product of sophisticated analysis of comments, viewing patterns  and other signals that will automatically appear above videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's kind of like related videos, but better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Right.  That sounds like that's the goal.  Yeah.  So if you search for Lady Gaga, this screenshot here, you'll get, uh, kind  of explore, you'll see Justin Bieber, poker face, Miley Cyrus, Katy Perry,  kind of related, related videos that you might be interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one of the problems I have, you know, even I'm even looking at  my recommendations on YouTube and you know, one of them is my own video.  Uh, white tiger wants to play.  I don't know why that's recommended.  Uh, some of it makes sense.  Some of it makes no sense at all.  And I think that they could do a much better job.  I know that's a hard thing.  Recommendations are a hard thing to do, but topics might be the solution.  Just give me some keywords and I can, I can drill deeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They just need to recommend Kit Kat videos to everyone and, and,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you all get the same stupid recommendations.  Do you think they're paying for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm asking you, would you pay Leo to control some of that recommendation space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't even think of that.  Of course you put those topic words and then one of them sponsored.  Right.  Doi those Google guys is always thinking.  We met, did we mention the Google maps border dispute or was that on  Twitter we talked about that?  We haven't been on Twitter.  It's pretty amazing.  The latest now, the Nicaraguan embassy in London says the government of Nicaragua  has formally requested Google not to accept the formal petition of the  government of Costa Rica to modify the border demarcation to see apparently a  Costa Rican general used the Google maps to justify invading Nicaragua saying,  no, no, that's our territory.  Google says we got the data from the U S government.  Go complain to them.  That's just what happens when you make maps.  Google did post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did they say who actually, cause I, is this actually Google's map or is  this something they bought from the state department?  Oh, that's sunny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you go to Bing maps, by the way, you get a different interpretation  of where the border is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is the best fan boy war that I've ever seen.  If you're a Microsoft fan boy, then you are on this side of the border.  Right.  You're a Google fan boy.  You're with guns over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yesterday, we became aware of a dispute that referenced the border between  Costa Rica and Nicaragua as depicted on Google maps this morning after a  discussion with the data supplier for this particular border, the U S  department of state.  We determined there was indeed an error by up to two and 2.7 kilometers.  The state department gave them the, the, uh, corrected version and they're,  they're going to fix it.  So being had it right.  And by the way, the Google posting then refers to president Grover Cleveland  and the 1888 arbitration agreement.  And this drawing, which is apparently on a notebook with lined paper.  Wow.  From 1888.  I guess you just, you know, the world, you know, it's a complicated place.  You get in the map business.  You never know what you're going to find out.  There's a new AdSense interface.  Do we care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you looked at it, Jeff?  I haven't looked at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't use that sense.  You think?  No, no, actually I used to, but no, I don't use it lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does.  I think I have like $2 in an AdSense account.  Every, every once in a while, I get this email that'll be like, really,  we want to pay you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm like, but we don't want to send a check because that cost us $5.  Right.  So would you like stamps?  Um, new interfaces full of features and making my, I don't know, just, you know,  if you're an AdSense user, go check it out.  There's a nice video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, just go check that out.  Go check it out.  We'll give you the news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah, I got some news here.  We report you go check it out.  Who I mean, do we say this already?  Google say apparently the guy who broke the bonus memo was fired.  Oh dear.  CNN money says, uh, after the money, the business, the memo was leaked to  business insider, which broke the news within hours, Google notified staff.  It had terminated the leaker.  How'd they find out?  I don't know.  You wonder if everybody had a different amount.  We're giving the bonus of $999.  Oh, no, it's you with a thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That gets sticky or yellow dots on the printout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hope they didn't do like snoop on the Gmail.  That would be very wrong.  That's probably what they did.  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There'd be nothing wrong if they're snooping on their corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Completely legal to do that.  I know, but it is legal, but it's still makes it's, it's as they say at Google creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we got to protect ourselves.  Yeah.  So what are your, uh, what is it?  What's your take on this fracasse between Facebook and Google, Google, Facebook?  Uh, I was hoping you'd tell us that.  Facebook's attitude is we import everything, but we don't give you anything.  And in some, some degree you can defend that, you know, I've been, we've all been  hard on Facebook over privacy, Facebook saying, well, look, you know, we have an  agreement to keep this stuff private.  So for conveniences, we're going to allow you, for instance, on Facebook, you know,  when you say find friends on Facebook, give me your Gmail thing.  I'll look at your Gmail and, uh, and I'll find some friends on there.  And Google just cut that off saying, well, wait a minute.  It's not reciprocal.  We, you know, we want to be able to do the same thing with Facebook, but I understand  Facebook's point of view is which, well, we said it would be private.  We can't just let you have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I can say whether or not I want my friends to have access to my email address.  So, so if I say Leo, when you and I are friends, you can see my email address.  Then I'm okay with you having access to that address on your, you know, Facebook  widget on your phone or, or being able to export it.  I mean, it's my contact information.  It's like giving a business card.  You know, this whole thing got really ugly.  I didn't like the way either Facebook or Google handled it.  I'll be honest.  I mean, I understand Google's point.  I mean, they're kind of take this, taking this very common, like this common, open  source culture, this like share alike, uh, kind of thing.  Hey, you know what?  Our data is not available to you if you can't, you know, spit it back out.  But then, you know, so they, so they, they took away access to the API.  So then Facebook just linked directly to their export page.  And then Google put up this page that the header was called trap my contacts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now hold on.  This is what Google will give you when you use this Facebook feature to export  contacts or import contacts from Gmail.  Hold on a second, says Google.  Hold on.  Are you super sure you want to import your contact information for your friends  into a service that won't let you get it out?  Here's the not so fine print you have.  I think Eric Schmidt should read this in his creepy voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've been directed to this page from a site that doesn't allow you to  re-export your data, other services.  Essentially locking up your contact data about your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't this whole thing read like it was just written by like some random  engineer who was just really pissed about the whole thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cause it's kind of opaque.  It's hard to understand.  So once you import your data there, you won't be able to get it out.  We think this is an important thing for you to know before you import your data  there, see this bad writing, jackass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fool.  I'm pitted a fool.  We strongly disagree with this data protectionism.  The choice is yours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google doesn't have their data.  Google has my data.  So if I tell them to give it to somebody else, I appreciate it.  But it's like, and I feel the same way about Facebook.  Don't get me wrong.  They should give me back my data if I ask for it.  But for Google to kind of act like, oh, we're being the nice ones about it.  And Facebook's evil is disingenuous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well then, and look, it says this public service announcement is brought to you  on behalf of your friends at Google context.  And then there's a checkbox.  I want to be able to export my data from Facebook.  Please register a complaint on my behalf over data protectionism.  Like Google's going to send them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the whole thing now, though?  How does this fit in with the fact that you're supposed to be able to export your  Facebook stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, basically, Google kind of I think I'm  Gina, correct me.  Google basically back down, but gives you this message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. They give you this message.  So you can continue to do it, but they give you this message.  So they've got this like anti-Facebook  rhetoric going on where Joel's point is exactly right.  If I'm saying get my contacts from Gmail and put it into Facebook,  I know what I'm doing.  That's what I want to do.  It is my data.  I think it's a pretty important distinction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you have I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, but like  whenever whenever a company gives you a warning message, that's super important  that they are objective about how they're presenting.  Like that's not the time to be political.  That's the time to say here is the situation and not like have some like, you  know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you're in New York market and you heard Cablevision and Fox go after each other.  Yeah, they're the devil.  No, they're the devil.  No, they're helping you.  And they're both the devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The only official, according to a gig on the only official comment that's emerged  from Facebook platform engineer Mike Vernal suggested that Google is being  hypocritical about data portability and is only concerned about it because  Facebook's more popular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you're only mad because I'm more popular.  I mean, this is the thing.  This is so childish on either end.  And I just feel like you're treating your customers like they're idiots.  Like if I'm asking to go into Facebook, then I yes, I'm asking to get my contacts  in Facebook and you know what?  Then I have a copy of my contacts on Google servers and on Facebook servers.  And like I have access to it either way.  I mean, I'm not being hoodwinked.  They're my freaking contacts.  And these are just two companies sniping at one another.  I didn't I wasn't a fan.  I kind of expected this kind of thing from Facebook.  I didn't really expect it from from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really a big problem for Google.  They have this institutional, I think,  blindness that they they think all their users think about them the way they think  about themselves. And that's why you have Schmidt saying all this like super.  It's not just Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Facebook does exactly the same thing.  True, true.  It's it's this there's a trend in Silicon Valley towards this this really catty  sniping. We've seen this the last couple of years with Jobs, Google, Facebook.  And then there's this other trend which you nailed, Joel, which is, well,  you're all just like us.  And I really like what you said.  This is my data. That's the bottom line.  Google, you may hold it, but where did you get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. I understand that, you know, that's my data is what I've traded for the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  services that Google provides doesn't become your property now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But like if it comes down to who  owns my personal data, you know, me or the service I'm using, it's, you know,  I guess you could argue it either way, but I don't feel that way personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. I want to take a little break.  And we're going to come back with more. We are.  This is fun.  Joel Johnson is here. He's from gizmodo.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said it exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gizmodo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how we all say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You go to a party. That's the password.  Where do you work? Gizmodo.  Also, no surprise.  No surprise. Jeff drivers from Buzz Machine and  Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org. I have a phrase for all of you.  I also want to talk about Ford.  Ford.  I don't know how they say that. Ford.  You know what they say? They call it the blue oval.  I kind of like that.  Scott Monty, who is their Twitter guy, their social media guy, says  we're polishing the blue oval because that's the logo.  You know, they have it's really fun to see the old Ford logos.  We went to the Rouge plant in Dearborn.  We had a field trip. It was so much fun.  And to see the original Ford logo is almost identical.  You know, the the logo with Henry Ford in the Model A is almost  the same. The Rouge plant was built in the 20s by Henry Ford, who had this great  vision. He wanted to build a plant.  It's like a mile by a mile and a half.  It's huge that you put in raw materials like the box cars come up with coke,  not Coca-Cola, but like iron ore and lumber.  Out comes at the other end, out comes a car.  The Model Ts are the first cars, but they still we saw the F-150 trucks being made.  It's just really fun to see.  In fact, you can go on a tour of the Rouge plant if you're there.  Highly recommended, highly recommended.  It's a mile and three quarters long and a half a mile wide.  That's the actual dimensions with the factory.  We were in the F-150 factory has a green rooftop.  It's a growing rooftop. It's got a succulent on it, which  does a couple of things, keeps it cooler in the summer.  It absorbs runoff water so they can reuse the water, reduces energy costs.  And of course, it generates it sucks in CO2 and generates oxygen.  Quite a bit of it because it's acres.  Really neat. You might want to take a look at some of the new Ford vehicles.  The Fiesta is fantastic.  Forty highway miles per gallon.  That's the most fuel efficiency of any compact car out there.  The EcoBoost V6 engine and the Taurus SHO.  Amazing engine.  It's six cylinder, 365 horsepower.  Very economical.  Basically the power of V8  in a V6 engine with direct fuel injection.  The 2011 Fiesta, I mentioned that.  Ford continues to innovate and I'm really proud.  Ford continues to bring heavy industry, keep it alive in the United States,  keep the jobs in the United States, keep the innovation in the United States.  And I love that Ford SYNC.  You know that. Check out the new Taurus SHO, the new Ford Fiesta,  the new Ford Edge.  They've got some great cars.  And of course, the new 5.0 Mustang, which is what I desperately want.  It's all at your Ford dealer.  Check it out today. Drive one this week.  And thank you Ford for us.  They've been giving such support to the Twitter network.  In fact, well, I won't say anything else.  We've got some things coming up I'm really excited about.  Instant previews in search.  People are getting all excited about this.  This is that you could do this before with a Firefox plug in.  Gina, what happens when I go?  Is this in the in Chrome only or where?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's everywhere.  You do a search. I haven't tried it in Firefox because I've only been using Chrome,  but I believe it's everywhere.  In your search results, there's a little magnifying glass at the very end after  after the blue link.  And if you click on it, you can see a preview of.  Whoa, I don't know who that was.  That wasn't Gina.  That was not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK. And so when I get there, there's this little magnifying glass.  I click it. Oh, that's cool.  You don't even have to click it. You could hover over it.  No, you click it to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can also use the right arrow key.  So the down and right arrow key to expand the so neat.  Yeah. The page even highlights the page.  Look at that. It highlights the portions of text on the page that have the keywords

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you search for and it gives you a call out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's funny. Whenever I've used a lot of  Firefox extensions that do this kind of thing in the past.  And I always felt like they were kind of like a little bloaty and would just load  this giant image, but this implementation is pretty good.  I've been kind of interested.  It's been interesting to see Google kind of move away.  They used to be so militant about this bare bones set of results, you know,  but they've been they've been really loosening up.  Marissa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, oh, you think it's because Marissa is not there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think so.  But they sound like gossipy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They've been more liberal about adding little images and changing things around.  I mean, that's a pretty heavy image to load.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm not seeing it.  Is it enough that you I know the idea is that if you don't want to go to the site,  you won't now. But is it enough to not go to a site you want to look at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you look on on our shot now, you see it's just it's very tiny.  It really is more like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've seen that USGS site. I remember that.  You still want to click on it.  But I got to say it's prefetching and caching.  I would imagine these pages.  So it is adding to the overall page load.  In fact, Gina, don't I wouldn't geography.com  when I when I hover my mouse over it wouldn't that sense a load, even though  it didn't really get loaded. I mean, isn't that probably caching something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  when it's the spiders are walking through, I would think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's taking a snapshot.  Because if you look at blogs, it's pretty quick.  Like an older snapshot.  OK, good.  I'm waiting for people to complain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it looks like I mean, this is interesting.  They really are doing a treatment to this because here it is geography.com.  And it's a call out  that says geography is the science of our world.  I mean, you can read that.  So they're doing some sort of yeah, there is something going on with this.  It's more than just an image.  Wow, that's really interesting.  So you think Rupert Murdoch, how do you think he's going to react to this, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's going to complain. Yeah, but actually he took his stuff down anyway.  So that's right. He's not. Is he not on Google?  He's on Google News.  He took his stuff out of Google News.  OK, that's not about Google search.  I bet he's still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The screenshots do not include the ads.  Anything with a plug-in shows up as a little puzzle piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But yeah, it just seems like an easy way to recognize.  Oh, yeah, I know that page. That's the page I'm looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's my website. Let's see.  Yeah, the big puzzle piece there.  Oh, yeah, this is old because it has the Halloween banner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, so these are cash snapshots.  Yeah.  I can't imagine what kind of storage this was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good Lord.  You know, Google just blows my mind,  but they have to store a little bit of it anyway for their search.  They're probably heavily compressing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you've got to figure if they're just saving images,  that it's just a bunch of, you know, have 100, 200K per site.  Like, that's not a whole lot more,  considering they're already basically cashing the entire sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and so there's the image, then that overlay with the text is actually  superimposed on top of the image.  Oh, it is.  Yeah. So that's just like the little snippet of text you see below  the blue link just superimposed on the page to show you here.  Look on the page where it is.  Because if you right click and open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, look.  So on the left, the snippet is got an email this morning.  This is on my website.  On the right, one of the radio stations.  This almost seems like a random snippet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  But like if you right click on the image itself and say open image in new tab,  you'll see the image without the call out, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Got it. So they are doing some call out is, you know, some JavaScript or some  JavaScript happening on top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yep. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. But now this so is this an image or is this the this is the actual  page.  It pulled up the actual page for me.  Well, that's huh.  I like that.  It isn't very Marissa, but I am sure that she did approve it.  Google Wave.  I don't know if this is your tip, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll save that for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I won't mention it.  All right.  Her eulogy.  In fact, let's let's let's do our let's let's do it.  Let's wrap her up here.  Let's do our tip.  Oh, God. Well, how late did it get?  Oh, my God. I lost track of the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're having so much fun.  You know, you know, this happens to me every time with this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's supposed to be an hour long and already we're like, you know, an hour and a  half in. I'm sorry, Gina Tripani, your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So for the dozen of you who loved Wave as much as I did, actually bought my book  and have waves in Wave that you'd like to preserve, there's now an official  export feature.  So there are plenty of gadgets and bots that would export things in Wave.  They're all a little janky or had something wrong with them here and there.  This is the official exporting feature that the Wave team promised when they  announced that Wave would only be around this through the end of the year.  So if you just go in a wave, open up a wave, there's an export button on the  toolbar and you can export as HTML, Facebook export or a zip file bundle with all  the attachments that might be included with your with your wave.  And that takes a little longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How would you rebuild it?  I mean, what would you display it in as a web page or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all it's all HTML.  It's just plain HTML.  Yeah, it's plain HTML.  Yeah.  So they're going to they're going to give away to export multiple waves at once.  Right now, this is a one wave at a time thing, but they've been promising the  whole time that export would be possible before they kind of shut down  wave.google.com proper.  So this is the first step.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your number of the week, Mr.  Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It survives the show.  It did.  It's not too effectively.  Two hundred ninety seven billion.  Usually when you use a number like that big, it's Google, but it's not this case.  It's Facebook.  I was astounded at this week says that Facebook trounces Yahoo, Microsoft,  Google and display ads that that they had two hundred ninety seven billion.  I'm surprised with the period is here at impressions for twenty three point one  percent of the market for the quarter.  And so that goes up from thirteen point nine percent, you know, which is a ten  percent increase there, which is quite considerable.  And it now swipes the mantle, as they say, from Yahoo.  You know, that's that's to me utterly astounding.  But when you have five hundred million people, that's what happens.  Wow.  News sites in the U.S.  tend to get about 12 page views per user per month.  Facebook gets that per day.  And that's why they have the scale.  And so now, you know, we always thought Facebook has no business model.  Well, hello.  It's pretty impressive.  And when you remember, too, they have incredible opportunities to target  against this.  However, here's the interesting thing.  The CPM, the ad rate charged is much lower.  It's roughly a dollar compared with three dollars for display ads on Yahoo.  And so I find that that interesting, but kind of, you know, you make it up on  volume and they really do.  So that was pretty impressive to me.  Yahoo was a distant second with 11 percent of the market and 140 billion  impressions, Microsoft 64 billion, Google 2.7 percent of the share.  But of course, they don't really they're not so much of content site as the  others. One more note on just advertising, as I thought more about about  Facebook deals last week, it really struck me that the clever brilliance of  that if you're going to have deals for millions of sites, the challenge is  sales. So they got rid of the sales challenge by giving it away and they'll  get their free deals on here.  And then, as we said last week, they'll be able to upsell the best ones to  create ads to drive you to their places to get the deal.  And the volume and the scale of Facebook starts to really take off here and show  what's possible for a business model.  And so these numbers just wowed me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Truly amazing.  Yeah, just just it's I mean, crazy times.  I don't think we would have thought of numbers that big even a few years ago.  And it's just the beginning.  We're going to start. We're start, you know.  I mean, well, you know, it's funny, though, I have to say, I don't know,  maybe Facebook slowed down or maybe they just stopped talking numbers, but  you keep hearing 500 million, but it's been that way for a while.  I mean, I presume it's more than 500 million now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I heard 550 is the latest number I hear out there.  Interesting.  I'll go look at it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My tool of the week is something you can't use.  You can't have, but maybe someday it's called RockMelt.  Now, I think I sent you guys invitations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did. I couldn't figure it out.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The reason it's on on this show is because it is based on Chromium.  You remember a browser called Flock some time ago.  It was a social social browser.  RockMelt is heavily, by the way, heavily funded by people like Mark  and Drayson, who invented Netscape.  In fact, the founders of RockMelt, we interviewed one of them on Net at Night  last night, come from Mark's company, LoudCloud, and one of them from Netscape  before that. So these guys have some history with browsers.  RockMelt is a social browser like Flock.  Unlike Flock, Flock was based on  on Firefox. Unlike Flock, this one is based on Chromium.  So if you're a Chrome fan, you don't lose your Chrome functionality,  but you get a lot of social functionality on the side.  The first thing you'll do when you launch RockMelt  is log into your Facebook account.  No good if you don't have a Facebook account.  So that leaves a few of you out.  Almost left me out. I'm glad I went back to Facebook because  actually, it's kind of interesting.  There's some interesting features.  There's the social features, which I won't dwell on, but these are  these are my friends on the left hand side based on recent posts on Facebook.  Friends, you can add feeds.  So there's the tech meme feed and it pops out and it can also be torn off.  You can also add Twitter.  So there's the Twitter feed. It can be torn off.  And so a lot of that functionality is, you know, it's just kind of built  into the browser. You could do that with extensions.  But they also change search. Notice that unlike Chrome,  you still have that kind of search window, but they've put back  the little search box here.  Oh, yeah, I know. I don't like that. However,  you might like this. And I don't know, you know, if you don't go to Google.com  and you hit Gina Trapani and hit return, the search results show up  here with the thumbnails just to kind of in a little side window here.  OK, I kind of like if I get to a page I like, like, let's say that works.  Mark video. Let's go back to it.  I can share it by pushing the share button.  Post a link to my wall or tweet it right away.  And I can also, if I like this page, I can drag it over to the sidebar  and it will take the RSS feed and add the RSS feed.  So I'm going to add the RSS feed for Lifehacker essentially  to to my regular RSS feeds, which is kind of cool.  So there's some interesting features that you can do with this.  Very easy to share.  I think this is worth looking at.  Now you have to go to RockMelt.com and request an invite.  I understand they are rolling these out pretty quickly.  So within a day or two, you should get an invite.  It's no good, again, if you don't have a Facebook account  because that ties everything to Facebook.  There's one additional advantage.  If you're worried about fire sheep, it's more secure because  unless you log into Facebook directly, all of these logins are done via the fire,  the RockMelt servers with SSL.  So you could actually visit your Facebook friends, post on Facebook and so forth  on open access points safely  by doing this. So there's some advantages to it.  It's kind of an interesting feature.  There's a lot of features in here I didn't mention, but worth taking a look.  RockMelt.com. It's free. It's based on Chrome.  And they have been keeping it up to date.  They say they will keep up to date.  It's the Chromium, you know, open source version of Chrome.  But they said they will.  They have an auto update feature.  And in fact, I've already updated it once since I installed it yesterday.  We are out of time.  I want to thank you, Joel, for joining us.  Really great to have you, Joel Johnson.  Yeah, thanks.
