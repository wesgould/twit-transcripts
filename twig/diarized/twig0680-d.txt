Transcript:  Coming up on this week in Google, it's me Jason Howell filling in for Leo Laporte  Also, Jeff Jarvis, Stacy Higginbotham and Ant Pruitt and we have a lot to talk about a lot of it  Google related and pixel related. We've got a pixel hardware event coming up next month  We've got satellite phone connectivity coming to Android Android 14. Anyways, you're gonna have to wait a little bit for that  We've got an edit feature coming to Twitter and some details as far as how that works  The EU actually wants to regulate phone updates  How do you feel about that? And we take a trip into my air-conditioned garage. Come check it out. This week in Google is next

My name is Jason Howell Leo is  He's in the area, but he's on his way to a hair metal concert just let that sink in a little bit  I think it's awesome that that's actually a true statement. Yes, death leopard  poison  Joan Jett and I'm missing one  What's that?  Wait a minute  Motorhead. Oh, is that right?  Metallica I had no idea no  It was an M hairband of some sort  So there we girls girls. Yes. Yes motley crew with the umlauts. That is Stacy Higginbotham  Joining us today. It's good to see you Stacy. Welcome back  Hello, any of those bands your favorites back in the day or even currently

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Last week. I said that I did see deaf leopard when I was pregnant and I fell asleep. Oh, that's right  That's right. We were like the second row. I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Understandably so though, I think anyone would understand that  Still you've seen death leopard and I never have even if you've only seen a couple of songs, so I'm slightly jealous

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't I wouldn't say they did a good show until until I fell asleep

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It continued to be good. It kept you asleep  Also joining us Jeff Jarvis  Jeff any of those bands?  Kind of wake you up. Just does Joni Mitchell play it in him  Joan Jett though is about as close to Joni Mitchell. So Stacy, did you snore? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mean probably I was pregnant pregnant women do all kinds of disgusting things  And I snore today. So  probably yes  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably so and the snoring was no louder than anything else happening in that  Yeah, that's the beauty of it also joining us and Pruitt what's up and  Not much sir. If you had to pick one of those bands to see live tonight, which one would it be?  Or would it be none of the above? I was gonna say can I punch it or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  coin  No idea sir, I think I'll pass I'll just sit outside and people watch that's what I would do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a man. I have a feeling that is a really great people watching show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's it outside with the camera and get some pretty interesting photos. I'm sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No kidding. You probably get some interesting photos with the camera inside the show as well  Because aren't they let me get in the pit. Yeah, right. Don't take your gear there. I think there's a pit  Yeah, it probably isn't you're probably right not this show  Probably not at this day and age. Yeah, I mean there are still pits  But I don't know that there will be a pit at this show. Well, technically there's there's usually still a photo pit. Oh  Okay, that's different than a mosh pit. You're right, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So was I oh no, I won't know part of that I'd hurt somebody

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very responsible of you and that's responsible mosh etiquette. Yeah, actually  Watch you to hurt them. That's just the way the mosh pit works  I do think that they're sitting in the front row or they're very close to the stage. Is that right?  Lisa's saying that so could be interesting some of the stories that we hear from that show and I'm sure Leo will talk about  About it next week on this week in Google  But this week I don't know if you heard but there's some big hardware announcement news today

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you hear Apple is that was on my Apple? Who's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Talking about Apple. What are you talking about? I'm talking about Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why would you think I'm talking about I don't care about about gigantic kitty watches

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that watch does look like a beast what is the Apple watch what do they call it the it's not  The Apple watch Pro

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  one goes here you something other

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the ultra that's what it is  Okay, they're taking a page out of Samsung's book and throwing an ultra on the end of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Samsung always has they can't know everyone has to pick their own  Naming so then we can figure out like Apple when we're guessing like is that the Apple watch 8 if they  If they add like an ultra to it, then I'm gonna be like a galaxy ultra 7bq

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, or why not the Apple watch mega like the mega the mega watch on dough the mondo  Yeah, none of them done mondo yet. That's a good one right there  For a ginormous like chunky watch on your wrist, I think mondo is quite appropriate  I think you should just go with Apple watch chunk  Chalk Chalk edition  Sign me up. I'd get it even though it doesn't work with my

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kind of thing if Google did that I really they have no taste they have no class  They have those dials. It's Google Apple does it and it's rediscovering huge. It's fresh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it's like you do absolute unit. So Apple Apple watch absolute unit

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go. That'd be for the the little that sounds like an Elon Musk child's name  That is good

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love it, of course  We aren't going to talk in detail in depth about Apple's hardware announcement  That wasn't even the hardware announcement that I was talking about  Of course not  The one I was referring to is the fact that Google on the day before Apple's hardware announcement  Announced its own hardware event. Yes  We have to wait until October 6 for that to happen  But still we knew it existed  Before Apple's event actually happened. So I don't know they score like two and a half points  So it's a day after the show

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah  Yes, so this is Thursday October 6th

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The day after the show so that means the event will happen and then you all will have six days to prepare your arguments for or against  And you five  Any of the hardware that is shown off at the event and actually Google is being pretty  Forthcoming and we kind of already knew what we're gonna see at this hardware event the pixel 7 the pixel 7 Pro  The pixel watch all three of those devices. We've seen already because Google  Did the thing where at Google IO? They need a surprise  They need a surprise like oh, I don't know a new product

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Surprise like oh, I don't know a new pixel book. What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Jarvis, come on who wants one

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be a surprise  But you know what Jeff I think you're on to something they do need a surprise because I was watching  part of the Apple event today and  What did what did they call that that bar and the pro that expands that had a?  Catching name for it and I think John might know the dynamic island the dynamic island  so  Basically what Apple did is you know, you know in the top where there is like a cutout for the cameras  Apple essentially said alright many people see this as limitation. It's a cutout  We're gonna turn it into a new UI kind of paradigm for  Receiving notifications and information from apps and so that little pill  Expands out and information appears there  It becomes this like living organism within the UI and that was something that I don't know that we knew of  Ahead of the event and what it made me realize right is that like we go into these Google events  We know flipping everything about these phones by the time it happens Apple somehow is able to hold on to  Some key pieces of information  Some of it gets leaked out  But some of it they hold on to for that true moment of surprise and that's what really lacks from Google's hardware events

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I will continue to sing this song that I've sung for the last three years here  Google knows what they're doing these  Leaks are not leaks man  They're giving that information out to somebody somewhere and then claiming it's a so-called leak  It's this is happening way too often

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead miss Stacey no, no, I was just I think it's harder to  Terrify your partners when you're Google and so these things do come out because people want to talk about them  I don't know if Google like I just don't think Google cares as much about leaks  Whereas Apple okay, I feel like you're dragged to a basement somewhere and like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But from a hardware standpoint Apple has way more what is it cache or whatever versus Google  So it seems like it only makes sense for Google to put as much information out as they possibly can  To get some type of interest in it because the average  John or Jill on the street are more than likely looking for the next Samsung device versus the next Google device let alone  Thinking about Apple devices out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, do you think the average John if you're an Android buyer?  You're either a super passionate Android buyer or you're buying a phone just because you can't afford or don't want for whatever reason to go out  Yeah, right on that. So I don't know  It's a religion  Well, that's a you're either in the religion. Yeah, or you're just it's it's a phone that you can afford  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Swear I see more religious leaning towards the Samsung side of things though versus the Google side of things

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot more a lot more Android energy from the everyday  Yeah consumer going towards Samsung than going for Google. I mean Samsung's also been doing this a lot longer than Google. Oh, yes. Yeah  But but I do see retail chain. Yeah. Yeah, totally legitimately better hardware

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is somebody said it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think you're right. They've spent a lot of time refining how they create their phones  Which is not to say that Google puts out bad hardware. It's just Samsung  Yeah, they're just they're just sharper on this stuff  I I prefer the the design language that Google does with the pixels more and I prefer  the UI and the kind of the the pixel  UI approach that Google does but I can also admit that  Samsung is at the top of the Android food chain for a reason, you know, I have you know, I have family  I have friends who have Samsung devices and they don't even think of checking out another phone  It's just because they're so used to the Samsung thing and they hold on to their phones for a really long time  Kind of allow you to do that if you're buying of a certain level a certain tier of of Samsung phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How is the level of I have a touch one in ages? How is the level of Samsung the software junk on top it? I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mean that has definitely changed over the years  There's you know, I guess it depends on what you define as junk  I feel like it used to be that you got a Samsung phone and you got all sorts of other apps  Be it from Samsung or not from Samsung all these like deals made, you know behind the scenes  Cluttering up the phone it really it felt like  Your your apps tray was just being impacted by all these decisions that were made for you  And I think that that's lessened. It's still there but Samsung I think more so has really leaned into  the extras features and services that they offer that Samsung really wants to be an Apple, you know  And and I think they do a decent job of doing of having that like they get  Come close right they're doing really well with that but um, but I think you know more and more I imagine Samsung has a  picture of you know of  Apple or an iPhone hanging on their walls like inspiration of like someday  Someday we're gonna be like you you know, that's I think that's fair because you can see the effort they put into this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and again, I agree with you far as like the  Pixel experience it with vanilla Android  But seems like Samsung is has starting started to clean that up a little bit more  They have you people that I know that are really passionate about Samsung and every time I've seen their phones  It's definitely not what it used to be in the days of your for sure and fragmented Android  And then the build quality of those phones are you pick them up their tanks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just the same word that came to my mind  Yeah, Sam Samsung is of a certain tier of a certain, you know kind of category they're building like tanks. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah, they're really well well designed and well built. Do you love all the features?  Do you even use or need all the features? No, I mean some Samsung, you know dedicated people  Will get in there and use all of them  But you know, that's also part of Samsung's playbook is like we throw a million different features in here  You don't have to use them all but you're gonna find the handful of ones that really work for you  And that used to feel used to feel on older Samsung phones like oh my god  Stop it like stop trying to make me believe that you are amazing and smart because of all these things that you've done  And yeah, they still kind of push that on you a little bit when you first set up a Samsung phone  but then you get past that and  You kind of settle into your use of it and then you you know, you're kind of  Settle into finding the things that actually do work for you and great. I don't have to use it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember a time when it was  Like the thing to have all of the cutesy stuff on phones and you know  All of the different bubbles pop it up and all of the weird sound effects every time you tap something  I wondered if that was  Something that the consumers really were digging for and I'm sorry that you hear singing going on in the background  I was gonna say

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sandy Cheeks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry about that. I should probably close my door. I told y'all this every daggone day all daggone day

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's awesome, I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The funny girl on Broadway before you know it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's got a captive audience right now rehearsals begin

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So amazing so sorry about that. I will close my door. I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love it. It was so cool  Yeah, so let's see here  So we got the seven the some news about the seven Google actually confirmed that the next generation tensor chip  Not surprising, but the next generation tensor chip is going to be on board  We really don't know what that even means just that it will be stay there for a second. Would you would you I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was wondering today with Google v. Apple  And Google's has tensor and has all this this this processing going on on the phone to do things like  Unlike translation and such does Apple have any equivalents to that kind of a process? Yeah, they have their bionic services

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So compare the services. Oh boy. Well, yeah, I don't know that I have the answer to that because I'm  Relatively clueless on the Apple side of things. Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was gonna say I was gonna say it's hard to do it apples tap  Yeah, sorry because  Yeah, orange is to orange is  comparison because  Both of them are now designing their own ships. They're still using they're both arm licenses  but that's one of the I don't know if it's a  It's that tight integration between the hardware and the software. So  You know Apple is doing on board device like machine learning type stuff  So they may not be doing it for real-time translate or that's not an advertised feature. Well, that's what I'm asking Stacey

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they're doing it  Okay  Where does Google have a strength in data in the data sets to enable the machine learning to happen on the phone?  Where does Apple if any have any weakness there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a weakness there because so what what happens on your phone is actually there's two sides of machine learning  There's the training of something like so training something to recognize words and speech and then there's the inference  which is running the noises my mouth makes against that particular algorithm and then  Elucidating the translation in  So the hardest part from a chip perspective is training and that all happens right now in the cloud  so any advantage that Apple has or Google has  It's kind of obliviate obliviated. That is not a word  Because they're both doing things in the cloud and then they stick that model so whatever speech to text model  They have they're gonna run it locally on the phone. So it's just running inference, which is still process intensive  but it's not like crazy like GPU level compute, so  My hunch is they've tweaked their algorithms to work specifically with both of their chips  So it doesn't and everyone has access to like the training data for speech, right?  so  Where you would look for advantages? I'm trying to think would be I mean even image recognition  It's just whatever training data you're using Google  Has lots but you can also buy access to it. Apple probably has lots they can  get  It I feel like Google gets it because and I don't even know how much of this is actually true anymore  You know Google got a lot of it by like picking it up from its users  Whereas Apple didn't pull that  Yeah, so that's that's the actual data that they're gonna create the they're gonna do the training on originally in the cloud  But Apple can just throw money at that problem too. Yeah, so  In in Apple's got the margins to do it  So maybe that's how they're doing it because there it's their quality is not really suffering. I don't think I mean  I know Siri is not as awesome, but it it's definitely gotten better  Yeah, I don't know someone who's doing like speech to text on an iPhone. Are you seeing changes?  Yeah, my husband does not seem unhappy

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he has an iPhone he doesn't seem unhappy we need the occasional Apple guest here to say how is it over there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good idea in fact, I've booked Leo for the show for next week so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Next week well play mr. Producer well play thank you, you know, I try to stay on top

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  things around here  But yeah, I mean that's you know as far as the the AI  Compute, you know all that kind of stuff Google is and has been pretty known  And you know has has proven itself to be pretty solid as far as that stuff is concerned. It's a good question  Where does Apple stand by comparison used to kind of be a standout thing for Google and for Android devices to have that?  But that has that gap  Narrowed I you know, I still find myself, you know  For for right or wrong. I find myself still locked in the in the thinking that Google has a leg up there  But maybe maybe that gap is has really narrowed a lot either that or maybe people don't care as much about it  But because I mean the Apple I think is doing alright, you know by by comparison

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they aren't I mean you can't do speech to text. I mean real-time translate on  Google devices is pretty awesome  Which is unfortunate but like I don't I don't think Apple  I mean someone in the comments just be like Stacy you and your blinker to Android worldview  But I don't think Apple has anything like that, right? I don't like that's been a priority. Well, yeah is live translation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From one language to another I'm not saying it's not an important feature. It's very important for the people who really need it  It's game-changing but  Really the majority of people probably don't have opportunities in their daily life to use something like that  So while it's a really great kind of example of Google's prowess in this in this aspect of what they do  It's you know, that's neat. I just I have no use for that unless I go traveling somewhere maybe, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd rather have  Privacy or real-time translation for like a week

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As a second Stacy  Question though apples going into the ad business all that they used to talk about that's going away  Apple's gonna Apple's something gonna change his mind about privacy. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Be curious to see say more Jeff. Yeah, I mean I'm you're I feel like your cynicism is like totally founded

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that even well because they're going in the end  I mean the whole background of Apple and privacy was Apple failed the ad business  And so they turned a failure into a feature  That's right. Yeah, you're into a feature. Oh, I like that  And and so we're the privacy company which really meant we don't know anything about advertising. We failed at it  We don't really care use the data in any way so fine. You're better off with us  And now they are way going into the ad business, which means they are way gonna need data. No two ways about it and  So I think that if we compare Apple statements of two years ago to two years hence  We're gonna find a little  Hypocrisy, I'll bet just just wager it. They've leaned so are you basing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, oh, sorry. I was gonna say are you basing this on the reports of them doubling their digital advertising business?  Yeah, like they've hired and all of them. Okay, so right right, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're they're going into it and you know, it's it's everybody's in the ad business, right?  Amazon is is Amazon's ad business is now bigger than the entire magazine industry  Best buys floors are advertising  Instacart is advertising everybody's in the ad business now  But all  Primarily to others as ancillary revenue. It's it's Google's primary support obviously  But in the case of Apple, it's it's a big heap heaping a gravy on the meatloaf and same for Amazon a real big ladle of  On I used to work at Ponderosa steakhouse by the way  One thing we were trained to do was you take out the cheap?  Australian beef right off the grill and you  Next you're supposed to ask them if they weren't the mushroom sauce mushroom gravy, which is awful  And you ladle it up and have it right there ready to pour on would you like some mushroom sauce?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, okay, well I this is helpful to me because I'm not a hundred percent aware but  Apple's advertising stuff is already in their apps. Their news and stock apps have advertising. They have it in the app store

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and I have an iPhone. I think this news report that that you're referring to well  No, this is someone linked in chat to an article Apple growing its own ad businesses private  There's a few piece rivals, but that's from 2021. That's from April 2021. So I don't know if there's newer  You know that was focused specifically on the app store

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is from Bloomberg in  August so about a month ago  And then they advertise on Apple TV  So August right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Showing ads on your iPhone said Bloomberg

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and they're saying paid sir. You're gonna get ads  inside your iOS  paid service  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it is a switch. It's and it's it's a double-edged sword that Apple can wield on the one hand  They hurt everybody else's ad business particularly Facebook meta and on the other hand  You know, like you can't you can't do any of this data stuff because we're Apple we're pure  And then on the other hand Apple has all this first party data. It's gonna become a world of first party data

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all their advertising looks like it's  Advertising it's letting developers pay to advertise their stuff on the platform. So it doesn't look like it's looking it's I mean  It's search term data. So it's like hey if I'm looking for a car game  Let's let's show you know, I can pay to have you know, my game higher up  So it feels more like Amazon's ad business than something like Google, which is now bigger than the magazine industry

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So at their scale there's a lot you can do there  And I think you totally yeah when you get to you know, and this is I put a thread in watch  I hope we can get to later  About because I've been trying to get my head around the streaming business and how what a mess it seems to us as consumers  Like always bloody things you can you can subscribe to for one thing you want on it's like it's like the monster  Mondo album you don't want to have you just want the single  And and that's the mess we're in now  And the point of this thread is how we're heading back to an economy like the old studio system where  Before there was antitrust action the movie studio owned the theater and ripped off everybody else trying to get onto it  All right. So consider what else is going to be on your phone than just an app  If we if we consider the death of broadcast  NBC is rumor has it going to give up the 10 o'clock hour prime time is meaningless  Cable is cord cutting all over. So if it is finally the day of streaming and  It's not just your phone, but it's also your Apple TV. It's also your Apple, you know your laptop  It's also your your tablet. It's everything else  It could be that the entirety of the entertainment industry is gonna have to advertise on Apple to get your attention  Just just one example  Hmm  Well that stopped the conversation you're just blowing our minds no I'm trying to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, it's all this Apple talk it just takes it out of it I know it does it does take you I know I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  agree

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just I guess where I come back with with with the whole Apple thing is Apple has leaned so  Heavily and so deeply into this privacy  everything  Thing that if they suddenly change course

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's gonna be really noticeable by hardcore users of the but they're gonna know but they're gonna love it still there cuz they're Apple fanboys  The right way to do it. This is right. Well, thank you Apple. It's all here's my day

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How Apple signals that yeah, I suppose. Yeah. Yeah, I mean there's there there are those people I mean, but not everybody  It's still some people they some people have just absorbed. Oh Apple cares about my privacy and if you ask them, they're like  Wow, and they'll be like, well, you know, it just doesn't take my data like Google does  They don't know that apples like killing pixels, you know, or actually opens all the pixels on you know  They don't actually know the nuts and bolts. Yeah, you're right  I think it'll take a while for that to filter through because I mean, it's just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  Yep. Yep. I  Think you're absolutely right. Most people  They hear the privacy first message and that's kind of all they need to know  It's like well, they're doing these things and they are privacy focused and Android definitely isn't you know their opinion?  Do they actually really understand the nuts and bolts what's going on underneath  Maybe they do a little bit they want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Know no, no, are they gonna yeah Apple goddess Apple got that reputation very fairly. I mean they really did  but also  You know, it'll take a while for that to for that message where all the media is like, oh now they don't care  That'll take a while to filter back out to the people who you know, don't care about that because you know  I don't know about y'all but my friends do not spend a lot of time talking about like pixel tracking and cookies versus flock or  Super various forms of data training. Yeah, you have stays you need new friends  I really do

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need to give your friends a questionnaire and if they if they fail on all these topics  Sorry, we can't put friends anymore  You got an F  my friendship  Should also mention that this event because that was what we were talking about  Will not just be set at the pixel 7 the 7 Pro and the watch but apparently we're gonna get some new nest  Products as well. This is information

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder if it's the you know, they had the Wi-Fi stuff that the Wi-Fi 6e routers that went through the FCC a couple weeks ago  Okay, I'm assuming it's that because they just did a camera refresh like a year ago  They did the nest thermostat didn't they do a refresh like two years ago the cameras seem to be like a three to five year  Three year, sorry refresh cycle  So I'm kind of like I  Don't know that's my thought. Yeah gotta be the routers the routers. There's also been

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kind of rumors bouncing around about a smaller cheaper chromecast not that the chromecast wasn't already  Pretty inexpensive, but this one would just stream in HD not 4k  And I don't know I think the rumors I was seeing was like 25 bucks or something pretty inexpensive  Oh stadia talk. So mr. How I  Think about any stadia hardware nothing. I wonder why  Strange you say with a slight grin  That is definitely offending  That is definitely offending two to three percent of the people watching or listening to the show  Two to three. I don't know  Now we're offending them even more and  This is how it goes when we talk about stadia no matter how we painted  We hear from that small percentage of people who really really care a lot about stadia  Anyway, so I'm looking forward to the event we will certainly be doing live coverage of this  This is of course a Thursday morning. I think well, I don't think I know later on that morning  We have tech news weekly the show I do with with Micah  So we'll certainly be talking about the the information on T&W that that later that morning early afternoon  But we'll be doing live coverage of the event that day as well  So, I guess keep posted for information as far as  Stay tuned  Don't go anywhere  Don't touch that dial touch that dial  Yes, and speaking of don't touch that dial.

We thank hover for their support of this week in  Google  I don't know if there's a whole lot here, but send our Pachai had a talk earlier this  This week at the code conference in LA  I guess this was actually this was just yesterday  So it was this week  But it was also just yesterday and a lot of what Sundar Pichai was talking about kind of focused on  Competition, he actually called Google pro competitive. We are pro competitive  pro competition  And you know use the opportunity to point out other other  companies  Doing similar things that they would see as competition right Microsoft Apple's ad competitors touched on what you were talking about a little bit ago  Jeff tick tock is one example of kind of cutting-edge video competition. So Google's uh, you know  Kind of out there making  Making it known if you if you thought there was no competition and that Google was running away with anything right now  I'm regulators  Know that it's not true. We've got a lot of competition  That's that's making things difficult for us right now and keeping them nimble right tick-tock was kind of one of those examples  Where he's like, hey, you know, they're doing who saw tick-tock coming. They're doing crazy things  If you thought social was locked up and locked into certain companies  tick-tock has proven that there is still room for others to innovate to come up and  Ultimately disrupt the status quo and  Then yeah talked a little bit about Google's acquisition of Fitbit  He did mention that Fitbit features coming to the upcoming  pixel watch and of course  Eagle-eyed viewers saw a pixel watch on his wrist  Thanks  So, you know, there's a little hidden pixel watch something to look forward to there  But looks nice should be about ten times bigger. I think  You want the pixel watch to be larger than it than it looks

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, I want I want the pixel mondo the pixel bando the pixel chonk chonker

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wanted to be as large as the Samsung one myself. Mr. Howe you have one of the  Recent ones from Samsung, right? Yeah, the big G. Sorry. I'm a pixel these Samsung watch  Yeah, I wish I had it ultra something other five something other  Yes, exactly the Samsung Galaxy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Name but is it the for the five five pro is the five. Yeah, I think is the five

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. You let me watch five pro  You let me just try it out and put it on my wrist and and I love that  It was the perfect size. It wasn't too tiny like the Apple Watch is in my opinion  This it's and I think it's not too big for everybody  But it's definitely big enough for people like you and I to have large hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not too big for everybody have you met my floppy little tiny wrist

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to see Stacy be the hand model for the trunk watch just to get an idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean like I feel like the chunk watch is probably like I was at a meeting and  there was this guy and his his  Watch was like it was the size of the bottom of one of this can and it was like it was bigger than his actual  It was a what why I mean it wasn't a good it was I think it was like a samsung watch it  But it was it was a smart watch, but it was giant. Yes. I don't know what some of that Margin

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I like the watches as jewelry myself  They got to look good first off but having the smarts in it is just a bonus and I think Samsung  Has been the only one that's really been able to get that right in my opinion the Apple Watch is cool  And it does a lot of fun things, but it still doesn't look like a watch to me. It just looks like some more  Wearables not necessarily got a jewelry to me, you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, some of them what if you got the the air maze owner that was a leather strap they had a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What don't they yeah, it's just the strap though  But I like the faces of the the galaxy wasn't always have going back to their original ones  But this pixel one looks like it could be a nice piece of jewelry as well  It's just really clean and I like the round face on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the round glass on the top which on one hand looks really appealing to my eyes  But on the other hand, I'm like wait a minute. It's really exposed  Watches you've got a little bit of a ledge up there that protects that that glass from being the first thing that  Right touches any sort of surface that you see me will run into

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry, what does that pretend for bezels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I have heard  And I haven't really actually looked into this but I have heard that the bezels on this thing are thicker than people  seem to like  I've just seen some people believe I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guess you can't make everybody believe that I spent two decades learning about chips and  Spectrum in I spend like at least 10% of my time talking about frickin bezels

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The ongoing pursuit of getting rid of the bezels once and for all right  Seems to be the never-ending story of technology

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you think this?  so-called pixel watch would cost

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it supposed to cost?  And actually, I think I just found an article that has some bezel pictures

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So is it bleed the Samsung was looking at right at 500 right? Yeah, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow, what is the price I feel like there we don't know exactly some leaks have said  399 although that feels really pricey for a pixel watch  Especially yeah, it seems like the price has been tipped to cost  $399 for the LTE model. So Wi-Fi Bluetooth model less expensive than that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What 325 three ish somewhere around there would be my guess and you think that's too much for said pixel watch is what you're saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's because if it's too much then what do you feel like the Samsung smartwatch Android smartwatches  Is justified at its pricing? I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mean the galaxy watch has a history right and so they have a following  Samsung also really creates high quality  Hardware as we talked about earlier. I think in some ways Samsung justifies the cost of a more expensive device because of that  Google historically with the pixel even even their high-end phones still cost less than a lot of other high-end things  Although that's that price has really gone up and it's it's way more comparable  But that's kind of been the the history mostly as far as pixel devices are concerned  So I guess there's a part of me that it would expect the pixel watch to be more competitively priced and not like  Here's a $500 watch which doesn't seem like all the other ones but um  But yeah, I don't know you know and then it comes down to and we talked about this and all about Android last night  It was one of our a great email from a fan of the show Mac file who is sometimes in IRC  Know her and also in our club twit she she just pointed out her long history with pixel devices and  How phone after phone after phone?  She runs into the same thing where the first year. It's really great and then things start happening  You know they start slowing down down has issues that are still in the crap camera camera the battery these weird little things and so  you know I  start to wonder about kind of Google's  Google's dedication to its the longevity of its hardware even though they're even though they're they're making promises about longevity from a software perspective  You know three years of major system updates five years of security updates  That's really great  But if I'm using a phone that's two years old and I can't stand to use it anymore because it's just getting all glitchy and everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that update pattern, you know that update cadence. I don't know but then the conspiracy stories start talking about planned obsolescence

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. Well, that's true. Some people do talk about that  I don't know if any of this stuff is planned like down to the calendar date  You know what I mean, but yeah, maybe

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean it's planned in the sense that like a chip vendor or a software vendor will only support something for X number of years  Yeah, right. So it's planned like they know that  You cannot physically buy a smartphone chip that will get security updates in  Support for more than like four years for example, right Qualcomm has programs that certify certain devices. That is true  Yeah, right. Yeah, so I mean, yes, it's planned

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To that extent yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  And Google says you know  We're gonna support this particular version of the OS for X number of years or security updates for the pixel 7 through whatever, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They do two years or do they do three now they do three years of major OS updates. So three, you know major  updates to Android but a total five years of security but  Not not all of those years are they month-to-month updates right like at a certain point it's like yeah  We we update up to five years, but that might slow down in those latter two. Oh  And and also like I'm really I'm really curious to see how the hardware holds up in five years  Like of course, that's what that's what we're we're asking for is we want our hardware to last  Longer so that people don't feel this pressure this need to fill the landfills with a device that's two years old  And right, you know, so that's great  but I mean I have seen phones that are only a couple of years old and are  insanely difficult to use because things just don't work the way they used to and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's for that's a some of the premium devices too, right?  It's not necessarily the the feature phones that people are buying. It's some of the premium lines  They're still pretty much. Yeah  garbage after two years

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My wife stuck with her tiny Apple for ages waiting for the small Apple to come out and it pretty much worked the whole time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Jammer B has a I believe he's got an iPhone 7

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Seven from 2014. Yeah, I'm going to  And then I'll get the 21 in another eight years

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Massive amount of respect for that jammer be that is awesome Wow  That's and and so then so then this device is what seven seven years old  Like at what point was it just in the last year that you're like, alright  It's time or have you been living with certain qualities of it over the past couple of years that you just can well

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's been apps recommended on Mac break weekly that I've downloaded to my phone and find out  Oh, they won't run on my phone and the walking measurement thing the gate thing that Apple has I would like that  But doesn't run on my phone. Yeah, and on this last trip  Ways was refreshing very slowly refreshing a lot slower than I needed to make turns  Yeah, so that I need I need a faster phone. Holy moly you turns on this trip, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You turns but a lot of crazy turns I  Can only imagine how amazing it's gonna be for you to get a new phone if you've been living with it years  Yeah, it's seven or eight years. That's you're gonna get this new phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's gonna man. It's gonna blow your mind. Oh, so worth not getting a new phone for eight years

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So refreshing after all that time well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you have your hands on the six a?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I did I  Ended up using so I reviewed the six a on all about Android  I think a week ago was last week's episode and and I used it a total of I don't know three three and a half  Weeks and I'd say all things considered the I love the a series. I think the a series is a great  Category or variant of the pixel phones because you know price to to what you get is just really high  You get a lot of value out of the a series and I think in that price range  It's hard to beat it for a number of reasons  But this time I definitely experienced some strangeness with the battery that I haven't experienced with pixel phones to that degree before and  It wasn't a total deal breaker, but and I think probably it comes down to 5g  You know as my 5g was active and they say well if you turn off 5g you get better battery  And I'm just kind of up the in this camp of like yeah  But I shouldn't have to do that to get big right good battery if it's a if it's a feature that's on by default like  Design for that for that to be a good experience not it's a great experience if you turn off this major feature  And but there are other people that don't have that experience so your mileage may vary  But I just more often than not I hit 7 o'clock  And you know my battery was it had it had lit up red because you know it was down to like 14%  And I'm just not used to that in this day and age  I'm not used to my battery being that low that early in the evening this sounds exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like your discussion you had several years ago about the Thunderbolt and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ha ha good good memory when was the HTC Thunderbolt that had to be like 2011

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Long time ago, but I remember you talking about that on all about Android all those years ago  And it's like man this battery is horrible. Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, so it's kind of the same thing right? Let's like this next generation network great the phone supports it  But it comes with a very large trade-off and yeah, it was right HTC Thunderbolt January 2011 was the release date on that  That phone horrible  But it was the first 4g phone on his form version  But yeah, so so the 6a like great phone  It's just you know understand that you might have issues with the battery. I  enjoyed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had the 4a until we traded it up for whatever she's got now and  The 4a was totally fine, and I'm like this thing was I liked the 4x  I think we're gonna be $300 forward like yeah, this just works you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely  The series is it's a solid series  But you know with the 6a now you don't get the headphone jack which was that was the last kind of like pixel remnant  They'll follow on the in the pixel lineup that had the headphone jack if you care about that  so you know it has has some trade-offs, but  But there you go  Sorry, I didn't mean to derail you that's okay. That's okay. I talk about this stuff all day  Well and and this is kind of along those lines and speaking of  Regulation which was kind of part of what Sundar Pichai was talking about  EU lawmakers want other Android phone makers to mirror  In in many ways what Google is doing with its pixel update cadence  There's draft regulation that would establish quote eco design requirements for mobile phones cordless phones cordless phones that makes me chuckle  Why even call that out anymore  I guess they still exist there you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  drop the cord  I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Remember those corded phones, but with really really long cords  So we could go for one room to the other then they just get all stretched out and then the coils would like  Unravel in certain parts of them  They'd be like little squares and it would bug the heck out of me  I'd be like spend all this time trying to like wind it back up so it was yeah, those are like the anti OCD phone right there  Yes, totally  But and then they also said slate tablets so basically they want to cut down on waste e waste  The pixel 6 as we mentioned five years of updates that's three years of OS updates five years of security  And they want that to kind of be the case for all Android phones at least sold in the EU  So extending the lifeline of devices from two to five years  They say that doing that is going to is equal to taking up to five million cars off the road  That's what the Commission said so  So yes regulation but regulation for for the health of the world I suppose how do we feel I'm in favor of it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I so I've been in favor of this sort of thing for any kind of connected device  because again like  Like chip makers don't support things for that long  Or you know like when you spec out your design and you're gonna buy like a certain memory for your phone  You know how many reads and right or rather rights it has  So when you spec that out you can spec to a higher standard it's gonna cost more but it'll last longer, right?  If you don't do I don't know if I really love the EU regulating that it has to be five years  What I would like what I would like to see is expiration dates for every device at purchase in terms of like  We will promise to support this for three years. So when you purchase that phone, you're like, okay  This is a $500 phone that I can use for the next three years  Yay, or maybe you're like I would buy a greener phone that is going to cost me $800  But it'll last for five years and I won't contribute to waste, you know  So I would rather see the market help decide this because we have to regulate how long we're gonna actually support it like or  Regulate that we have to tell people that as opposed to saying you must support it for X number of years

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because these you must support it for X number of years really depends on how that device is built to begin with right like  like a device that is  $1,000 that Samsung puts its latest and greatest and best and loads it up, you know  That thing stands a much better chance at least in my opinion my limited opinion  stands a much better chance of lasting five years based on the fact that all of that that hardware is  Forward the future proof to a certain degree at least considering that first is like a low-end device that costs like  $100 out the door, which we still need to have right for some people  That's that's the device they can afford that turns into waste that turn and turns it turns into waste  But how do you ensure that a hundred dollar device with the technology that is in there to make it that that?  Inexpensive could last five years. I don't even know that's like is that even possible, you know again  It goes back to like how do you even use a phone like sure? Okay, like technically it's getting an update  But it's it you know, every command takes ten minutes to execute like that's just not usable  Why would you want to use that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could the flip side of that if you did regulate that you wanted to make cheap devices  You would have to make light software that could run on those devices  So, I mean you're you're right Jason  You're gonna have to buy for Kated either at the software side or the hardware side if you want to make inexpensive devices and  That's why again, that's why I don't love the approach of saying it's got to last five years  But yeah, that's just me right and there's the people who like  Well, I was gonna say there's people who like lease versus buy their car and they like I drive my cars into the ground because  I just don't think it's something I want to update but some people are like I must update my car every two years because it's  a piece of me, you know and

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It needs to be flexible. Yeah, the other thing is I don't think it's just an eco issue. It's also a consumer issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a hundred percent a consumer issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But yeah, it's been positioned as an eco matter by the EU because it's very you wish but it's more consumer protection

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I've argued about this not just for funds

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you if you if you need a cheap phone  But it can't be a cheap phone anymore because it's required to do all these things for so long  Then yeah, have you is it an inequitable?  Market intervention, right? I don't know right is the trade-off point. Yeah. Yeah, really

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not just the the OS updates either. It's it also this  This regulation draft regulation calls for repair parts and services to be offered for at least five years after that device goes on sale  also calls for meeting a strict standard on battery life or  Bring back swappable batteries. Can you imagine if we had a resurgence in replaceable batteries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean that's batteries are one of the biggest sources of e-waste  Yeah, right so like if you can have your batteries have more discharges without losing capacity  That would be great. But I I don't know if we actually have that technology at certain levels, do we? I  Don't know batteries  I'm gonna I'm gonna allocate my bezel stuff my bezel knowledge over to battery  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, all the action is I mean I feel like I saw let's see here I'm looking at the nine to five Google  Article the EU's requirements. This is from the article would have to  The batteries that meet the EU's requirements would have to retain at least 83% of rated capacity after 500 charge cycles and  80% after 1000 cycles and then you've got companies like Apple their claim for iPhone batteries  Is that it holds 80% of their rated capacity after 500 charge cycles?  One plus 10t for example, they claimed it can retain 80% capacity at  1600 charge cycles. So there's something in there that that manufacturers are able to do to  to rate  The the health of their battery and  Apparently according to one plus 10t because that's a huge jump from anything any of these other numbers  There's something that they can do to increase, you know  The the the health of that and and get more charge cycles  in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I have if you have to like lard the battery with like toxic chemicals though to make that happen. Yeah, I

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Haven't wandered the best buy phone department in a long time  Is there still a large selection of basically burner phones of oh good quite this phone for very little and  Don't open an account. I  Best buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know last time I went into Best Buy I mean are there a lot of are there burner phones for sale  I'm sure there are yeah  You don't have to go to best buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  Come by them everywhere. Mm-hmm gas station gas station gas stations grocery stores  Parades and I need to find the best buy I think like I have a new burner phone for every day of the week  I'm not reporting. What about you Jeff? I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  365 burner phones  Burn a hole in my pocket

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Leo basically does that just a normal course of his business. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's just another day here at twitch  Yeah, and then I think finally because we've been talking a lot about Android and stuff so we can wrap it up with this last  One, but I think this is I think this is actually very cool  Android 14 which is yes the next version of Android that we haven't even started to see any  Any versions of any developer previews or nothing like that?  we're just now starting to hear some aspects some elements about it to look forward to and  I think I believe on last week's or the week before episode  Y'all talked about the SpaceX and T mobile announcement that they would be bringing satellite connectivity to smartphones  Well last week  Hiroshi Lockheimer actually tweeted about this and said  Essentially said that Google is working. They're designing for satellites  He said we're excited to support our partners in enabling all of this in the next version of Android and it has been confirmed  By nine to five Google that the next version is indeed Android 14 that Hiroshi was talking about so  satellite connectivity coming to Android 14 at least as a capability and  Yeah, great for people who aren't served by kind of traditional connectivity traditional  Cellular coverage this would be first which is a small percentage of people but which  The most satellites through the other satellites. I don't know that there that information is public yet, but  It's just there. There's some similarity between  You know what SpaceX and T mobile is doing and what Hiroshi was referring to so I don't know if they have a direct relationship  But they're definitely working on building this functionality into Android to support something like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, I could totally see that we thought we'd see that on the new Apple phones, too. Yeah, I did too. It was a rumor there  right  Any of the satellite connectivity though  It sounds like most of these companies are looking at something like texting which wouldn't require  SpaceX level constant always on Apple this satellite discussed this morning

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they talk about discussed it? Yeah, it seems like they discussed that this morning and where it basically shrinks down the  The bits of SMS so you can get get it faster over this so-called satellite connection. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they did talk about it my bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that had to do with the watch is that what you're saying jam or be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's an iPhone 14 and though does the ultra watch also have it. Okay. Okay, explain the size

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There you go. Yeah, I know IRC says the satellite is for SOS cause okay. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that makes sense. I mean like the Garmin has their inReach which was a surprise hit for them and that's like a little I  Have one it's a little  It's a walkie-talkie looking device that you can use  Yeah, well no not a walkie-talkie it looks it looks like a tiny walkie-talkie, but it's not a walkie-talkie  sorry  and you can use it to send a little SOS in your location when you're camping and  You know like as a woman who goes hiking by herself. I'm like hello  Absolutely, yeah, yeah, and I mean I bought that for like 350 bucks and  So it makes sense that Apple's like hey, that's that's a feature  We could stick on our phones and maybe one day it could be even more useful over time because once you get those economies of scale  Yes, but the chipsets

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would maybe be awesome and that really that really ends up solving a  problem that we've all kind of learned to live with because we didn't have a solution for it, which is that you know  You don't always have connectivity everywhere you go with your phone  Now if it supports satellite connectivity eventually you could see a time where you kind of always do because  Wherever it you know traditional cellular coverage can't reach the satellite probably can and  Yeah, that's that's some good good progress right there like that a lot  So Android 14 would be something to look one at least one feature of Android 14 to look forward to and who knows?  You know if that's the case then you can I can already see it now right like the pixel eight or whatever now with satellite connectivity  Compatibility, but who the heck knows we still need to get to the step is is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh Stacey is that antenna specific to the satellite

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which antenna

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  To be able to get the satellite is it is it is the satellite?  Or is it a separate kind of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't know that sorry. I didn't even know Apple introduced it so now I'm like

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bezels get past the bezels here

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well if it's global star you do have to have a specific  Transceiver in your device okay, okay now did like and I is Apple using global star  That's like these are the like  Again, just found out they have this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just gave the high-level

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Apple picks global star for emergency satellite service on iPhone 14 one hour ago, okay, so then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then you would need  You would need a special antenna inside the device so it's possible in other words that

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Samsung  Could put one antenna in its hardware and Google put a different antenna in its hardware the software has to deal with both

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but it would be stupid to do that  It would be stupid because it would cost more so  If you have to have a special antenna manufactured as a radio  You're gonna want as many people using that radio as possible because then you can take your  Cost down on that radio because satellite radios  Like part of the expense of satellite is because they require specialized equipment that doesn't benefit from the economies of scale that are in cell phones

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, so so Queen Queen of chips  which chip is is the  What am I asking here?  Are the antennas the antennae in?  in  in our phones  What are they what chips they built into how many you got your your core chips?  But what chips are the antennae in is this something you just add on to an existing chip would have to be a new chance

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So qualcomm qualcomm integrates their application processor, which is the brains of a smartphone  there are now a lot more brains on a smartphone with a  Radio so okay Apple though because they built their own chip they still use qualcomm radios, but they don't use the  Application processor because they built their own right that's one of the reasons they're in this big fight with welcome anyway  So you could have your separate baseband chip for talking to your 4g and usually now they're they're pretty highly integrated  So you'll have a baseband chip that talks to your 4g your 5g network  I  Guess you could integrate that with  Right now you it's not integrated with the global star  So you would need another chip on your board for handling and the radio has the antenna plus a little  we'll call it an engine a DSP process or whatever to handle the  calculations of turning your airwaves into bits and bytes

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this this is those two things are nice  So surely this is been in discussion in the field for quite a while oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, well people have been rumored. I mean it's been rumored for like two years and  The other thing is the satellite companies for the last like I mean in 2005  I was reporting on satellite companies that wanted to get into the cellular space  one of the big issues were that  Your satellite spectra or your satellite airwaves and your LTE or whatever cellular airwaves  You couldn't have both of those right you had to have two separate radios, and that was expensive  and you always had to have  Up until probably 2008 maybe the FCC said if you were gonna do satellite connectivity  the majority of your connectivity had to deal with satellites and not with like  Cellular on the ground and they did that to separate the two things out and then like  Philip Falcone came in with light squared and was like  The FCC said yeah, okay  You don't have to you know you can have this combo terrestrial thing and most of your  Most of your traffic doesn't have to go through satellite  And then he was like aha I found a way to back home back my way into a cellular network  And then everybody was like no  And then the FCC changed their mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's politics technology. So this is really good because we happen to have the queen of chips right here, so  So the announcement that Elon made with with T-mobile  I mean he changed he has different satellites go different birds going up right  But how can T-mobile say we're gonna can they offer it only with one phone that happens to have this hardware whose phone is it?  What are they off?  Understand how T-mobile as a carrier can offer it across multiple phones or is it just one phone that going on this effort to  How do you think that's gonna work? Oh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the T-mobile SpaceX thing this isn't the other stuff now  Sorry no no and I'm actually reading about scooter X says Apple says they figured out who's the iPhones antenna  I'll answer your T-mobile thing in a second  The iPhones antenna and special software to compress to reach the satellites. Okay, so they don't actually they're using the  Wow  They're actually they're using the case well now they build antennas into the into the bezel  Okay, I just didn't apparently I just slept through this part of the presentation okay with Teemo in SpaceX  I don't know how that's gonna work because I have not paid attention to that at all. Sorry fair enough  I did learn a lot about Microsoft and  5g and AT&T though if you want to revisit that ever because that was all day yesterday  I did a whole talk on that with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you ask them why we talked to me in 3 weeks?  5g modem on our phones in order to get better battery. Did you ask them that huh? No? Oh, I can tell you why that okay?  No, I mean I understand actually I just I just wanted to throw my throw my  Upsettedness around a little bit about your ire. Yeah my ire. Thank you  All right, let's um  How about this? Let's take a break and then I know when we come back  We're gonna want to talk a little bit about this Twitter at it news. I'm really interested in this  I think I think it's very interesting how Twitter decided to go about this and I'm curious to hear your take on it and then  Pick out a couple of stories that you think out of this whole list you you want to talk about and then let's it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Revolution. Yes, it's anarchy. Yes. It's a it's a democracy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am opening the floodgates any of these stories  Let me know but we'll start with the Twitter edit because I definitely want to make sure that we talk about that  But first let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode of this week in Google and  That is eight sleep the show is brought to you by eight sleep good sleep is the ultimate game-changer  And I know because last night I did not get very good sleep, you know  It's been really hot here in the Bay Area and a lot of parts of the country  So it was really hot in our home  So we ended up sleeping in the one room that had air conditioning, which is the garage believe it or not  Which was great. We had air conditioning, but it still it just wasn't quite as comfy as my bed  And my bed would be even more comfortable if I had eight sleep technology  Running through it the eight sleep pod specifically is the ultimate sleep machine  Consistent good sleep can help reduce the likelihood of serious health issues  It can decrease the risk of heart disease  It can lower blood pressure and even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's yet  Still more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep and feeling hot at night  Like I'm talking about is one of the main causes of poor sleep. That's really what eight sleep is all about it  it regulates the temperature Leo has  Has eight sleep technology, you know on his mattress  It allows him to make the bed hot when it needs to be make the bed cool when it needs to be cool it down  I mean this stuff is really cool  I'd love to get my hands on some on some of this technology in my bed  But now you can fall asleep in record time faster than you ever have before  All thanks to eight sleep pod the pod is the only sleep technology that dynamically cools and heats each side of  The bed like I'm talking about and that's to maintain the optimal sleeping temperature for what your body needs and what you need  Might be different if you're sleeping with someone else in the bed  It might be different than what that person's body needs from a temperature standpoint  So you can use the pod to regulate it's pretty awesome with the pod  You can start sleeping as cool as 55 degrees Fahrenheit or as hot as 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Holy moly the result  clinical data shows that eight sleep users experience up to 19% increase in recovery up to 32%  improvement in sleep quality and  up to 34% more deep sleep and  You know when you get more deep sleep  You can be confident that your mind your body are moving through the restorative sleep stages that are  Absolutely vital for physical recovery for hormone regulation for mental clarity all the good stuff  Even better eight sleep recently launched the next generation of the pod the new pod 3  Actually enables more accurate sleep and health tracking with double the amount of sensors that delivers the best sleep experience on Earth  The pod is not magic. It's not quite magic  Technically speaking, but it certainly feels like it that's the beauty of eight sleep go to eight sleep comm slash twig  You'll get exclusive Labor Day savings through September 11th, right?  This is September 7th at the time of this recording. So you still got a couple of days eight sleep currently ships within the USA  Canada the UK and select countries in the EU and Australia  So if you're listening after September 11th use the same URL that's eight sleep  EIGHT sleep comm slash twig and you can check out the pod and save  $150 at checkout eight sleep is pretty cool stuff  You got to check it out and we thank eight sleep for their support of this week in Google  So it's happening we knew it was happening  We knew it was on the horizon. But now Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You air-condition your garage

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so okay. All right, so

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your car what's very special car do you have? No, it's our garage is no longer a garage

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We converted it into a gym for my wife when the pandemic happened her business in San Francisco  Shut down and so she moved her business up to Petaluma and so we ended up converting our garage into her gym and  Then her garage was getting really warm  So we got you know, like a nice air conditioner in there for her to work out of so it's literally  It's the only room in the house that has an air conditioner  I still refer to it as a garage even though it's actually more like a gym. Yeah, thank you very much

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just had is your wife a trainer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She does she does personal training she also does something called muscle activation techniques, so  Yeah, that's awesome that is pretty she treats people's muscular imbalance and stuff it's kind of like PT but it's a little different  Yeah, so and that comes with the added benefit on these really really hot days when we need a place to escape  We've got the AC in the garage. How's it? We go in there. We watch Stranger Things the other night  My daughter's brought in their squash mellows, whatever, you know those big stuffed animal things and we got  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cozy on the weight bench

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Our home doesn't have an AC either  But I have a window right here that's really loud and then I have a floor unit downstairs  And your head has a floor unit over there. So it can't be challenging to get things cool. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was was was hot a lot  I mean San Francisco I get it because it's foggy 90% of the time  But I thought up where you guys are it's hot all a lot. Well, not at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean it gets hot in the summer  but I think the the beauty of Petaluma and the area that we live is that  There's there's like this direct access of the wind coming from the ocean that about like four or five o'clock in the afternoon  usually during the summer we get this really kind of like ocean cool breeze that blasts through the  Town so it might be hot through the afternoon and hot Petaluma terms  It's like, you know 90 ish somewhere around there, you know, sometimes it gets 95 lately  It's been like in the hundreds which hardly happens 13 yesterday. Yeah, I mean  But that rarely ever happens today. That's super rare  Yeah, yeah exactly and now it's happening more but we almost always get that nice cool breeze coming in  And  The Petaluma

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Climate I love I love the Bay Area and it's microclimate. Yeah. Yeah, I live in this microclimate

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought I told my family we basically just have to survive lunchtime  Yes, right after that  Feel a difference. Yeah, cuz right I'm serious  You can definitely feel a difference right after that the temperature just changes and it gets comfortable cold

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Juno fish salad sandwich and you're okay. There you go

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't bake anything in the oven for the afternoon. Yeah, save that. All right. Thank you. I deserve that interruption  No, no, it's okay. It's okay  It's one of the things that I love about Petaluma is that you get that at the evening  although at the same time sometimes I wish I could like  Go to an outdoor restaurant and be in shorts and be perfectly comfortable and a lot of times in the summer  you can't do that in Petaluma you need like a little layer because  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're hooded to the beach

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you need a little bit of a show years ago. I came from from from Chicago and I said, oh well  I can I is okay if I put an air conditioner and they all just laughed at me  I couldn't understand why they were laughing, but I learned soon enough  Fog comes in on cat feet. Yes. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but but at the same time I will say it's nice having a room with an air conditioner in it  Oh, that's like that for four nights like that. It would have been unbearable sleeping upstairs in our bedrooms  You know on the hundred and thirteen degree day the evening of that where we didn't get that cool down in the evening. So  And now now on to Twitter. Sorry. No, that's okay. That's okay. I love it. Yes. So Twitter  Twitter this thing we'd love to hate we hate to love  Now with an edit button not quite for everybody but Twitter is you got I haven't got I haven't I haven't gotten it yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But apparently it's Twitter blue. I'm blue. I have the blue button  But is the different thing where you can do it up to 30 minutes and also McGill. Oh, yeah, that's that's what it's it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know who they're testing this with outside of employees  I think it's kind of starting there and then they're eventually gonna open this up to test with Twitter blue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought I saw that it was going out to the blue people like right away  The blue subscribers were we're getting it at least that cuz where I read I don't I mean eventually they are

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if they are right now. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can schedule my tweets?  Edit them. I know I know  Mobile  This is a test tweet

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can view the tweet and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then you know what? No, I still I know cuz I can't I can only wait I so I can't edit it  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I don't think that you're going to be able to like my understanding is that right now employees are testing it  but  So you might see tweets on Twitter that have all the the kind of  Symbols or the hallmarks of an editable tweet which I'll talk about in a second  But I don't know that you can actually edit yet eventually  This is going to be a feature that comes out to Twitter blue users. So you'll have to pay the what is it now for?  $4.99 a month for the subscription service and this might actually be a feature that's worth it depending on how often you tweet  Look like an idiot less often  But I think how they're doing this is actually really good  So essentially you're gonna be able to edit up to five times within the 30 minutes following the publication of that tweet  So you got five can't make up your mind by I know five seems like a lot  They initially said a few times and then they clarified up to five times which okay  That's that's a lot of editing power that you have in 30 minutes, but then after 30 minutes you're locked in  I suppose at that point you could still delete it and go again, but what happens when you edit a tweet?  It will appear with an icon in the feed. It appears with the timestamp and a label  So it's really clear when you're looking at an editable tweet or a tweet that has been modified  And then if you tap that label that actually takes you to an edit history  And I don't know why I never why it never dawned on me that that would be a great way to do edit because I've been  Very kind of like hesitant on the edit button  Discussion because I do believe that Twitter is you know, it's used in so many different ways for for good or bad  It's it's it's become an important kind of megaphone for for certain people and I want to know  Well, what about Facebook mr  How well but I'm not but I don't think that Facebook is used in quite the same way as Twitter is used for that sort

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of thing like this is with all a gazillion  bazillion followers and inactive accounts on that you don't think there's an just as many voices that could be used to  To document things that happen in our history and whatnot the same way Twitter has could be but is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like I feel like I feel like a lot of the communication that's happening in this way using a social network to broadcast it  Many many people it seems to and I could be wrong my perspective could be totally wrong  But it really seems like Twitter has has kind of filled that megaphone role

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does I think about like the George Floyd scenario did that originate on Facebook or Twitter's else?  They just face for that was on Facebook. Okay. Yeah, so  It has its place yeah for sure those things have been editable for how long now

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you go into a Facebook post that you posted five years ago and edit it?  That I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I know they've been editable. You guys are all Facebook's all find out cuz I'm still yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know nothing about I did come back to Facebook. I should say I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Am I am there I remember when we talked about this previously?  The the API was the discussion when we previously talked about it with  People using it as a source in news stories and right things would get wacky  That's right. How it would embed but I'm like nobody ever said that about Facebook and Facebook posts were editable

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, right blog posts are editable and there was there was an ethic about doing that that you should cross out  You shouldn't erase. Yeah, right. Yeah, right, but that was just I missed that ethic. No one does it anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We still do it. I know because I see people just update at the very top or at the very bottom, but no cross that  I've seen that just think I've seen at the bottom

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry, the argument I've seen I think I'm waiting for the edit button. I want it but Jason I think to make your argument  What I've seen is that someone could use it as a Trojan horse  That you could get in  Something that seems innocent  Or yeah  I guess you put something in this innocent and then you edit and it gets all kinds of popular and then you edit in something  Noxious and the noxious thing  Spreads it's a bit of a stretch to a stretch of a complaint to me  I agree with that all these other mechanisms are editable. The problem I've always imagined for  Facebook is  That once something goes out in the RSS feed you can't draw it back and change it  And so the only thing about the edit button that worries me is that I was hoping that Facebook was heading back to being a  protocol and an API  In which case people could just take it and put it wherever they wanted to but then that complicates the idea of editing  Maybe that's why the 30-minute thing. I don't know  But then that is that does that delay the tweet going out to the RSS world? Is that is that the thing you're doing here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good question, I guess I don't think of I rarely ever think of Twitter and in terms of RSS feeds

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anymore but yeah, I'm in tweet deck is a separate  Instance right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't know. There's a part of me that appreciates having the record though. Like if you're gonna edit  I don't know this I just I like I like that control I suppose I suppose at a certain point like if I put something out  There to a certain degree. I'm kind of committing to it and I guess that just that works for my brain  Things on Facebook, I just it is what it is cuz you're a journalist we're just cut we just are like

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's just we're gonna make it happen. Yeah, it is what it is. Go

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah  But I but I appreciate that there is that kind of historical record if an edit is made  You can still kind of see what was there before. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's that's better

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's better than Facebook or anything. Oh, well Facebook Facebook will tell you it was edited  I think it's fine to know edit trace

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's fine to have the tag on there to says edit because people are gonna make just general mistakes  they're gonna say something that comes out totally wrong from what they intended on saying because  Especially for using phones because we all know autocorrect just really does a great job with the things that we're trying to say  Explodives come out and things like that and you're like, oh my goodness  I really did not mean for that to come out  Let me go edit this because you know, autocorrect wrecked what I was trying to say not that I was just trying to  Get over on somebody and go back and hide my tracks if you will because sometimes people just make mistakes

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's true  That is true. You know, but there are people who hide their tracks there are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I know that but it's nice for the people that are that sometimes to just make a general

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just don't reread their stuff before they pass. Oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, hey, welcome to Monday. Wait a minute. Oh crap. Today is Tuesday Tuesday  Let me fix that welcome to Tuesday something as simple as that, you know, I just spent

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just edited through my manuscript another full three times beginning to end before I sent in my final line at it and I'll  And I've done over and over and over and over again, but the idea of rereading one little tweet is too much to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Weirdo that tracks. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's always after I hit send that I end up looking and going  Too late and I suppose for the month  I only really had Twitter blue for a month and it was nice to have that delay thing  But then I was like, yeah, you know, do I really do I really care that much like, you know, I'm gonna misspell things  That's alright. I'm human

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you let something slide is a mistake but when context is totally changed that's a problem yes, you know and then in  I  Know this is a bad joke  But there's some times when people want to tweet out the f-word and it comes out the D word instead D  Sometimes you want to go back and fix that, you know  There may be a reason that tweet in that expletive knows but they they should have the right to be able to fix that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, man. I am just gonna start tweeting out  What is going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Doc I know what they meant  that person meant  They said duck  Okay, so I'm opening I'm opening it up who wants to pick a story  What what is the story that y'all want to talk about that we have here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  80t and Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, that happens to be the next the next line even

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I figured I'd just make it really  So tell us a little bit about this  Alright, so August 2020. It was a dark time. We were in the midst of the pandemic and Google invested  That they purchased six point six percent of 80 t and they said hey  This security company is now going to resell our gear. It's center security gear nest cameras  And it was good and this started happening and 80 t got a boost Google  Didn't really get a bunch of a boost but it's it's a good  Was a good deal for Google just because it gets their stuff and more mainstream homes now  This month this week  State farm said, you know what 80 t we're gonna give you we're gonna make a 1.2 billion dollar investment  that's a 15% investment in 80 t and we're gonna give you a  Hundred no, I think they're giving you 300 million 300 million to play with and Google said yeah  You know what? We like what you're doing for us so far. We like this state farm deal  We're gonna give you 150 million and if you do really well, we'll give you up to 300 million to play with so  This is to me a really interesting deal because for the longest time we've been waiting for insurance firms to do more than just  Say hey, you got a security system  Great. We'll give you a 5% discount off your premiums because with the smart home  They can actually do a couple things  There's more devices that they can see use for like tracking things in your home  But they can also see if you're actually activating your security system  So we're gonna start seeing discounts that maybe are a little bit more  Appropriate to like the amount of gear you have in your home and the fact that you're actually using it now people who?  Get the 5% discount and don't turn on their security system. They're probably not gonna want to  Opt into using this particular state farm product  They haven't created a product yet, but I'm imagining some of the things that might look like so I'm really excited about this and  It also gives Google  Everyone's in the insurance company or insurance world for a long time had been like man  Google and Apple they could totally team up and offer some sort of insurance based on their understanding of what's happening in people's homes  And this is seems to be like Google saying you know what? We're not gonna do that  We're gonna leave that to the state  Farms the insurance companies of the world  But this this gets them kind of in the door talking and understanding the product a little bit better  So I think it's a really interesting thing  That's that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice does it I don't know why my mind always goes here  But when I when I think of kind of data sharing with insurance companies  I I can't help but have a little bit of a red flag kind of reaction to it  Is that warranted in a situation like this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If they didn't let you opt-in  I mean what they're gonna do is they're gonna offer you presumably and again, this is theoretical  This is presumably but like if you opt into a program like this  You might pay less because you activate your security system  religiously, right  Because you're  Probably gonna be at less risk is there they're thinking and so and you'll also it I  You don't have to act if you have to activate it that seems like if you could only get insurance if you install Google products  That becomes a problem. Yeah, but you can still buy like there's insurance like auto insurance that you get you get  Discounts based on your driving  Those are opt-in and people who drive really well really I  Would never would never buy a premium buy that as an insurance product because I drive really fast and kind of aggressively  So I'm a good candidate

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Driving gloves and everything it is like let's go. I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Down the road just exactly 10 June for here  I  Even drove in your car because you wanted insane mode. Yes, I did I wanted I wanted rapid acceleration

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The point is so I think if like I  Think it's probably good for insurance companies. It also brings the price of like things like  Water monitoring stuff which is hugely valuable  But is also like super expensive it could end up bringing the price of some of those products down to a point where more homes  Could have them installed. Okay, and that would be good  So I don't think this is like super nefarious just yet  I will say in the insurance like the health insurance world like if they're paying for a CPAP machine  They are actually making sure that you're using it and some people don't like the health insurance companies are getting data  on the compliance  And that's actually not opt-in which makes it a little dodgy air, right?  In this case, it doesn't stop then does not bother me. You have the choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's in your hands to decide whether you want to go that route or not and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until we see a reason if they look at like there we go your teenage kid  They see them on the camera sneaking out and they're like, yeah, we're not gonna ensure that right  That's a little if they're like there's certain like you wouldn't want them seeing what was going on in your house  Necessarily, even if it was like terrible behavior like you like to light fires in your living room like on the carpet  It's a hobby. It's a hobby

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To live on the edge. I'm really good

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But  Seeing like oh, do you turn your cameras on at night or when you leave the house? Yeah. Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good good best practices that actually actually help their bottom line and yours and your safety and everything  So, okay, cool. I can get behind that  Um

Transcript:  What you got Jeff anything on this list that you I still gotta get my head out of the idea of the air-conditioned garage  I'm still thinking Leo  Be looking up cuz you you're I envision you coddling your car. Good night  Leo and I would be looking up an old show called my mother the car which guys mother  I  Dated as his car which would be reason to put it in air-conditioned garage  But I I go off on a tangent that didn't happen Jeff

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just okay good go ahead dispel any any myths or rumors right now  My mother is not a car and actually our garage is not even fit a car anymore. It is completely converted  Okay, I just want to like this

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Imagine the how old family dad won't let us get air-conditioned but the car  Toyota he's more to us  Leave this now  So there's a thread I put up which is long thread least is not a long essay people from V for Von Detta  G von Joy  about  Hollywood and and I didn't know some of this I knew that there was you know used to be that that studios would would make the shows and  Distribute the shows and own the distribution channel right they don't the theaters and they would if  Paramount owned the movie theaters that if you want to get into my movie theaters screw you you're gonna pay through the nose  Because I'm only putting my movies in there right and that was happening until  But which there was a big case in the Supreme Court leading to the Paramount accords which they said okay, okay?  We won't do that and after then there's antitrust  and  After that occurred there was a huge amount of  Growth that occurred an increase in the number of independent movie theaters in the 50 60s and 70s an increase in the number of independent  Producers and studios I'm reading for part of the thread here the beginning of the end of the old Hollywood studio system  And the weakening by the way of the Hayes production code which which was a you know  Get the smut off the screen  Thing right so all this was going on and it's fine and everything's going along fine in Hollywood with us  and then in  2019 there was a case in 2020 Supreme Court enabled a  Sunsetting of the law which according to this thread ended. Oh  Last month it was a two-year sunsetting so August 2022  The the Paramount accords went away, and so now what you see happening is that?  the various new studios whether they have old names or not so Disney or  or discovery now owning Warner Brothers or  Who did Amazon buy  You know  MGM thank you and so what you're seeing I think  What we're seeing is the nascent beginnings here of the old studio system where Disney can make the show and  then they distribute the show and they own the distribution channel in the form of Disney Plus and  Warner Brothers has its with discovery which is a ridiculous structure Amazon will have its and we end up in this world where?  Nobody will distribute anybody else and we're in the position where you choose to go to the  Disneyplex or you go to the Warnerplex or you go to the MGMplex and we get stuck with  their bundles of what they choose to show us which is basically where we're headed right now and  as the thread says you're basically in a world where eight people own Hollywood and  You know Disney owns half of it having bought Fox and  Again Amazon having bought MGM so I found it really interesting to think through  where that is and as she says it made seem to make sense at the time to get rid of the  She's been a little bit sarcastic to get rid of the paramount accords because hey all the studios that were in  The original also don't even exist anymore and movie theaters who cares  but the  Principle that was behind that antitrust action  Sunsetting leaves us vulnerable now to I think to my mind a kind of bad era for  Entertainment and finally I think I mentioned earlier. I know I mentioned this to class today. Sorry  NBC is rumored to be  Considering giving up its 10 o'clock hour to local stations because prime time it's worthless now broadcast. It's worthless now  And and so it's really interesting time where the big guys are gonna try to  monopolize entertainment  But we have tick-tock we have YouTube we have all kinds we have podcasts  We have this show we have all kinds of other entertainment and what's gonna happen in that new melange  I don't know so sorry I turned that into a  Soliloquy here, but I find it absolutely fascinating to imagine what's gonna happen to online entertainment  I'd go back and see previous discussion of Apple and  phones and  Advertising it's gonna be really interesting to see how this works out here. So that was that was my little moment. Thank you  The why Leo tries to avoid democracy so I don't call for this a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I think it's a I think it's valid and I'm reading through this thread it's a it's a really great thread she points out  at one point that the original  decision  Actually ultimately increase the number of independent movie theaters. Yep, and now we're seeing  You know kind of in this in the current era. We're in this collapse of movie theaters  filing for bankruptcy  What's the latest part of that's like the pandemic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have no desire to go to theaters. I've I think I've said before I've only gone to see  Whatever the newest Star Wars was and I went to see Black Panther because the chat  Because in my opinion the movie going experience is just it can't beat  Being on my couch  on a nice clear screen with decent sound and it's dark and there's no interruptions and  People talking on phones or babies crying or sneezing and sniffling happening all around  My lawn yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Movie you can pause it and go to the bathroom

So about a year and three quarters into the pandemic.

I didn't miss it anymore. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe my dad lacked context though. Like you were sitting in your car eating  theater popcorn

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is a sad image right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My dad used to send us to go get popcorn from him for him from the theater really that was this that was a regular request  Yeah  Queen prude she she had her moments like that from time to time  but there's nothing like just getting the kernels yourself and throwing them in a pot and just  Shaking the daggum pot on your stove and popping them right there

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And butter. What's your stance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  butter salt  Yes, yes, there's one word but not and I did go see Top Gun in the theater

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you like I we don't have now any like normal like we don't have any of the fancy theaters with like the recliners  And the food and stuff and my child  Very spoiled  Will not go sit in a normal theater anymore  It's got to be very funny. Yes where the seat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Time has just gotten so much better, you know, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah  So I kind of get it cuz I'm like when I'm crammed into those seats again for like three hours  I'm like, okay. Yeah, this this movie is not transporting me enough to make it worth my while to sit here for this long

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right  Yeah the theater here in Petaluma, I don't know how many years ago at this point but got converted to the big recliner  Style, you know totally cut down on the amount of seats in theater. That's not a bad thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When we decided we were done with the theaters, this was several years ago and I  think it was Atlantis was the movie because we all went as a family so the kids could see it and  There was a kid behind us that was  Every two seconds just doing that and  Okay, so Queen Pruitt being a mother reaches into a purse  And she politely reaches back to the mother behind us and hands the mother the tissue  she's like, yeah, here you go hope to help you out and  Mom took the tissue and blew her own damn nose didn't even give it to the child. So we listen for another hour  And been back to the movie theater sense  Because it's it's so much better at home. Yeah. Yeah, so and I'm gonna agree with you

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So my mother made my sister and me and I in turn passed this on to my children an absolute  Obsession about hating open mouth chewing. Yeah, there's that too  Now that it's one matter if you got popcorn, but now when they're practically serving you a steak dinner in the theater  Yeah, no kidding, right?  it's it's it's the smell and the interruption and and and the chewing and and  No, no. Yes. Yeah  That's what we do this is the show yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The twig crew complains about movies I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love it. I used to work in a movie theater  So I would be behind at one point behind the concession stand, right?  That's where you start of course when you start working in movie theater and making the popcorn and I realized just how much of that oil  It goes into the canister. I mean, of course this was back in like 93  So I don't know how different it is now  But I mean it was I mean when you really see what they're putting into the canister what we were then  I mean, it was buttery scented oil. That's really what it was. Oh, yeah  Butter yeah buttery scented oil and I mean you put so much in that the popcorn came out and you know fully salted  nuclear yellow like it looked radioactive  That was how I made the popcorn back then I wouldn't make it like that now  But it was nice to have the control but once you've seen that it's kind of like oh it takes a little bit of the mystery away  It's like I don't know  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The essence of it, you know mass media watch out here  We're back to mass media  I'm not going back to Gutenberg. I was gonna say where's Gutenberg and all this  So it really was that was was steam-powered presses and all that and the model  And you're here. Are you consider just radio right broadcast? We've basically gone through a century of broadcast and it's over. It's gone  It's meaningless now it's crap on primetime. It's it's a radio in the United States  It's the reason to radio they're listening to podcasts like this one. Thank you very much. Right?  Yeah, well, yes cuz you're a feat

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You just can't see them because this is a podcast  Yeah, I listen I listen to a little bit of radio actually a couple of weeks ago  This is so off topic, but a couple of weeks ago. I was away for a few days and I went to a cabin  Out, you know a couple hours away and the radio in the cabin was tuned to a local radio station that played nothing but  Like 70s 60s and 70s kind of rock, you know roots stuff  Some of the music that I love and some of it then I'm kind of like, okay, I could take or leave it  But what I loved about it, I I experienced what kind of older  school radio was because they had the full they had the single announcer that you know was just like  Sitting there in a dark radio station totally curating the playlist talking about why this song is so cool  I remember back then when I was a kid  The playlist talking about why this song is so cool  I remember back then when I went to this concert blah blah  You know kind of spinning stories up around the music and you know, it was just one of those moments like it for a couple of  Days I was listening to this radio station and just like man  I I wish we had more of that but we don't anymore what we do have on radio is highly programmed by a computer and then you  Have you know a little color commentary in between but it's just not the same  It was it was a really the licensing rights

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could do that for a podcast, you know the problem there is the song licenses. Yeah. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was tick tock solves that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm just thinking like cuz there is a question about licensing for the new like for the new  Streaming in the new way we consume content and our IP laws really haven't adapted or changed for that. But  Wow, what are we talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a good point you could do that on tick-tock if you just you pull it with the camera for yourself let it play and  Yeah, and you give your commentary and you can because you can adjust the volume and stuff inside of the tick-tock video

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's your new radio station. That's ant radio. That's it pretty slick idea. Yes love does these

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  things where he goes on little Twitter threads about  Saw it like his ideal DJ party playlists or his ideal playlist for X thing and then he  somewhat he doesn't do it but someone always goes and  Takes that thread and then pulls the songs into a Spotify playlist  Which is kind of a janky way to have to do it  but it is really cool because then you get like arguably a wonderful DJ and  musician explaining like  Why he loves this song why he plays this song next what his goal is when it's you know for what it like if it's a  Get your lover in the playlist  It's really awesome. Yeah, but I would pay to have quest love do a podcast where he kind of does ten songs  You know, but he can't do that. I don't I mean licensing all that music would be crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah  It was nice though  Nice experience and I think folks in chat have figured out the radio station that I'm talking about declare  Mentioned ko ZT and Mendocino. So if there is some sort of like online  Broadcast rebroadcasting of that radio station check it out. You can do that. Yeah, exactly. Exactly  So I'm sure you can find it and you can see exactly what I'm talking about  Is there was something very just kind of like soothing about listening to it?  It's like I might not like every song that you're playing but I love the experience  It really just took me back to when radio was like that, you know  Just isn't anymore KOTC. Listen now ko ZT dot com slash listen dash now  There you go. Yeah, check it out for yourself  And then and I don't want to leave you out of this democracy  Is there is there a story before we get to the change log that you want to make sure we talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the only thing that came to my mind was was from  Adobe and this comes from petapixel. What line is this? I didn't say what line line 100 100 easy to remember  line 100 and this was more of a  Like a why like why why is this but Adobe is launching a camera app for quote serious photographers and  We all are familiar with mr. Mark LaVoy and in his history with with computational photography  Especially back with the pixel days and so forth  well, he's now Adobe and Adobe is pretty popular with their AI as well and  When I saw the headline and it said for serious photographers, I'm like why why would this even?  be considered because  When people are shooting with their phones the AI really takes a lot of the thought out of it  you don't necessarily have to think about shutter speed and and  ISO and stuff like that unless you really really want to and  Even if you really really want to you tend to go back and just say let me just hit the shutter  Button by default because it's gonna look good  It's it just just flat-out works now and I just thought it was interesting like why Adobe?  What's the point of this and I'm an Adobe fan?  But I don't know why I'm curious to see  What's gonna happen in October because Adobe Max is coming up. I'm sure this will be part of the discussion then

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this a so so is this a control app then or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and that's that's what I'm saying it  They have an app called Lightroom mobile. I'm sure you all know about that. Mm-hmm inside of Lightroom mobile  There is a camera functionality that allows you to do things like long exposures where you can change the shutter speed to be a lot  Slower or change it to be faster and really have some manual controls just like you would if you picked up a camera body  And it's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Using the phone's camera though. I guess is what I'm trying to write using the phone's camera to try to simulate controlling

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  understanding a  You're not necessarily changing the aperture because apertures are fixed on smartphones  But you can simulate an aperture change and far as how much light you're letting in on these things in it  That's fine  But again, I think a lot of that is already handled in the AI today, you know, maybe four years ago  Yeah, that's pretty cool. You got so much more control, but now the AI is so smart and  It could figure out your scenario and it's already taken a gazillion pictures before you even hit the shutter  Right, you know, what's the point of this? I don't know. I'm just curious to see what else they're going to say in October  I hope to go to Adobe Max. They gave me a ticket. I just can't quite afford the dad gum hotels down there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good lord. Where is it being held? It's in LA LA

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But but it has good well and I'm fine with the last-minute stuff like that  That's I've used last-minute services like that and it worked out well, but  You there, yeah

Transcript:  Waffles we could don't we could tell it's time for waffles  Chrome OS game controls something that Google had announced was coming is  Well, it's coming and does that support is rolling out  Chrome OS 105 actually brings an early alpha version of these game controls  I just it allows essentially for you to have  Expanded touchscreen control of Android games using the Chromebook  So there you go. If you like playing Android games on your Chromebook  You will love this feature or I actually don't know if you will but there you go. Look for it. Anyways  Um, let's see here Android Wow, I really didn't sort these very well  It's not like I had too much to do  Preparing and understanding the stories that we're going in the rundown today  The first patch for Android 13 is out. It actually fixes some issues some pixel issues  If you have the pixel 6a you are not gonna get that update  One of the things that I think this addresses was a big complaint that we were hearing about  Battery drain issues on the pixel 6 and the 6 Pro  I have wondered if it's the same thing that I was experiencing with the 6a but the 6a isn't on 13  It's still on 12. So maybe that doesn't matter but  nonetheless if you've been experiencing a bunch of battery drain issues on your pixel 6 or 6 Pro  Since upgrading to Android 13  you will want this patch because from my understanding it helps to address those issues and  Kind of bring the phone back to a better working order as far as your battery power is concerned  And then finally, oh, oh and I should also mention the pixel 3a and the 3a XL  We were talking highly about these devices earlier. They are getting their final update with Android getting a final Android 12 update  And I think that's it as far as updates go for that device  So if you have the 3a or the 3a XL you may have hit the end of the road  For updates, so I'm sorry to say that  and then  Finally, the nest hub max is getting some quick quick phrases  This is to allow you to skip the hey G  Command and so I think  It bypasses the hot word and  You know allows you to kind of set set it up so that you can talk directly to the device without always having to  Say hey G in order to do it. So I  Think that makes a lot of sense for a for a hub device like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We disagree. Oh, yeah, you don't like that  It's too much to pre-program so you gotta go in and do it in the app  I'm like, can I just say like hey G, let's pre-program my quick phrases  I see but no I got it. I hate opening apps. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fair is the programming process like a beast and you only get four choices

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen to me. I hate opening an app. It's so terrible  I mean God I gotta go into the Google home app and figure this out

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, it's it's like six steps inside the app, but  But it's a voice the point of voice is that you talk to it and it does what you say and yeah  I feel like Google like Amazon has been pushing  Madam a towards that so you can do a lot like you can set up a routine with your voice now and I'm like  Get on it Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well dwindle points out in IRC to that. The home app is getting very cluttered. It does feel like that. Oh my god  Such a nightmare.

I wish I had mine with me  I have some USB C cables from Nomad at home. They are awesome. They are reinforced with a double braided Kevlar  Outer sheath and then a strong metal alloy connector housing  Nomad cables have been engineered for extreme durability and heavy  Everyday use and they really feel like it when you've got these cables in your hands  you're like this is a solid cable this cable is not gonna deteriorate or  It's not going anywhere. The sucker is gonna work for a long time. They're also a climate neutral certified brand  Nomad is and always will be a company that prioritizes design and quality over everything else  One of the most important aspects to Nomad when designing new products is that they use the highest quality and longest lasting materials  Available so they design all their concepts from the ground up rather than white labeling existing products  You know that when you're getting a Nomad product you're getting a product direct from them  That is unlike anything you're gonna get from anywhere else. I'm telling you if their products are awesome  I also have a high speed charger again  I wish I brought it with two separate ports one port to power my laptop another port to  Fast charge my phone at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My  Pick of the week is a service that I used so this is one of those AI art  Generation things which I feel like now  They're they're propping up everywhere, you know, suddenly. Yeah, suddenly they're everywhere, but this was the first one that I that I had  had actually explored it, you know after seeing like the results of like Dolly and  What was the one that was free? It was like Dolly  It was like a limited stable vision Dolly mini Dolly light or Dolly light  Oh boy, it was like and it was interesting but everything but it it felt light  It felt like the images were kind of like low resolution and it was like, okay  Well, that's neat  But I want like full resolution like I want to see what these things can do get my hands on a kind of a higher-end  version of this if that's a good descriptor for it and  came across one called mid journey and  So

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should we tell you this was Leo's pick like two weeks? Oh, was it? Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think I know that is like I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But let's see well anyways

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo told you about it and I did a couple of images. So that's what I'll show  One of them was  Labeled it alien art in the dock and I can't remember what my what my cue was for it  But I put the links in there for you John  And so the first one oh wow when we pull it up have we showed it yet? No, no, no. Oh, sorry  Sorry, no, no below the story. There's three links to a Google Drive. So there's one called alien art  Cuz cuz leo already did the pic so I don't need to do all the setup and everything like this  So, ooh, isn't that interesting? I can't remember what the prompt was for this  I wish I had written them all down  But the the way that that mid journey does this is really interesting you put in the prompt  I think it's it's like imagine is the command prompt and then all of the modifiers

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Imagine and then it gives you a blank and then it gives you four

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four different ideas and like a little square grid and you can you can either choose to take any one of those ideas and up  Res it or take any one of those ideas and create four new ideas from that  Or you know and you can go down that road. So I did that with a couple of images  That was one of them that when I got to the end I was like wow that just that does  Looks like someone created that that is so like  intriguing  The second one I tried to recreate Leo had done podcast legend having lunch was that on this show  And I was like what would mid-journey do if I did that prompt so that's the second link and it's not nearly as impressive

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  although they you know, I look very similar though, is it the one in the upper left quadrant is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Old white guy with brussels sprouts on a plate, you know in the foreground

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The second one there is really the only one that alludes to anything podcast because it kind of looks like that that head on a platter  It's wearing headphones  Yeah  But that's podcast legend having lunch. I didn't really explore that one much further than that this last one  I was really stoked on I asked Micah to give me a prompt and his prompt  Of course, you are playing Dungeons and Dragons and I got four options  This was the winner and I'm telling you like I love this image like that is  It's a little you know, it's a little I mean very abstract actually, but yeah, there's no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have been trying each one of these services. My book is entitled the Gutenberg parentheses  So I want to cover from one of these things because I think it'd be really cool to have a book cover  Proposal to the publisher that came from AI right? Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't understand parenthesis. It doesn't understand Gutenberg  There's your side you would think putting something in a parenthesis  Yeah, but other things in a print doesn't understand parenthesis and Gutenberg is too far back in history for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm gonna do grammar snob printing press

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  grammar snob printing press

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  grammar snob printing Stacey needs a waffle  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or Oxford comma or something to give it some you know, maybe it's not parentheses  Maybe it'll get you something. I'm not being mean. I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Syntax or what it would requires. I mean one thing that I noticed with mid-journey  In my short time because you only get a limited number of free tries, right?  You get 25 free tries and then after that it's ten dollars a month you get 200 images for the month or  $30 a month and you get unlimited personal use  So I just did the 25 free tries and what I learned in that short amount of time is the more  Descriptive words you can give so likes the better the closer your image might actually  You know come to representing something along the lines of what you're looking for if I was giving it short prompts  I didn't get nearly as good of results as if I really went out on limb and was like, alright  Here's here's a bunch of descriptors  About what this this would look like so it takes a while to really learn the syntax of of how these particular  image generation systems work, you know, but  Someone prompted in the discord air-conditioned garage full of squish mullows

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks too real I don't even I think I want to see Jason's mother the car

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The air-conditioned garage  So anyways mid-journey check it out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the only reason I wanted to bring it up is because I feel like Dolly to you know  All these other ones I see people talking about them, but I have no way of using them  And then this one I was like, oh wait through discord. Okay, so I used to use it  I have no way of using them and then this one I was like, oh wait through discord  Okay, so I used it and who knows maybe I got the suggestion from Leo when he featured this two weeks ago  It's his tool. I don't know  But it's not here. It's okay  It's gonna have to come down from this  All right, well we've reached the end of this episode of this week in Google's been a lot of fun sitting in for Leo  He will be back next week to tell you all about the hair metal hair metal music that he is  Probably watching at this point.
