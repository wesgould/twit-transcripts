Just the three of us this week, starting with the wonderful, the talented Gina Tripani, former founder of Lifehacker and still there, but also her own page, smarterware.org.  The new book, the new Wave book, which is called...  The Complete Guide to Google Wave.  The Complete Guide to Google Wave.  The Complete Guide to Google Wave.  The Complete Guide to Google Wave.  Which is called...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  The Complete Guide to Google Wave.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Complete Guide to Google...I got to write that down.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Which is at completewaveguide.com, which I know is a little confusing that the URL doesn't exactly match the name.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Completewaveguide.com. So you can participate in the creation of the book, read it as it's going, and Adam Pasch, of course, from Lifehacker, working on that with you. That is awesome.  Yep. Yep.  I've got to read it because, you know, I've kind of stopped using Wave. It's like, I don't get it.  Yeah. Yeah. I think a lot of people have.  I've got to get back to Wave, man.  Also here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com, the great journalist and journalistic observer.  You guys are going to travel. Gina is going to be next week at Web 2.0. Jeff is going to be at Yale giving a lecture.  So the show will be on the air a little late next week.  We'll do it Sunday at 5 p.m. Eastern, right before Twitch on Twitch Live, and then it'll come out a day late Sunday afternoon.  But meanwhile, we're here together today to talk about Google.  Did you buy the droid, Gina?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I held myself back. I'm clutched with lust, but I held myself back.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I saw you doing that on Twitter. You were kind of begging for help. Stop me. Stop me before I buy it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I want this phone so bad, it hurts me. I'm just I'm trying to be frugal and sensible.  You know, Anil Dash and I did that site called lastyear'smodel.org, which is kind of talking about how important it is to kind of hold on to our gadgets and appreciate them and not sort of mindlessly buy whenever something new comes out.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's communist. That's terrible.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's why the economy is in trouble, darn it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could blame last year's model for that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So I feel like I'd let down the entire last year's model crew if I had gone out and buy the droid, but it is killing me.  In fact, this morning I was like, you know what? I'm just going to go to the Verizon store and check out the phone because it's my duty as a host of twig to have held this thing, you know, and really understand what it does.  You have to.  I just I didn't do it because I knew that I would I knew that I would buy it.  And, you know, and one thing I'm traveling to London in a couple of weeks and I knew that the phone wouldn't work over there.  So I'm going to stay with my 18T.  That's the big problem with it.  Yeah, that's the thing. I'm going to take I'm going to need my GSM phone in a couple of weeks anyway.  And so I am really filled with lust.  It just looks like such a good phone.  The hardware looks so much better.  Android 2.0 looks great.  Although, Leo, I want to hear from you about what you think about a Clare, because it doesn't seem like there's a whole lot of software updates.  No, no, a Clare doesn't seem to be a huge difference.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, the droid is the only phone that's using a Clare 2.0.  All the other Android phones are still stuck with one six or in some cases even one five.  They're still donut.  Or is it cupcake?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's donut.  It's an alphabetical order.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So it was donut, cupcake, and Clare.  Oh, that's it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That makes it easy.  You mean cupcake, donut, and Clare?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, excuse me. Cupcake, donut, and Clare.  Yes.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And then Frangipani next week.  I don't think so.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's a new one.  I don't know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Fried dough.  Next week, the Google Android fried dough edition.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What happens after they get to Zeppeli?  I mean, then what?  Start again today?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then they'll take it over the world and we'll all stop with updates.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They left out cannoli.  I mean, come on.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, no, sir.  The Italians are not happy about this.  The French are enraged.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Take the phone.  Leave the cannoli.  So the Android, or I'm sorry, I should say the droid, the Verizon droid is Gina Spectacular.  It is spectacular.  Colleen got one.  She got one day one.  I saw a pre-release version that Natalie Delcati had from CNET.  Best screen I've ever seen on a phone.  I mean, it is roughly the same size as the Apple screen, but higher resolution.  Gorgeous.  Really legible screen.  Some complaints about the keyboard.  The keyboard keys are not very well differentiated and there are slight raises, but not sufficient for you to know where your fingers are.  So it is a, I don't know.  It's a bad design.  I don't know why they didn't distinguish one key from another better.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I heard.  That the keyboard wasn't fabulous.  It's a headphone jack, right?  True headphone jack.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  True headphone jack so you can listen to your favorite tunes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And like smoke and camera, right?  But the pictures on the camera, are the pictures on the camera good?  Not smoke and camera.  What's the deal with the camera?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a five megapixel camera, but I am not overwhelmed by the quality.  The video looks pretty good.  I mean, look, it's two megapixels better than the iPhone.  But the, but the, but the, but the, but I don't, you know, these cheesy plastic lenses and it's got auto focus.  It shoots decent video.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Andy Anadko did a fantastic review and he did, he took some photos side by side with the iPhone and Android and the iPhone photos, despite the less megapixel edge, look much better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Better software, I think.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, because the iPhone's tap to focus, right?  Which Android doesn't have.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But it has a flash, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It has, well, come on, LED flash is anemic.  It's not going to make any big difference, I don't think.  And sometimes a flash can make a picture worse.  So I would say in the camera section, this is a wash.  It's not as not spectacular.  And I'm going to be honest about, you're right, 2.0 doesn't seem that much different than 1.6.  And, you know, these are small incremental improvements.  And I don't think Android is that polished quite yet to me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, right.  That seems to be the consensus, right?  That it's like on the verge.  So I think Andy's conclusion was like, this is a smartphone that's now sort of in the same class as the iPhone.  Yes.  You know, but it's not a definite iPhone killer.  So, but we're more on level than ever before, that it's grown in leaps and bounds.  I mean, the other big thing with EggClair, right, is the car home screen and the turn by turn direction.  Huge.  So I can mount this thing to my dashboard, right?  And then if I have the mount and I can kick it into car mode, right?  And so car mode, the car home screen is what?  It's just a couple of big icons that you would tap if you were driving.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, I haven't seen that, but I've talked to people who've used the navigation and say it's quite good.  In fact, John Belmont, newscaster extraordinaire, told me that when he got to where his destination was,  it showed the street view of his house.  You get to watch instead of just plain old, you know, cartoony maps, you get to watch the satellite maps.  Another person told me it's just like you're watching yourself drive down the street.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wow.  Next it'll tell you what you're searching for in that house.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is not the droid you're looking for.  But the interesting, I'm sorry, I had to use it.  The interesting point or important point, I guess, to make is that the maps are downloaded as you go.  It may cache some, but unlike a true GPS or even the iPhone GPS apps, the maps are not stored locally.  OK.  So no 3G means no map.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right.  And I hear that the Gmail client, which is awesome and one of the main reasons why I use Android is because my life is in Gmail and it's so great,  is that it now supports multiple accounts, which is this is probably like a geeks only type thing.  But a lot of people have more than one Gmail account.  And so now you can switch because on my G1, you know, you sign in with one Google account and you're tied to it.  So you can do multiple accounts now.  I do think...

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A little something.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So, Leo, you say it's polished, but not polished enough.  I presume it beats the hell out of a Microsoft mobile UI and Symbian too.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, you have to, one of the conclusions you have to draw is that both Symbian and Windows mobile are dead.  That it really is now down to Apple, Android with a, and depending on what the N900 does from Nokia, the Mimo.  I mean, I think Nokia is kind of out of the game, but we got to remember Nokia still sells more handsets in a day than Apple sells in a quarter.  It has incredible worldwide penetration.  It's mostly international and it's mostly cheap candy bar headsets.  Nevertheless, handsets, but nevertheless, they're still in the game.  And if their Mimo is basically their version of Linux, just as Android is Google's version of Linux, I ordered an N900 because that is world.  And I have to say, I cannot use a CDMA phone.  It's not going to work for me.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Is there going to be, is there any rumored schedule for Droid with GSM?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think it wouldn't be Verizon.  I think Verizon's got these questions for a while.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I'm saying for foreign, if I can go buy one in England, get an unlocked one in Europe, there'll be a market for that fast.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I don't know.  I haven't heard Motorola selling it to anybody else.  I love Andy.  Andy is such a way with words.  He says the latest generation of, and you bookmark this, Gina, the latest generation of Android hardware and software is Apple's worst nightmare.  They've discovered that over the summer, the sickly kid with asthma grew five inches and put on 30 pounds of muscle.  I love that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, he buried, that was the last paragraph and I, and it was a long review.  That's typical.  Best paragraph and the whole thing is buried at the end.  It's just like, it was like a prize for someone that lasted.  He writes, he writes great reviews.  I love Andy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  He really, he's a master of the language.  Yeah.  He really liked it.  I would say I maybe even like a little bit more.  There's no question in my mind.  If you're a Verizon customer, you should stay with Verizon and you should get the Droid.  I don't think it's worth switching to AT&T for the iPhone.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And by the way, Leo, they, they, they usually they give a discount to new customers for these phones.  In this case, I saw online that Verizon gives a discount to existing customers.  It's $199 for new customers, customers $149 for existing.  That's interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Isn't that different?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's also saw by the way that in the data plans, because I, I too, Gina was just asking,  anyway, I can justify this without getting divorced.  And they promise you a nationwide email.  I love that.  I thought, well, what if I only want to pay for Jersey?  Nationwide email.  What does that mean?  It's just such Verizon talk.  It is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's our nationwide network.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And, you know, it's obviously it's 26, $2,700 commitment to get that phone.  And, you know, the two year plan, it's just I blogged immediately that I want to create and Gina joined in on this.  The Gadget of the Month Club.  I want to at least get the phone for one month.  I'll pay a premium on that month.  I'll pay more.  I want a lot of different gadgets to be able to come in.  Some I'll get the fourth month.  I don't care.  Some I'll pay extra to get in the first month.  And I even got the CMO of Best Buy noodling on it via Twitter.  I just I want to get my hands on it.  Even if I don't own it, I want to have it for a while.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it'd be a great marketing trick because I think enough people would you, Gina, if you had it for a month, you'd buy it.  Oh, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  She'd be sucked in.  Dead cold hands.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I probably would.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, Leo has got me has has me thinking about the whole review unit thing.  You know, it's like I guess I could have really I could have asked.  You could have gotten a unit.  I probably could have tried to get a review.  I probably could have gotten one.  You know, I didn't.  You know, it's hard.  And actually, I would love to talk to you talk to both of you about this more.  It's like if I get a review and I get to use it, it's not kind of the same thing as me going out and spending my own money.  You know what I mean?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's exactly why I buy things, because I don't think you get the true experience unless you commit.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You put your you put your data on it and you say this is my phone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Bye bye, iPhone.  And you or whatever G1 and you use it.  And I feel the same way about laptops and everything else.  And it's actually the hardest thing about being a reviewer.  And I've done I did that for years is you got it for a week or you got it for two weeks and you just never really commit to it.  So you really don't get the experience that somebody who's put their hard earned money on the counter.  Right.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  At the same time, though, I think people who put their who spend the money and buy it psychologically, you want to convince yourself that it's the best thing ever.  And tell everybody that because you've spent your money.  There's the Stockholm syndrome.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I definitely found myself defending Android and my G1, which has a lot of problems that people know about just because, you know, I spent the money and I did it and I made the leap.  You know, so it's like.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it's particularly hard with phones because nowadays they change even faster than PCs do.  Yeah. So you're really you know, I mean, I have accounts with all the carriers and I spend ridiculous sums of money.  And I don't know why I haven't bought.  By the way, the chat room tells me good news.  There is a GSM phone, Jeff, of GSM version of the droid.  It's called the milestone, the Motorola milestone.  O2 in Germany is selling it now.  Yeah. Eight hundred sixteen bucks.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know, aren't you going to London soon?  Fly over to Germany and you got it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, if O2 in Germany selling it, I presume they'd sell it in England, too.  They're also an English carrier.  Milestone.  Milestone.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  All right.  Yeah, that might be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Google that right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I love it because in Germany they call mobile phones handies.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, they do.  My handy.  I thought it was because it was it was convenient.  It's because it hits fits in the hand.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a handy phone.  You heard Stephen Fry's little.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I lost my handy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's very funny.  I am impressed.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Milestone is announced in Brazil.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There you go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Um, oh, oh.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  My German friends.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're going to get the handy from the handy milestone went with the dog.  We'll stand up very nicely.  So I have to say it's heavier than the iPhone.  So it feels in the hand in some ways very solid, almost too tonic.  It's got this, it's got this feel to it.  And some say maybe that's a little heavy.  I think the only negative that I can see is that keyboard.  It's at least you have one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that's what Arrington went orgasmic over the thing on TechCrush.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  He must have got a free one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah.  But I think he was saying I hope I think was Arrington who just said, well, the good news is it has a keyboard.  The bad news is this keyboard.  Yeah, that's that's exactly right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good.  It's good and bad.  This is a huge success and it puts Android solidly on the map as it.  And by the way, 12,000 apps in the Android store than Android Marketplace.  That's not insignificant.  It means that there's a good chance you're going to find the app you need.  I mean, yes, admittedly, there's 100,000 in the Apple store, but 12,000.  I mean, there's going to be a lot of stuff that you're not going to feel like, well, I can't find anything there.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a solid number.  It can get better.  It needs to get better.  But I think that with 2.0, we're going to get a bigger commitment from developers.  And I hope the quality the quality will go up as well.  But it is a solid number.  It's a great number.  I'm impressed.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I think there there is definitely a real competitor.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So, Leo, what phone do you carry around with you?  I'm still on iPhone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm waiting for this N900 to come.  It's been way delayed.  Apparently, they want to do some cleanup to MIMO or MIMO, the Linux.  But it has a very good five megapixel camera.  Nokia has good cameras.  The N95 had an excellent camera.  And it's got a huge screen.  I think it's 800 by 480.  No, is that right?  600 by 480.  It's a very high res screen.  Touch.  It's got the same kind of multitasking the Pre has where you slide over the window you're looking at to see the other windows behind it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that's sweet.  I think that's one.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, the Android does multitask.  A plus there.  But I think I like being able to kind of switch between applications a little bit better.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What about the Nokia netbook?  Is that any different from any other netbook?  No.  It's coming out?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No.  And it's very pricey.  But that has built-in EVDO or built-in 3G network.  I'm really looking forward to it.  You know what's going to be very exciting is when these fourth generation networks start coming online and everybody's saying, oh, our 4G is coming.  Even T-Mobile, our 4G is coming.  It's a chance for T-Mobile to leapfrog everybody if they can get it out quickly.  That's so fast.  It's as fast as your cable modem.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I was at the Foursquare conference in New York this week, and the heads of Qualcomm and Google and Nokia were there talking.  It's off the record, but no secrets here.  And they were talking about 5 to 10 megs down and up, and that becomes real.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Man, everything changes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then the heads of Qualcomm showed a new screen.  It was just a prototype, but it was not E Ink.  It was another kind of screen that was full color, full motion, very, very low power that you could see in ambient light.  And so basically it becomes always on.  You're not going to pick up your phone and hitting a button to see what's going on.  It's just there and on, and it starts to change the sense of permanence and ubiquity that you have.  Eric Schmidt was just lurching for it, saying, when's it out? When's it out?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know, one thing we didn't mention that a lot of people are loving is the Google search app, the voice-based search app that comes on the Droid.  And I've seen several demos of it now.  It searches phone-wide.  It's basically like the one that was on the iPhone, except it's phone-wide search.  And people are saying it's extremely accurate.  Again, the benefit that Google gets from that Google 411.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Why can't they do a better job of Google Voice transcription then?  I linked to, there's a slideshow of classic Google Voice screw-ups.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I've been waiting for somebody to do this.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, that was just waiting to happen.  They're classic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Let me see if I can pull it up for people.  We can take a look at it.  For those of you who are watching at home, the rest of you will just have to go there on your own.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Now, Donut has a voice-activated search and also searches phone-wide.  Did it change in Eclair?  Oh, that's a good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I think it's the same as in...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's good.  It's really good.  In fact, sometimes I use it.  You know, my wife tells me, like, stop showing off, because I'm like, shh, shh, shh, I have to search now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the only negative.  I was at a party and a guy was trying to show me this.  And we had to say, shh, shh, shh.  I'm dictating here.  If it's noisy at all, it just stops working.  Yeah, exactly.  Shh, quiet.  Best, worst Google Voice transcription errors.  This is from CNET.  I'm starting to hate this on the web because they get more web hits.  I know, the slideshow thing, yeah.  I'm so sick of this.  In fact, I'm not even going to...  I don't want to even give them any credit for it.  Punish them.  Punish them.  Just look and you can see it, but you've got to click next, next, next, next.  And I guess they've been taking them on because some of these are for Twitter pages, some of them.  You know what?  I don't even think it's funny because I've seen them all.  Yeah.  Been there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Had the bad transcription.  Have you been noticing that the...  I haven't seen it on my Google page, but I've seen pictures of it.  Maybe it was only on Droid Ship Day, but Google...  I can't remember this ever happening before.  On their front page had a link to buy the Droid.  Right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's really important.  That's the first Google ad I think we've ever seen, right?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  On the front page?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I saw that once before when they rolled out social stuff in Google Reader.  I mean, they usually do it to point out their own products.  I mean, Droid counts, right?  Because it's Android.  This is the first one that's for sale.  Right.  I see what you're saying.  That this thing is for sale.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're pointing to a product.  Yeah.  And so not even their product.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But...  Schmitz has said that by not putting ads on the home page, they are forgoing and he quote  billions of dollars a year.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Think how many views that one link got.  I wonder if they got some money from Verizon for that.  Certainly, Verizon's very happy.  But it does show Google's commitment to making Droid a hit.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, that's, I guess, if nothing else, that's the...

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's really important.  You're right.  Because otherwise with Google's beta think, they tend to kind of stand back and say, it'll  work.  It won't work.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's what they've done.  That's what they've done up to now.  That's what G1...  That's really a good point.  Wasn't a lot of commitment to Android until now.  What is the story of Android-based netbooks?  Is that third party or is that Google now saying we're going to start doing Android-based  netbooks or Android-based hardware?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think there was a third party announcement for early next year.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it's not Google doing it.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't believe it's Google.  Okay.  There are a few different Android-based things coming out.  There's like photo frames and...  What was the other thing?  The Nook is Android-based, right?  The Nookie.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, the Nookie.  Nookie, book reader.  I did it all for the Nookie.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Max Hammack, who's a friend on Twitter, said, didn't they just ask one 14-year-old about  this brand?  Just one?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They're obviously not parents because any parent naming their kids is going to ask that  question.  You'd think they would know.  It's pretty funny.  Oh my goodness.  Let's see.  Let's take a break.  We're going to come back.  There's lots to talk about.  Even, yes, some wave news, some Twitter news.  PB Works getting a makeover.  That's the...  I guess it's the Wiki that Google purchased.  We'll talk about all of that in just a second.  But right now I want to talk about our friends at Citrix and the great go-to assistant.  Go-to assist.  We use go-to assist in the early days on the screensavers to actually fix people's computer  by remote control.  Go-to assist has gotten so much better, so much more powerful, so much faster, so much  more affordable.  They've introduced day passes for go-to assist.  So if you've got a parent or a friend who just needs a little hand, you can use it.  But it's really aimed at the tech support professional.  Somebody with software to support or perhaps maybe you're in an IT business.  I want you to try it.

They've they're they're letting you create your own topic pages.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. It's not a big deal, but they're they're bringing in a little bit of personal  aggregation, curation.  And then the interesting part is that you can get and publish that.  So, of course, I went to it and I created a Google News page about Google that  appears on my page.  No big deal.  But I can start to publish that to the world.  And if you get more complicated about it, if you did Google plus Eric Schmidt, but  not this, what's that people who come up with good topic pages can can kind of  become the new editors of the Web.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So would you did you embed it on your page so that you can see it at all times?  I mean, how exactly it did that automatically?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I did that automatically.  No, not a buzz machine, but on my on my Google News page on your Google News page.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ah, wait.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So where's that?  News.Google.com.  I knew you'd ask me that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Darn it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I have the link in the friend feed room.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You guys are the tools and tips thinkers.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I embedded it.  It's somewhere.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, it is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's so I'm going to find it.  It's in our if you go to our friend feed room, twit dash twig, which is what I'm doing  right now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, me too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Faster.  Oh, OK.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Google News.  Here's mine.  OK, so the URL is actually kind of complicated.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Long.  It is quite long.  It's probably not a URL we'd want to read on.  And it doesn't say Jeff.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it does.  OK, on the right, it says by Jeff Jarvis.  Oh, that's cool.  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And people can rate it.  And you know, I'm a partner in a company that competes with Google News called Daylife.  And part of our original plan, we didn't we didn't have to be, you know, startups have  100 things they want to do was to have people do just this, which is to create whoever created  the best David Bowie page.  General wise, my mind.  I don't know.  So I'm late to the show before the show.  Leo was on his Santa Claus hat singing.  But if Gina and I each create a page, but she creates a better page because she's got  the keywords right, then her page should get higher ratings and should rise and becomes  a new topic page.  Well, I press the button.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It says add this section.  Where does it add that section to mine?  On to your Google News.  So if I go to my Google News page now, I'll say Jeff's.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think so.  But you're the tools guy.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm just looking.  I see now a Google link.  Was that?  Yeah.  OK, so it does.  It adds it to my left hand nav bar.  It doesn't say Jeff Jarvis, but it says what your topic is.  And so now I have a new Google topic.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And so now I have actually that that has made you one of my editors.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  Exacto.  And you know, again, mine was not was not fancy.  All I did was Google.  But I think you can get you can do a lot of Boolean fun stuff to say Google Google plus  Eric Schmidt plus Marissa Meyer, not Sergey Brandon.  So it's is it a search term that you give it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Basically, yeah, it's time.  I mean, you know, Google News has topics that it knows about.  I think that if you if you went and put in, you know, me, it wouldn't be as satisfying.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, where do I I'm on my Google News page.  Where do I go to?  Is it in the preferences?  Is it in the advanced search where maybe I'm not signed in?  Let me sign it here.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  My account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Oh, you know, I don't know.  Google News top right.  Add a section.  Is that it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Add a section.  Yeah.  If you're signed in new custom section.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't like Gina.  I don't have that.  So we don't sign.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You're signed in.  I'm signing in.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Top right.  I see Web History.  My account.  Oh, I'm not a news.  Probably.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Go to news.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm still at Jeff's News.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK, let me go to my news on the upper right under the little red new.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There I see it.  Add a section.  Add a section.  Edit this page or add a section.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you can.  I can even do a local section, which is kind of nice.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's cool is you can also.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yes, you can do different languages and such and then publish this site to the directory.  So then browse by everybody.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So then and now in the directory, as you said, these are highly rated sections, some of them  by Google.  But here's one by Steph, a guy named Stefan.  He's got quite a few users.  Hey, most of these are by Google.  That's neat.  And I wonder what he did.  What I'm trying to see is, is it transparent what words he used to make it?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's a good question, because then you could just steal his search terms.  I just made a Google Wave section.  So if I now search for a section called Wave, let's see who has Google Wave sections.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to go to Google Wave.  I'm going to go to Google Wave.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I'm going to go to Google Wave.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to go to Google Wave.  So if I now search for a section called Wave, let's see who has Google Wave sections.  There's a few by Sean Brady, Randall, Don, Mark.  So yours will show up in here.  It's still not here, but it'll show up in here.  That's great.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So it's rather like Twitter lists in a sense, but it's just doing a list of the world.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  This is, as is often the case with Google, this is a great tool that they haven't exposed  very well.  It's not obvious how to use it.  And if they could just kind of, I mean, if they could take advantage of massive numbers of people  generating this, as massive number of people have used Twitter lists, this could be hugely valuable.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  And imagine if you had experts in various areas, if you had a financial reporter covering companies using this.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You could put this in your profile, though, say, read my Google News Google section.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, and Google doesn't think like this, but of course I should be able to, and you can do this with  the Daylife API, but I should be able to take this and put this on my blog.  Right.  Yeah.  I can create a Google page with Daylife.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's what I thought you had done.  Lazy and haven't done it.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But, you know, they're thinking, oddly, this is a case where Google's not thinking that way.  Google News does not think about exporting.  I went to Google News, oh, jeez, six years ago, seven years ago, trying to get them to export Google News to the news sites I ran.  Right.  They said, oh, neat idea.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I never did it.  That got hooked up with Daylife, I guess.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Because it is a great idea.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Daylife has an API, not to plug it, but it has an API that enables, USA Today has 40,000 topic pages created using Daylife that pushes their own content first and then the content of the rest of the world, plus photos and quotes and that kind of stuff.  So there's some similar functionality here, but it's API think versus destination think.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Interestingly, I have a Google Alert set up for this particular news story I was following quite a while ago, but that's also showing on my Google News page on the right hand.  So your alerts are showing up, too.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's good.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Which is interesting.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this replaces, in some ways, an alert functionality, I guess.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It does.  I mean, the good thing about alerts is that it will email you a digest.  Yeah, so it's those things that kind of like, my friend is involved in a case and I'm not going to look every day, but I want to get notified if something happens.  So it's just one kind of way to do it.  I use it like most people do.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I just put my name, my search terms so I know.  Ego search, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it is an ego search.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now, if I do an RSS of this, yeah, so I also have all the ego searches as RSS, my RSS reader.  I have an ego section.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is there an RSS of your Google News?  Yes.  There is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So I have Google News, Techarade, Ice Rocket, Blog Pulse, because I'm making news in Germany, Google News Germany, and I just go there and revel it myself.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Now, does this require any work on your part to maintain or is it now just, it's just a customized search?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's all it is, really.  Yeah.  But I guess, you know, what you could do, I guess, Leo, is that you could go in and say, I'm going to do the World Series page.  And as Utley becomes big, you add Utley.  You add Utley, yeah.  In some way that you can tune it and be known for having the best World Series page.  Clever.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina, you're of an age where Sesame Street resonates.  I'm not.  I was 12 when Sesame Street, and Jeff and I are too old, really.  Yeah.  Yeah, I definitely grew up on Sesame Street.  But you grew up on, so, and I imagine the Googlers did.  So for you, for the last three days, every time you went to Google, you'd see a Sesame Street character.  That, to you, made sense.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know, I see Sesame Street characters and I just feel warm and fuzzy.  Yeah, so that's why they do it.  Yeah.  But it has been for three days.  You know, it's interesting.  I noticed it, but I just, I didn't look into what or why or for how long.  Three days is unprecedented.  I can't think of any other, well, no, wait a minute.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The crop circle thing went on for a while.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  But this is ridiculous.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not, no, I'm not, no, I'm not knocking Sesame Street and I love Sesame Street and blah, blah, blah.  But it's kind of, it's almost a little juvenile.  It's like, it's like this was, this was so seminal for people in their 30s.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a little, it is very sort of generationally specific.  It's totally generational.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I love Oscar the Grouch, but I, you know, I don't get why people are going all warm and fuzzy on it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, honestly, I so rarely visit the homepage.  Yeah.  I had some network problems this week.  Same here.  So I was going to Google.com in my browser, but that was the only reason why.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The only reason I see it is because other people use these computers here.  So I log them out of their Google account and then you get a generic Google page that has a little version of it in there.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I note the ad is gone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The ad is gone.  So it must have just been for day one.  What, does anybody know how many page views that front page gets every day?  It's got to be billions, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, you know, I would imagine that the search results page certainly as a group got a hell of a lot more.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, let's hope.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As a group, but the point is they are a group.  They're a bunch of different, it's heterogeneous.  This is one page that everybody sees.  And as you pointed out, Eric Schmidt said, this is a valuable, this is the most valuable real estate on the internet, isn't it?  I'm just wondering how many impressions that Droid ad got.  I was just trying to look it up.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But it has to be going down, right?  I mean, people have to be moving away from visiting Google.com, right?  I mean, aren't people, do you think people are using the search boxes?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You know what, I watch people who are not idiots go to any site, not even by using the search.  They go to Google.com first, then they type in Google.com, then they go to the site.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, they're idiots.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm sorry.  No, but I think nowadays most people, because most browsers, I think all browsers now have that little Google or that search box up in the upper right.  Yes.  Don't you just, in fact, it's frequently that I won't even type a URL.  I'll type a term in there and then I'll get this Google search page and I'll click where I wanted to go.  So it's an extra click.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I wish I had a four leaf clover there in the toolbar so I could just go lucky from there.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?  I'm sure you can add the Google toolbar.  You'll get you add a little.  Yes, that's true.  But who wants that?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't want that.  There's gotta be a way to build a custom search that does the lucky.  I'm going to do that for you, Jeff, after the show.  It's really easy to make a custom search engine.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, you would make a custom search engine.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, like, well, I mean, that's the way to do it.  Yeah, it's just it's just a query.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you chase the favicon that way though?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, you can actually set it.  You know, it's just a little bit of XML.  You need to put a little bike there, Gina.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Gina's bicycle search.  Or wave.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Either one could be your logo.  I don't know.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You can set the favicon.  At one point I made one for Lifehacker because Lifehacker's internal site search kind of really sucks.  So I tell my readers to Google it to do a site colon Lifehacker.com.  So yeah, so I'll put together.  I'm sure a lucky search wouldn't be too difficult.  That's cool.  Not to sound like a boastful programmer that I sound like right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Hey, I thought you were going to do it in Firefox, Firefox extension or something like that.  I thought you were going to change the Firefox UI and that that's more impressive because you have to use JavaScript for that.  Well, I could do that too now.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Aha!  No, I'm just kidding.  Aha!

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to send you a droid just just because you deserve it for that.  Just for that.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Just because I'm being one of those annoying coders.  Yeah, just because you're an annoying coder.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You deserve a droid.  No, not all coders.  You deserve a droid.  You deserve a droid.  What is the Google data liberation front?  It sounds very lefty, but I don't think it really is.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, I just so I discovered this through your tool of the week, which we'll talk about later.  But it was kind of they mentioned it kind of offhand in the announcement that they had founded this data liberation group, which I hadn't seen before.  I did.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  She's been talking about it as their defense against those who say I can't leave you.  Yes, you can.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So, I mean, it's a group of engineers inside Google whose purpose is to figure out or encourage the different Google products, encourage ways to export your data and to get your data out.  Right.  I just love this.  I love this.  You should be able you need an escape hatch.  You should be able to come and go as you please.  We don't want to make it difficult to get your data out.  So this task force exists within Google to, you know, quote unquote, liberate products.  And so if you go so now figure out the URL there is if you go to the site.  Dataliberation.org.  Dataliberation.org.  And it's a very sort of it's an interesting kind of design and it seems like a very political.  It does.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's got a fist, a raised fist in red.  And the fingers of the fist are one zero one zero, which I like.  It's like very binary.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  And so they have a list there of all Google products and the ways in which you can export your data.  It's fantastic.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Do you think this is PR or you think this is genuine?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think it's both.  I think that Google is an organization made up of primarily engineers.  And I think that data portability and the ability to export, get your data out is very important to the kind of engineer that Google attracts.  I do.  I do believe that.  But I also do think it's PR.  I mean, I think that Google knows that people are starting to get a little more and more freaked out about the fact that they have your email, they have your voicemail, they have your, you know, your RSS reading habits, they have your search terms and, you know, that if Google wanted, let's be honest, if Google wanted, if you're a heavy Google user, they could build a very, very complete profile of who you are as a person.  You know, so I think people have fears about that.  And I think that this is Google's way.  This is also a PR move.  This is a way.  I think you're right.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think it's even even on antitrust.  I've seen Eric Schmidt at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Brian Lehrer from the NPR station here in New York said, you know, aren't you too big?  Basic standard question.  Shouldn't you be regulated?  And I can't leave you.  And Schmidt said, yes, you can.  For every single Google function there is, there is a perfectly good alternative.  And so trying to accuse Google of monopoly becomes difficult.  Then if they say not only is there alternative, we will make it very easy for you to leave us and go to that alternative.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's not it's you can't tell whether it was the idea was the engineers there was with the engineers first or was was the management first.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But it's I had the impression it was engineers first, but it's part of the principle of the company and they know they have to hold to it.  Good.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right on.  I mean, I think that's very important.  I agree.  It is extremely important to their users.  Yeah, definitely.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And Facebook doesn't have that.  No, no, no.  Twitter doesn't have that either.  Facebook couldn't be more unapologetic about wanting to keep you inside the wall.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can you get can you use RSS or some other method to export your tweets to like there's there's ways to save your tweets.  Yeah, there are very easy ways.  Through the API or the API.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, it's all totally exposed.  It's pretty easy to export your tweets.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it's pretty simple to do.  The only thing with one caveat is that you can only go back like 3200 tweets and it's and it's a scaling.  You know, I think it's more of a scaling thing than anything else.  They don't want to have to save everything.  Right.  And well, they don't want to have everything, you know, on there.  I think they have these front end servers which help you search, you know, the most recent tweets.  But I think they archive the old stuff on other servers and they have an exposure to the old stuff.  And yeah, but I talked to Alex Payne about it because I was who's a developer at Twitter and he said that exporting all your tweets is on the roadmap and they're working on it.  The other question I have I was trying to search this morning for a tweet.  I was writing a post about this woman who wrote about her miscarriage.  It was happening.  It became very controversial and I wanted to go back to the conversations.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I know there were tons of them, but search seems to go back to the conversation.  And I think there's a lot of different ways to do that.  I wanted to go back to the conversations.  I know there were tons of them, but search seems to go back about 12 hours.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, search does not go.  Search is not every tweet ever.  It's only recent stuff.  Very recent.  Yeah, very recent.  Yeah, so useful.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But that's a scaling problem, too.  I'm sure.  I'm sure they would like to do more.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it definitely is.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, we're just Twitter is saddled with its bad decisions early on as to data structure.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But that's where I complained about the new list function that was difficult to use.  And Fred Wilson, who invested in Twitter, answered on Twitter that that's what the API is for.  That's what developers are for.  Somebody will solve that elsewhere.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and that's one thing they've done extraordinarily well.  It's been one of the reasons they've been so successful.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, I was at this Foursquare conference and Biz Stone was there and Reid Hoffman and Chad Hurley were up there.  And again, it's off the record, but I'm not giving away anything here.  And they were asked, well, what would be the ideal company for you to go to to get a distribution deal?  They looked at him like they were confused German shepherds tilting their heads.  What?  Distribution deal?  Why would we want that?  We have our people.  We have our people, right?  We have our users.  The thought is just so different to how big old companies operate.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so funny.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter does an amazing job of putting developers first and expose.  They expose their API often before users get it on their own site.  They're doing that right now with a geolocation and retweeting, right?  Retweeting. Yeah, yeah, that's not right.  That's out on the API first.  It's really amazing.  The degree of openness is amazing.  And the fact that they're just not worried, they just don't seem worried that anyone's going to build something that's better.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, that's because they have a lot of money.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Well, yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, it's also, Gina, I think that is their means of distribution.  That's what's going to make them world dominant is that network is that the other thing that struck me at Foursquare was that these kinds of guys were not talking about corporations and industries and  the agglomerates.  They all use the word ecosystem.  They all recognize that they're a member of something bigger rather than the owner of their world.  And so I think Twitter has been brilliant about that.  And they have very few staff members.  They're already huge and they're going to get gigantic by thinking that way.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Question on this.  We were going to talk on Twitter lists last week and got short, but I was having a lunchtime discussion with son Jake today.  And he was saying, you know, I don't really see what the big deal is about lists.  About lists?  Lists.  Yeah.  And I take his point because I was doing the automatic echo chamber reflexive, it's big thing.  And yeah, I mean, I looked at a bunch of lists and most of them have zero users.  I would prefer to have tags.  I prefer to have people, as you do on Flickr, congregate around a word like funny or description of things where it becomes useful to more.  Or even the Google News thing where people can rate it and publish it and people gather around.  The problem with lists is, as Jake said, you're going to see 100 exactly the same lists for the World Series.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So how would a tag, I mean, first of all, a list could be a tag.  That's just exposing it that way as opposed to.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But you can't coalesce though, Leo, right?  The three of us could start lists.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because of a taxonomy issue, it's a folksonomy, so you can't agree.  But World Series, probably people would agree on.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I don't know whether the API would enable you to then find, oh my God, 100 people made World Series lists.  Here they are.  And then somehow get to some kind of ranking.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's just a database issue.  I mean, in effect, by having people create lists, you're having them tag people.  It's just kind of an upside down way of tagging.  I don't see any reason why you couldn't expose it that way.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that's what makes it useful.  Because then I don't care whether it has a bunch of users.  If you had dumb as a list title and everybody started people they don't like into dumb,  and we find out who's the dumbest then, who's on the most dumb lists, that'd be fun.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  What's interesting is that very quickly the third party clients have started.  TweetDeck, Seismic is now supporting lists, and Brissley.  I hope you got your Brissley invite, Jeff.  Yes, thank you very much.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Now has converted its groups.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It had groups before into lists.  So you can see the lists.  You can create lists.  You can modify lists.  You can subscribe to lists.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I haven't done my TweetDeck update yet.  So they bathed lists into the TweetDeck.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I apologize.  It's not available yet, but they have said they would.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  They said that they're going to do it.  The thing about lists is that so many of the more advanced clients had group feature.  So it was almost like Twitter kind of catching up to them, and then it was just a matter of the clients saying,  oh, well, okay, we'll guess we'll use their lists.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  As is often the case with Twitter is that it follows the users.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Right, it follows the community, like with retweets.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And at signs, and most of the functionality of Twitter, frankly.  It's true.  They subtract stuff, but the stuff they add tends to be by...  So I think Brizly has done a good job of not only taking this API, but making it more useful.  They've got delete buttons and per individual delete buttons they've got.  But I think this is pretty close to tagging, Jeff.  I think that this is just another way of doing it.  If you use the API correctly, I agree.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think that's where the utility really comes in.  I agree with you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And it's a folksonomy.  So there's, you know, we might spell, you know, I might have a geek list and you might have a tech list that say the same thing.  And I've noticed people like you, the smart people like Jay Rosen have very interesting list names.  That goes against the taxonomy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And that's what I, you know, I, my list names are photographers, politicians, science.  His is mindcasters.  Yeah. And his is mindcasters.  So...

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I also tried to get a little clever with my list names just to make them unique.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe that's not the right way to go.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's probably not the right way to go, right?  It's like, it's better, more useful if we can all agree on a vocabulary.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And I do, you know, my tech list, presumably people will know that, oh, Leo's a guy that you would look to see who he's following in tech, has 485 subscribers.  I mean, people are, you know, 300, 300 on my tech TV list and my Twitch list, 374.  So people are using those lists, I think.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's a better Follow Friday.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a better Follow Friday.  It's a better SUL.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But, you know, one difference though, Gina, Chris Brogan was, was arguing that he didn't like the list.  But he was also, I think, saying that lists are necessarily a recommendation.  And I said, no, not at all, because you can have a list of idiots.  You can.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's true. You can have a list of spammers.  Like these are people who try to pitch me products constantly.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So Follow Friday is, I think, inherently a recommendation where lists don't have to be.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Lists are what you wanted.  They're a taxonomy.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think so, if we can get at that.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I think that they...  Okay. Listen up, Twitter.  That's what we want.  And I think you're exactly right.  I think you and Jake are exactly right that what we really want is tags.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, the other thing Jake said, and I again couldn't answer him, but that's life.  Hey, at least you're talking about these things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I talk with my son, I say, why you shouldn't be smoking.  So you're way ahead of me.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It gives us opportunity for conversation.  It's a good thing.  But he said, why the hashtag?  Why not just the word?  And I fumbled and tried to answer it and said, well, if fail hashtag is different from fail in a sentence, but he said, not that much.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, you shouldn't.  No, he's right about that.  In fact, Steve Gilmore, for a long time, was trying to deprecate the at sign.  He said, what do you need an at sign for?  A good search eliminates the need for hash or at or any of that stuff.  It's just search.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  There is an intent to that.  Yeah.  There is an intent to the at that says, this is really about this person.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's some functionality.  But you can duplicate a lot of that with appropriate tracking and searching.  And I think there's an intent to the pound sign, to the hash sign.  You're saying this word is more than just a word in a search.  This is taxonomy.  I like tagging.  I think tagging is very powerful.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I don't like that hashtags have started to make it have started to sort of spread into onto other sites where there isn't the 140 character limit.  Have you guys seen that?  I actually probably shouldn't complain.  I'm probably going to get in trouble with my colleagues at at Ocker and at Lifehacker because we're now using a lifehacker is now using hashtags to tag posts.  And that just doesn't it just doesn't make sense to me.  Why not?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because I mean, WordPress has had tagging for a long time.  Almost all blog platforms have tagging.  I think tags are great.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I think putting the hash putting a hash mark doesn't make sense because you're not limited to 140 characters.  But it seems to be kind of this newfangled Twitter thing to do.  So people are doing it in other mediums.  I think it works well on Twitter.  I think tags.  I love tags across the board.  Delicious.  I'm all about tags.  I just it's the hash mark that seems unnecessary in other in other contexts.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I think I think you're right about the intent of the hashtag is that the problem with Twitter I was on Dave Weiner and Jay Rosen's Rebooting the News podcast week ago.  That should be disloyal.  No, no.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In fact, I want to get them on our show.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They're on my list.  But as a guest.  And so we talked about I wish there were also a taxonomy for what does this hashtag mean?  What conference are you at?  Right.  That's where it started.  So I said why not, you know, I think we talked about this before, define hashtag.  And Dave said, yeah, I agree.  And he tried to suggest that.  But you can't do it on Twitter.  That led me to a post where I said that I love Twitter, but it's causing me problems in memory because I'm logging less.  I'm storing things in the blog less.  When I link to something on Twitter, it goes away.  And the other problem is that it's a really bad place in the end to get a good critical mass going because the half life of a meme on Twitter is sometimes 30 seconds.  Right.  Maybe 24 hours max.  Whereas on a blog, the notion of the permalink and I think it's more fundamental the whole Internet that an SEO permalink world, which we had in the page based Internet, what we're seeing with Twitter is the future that's going to go off and everything is fleeting.  Everything goes away and you can't gather around.  If you don't gather around real fast, forget it.  It's over, Bob.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Those swarms, those attention swarms really move on.  That's the nature.  That's the short attention span nature of Twitter.  Yes.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is why it's so important for us to have our tweets on our own servers and include them in our blog posts and link to them and that kind of thing.  The difference between storing your bookmark on Twitter and delicious is that you're going to broadcast it more easily and it's probably more people on Twitter, but it's not going to be archived the way that it is on public posts.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's just kind of the nature of different media.  Some media are short term and some are long term.  A blog is a long term post.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  But our presumption about things, that was TV and radio.  When you did radio, it went off into the airwaves and they're listening to it somewhere in another galaxy now.  Whereas once the notion of the permalink came and the ethic of the permalink came, it was Nick Denton who first taught me about it and said, no Jarvis, you did the wrong thing.  You should have done this and that to link to here and there.  He taught me what it meant.  I think that's changed my perception about what I expect, my expectation about information.  That it's an ethical thing to get back at it and when things go off in the ether, I'm feeling like it's lost now.  You want Brewster Kale to start the time machine for the streamed web, not just the paper.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Right.  You're right.  You hit the nail on the head.  I'm just used to it because that's the kind of media I do.  In fact, I prefer because if I say something stupid, at least it doesn't stick around to haunt me.  You write stuff down, people have this nasty tendency of bringing it back up.  I can always deny it.  I have high deniability.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Was there a singing of Christmas carols before recorded anywhere, Leo?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I don't know what you're talking about.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It never happened.  It's gone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's gone.  No, unfortunately, we record everything.  I've got an array of hard drives and everything is permanent now, but I control the permanency.  Let's get to our tool, our tip and our number of the week, starting with Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  My tip this week is a little cheat sheet.  I love this.  Google Voice.  Google Voice, people are getting invites and sending out invites and more people are trying it out.  Google Voice is fantastic, but I tell you, I really could write a complete guide to Google Voice as well.  It's got a lot of different options.  When you call and you get to press this to do this and to do that, you can do all sorts of cool things with it, but sometimes it's hard to remember what you're supposed to press when.  This very cool designer at coolgeeks.com created a Google Voice quick reference guide, which is just a graphic that you can use to just a reference for the decision tree when you go into Google Voice, when you check your voicemail, when you want to make a call.  I don't think that he or she mentioned this in the post, but one thing you could do is take this reference guide.  It's just an image and set it as the wallpaper to your phone.  Oh, yeah, I didn't actually try that out, but it looks like about the about the right size.  If you got a phone that has wallpaper and you're just starting to use Google Voice, it could be a good way to you.  You have to glance at your phone and then do it.  If you've got icons in front of it, it might be a little tricky, but one way to do it or if you just want to print it out and have it on your desk while you while you sort of get used to Google Voice.  I don't you know, I love Google Voice and I use it all the time.  It's my primary number, but I don't use a lot of the functions.  I use it in a very specific way.  So as you're exploring and figuring out how it works for you, this quick reference card is a good it's nicely designed.  It's colorful.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm done.  Google Voice.  Do you think you'd even need this?  Did you get find a way around this?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  You know, it's it's so interesting, you know, Lars Rasmussen that the wave wave lead said wave is complex on purpose, right?  We didn't we weren't shooting to build something that people can understand that in a day.  There's a learning curve and that's, you know, we're unapologetic.  Basically, he was saying we're unapologetic about that.  And and I in a way, I kind of really like that.  But it really is completely opposite to Apple's ethos, right?  Which is like make it as simple and one click as possible.  So, no, if Apple built Google Voice, you would not need a quick reference card.  There does come a time, though, half the stuff either.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So there does come a time, though, when you want when you have to be complex to be useful.  I mean, if you limit yourself only the things that don't need a reference card, pretty soon you only do trivial things, right?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. But what Google itself, you know, the simplicity of one box giving you the entire world.  Yeah, is is complexity brought to simplicity in a really elegant, profound way.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But and search and the Web lend themselves to that. But I don't know if everything does.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  No, OK, that's fair. I think Google loses something on simplicity.  Gina, since you brought up Wave, I meant to ask this one.  Is Novell coming out with a first enterprise app on top of Wave and releasing that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that a big deal? Is it is it is it a server?  What are they what are they what are they released product?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Novel pulse. Huh.  And I just thought that it was one of the reasons I'm asking is it seemed amazing to me that a company was going to  announce and release a product on top of Wave, which is so unfinished and early productized.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I read a little bit about it.  I think it's really interesting that the whole enterprise spin on Wave.  Yeah, I mean, for something it's such so early and for something that just hasn't had the same kind of penetration.  I do think that there are interesting enterprise opportunities and I do think that that's interesting that Novell release something.  I mean, I think right now Wave just really needs to get more people on board, get more users on board and prove that it's going to be viable and stick around.  I mean, I wrote a book about it because I think that it will, but I'm not positive.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, I am positive. I think you are right. And I think it's just a matter of time.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But that is really interesting that Novell is so what is the real time communication authoring.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It sounds like it's backup available via the cloud or as an appliance.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it must be a server. It must be a server.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  It's a collaborative document creation product for the, I wonder if it's kind of a red hatting of Wave.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's exactly what it is.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  If you use the service, it's like you have your own.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Coming in mid-2010, Pulse will be first delivered as a service then a later for on-premise deployment.  So I think it's their custom Wave server is what it is.  So this is their custom Wave server.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  So the user will have one personal email and Google Wave inbox with information relating to their tasks and work groups.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense. If you're a business, you're going to want a box.  Google may do one, but why not get it from Novell?  I'm a little worried though about all the Wave, Pulse, Beat, Throb.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Stop there, Will. Stop.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I just.  It's starting to get a little dirty.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I know. But I mean, look at all the verbiage on this Pulse website.  Catch the beat and ride the wave.  Novell Pulse works seamlessly.  It's just a matter of time before somebody does Google Throb.  Google Throb. Yeah, I'm a fan girl.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Quiver.  That's taking it a little too quiver.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I got the new Quiver server.  It's with Throb enabled.  Watch out for that pulsing.  And anyway, I don't know.  It's a little too much like Jell-O for me.  Our number of the week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I confess, I looked and looked and looked.  No numbers.  I found a number. It's a boring number, but I'll give it to you anyway.  We'll look away.  So the latest com score numbers.  Microsoft percent of time spent online by region worldwide is 14.5% versus Google is 9.3%.  And I saw a lot of blog posts about the same.  Oh, well, Microsoft bigger.  But of course, that's because Microsoft tries to hold you into a prison like Yahoo and Google doesn't.  Right.  That's my that's my that's a boring number.  I confess.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I wish we'd found how many hits a day the Google front page has.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That would be I looked and I could not get it.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That would be that would be really it's got to be you know, Google probably just doesn't publish it.  Kill you.  Yeah.  It's like the secret recipe to Coca-Cola.  Just something magical.  My tool of the week is Google's dashboard.  And I guess both of you found it.  It came out this week, though, didn't it?  Or at least I saw the blog post this week.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, it did come out this week.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The idea is that you can see in one spot all of your Google accounts.  And boy, I was kind of stunned at how many Google accounts I had.  That's a bit of a reckoning, isn't it?  Yeah, it's like, whoa, I guess I guess I'm glad I'm doing a Google show.  So here's my Google dashboard page.  If you go to Google.com slash dashboard, you can sign into yours.  It lets you manage these accounts, edit your personal information, tells you in the case of Google, for instance, what my authorized email addresses are and what websites are authorized to access the account.  I also have Blogger, Calendar, Contacts, Docs, Friend Connect, Gmail, Sync, Health, iGoogle, Latitude, Orkut.  I didn't even know I had an Orkut account.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And then I have a Picasso web album.  And friends in Brazil you never know.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  Profile, Reader, Talk, Tasks, Voice.  Your web history is in here.  YouTube.  And then there are 20 additional products not yet available in the dashboard, including Analytics Checkout, Video AdSense, App Engine, Sync Groups, Kanaal, Local Business Center, Google Maps, Mobile News, Kanaal.  You know I had to make a Kanaal account.  Is that how you say it?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  It's Naaal.  It's Naaal.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I like it because it's Naaal.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  But it's Kanaal.  I just scrolled down my dashboard as you were reading off yours, Leo.  And we do have quite a bit of parallels.  Although you do have a couple of products that I don't have.  And I think I may have a couple that you don't have.  But mine at the bottom, it says 15 additional products are not yet available in the dashboard.  So it's interesting.  Now this is a Google Code account.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I probably don't have one of those.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  I do have a code account.  This is all the data that's stored in one Google account, right?  Like this is in every Google account that you own.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, this is just one.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Like in one account, all the products, right?  All the data that you have different products.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because I have a ton of Google accounts.  And this is just the main one.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What I really wish this had, and others have blogged and tweeted this, is what Google uses to target me.  And the opportunity to correct it and change it and get a sense of what Google knows about me and what my relationship is with that.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Can't you assume that they use it all?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, yes, but it's the Amazon problem.  You know, just because you bought Christmas records once, Leo, you don't want to buy them all the time.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So you'd be nice to see a little graph with how they weigh.  Like how much weight do they give my code account?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, and how much you could, if you corrected that, how much more valuable would their data be?  Right.  And it targets for you better, but it also says that they're more active.  Yeah, they should let me do that.  You're right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  In a way, that's what profile kind of starts.  That's the journey that profile starts.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They've got to get gutsy about it, I think, and put up things that will surprise us.  And it will then bring us in to do that and create a Google account and do all those other things to say, you know, I want to have control of this.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  So we can clarify.  Yeah.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I heard, I don't know who it was at this Foursquare conference, was talking about an ad opportunity where you're going to be shown a commercial for a cola.  Which cola would you like to see the commercial for?  Right.  It was Hulu.  And that's smart.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Dig does that.  I think it's the smartest thing I've ever seen where they do thumbs up, thumbs down on ads.  Yeah.  And at first I thought, what, are they crazy advertisers?  You're going to hate them.  And then maybe it was you who explained it to me.  Oh, no.  Advertisers love it.  They only want to show the ads to people that want to see them.  It's hard to be.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right.  AnnArbor.com, which killed its paper and then came up with an online site, which I consulted for, full disclosure, has the users vote on the ads.  They have one day a week, Sunday, paper still coming out.  And the ad that the users vote best appears on the top of page one of the Sunday paper.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's so smart.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That is cool.  I like that.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You get rewarded with more, which is kind of Google think.  Right.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So guess who knows how many hits per day the Google page gets?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  VORAC?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Wolfram Alpha.  Oh.  And I thank our chat room for discovering this.  Of course, they asked the question.  Would you like to guess?  This is going to be our number 5.7 billion daily page views.  Now that says for all of...  Google from page alone?  No, that's for all of Google's.  Let's see. Web information.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  What's the date on that?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They just did this search.  Oh, domain online since 1997.  Site rank number one.  Daily visitors 570 million.  That's from Alexa.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That's from Alexa.  Oh, OK.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's going to be somewhat suspect because you have to have the Alexa.  At least you got an answer.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I gave you nothing.  I failed you.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We got a number and it came from Wolfram.  Where else?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Wolfram.  Yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  By the way, one more thing on the Google dashboard at the very bottom of the Google dashboard  page, it says something kind of interesting.  Is this everything?  So it does give you the chance at least a little bit to elaborate.  I don't know what that would...  Let me see.  Is this everything?  What do I get?  It's just a help page that says, not yet.  There are other kinds of data that Google records when you use its services, which are  not associated server logs, cookies, internet based advertising.  There is a Google Ads preference manager.  I wonder what that is.  Let's you opt out of interest based ads altogether.  So you can actually do this.  Jeff, look.  You can?  Oh, good.  I've specified, make the ads you see on the web more interesting.  I did this ages ago, I guess, because I don't remember doing it.  Oh, good.  I show my interests.  I'm opt out.  I have my cookie and it gives it to me right here.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's beautiful.  It's better than nothing.  That's so smart.  That's so smart.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  This is a new one on me.  Interesting.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I always want something more.  I wish there were an API to that to make it easy for people to do.  And I think there's huge value there.  This is hidden now, so I couldn't find it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, I did this ages ago.  I don't even remember doing it.  What's it under again?

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  How did you find it?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  If you go to google.com slash dashboard, go to the bottom where it says, is this everything?  Click that link.  And then it says interest based advertising.  And there's a link there to the Google ad preference manager.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I guess they were talking about doing that.  I know they've done it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Okay, great.  I guess it's google.com slash ads slash preferences.  Let me see if that works.  Yeah, that does.  Google.com slash ads slash preferences.  And you know what?  They probably did it three years ago because I mean, I have information in here that I  only do remember doing.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We need to do a show on Google products you've forgotten about.  All of them.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  All of them.  They do the worst job of exposing their stuff, but it's perhaps because they have so much  of it.  Yeah, interesting.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  I mean, here we are.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Supposedly Google experts.  You wrote a freaking book on it there, Mr. Charles.  You wrote a freaking book.  And you did too, Gina.  Gina's book is available online right now.  CompleteWaveGuide.com.  Right?  Yes.  I didn't turn it around this time.  Complete Wave.  And the server's up today.  It's all, it's crazy.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  We're getting nuts.  Really?  So everybody can go there right now?  Everybody can go there right now.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  My sister is going to love this.  I moved servers this week.  Oh, did you?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Oh, good.  Yeah, I did.  And he was like, bring it on.  So this would be the test.  Everybody go there right now.  Bring it on.  CompleteWaveGuide.com.  That's Gina's new book.  You can participate by clicking on the link below.  And you can also go to the link below.  And you can also go to the link below.  And you can also go to the link below.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Before it becomes a book, but it will be a PDF available for purchase and update regularly  sometime this month.  Yes?

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  Yeah, this month where I actually just handed over the manuscript for the PDF to my copy  editor last night.  So it will be in a couple weeks.  Dang, you work hard.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You are the hardest working person in show business.  You are impressive.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I sat next to a book publisher president, Gina, at this conference and I said that you  were inventing the future of books and told them to go look at it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  Watch out, fella.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  The future of books.  Here comes Gina.

Speaker: Gina Trapani
Transcript:  That would be an awkward conversation.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Speaking of the past of books, I honor you and thank you.  The ghost of books past, that's me.  Jeff Jarvis is the ghost of all things future in journalism.  You can find his great blog, a must read, at BuzzMachine.com.  Anything else you want to plug?  You're going to be at Yale next week.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have a certain book called What Would Google Do?  Oh, that's it.  I haven't done it for two shows so I can at least get one plug in.  You get a plug every show.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's a great book.  A must read book available on Audible as well as in book stores and Amazon.  You must get it.  I'm Leo Laporte.  I thank you for being here and make sure you watch the show at a different time.  We broadcast live every Saturday at 5.15 Eastern, 2.15 Pacific time.
