Have all the geeks left town, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, they're still here.  Well, most of the geeks have left and now we're up to music.  Music and then film.  So now it's the LA producers.  No, film kind of goes throughout the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Yeah, well, I'll tell you some stuff.  I wish I had gotten tickets to it.  I'll tell you that in a second.  First, let's say hi to Jeff Jarvis,  the City University of New York.  It's great to see you.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Welcome back, boss.  Thank you.  I ain't your boss.  I love the onion.  You see that Elon Musk is going to be starting some sort of strange onion comedy.  He's well, I think Elon shouldn't do comedy, but that's, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, he does everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was he funny at South by him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's saying he said, what?  I don't know if he's funny.  And he cited Kanye West as his favorite musician.  Did he rap or sing?  Singy, rappy.  It's hard to say.  Singy.  It wasn't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Singy, rappy.  Hold on.  Let's see.  He had a sold out talk at South by.  You know, they were South by has come back, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  No, no, no.  He's saying my little buttercup from the.  Oh, little buttercup, my little buttercup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's Gilbert and Sullivan, right?  He's created a company, according to this, called FUD.  T-H-U-D exclamation mark, which is going to be.  Boy, that's a master of the universe picture.  I think he wants to be Indiana Jones.  Indiana Jones or Han Solo or something.  I'd love him.  He's wearing a bomber jacket with a fake fur collar.  And the black t-shirt.  And the black t-shirt.  And his hair has been carefully quaffed to look as if it's not carefully quaffed.  And he's got the five o'clock shout out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was early, to be fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He tweeted early this morning that he.  Because we knew he was hired that he apparently attempted to buy the onion at some point.  Which right now is probably for sale.  He had a deal.  Yeah.  So he hired former staffers of the onion, including editor in chief Cole Bolton, executive editor Ben Berkeley.  And he's going to start something called the FUD or FUD, maybe just FUD, no the just FUD.  FUD.  He says, this is Elon.  It's pretty obvious comedy is the next frontier after electric vehicles, space exploration and brain computer interfaces.  I don't know why anyone's not seeing this.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's funny.  He's got some humor.  I mean he did the boring company.  That was pretty funny.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's been planning this for a while.  The registration for FUD.com was December 6th, 2017 through GoDaddy.  Oh, Elon.  Oh, Elon.  He's, you know, he's not Jeff Bezos rich, but he's one fifth Jeff Bezos rich, which is plenty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't he have a lot of loans?  Twenty billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, he may own money.  He's not terribly liquid, I don't think.  Yeah, but you know, that's not him probably.  That's probably his companies, right?  No, he put a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He put all of his PayPal money into his companies.  I know.  And I feel like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Variety says he's worth 20 billion.  I'm sorry, Forbes says he's worth 20 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, we all trust and love Forbes and their estimates of people's wealth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they are the ones who do the Fortune 500 or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, they do the Forbes richest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do the Forbes richest.  Fortune does a Fortune 500.  Yes.  You know, there's a clue in there.  I'll let you find a clue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which one did Donald Trump want to be spanked with?  It helps you keep it straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not a visual I ever want.  Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so he made a lot of money from PayPal.  Not anything like his current net worth, but you know,  PayPal was only sold to eBay for 1.4 billion, but he's he's parlayed it.  SpaceX is worth more than 20 billion.  Tesla, I don't know how much Tesla is worth.  That depends on your outlook for Tesla.  Do you still love your Tesla?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do, although it has started rebooting.  Yeah.  The screen reboots sometimes when I'm driving.  Yeah, I don't know if they wear that well.  When you're driving?  It's all right. You can still drive.  You can still drive, but I will tell you, in Texas, the air conditioning also goes.  So your music, your nav and your AC go and you're like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's basically pretty much you can steer.  Can you open the window?  Yeah, you can open the window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess in the Model 3 could are there still window things or is everything?  Everything's in that dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they've I read a story from somebody who's had a bad screen and it really it was really a problem until Tesla replaced it.  There's no controls.  It's all on that screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Leo, by the question, do I sense that your bloom is off the rose?  The bloom is off the rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good way to put it.  It's almost two years in to be two years in in July and it's getting a little janky, getting a little funky and funky or janky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those are important distinctions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My 12 volt battery died a year and almost two years old and a 12 volt battery died.  And then and then I called to replace it a week ago and they were supposed to call me back and they didn't call me back.  They didn't call me back.  So finally, I mean, I called several times, like three times left messages because they do what nice things they do a mobile repair.  But they didn't you know, it was like, come on, guys.  And you can't bring a Tesla down to your local, you know, Jiffy Lube.  You have to get them to fix it.  And so finally, I called them again.  She said, oh, I was just about to call you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, they called me like a dozen times over a not like with a 12 volt battery issue, Leo.  And I didn't have an issue.  So I was like, please, I'm good.  My my battery is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, apparently the 12 volt accessory batteries die rapidly on Teslas, which is ironic since they have a 90 kilowatt hour or whatever his battery pack in there.  But for some reason, they use a separate accessory battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the resales good. Right.  I mean, you buy or you lease?  I lease it. I don't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm going to stay electric. I really like electric.  I love the way my car drives.  What would you get? Would you get a little BMW?  There's going to be lots of choices.  You know, July 2019, when my lease runs out, there'll be lots of good choices.  I think, you know, the new well, the Jaguar pace.  What is it? The I pace just came out.  Is that all electric? All electric.  Well, you can also get the go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  VW bus. No, that's not out yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when that comes out, I'm definitely getting that.  It's the love bus.  But VW just 20 billion dollars worth of batteries or something.  Right. Geez. What's the range for the Jaguar?  Same as the it's a 90 90.  What is that kilowatt hour? It's 240 miles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So does the bus get you more range because it just has so much room for battery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe.  Look into it. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a Jaguar. That's nice looking. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  SUV. I'm not crazy about an SUV.  I'd rather have an XK or an XJ.  But still, I think I'm going to buy my next car from a company that makes cars.  That's a thought.  Oh, really? Crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Crazy. I still love my Tesla.  I would have done the Model 3, but we decided it was just I didn't want to spend.  I think it was going to be the first one was like 50, 50 K for basically what I wanted.  I was like, I got my invitation to build my Model 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You haven't or you did. I got the invitation and I declined it till next year.  I said, I'm waiting for the dual motor four wheel drive version.  But I also just deferring.  But I was surprised because I ordered it much after the long, you know, the rush.  Why do you need four wheel drive? You don't know.  I just like it's more sure footed. Oh, I see.  It is. It's like driving a mountain goat.  Nothing's like driving a mountain goat, Stacey.  Have you ever driven a mountain goat? I have not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that's what I envisioned when I see them like up there in the nature shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or those Grand Canyon mules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't I haven't ever ridden on one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, VW is very aggressively going into the electric VWs, by the way, Audi as well as Volkswagen.  Twenty five billion dollars in batteries.  VW is planning to build three million electric cars by the year 2025.  This is the bus you're talking about, but that's a concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, there's a date coming up, though.  They put it there's a I think there's a date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love a Volkswagen. I used to have a Volkswagen.  We used to I grew up with a Volkswagen Bug and the ID Buzz and the self driving ID Vision.  Do in 2020.  So anyway, I figure by a year and a half from now, there'll be lots more choices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or we're at nuclear war with Korea, one of the or there'll be no choice at all.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Let's move on to topics of the hour.  We now know Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, Google's World Developers Conference,  Facebook's Developers Conference and Microsoft's Developers Conference.  And they're all roughly in the same two months.  Yeah, I'm going to have to come out to California twice in two weeks.  That's crazy. You come in that fate and I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think my I think Microsoft, though, gets I'm sorry.  Apple gets the award for the best website.  Let me open up the WWDC website because it's it's it's really quite pretty.  Apple dot com.  Slash developer developers, developers, developers.  Let me let me reload it and you'll see the sweet and hey.  Now the animation is not working on on this.  Oh, I have to click that maybe.  That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, are you in Safari?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it doesn't actually work in Chrome for me.  But I but I yeah, if I click this, I think it will.  Now we're going to look at this.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  I want to do the Game of Thrones theme.  Um, W W W C.  Anyway, Google has a so Jeff was mad at me because I discovered three words two years after he picked it on Google on this week in Google.  The three words that you forgot all of these links.  I forgot all of it.  Yeah.  Well, that's one of the good things about getting to be a certain age.  I don't remember much about going through 3000 links a week.  And so I was all excited about this idea that you could you could describe any 10 10 meter by 10 meter square on the world's on the Earth's plan with three words.  And but Google has got its own thing.  So the reason is a lot of the world is not does not have street addresses.  India.  But did you did you do it for the twit brick house?  I did.  And I ordered a a sign.  I haven't gotten it yet.  I think it's what is it?  Nasal.  It's I know nasals in there.  It's the three words.  So one of the things the what three words guys did and said and they said this on they did this on purpose is that there's no similarity between squares in their adjacencies to avoid accidentally entering.  Something close but not the same.  So if you made a mistake in the three words, it would be very obvious like, oh, I didn't really want to go to the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  I'm just trying to go downtown.  But Google's done the opposite.  So they've come up with a new global code system.  They call them plus codes.  It is an open source.  One second, Leo, because you lost me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You never actually told us what Jeff thought.  So I'm listening to you describe three words.  I just said I did this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I revealed the three words on this show a good two years before Leo thought he'd discovered them.  Yeah, so I got pissy.  Do you get you don't remember that?  Oh, maybe you weren't here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, so what I wasn't here.  I have no idea.  I'm like, what are you guys talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let me go to tweet LLC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is what three words dot com.  We had them on one of our shows.  And then so the three words for a tweet are glow walnut nasal.  So you what you do is if you have a Mercedes, the new Mercedes will support this in its nav system.  So really, say navigate to glow walnut nasal and it'll take you right there.  And it's but you see, you could actually have different three words for the back of the building and the front of the buildings.  It would actually be for the front door glow walnut nasal because it's 10 meters square.  So every place in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So India or places that don't have street addresses or Africa have where you have a lot of places that don't have street signs up.  You can navigate somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. So let me.  So here's Anton's nightclub in Austin, Texas.  It's three words are smashes transmitted evoked.  So and that would take you right there.  Now, it's not just by the way, developing nations in Venice, it's very hard to deliver mail because they don't have street addresses.  And you're in the you know, that's actually a very highly skilled job that the post post office person.  Well, then how do you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you do the sequence, though, that says that the smash olives piano is next door is the next place I'm going to deliver the email is to.  Walnuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's the that's the Mexican Mexican Art Museum in downtown Austin, actually.  So, yeah, that's an interesting question.  You have the way what three words works is it doesn't you could enter in their map or you could send it from their map the GPS coordinates to a regular map and use that.  So, yeah, you're right with the postal service, that might be complicated.  What Google's proposing is more like kind of like zip codes.  You have a four character and I say character because it's numbers or letters area code.  And then you have a seven character local code.  So it's a lot like your phone number, except it's not just numbers.  It's got it's got it's harder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like it's like British postal codes.  It's harder to remember when it's a mix of numbers, letters, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also.  Has, I think, a mistake, which the folks at what three words were.  Didn't you know when we did what three words, they were quick to point out.  Oh, listen to my Samsung phone.  That's this.  I'll be showing the S nine of it.  That's what Samsung thinks a ring tone should sound like.  It's like a symphony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like you're in an elevator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like the doors of the elevator opened.  I'm not going to want to be racist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a bad way to start a sentence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should.  I'm like, you know what?  If you don't, just don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then don't.  It's more cultural than racism.  But but South Korea, the aesthetics of phones created in South Korea, Samsung particularly, it's clearly culturally very different from.  Well, it's just different.  I mean, I mean, I celebrate the difference.  I'm going to be in Korea next month.  I can't wait.  But that there is a but that culture.  So sometimes companies take pains to kind of gloss over, you know, make it more Americanized.  They Samsung.  I don't know if they do a good job of that.  So that's like the ring tone is like I don't I don't think that really is a good ring tone, but maybe it plays well in Korea.  I don't know.  I might as well show you.  Did I show you the creepy A.R. emojis?  This is my I'll show you my A.R.  Actually, you know what?  I can do it on Google Photos by now.  It's probably.  Oh, no, maybe doesn't because I haven't uploaded it.  I'll do it in the gallery.  There's my lovely wife and there's some pictures of me and Jason and Megan with our it's not a Snapchat filter.  It's an A.R. emoji and here's what it thinks I look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you look like Anderson Cooper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We all look alike.  All us white guys.  So that's the A.R.  emoji.  And as Brian X Chen said in the New York Times, he did a review featuring his A.R.  emojis.  Not really very good.  But OK, it's just not Apple.  Apple quality.  I'll do more on this phone in a bit, but that's I thought you'd want.  So you were saying that Google made a mistake in its.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so discursive today.  That's why we're here.  They.  They.  So first of all, the first four codes, first four characters in the area code, 100 by 100 kilometers and in the last six characters.  Six.  I thought it was seven.  Oh, maybe the plus doesn't count.  Plus is just a character or the plus is just a character.  They say the last six characters of the local code.  No, I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm wrong.  I've got a plus in mind, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the plus is there just as a separator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have I have seven plus the plus.  My address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe because your local area is so many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the last six characters of the local code and that gets down to 14 by 14 meters.  The area code is not needed with navigating within a tent, obviously, but there is another optional character that could be appended to provide more accuracy down to three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's why.  So I increased the size of the map and then clicked on the spot.  So it gave me the extra character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what you got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So where do I want the drone to land?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's probably what this is for, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I get that not every place has addresses, but why go with something complicated as opposed to something easy for people to remember?  I guess it's for computers because we just assume computers take us everywhere.  Well, that's why I liked what three words.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank you, Jeff, for that tip, because it's human.  It's OK. It's OK, though.  So you can remember glow walnut nasal a lot better than I can.  HGC 2CMXR plus X six.  That's now I remember talking to Tim Berners-Lee, the guy who created the World Wide Web, and he said, I never intended anybody to see HTTP colon slash slash.  That was always that was those URIs were always intended for machines.  What he underestimated was how that would become, you know, saying WWW dot twit dot TV would become a way.  That's what led to the QCAT.  You remember the QCAT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the QCAT.  So no one's ever going to deal with these complicated URIs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's my guess that Google says the same thing about these codes that oh, these are these are.  And boy, you nailed it, Jeff.  That's clearly what this is for is drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, because I can actually if I pull like my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can get the front of my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can get the middle of my house and the back of my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, have you have you done it for your address there, Leo?  No, I do that.  Where do I do that?  In that story, it had a link to how to do it.  OK, I just got a plus code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HTTPS slash slash slash slash slash.  You forgot the colon, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It won't work without the colon.  Right.  Tim Berners-Lee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.  Open.  It's based on open location code, a standalone open source library.  Here's the world's largest carrot.  Plus dot codes, plus dot codes.  OK, here we go.  What makes it unique, free, accessible?  So let me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Endure a city or plus code.  See, now, what was nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if I could put twit LLC because what was nice is I put twit LLC in the what?  Three words in a new where we were.  Yeah, it does.  OK, there you go.  So our code in Petaluma is seven, eight GM plus M six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, if you if you go up, expand the size of the map, you know, plus it.  Yeah, I'll get it.  Other way.  I'll go in.  Zoom in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are when you.  So this is got this has the front door in it.  This is where the front door is.  Right.  So I can do a smaller box.  Oh, look, there you go.  That's that's the front door right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's the landing spot for the drone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You could just pinpoint it.  Right.  Go to our roof.  Oh, yeah.  See the last letters changing.  Change that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they are square.  So buildings that aren't square.  It's kind of like like I'm looking over one of my old apartment complexes just to see, like, would that even get to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they said they can do as high resolution.  Change the world.  Three meters by three meters, which is 10 feet by 10 feet.  I would guess you're not going to land a drone anywhere where you don't have 10 by 10 at least free.  Right.  Clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, that's that's a big I was actually talking to an architect at a party about like they're going to design landing.  Landing landing.  Yeah.  How do you think about where drones land?  I've got a great plot place because I've got a flat roof.  But, you know, everybody else is screwed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to just like, you know, they design ships with a big H and a circle on it.  If you're going to land helicopters, you're going to have to drive drone and probably they'll have to have some sort of optical signal and maybe even some lighting signals.  The reason it's interesting is because New Zealand just approved a test of drone delivery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just approved one, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've got somewhere in the US.  We had dominoes doing pizza delivery, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is who is this that's doing the drone delivery?  Is it Amazon in New Zealand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the other thing New Zealand just approved or I think approved is Larry's Air Taxi Company.  That's the one I was thinking of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry.  Larry's Air Taxi Company.  The drone.  Cora is an electric sky Uber drone from Sebastian Thrun.  Larry Page funded it.  Thrun, of course, was the former head of the ex Google X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And creator of the self-driving car, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it's Cora, which is a vertical takeoff and landing personal airplane helicopter drone that will carry a passenger.  That's not much use.  This I want.  But what's interesting is look at if you look at it really is stealth because look at the front.  It looks like there's a dashboard and windows.  So and but they're tinted.  So you can't tell if there's a driver and they people have seen these are never sure if they can't see a driver.  That's because there is no driver.  Otherwise known as a pilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the Wall Street Journal.  There's no liveryman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do they do without pages?  Footman.  I need a footman to open the door.  Sorry.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's OK.  I'm answering the question about drone delivery in the U.S.  So according to the Wall Street Journal at a FAA UAS symposium last week, Jay Merkle, a senior FAA air traffic control official, said that some proponents of drones such as Amazon, quote, think they might be ready to operate this summer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, I see.  We put pood this.  Remember how we laughed when the 60 minutes piece with was it with Larry Page?  No, it was Jeff Bezos and Charlie.  Charlie, he's in disgrace now.  Rose Rose was so getting all loud about it.  Yeah, it was so incredibly wowed because because Bezos did this reveal.  And look, here's where we test the drones for delivery.  And we were laughing.  We said Charlie Rose got played.  They're never going to do that.  Wrong.  I guess if you have fully autonomous drones that really know how to avoid everything, power lines, other drones, you could have thousands in the air.  Birds.  Birds, everything you could have.  But it's still it's still better than the street, right?  I mean, there's a lot more stuff on the ground.  You could.  Well, the idea is that.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That you could reduce a lot of transport or some transportation traffic, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and after all, Amazon's biggest expense at this point is delivery, right?  Has to be shipping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if it's the biggest, but it was a huge.  I think last year it was like a seven billion dollar loss for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's one thing that can stand in the way of profit.  Amazon doesn't care about profit.  Well, at some point they're going to.  And if they do, drones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like they do care.  They have a very macro.  They have a long term.  They don't care about excessive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have a long term focus and Bravo.  And that's one of the reasons they were seriously looking at drone delivery.  It's almost almost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you remember the UPS video from last year ago where the brown truck arrives  and out of it come a bunch of drones to nearby addresses.  Oh, wow.  I'll put that up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an interesting idea.  So it's the last mile.  Yeah, it solves the last mile problem.  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So you don't have drones going all over the hell and high up.  Come on, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although you could, it just would black out the sun for a period of time.  There you go.  I'm thinking a lot of deliveries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like I'm like the I'm like during Christmas season, what happens?  We don't see the sun anymore.  It got dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's just Christmas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be loud.  I mean, that's one thing.  I mean, when you hear the drones are like drones are loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they are loud.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like, I don't know.  I'm not I'm not excited by drones to the extent other people are.  I just they're they're loud.  They're irritating.  They I don't know.  I like looking at the sky.  That may be part of my problem.  I'm from Texas.  I love my horizons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know why you don't know.  This is why I don't like drones.  This is thank you, chat room, for this link to the Tinkersons.  Let's see if we can fly the drone.  The father says to the son, the drone goes up in the air and then zip.  Let's see if we can find the drone.  That's pretty much my drone story in a nutshell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you're into this, people out there in the world, there's a conference that I then the early days I help organize.  I haven't been able to be there for the last two years, but really nice guy named John Kellen runs called Postal Vision 2020.  You're kidding.  And it's about the future of delivery and the postal service.  Oh, and fascinating.  I got we got Tim Burgers Lee to to I'm sorry.  We got been surf to keynote early on fun.  And and they've had drone companies there and new package companies there and all kinds of things.  You know, logistics are actually pretty fascinating because it's about atoms.  What do you do about atoms?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm going to have to ask you about this, Stacey, because you have the wired home.  By the way, I asked Stacey's husband Andrew how he felt about all that.  I met Andrew.  It's great. You know, Austin was pretty he was surprisingly sanguine about the whole thing.  The only thing he seemed like was an issue was something about the blinds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ah, this is a three year effort.  I have these crazy proprietary blinds.  I bought this thing to convert it to Z wave.  It is a monstrosity.  It has a click wheel.  So when I program it, I have to get my little screwdriver and with the click wheel.  It's a nightmare.  Mom, why is the house always dark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shush.  It'll be fixed in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have perfectly acceptable remote controllers, but he wants it to be.  He wants to talk to it.  And it's all his fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you saying it's Andrew's fault?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not blaming him.  He just every year he's like, it's my birthday, Stacey.  Maybe we can make the blinds work again because they did for a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my wife says, but getting expense accounts done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, every every couple has one of those, you know, just this running joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the how you load the dishwasher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is. We're totally in agreement on that.  Four times up or down.  It doesn't matter.  I think that's why we're in agreement.  That's why you're in agreement.  You don't have a strong opinion, but we do have a strong opinion about the toilet paper roll.  You roll over.  But our daughter, our daughter does it under.  Savage.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Where did she get that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she's just so young.  She doesn't understand physics yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I've explained it to her.  She still she chooses to do it that way.  I should I nip her personality in the bud?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is called rebellion and it's just the beginning, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like I'll accept that as my my rebellion.  That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, that's not bad.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to give you a video that you'll like as a result.  OK, we go.  The next one up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, I'm going to ask Stacey in a little bit.  As soon as I see that routines.  Here it is.  I got it.  That's the one you sent, right?  No, I sent one earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's this one's not showing up.  Oh, I'll put it on the rundown under other.  Sorry.  It ruins a punch line.  OK, it's in the blank.  We just added it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  We just added it to the punch line.  This is how a thud is going to work.  Is that the worst name for a humor site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You always say a joke landed with a thud when it's not successful.  Yeah, sure.  The exclamation point, though, really makes you.  Thud.  Thud.  Like Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm thinking it's probably an acronym.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  OK.  Oh, there it is.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did it help that I typed hello?  Did that like?  Yes, I somehow it did free.  Yeah, it unlocked it somehow.  I thought it might.  Everyone say hi to Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin, get Kevin on.  Kevin on.  He just sent me his plus code.  Oh, nice.  Oh, here is a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this Kramer?  No.  Wait a minute.  It's like the fake Seinfeld.  This is mad about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, guys never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is you know why everybody's laughing?  Because they recognize it.  It's true.  It is true.  It's true.  They got because there's reasons for that.  Not good ones.  Not good ones.  Not good ones.  All right.  Google Assistant.  Multi-step smart home routines are now live.  I knew when I saw this headline, there was only one person who could explain it all to  me.  Stacey.  Yeah, it's not me.  So I am so sad because I don't have this.  Oh, so that was so I don't have it yet, but I do have opinions on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're rolling it out.  They are still rolling it out.  I was really disappointed with this.  I was really disappointed with this.  I was really disappointed with this.  So there's there's reasons.  OK, so it's good in the sense that it shows you how it helps a novice person who has some  of these devices think about their morning routine and like what they might want to include  because it's a checklist that you check off.  The downside to this is you can't do anything custom.  So if you're like the hardcore smart home user, you're going to look at this and be  like, I want to do more.  And then you're probably going to turn to Google shortcuts and then you're going to be  extra frustrated because Google shortcuts is awful.  Oh, I have Google shortcuts to me is one of the most frustrating user experiences I've  ever encountered because.  It feels like it should be easy.  You tell it good morning and then you're like, and this is what I want you to do.  But because Google has some weird naming, Google Home has weird naming conventions and  because it doesn't tell you when you do something wrong.  I have a lot of shortcuts I've tried.  They don't work and I don't know why.  So I have to like basically remove one item at a time and try to reverse engineer my way back  to like a working state and then add again to see what the heck I did wrong.  I hate it.  So I'm not too.  I mean, if you're into routines, you know, if it works for you and these these options are  great, like I like the bedtime one where it's like put my phone on silent if you have an  Android device.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would totally use like last if this than that or, you know, something like that for  those.  Isn't that easier?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do that.  But maybe if it is too much for people, if you don't want to use ift, if you're like,  Oh, Google's let me do these things, then maybe this is nice.  I also don't use my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, good.  At this point, you'd say X echo is probably a better choice for voice home automation or  no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I started using my Google home more and I find myself defaulting to the echo for all  but inquiries.  So, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does the echo have multi?  What is this multi-step?  They do.  They have multi multi.  Yes, they don't have routines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What do they call it?  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, sorry.  I do like that.  So I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm not too.  I'm confused because my world is.  Contextual follow up.  Contextual follow up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's separate from don't you don't have to say the trigger word twice in a row.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  OK.  But so going back to the beginning, because I'm on cold medicine and I have to stay focused,  there is echo has routines too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At least you have an excuse.  I have no excuse for how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So echo does call their routines routines.  And it's the same sort of thing.  You tell it to what you can say and then it offers you a lot of options.  I don't know if you can see my phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it offers you options, but then it also lets you add your own.  So it's more flexible.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then Google has made important to this whole mileage, which I put on the rundown,  which is you can now do location based reminders on assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love that feature.  I've used that feature for a long time in Apple on iPhones.  And I think keep does that as well.  You could say to keep remind me.  Here's my grocery list.  Remind me.  Pop up that list when I get to the grocery store.  I had no idea.  Oh, that's a nice feature.  Oh, wow.  I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to have an if recipe that when my husband got near the grocery store, it would text  him.  Oh, it's a really nice feature.  Ask me if I need stuff at the grocery store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really funny.  But that's good.  Wait a minute.  I might have to I might have to implement that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, so the downside is he always got a text even when he was just driving by the  grocery store, which is the intended function.  But he was like, it's not so bad.  This is irritating.  The grocery store is right by our house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's ultimately, unfortunately, the ultimately the most common response of a person  married to a geek.  This is annoying.  Yes. Stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like Seinfeld and Newman.  Newman.  Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Keep has done this for a while and I started doing it with Apple's reminders.  So if you have a list or something, you can associate it like the pet.  I have the Petaluma market list.  You can associate it with the Petaluma market.  And then I actually have to give my app permissions now to get location information, which I guess  I had turned off.  So I'll do that right now.  And now that it's got permission as information, I can add a location to this.  Let's see.  This is my this is our shopping list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know, it'd be good though.  Tie this to the more granular level of the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I already did that because it's got the Petaluma market thing.  So yeah.  Oh yeah.  Maybe that's why Google's value of the plus codes, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because then when my husband drives by, he's not in the parking lot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's the pin icon that will say, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would make it less annoying.  I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Here it is.  Edit reminder place or time.  So normally reminders time, you know, at four o'clock remind me to mow the lawn.  This is place Petaluma market.  So whenever I get to that place, not yet, or maybe you could, you know what?  That would be an easy enough thing for them to do.  Right.  Because right now, yeah, I bet you you can't because it means inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like you, Stacey, this works when you're driving by, you're in the vicinity, you're  on the roof, whatever, and you don't necessarily want that.  So that's good.  If you had a plus code for the front door of the market and that's when it popped up,  that's exactly that would eliminate some of these false alarms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because one of my things that I'm constantly looking for in my smart home implementations  is actually walking through the door based reminders.  So when I leave my front door, I want a reminder like jacket, like karate or whatever.  Whatever needs to, like what you need to bring for your day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's something new though.  They're going to have location.  How is that going to work with a static device location reminders?  It just let you add it to the reminder somehow.  Is this an echo or I forgot, is this in Google Home or Echo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's Google Assistant.  Aren't we talking about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Assistant would make sense because that would be in your phone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're all losing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just yeah, I just have too many things on my stack.  I blew my stack.  Okay, so Google Routines support page is live.  And actually they care about this a lot because I sat on it for a minute or two and I got  a pop up saying, would you like some help from a service representative?  Yeah.  So I'm surprised it's not available to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I'm like.  I'm like Google, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So right now they have good morning, bedtime, leaving home.  Oh, you could do this to the Assistant.  So you could say, hey Google, I'm home.  So that's kind of location based as well.  I just got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yay.  How do you know you have it?  Where do you go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry.  Oh, you go into hold on settings for your in their Google Home or Google Assistant app.  And if you scroll down to services, you'll see music, home control, news, routines.  Nice.  Oh, look.  Okay.  My assistant, I'm totally I'm doing the good morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This doesn't require a Google Home.  This is or is it?  Does it?  It does.  It's not.  Oh, it's I see.  It's your Google Assistant, but it's on the Google Home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Because I'm going to talk to the well, I guess I could talk to my Google Home on any device  because it's telling me what devices this is available on.  Right.  Cancel.  Okay.  So I'm going to take my phone off silent.  I'm going to adjust some lights.  I'm going to adjust my thermostat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This would be whenever you say I'm home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to.  It's when I say good morning, tell me about my day or I'm up.  Those are.  Oh, can I add?  So this is nice.  I can add a command.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's much more functional than the Amazon then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no.  Amazon's the same sort of functionality.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, this is a problem because here we are presumably experts, certainly seasoned users  of these devices.  This is like we haven't set this up.  I haven't set it up on the Echo and it sounds great when you described it.  I love all that, but I don't.  I just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Google makes it.  That's what Google's trying to do.  So like here I am.  It's showing.  I don't know.  Hold on.  Let me dim my screen for y'all.  So here it's showing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a whole long list and you could check those boxes to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm checking these boxes now when it says tell me about today's calendar.  I'm still hosed because I can't get my G Suite calendar information, but I can on the  Echo.  So that's why I prefer to ask her about like what's on my schedule today, which is just  aggravating.  And then so it has me adjust the media volume, it says, and then play music, news, radio,  podcast, audiobook or nothing.  Nice.  Let's see what.  Oh, so yeah.  And this is the audio books is only Google playbooks, which one would expect, I suppose.  So this card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go.  Let's take a break.  More to come.  Leo and Jeff are confused show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm trying to figure out our show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is my Friday.  That's the only excuse I have to offer.  This is my Friday.  I'm on the I'm already on my weekend.  Our show today brought to you by my mattress.  I did.  I have to say I can't blame it on a bad night's sleep.  Those Casper mattresses, man, you sleep so good.  Oh, I love my Casper mattress.  Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.  You know how they do that?  They eliminated the number one reason mattresses cost so much dealing with resellers and showrooms  By eliminating those costs and passing the savings on to you, you're going to save a  huge amount.  Now what they don't have is a place you can go lie in a Casper.  Well, they do actually in some places like New York City, but in most places the idea  is that you know, lying on a mattress in a showroom isn't going to do you any good anyway,  because that's not a real test.  You need to get your Casper in your house, lie on it for a night or two or three or 100.  And if at any time in the first 100 nights you don't love your mattress, you just call  them, they'll come and get it refunded every penny.  So there's no risk, no risk at all.  The original Casper mattress combines the multiple supportive memory foams.  They kind of pioneered this for a sleep surface with just the right sink yet just the right  bounce.  Plus, it's breathable design lets you sleep cool.  That's so important.  Even in the winter, even when it's snowing outside, you've got the heater on, you get  overheated and that's not good.  But the Casper mattress helps you regulate your temperature throughout the night so you're  always comfortable.  And it provides long lasting comfort and support and I really like that.  And it's risk free.  I mean, you got to try this.  Casper understands the importance of trying out a mattress.  That's why they give you 100 days.  And it makes you feel a little bit better because you know, there's no risk.  And returns in the US and the Canada and the UK.  And by the way, they come in a very compact box.  You open the box and the mattress comes out.  It's ready to sleep on.  You don't have to air it out or anything.  It's just feels great, smells great right away.  It's good.  I actually both my kids ended up in the dorms with Casper mattresses because well, it was  nice to have a fresh new mattress and the cost was low enough that I didn't mind.  And it was easy.  I shipped it to them in the box.  They could carry the box upstairs.  Henry was on the third floor.  It was easy.  I think he might have gotten a friend to help him and then boom, opens it up and there it  goes.  And it was so affordable after four years.  I said, leave it there.  You don't need to bring it back.  It's okay.  Leave it for the next guy.  Get a Casper mattress today.

Transcript:  This just in.  Breaking news.  This just in.  Nacho fries become Taco Bell's highest selling product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even want to know what that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't know about the nacho fries?  It's got more than 53 million orders in the first five weeks.  If it has to do with queso, it's relevant to this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we really want to call Taco Bell's cheesy sauce queso?  I'm just asking.  I mean, I eat at Taco Bell like any other fool, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So explain to me.  This looks like a french fry.  Is it made out of potato?  It is a french fry.  It is a potato.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's their take on fries.  They have a spicy seasoning and then you dip it in cheese instead of ketchup.  It's cheesy fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you can't get the cheese.  They don't offer the cheese with chips or anything.  They just offer it with the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you get ketchup if you want ketchup?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  You go to McDonald's for ketchup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fifty three million orders in five weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.  It's kind of mind boggling, isn't it?  That's why I actually buy my Mexican food from actual Mexican food shops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you have any queso in Austin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did.  Now, tell me if I went to the wrong place.  I went to Uncle Julio's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We didn't know.  You know, I have to say we went to Franklin's, tried to go to Franklin's Barbecue and literally  that's crazy.  I don't know who goes there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Don't go during South By.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't go there ever.  Six in the morning.  It's a six hour wait.  We got there.  Nobody ever gets in.  I mean, you get in, but you wait six hours.  I'm not waiting six hours for lunch.  So then we go around noon figuring, well, people will be gone by then.  No.  The lady said she offered me a beer, which was nice from her bucket.  And she said it'll be about two hours.  And I said, will there be anything left?  She said, there's no guarantee.  Yeah.  So we left.  We went back downtown and we went to a place called Cooper's.  It was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cooper's is not bad barbecue.  Really, it's Texas.  You can't get bad barbecue.  It was very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a moment where Stacey should have the glove in her home.  Leo could have done that.  Yeah, I told you to order it.  Look at the side eye.  You just got Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where should I have gone?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't know.  No, no, no.  Franklin's is OK.  See, this is what's wrong with our foodie culture.  People like go and eat perfectly good barbecue and they're like FOMOing over the best barbecue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they make a fetish.  Yeah.  You got good barbecue.  You know?  And I frankly thought Uncle Julio's was fine.  They made guacamole at the table.  That was awesome.  Many places make guacamole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like, you know, that's like table steak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Easily amused.  They had a tortilla making machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, you have to have the old grandma making the tortillas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wanted the mamacita making them by hand, but that's all right.  She was there, but she was putting the balls of dough in the machine.  It was going to...  That wasn't quite as good.  When I was in Mexico, that was the best tortillas I've ever had.  Which, you know, the grandma was standing there making them by hand.  They were so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You did see the Brooklyn barbecue, didn't you?  What's Brooklyn barbecue?  Well, that was a story two weeks ago.  I just put up on the rundown.  Obviously, I'm falling behind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait, it was last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the...  March 5 is when this happened.  What is it?  I put it in the comments.  You'll see the picture says it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  De Blasio decides if Texas or Brooklyn has the best barbecue?  That one?  No, I put it in the rundown.  Oh, Vice claims Brooklyn barbecue is world famous.  Now it is in the worst way possible.  Why is Brooklyn barbecue...  Well, look at the picture.  This is in Brooklyn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's in Brooklyn.  That's barbecue as defined by Brooklyn.  So it's hipster barbecue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, no.  See that sauce?  Yum.  Fried okra.  I do like fried okra.  But see what I liked about Texas barbecue, and we talked to that guy, John, from ATX,  the Instagram guy, the ATX barbecue guy who...  Texas Monthly named the top 50 Texas barbecues.  He went to all of them in 38 days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he wasn't dead when we saw him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He was still alive, although both he and Stacey used a term I had never heard before that  kind of scared me.  Meat sweat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the meat sweats.  It's what happens after you eat too much meat and your body is struggling to process it  and you get this... the meat sweats.  I can't believe you've never heard this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only in Texas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I've never not only not heard it, I've never had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's actually probably good for you.  And after a certain age, you should probably not go to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The meat sweats are the first sign of a heart attack at my age.  Yeah, so that's probably true.  Either you've got the meat sweats or you're dead.  So what I learned from John, who's great, is that in Texas, it ain't the sauce.  In fact, sauce is kind of deprecated.  It's the dry rub.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And he said, test it via... he said, get the brisket.  The only way to know if it's good barbecue is how the brisket is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, in Texas, we are brisket people.  I didn't know this.  I wish I had known this.  And you don't get lean brisket.  You get the fatty mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what he said.  He said, you want USDA prime, whatever the highest level is brisket with lots of marbling.  I didn't even know brisket could be marbled.  I thought the whole point of barbecue was taking the worst meat cuts possible and cooking  them long enough so they didn't taste bad.  But as it turns out, you can get good brisket.  Oh yeah.  Did you not get brisket?  Sorry, audience.  I didn't know.  No, I didn't know.  I always get the links and I like pork ribs.  So I love this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You missed out on Texas barbecue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  I'm going back.  I have to go back.  I'll see you this weekend.  I blew it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come hang out.  I'll take you places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who knew?  You get brisket.  Apparently, everybody knows except me.  So I love this response.  This is Kansas City compared to Brooklyn.  Kansas City on the top.  The Brooklyn barbecue you can't get into.  And Sanford Johnson tweets, I've seen Southerns from all walks of life come together to condemn  this struggle plate.  Brooklyn barbecue.  It doesn't really look that appealing, does it?  No.  And everybody who knows barbecue knows that you don't put like...  What is this?  A dinner roll?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I was looking at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A slice of white bread, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Slice of Texas toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Brooklyn.  This is Cooper's barbecue in response.  That is...  That's a pork...  What is that?  Pork or brisket?  That's the brisket?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That looks good.  And they had a sauce but it was a very...  Dang it.  Now I got to...  God, I got to go get more barbecue.  It was a thin kind of vinegary sauce.  It wasn't an all thick tomato-y sweet sauce.  It's very good.  That looks good on a surface tablet.  Good enough to eat.  So what's this Brooklyn barbecue?  This is silly.  This is not barbecue.  This looks like a prisoner's last meal or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that wouldn't be your last meal.  That'd be cruel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what you get in solitary.  Looks like that, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was trying to read this Men's Fitness article for you on the meat sweats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Men's Health has the best articles, I swear to God.  They are the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is Men's Fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Because I follow Men's Health on Twitter.  It is the link baitiest crap you've ever seen.  It gets me every time.  And every time I hit myself, I go and I read the article and I go, oh crap, I fell for  Men's Health again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go.  There you go.  Oh, it's called the thermic effect of feeding where your body temperature rises after you  down a ridiculous amount of food.  So there you go.  But oh, even food and wine has one.  Yes, the meat sweats are real.  Here's how to survive them.  Okay.  Now you know more than you want to know about disgusting things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Meanwhile, back in Google land, France is suing Google and Apple over developer contracts.  They're seeking fines of 2 million euros over what it terms abusive contractual terms imposed  by the tech giants on startups and developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're just trying to find anything they can to sue them.  Nobody's suing them over parking tickets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  France's finance minister Bruno LaMari says as powerful as they are, Google and Apple  should not be able to treat our startups and our developers the way they do.  I will therefore be taking Google and Apple to the Paris commercial court for abusive  trade practices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google says, Google says, we believe our terms comply with French laws and are looking forward  to making our case in court.  And there you go.  There's the EU story of the day.  Bezos says he's going to spend his quote Amazon lottery winnings on space travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does this mean he's going or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good question.  He really wants to go, doesn't he?  Here he is, by the way, eating something I don't even want to know.  I guess it's an iguana.  It's an iguana.  Don't eat iguanas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That picture is going to haunt you.  That is horrible.  It is.  Don't eat iguanas, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why?  Where was he?  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somewhere not around here.  He was at someone's horrors club.  The price to admission of space, the price of admission to space is very high, said Jeff.  I am in the process of converting my Amazon lottery winnings into a much lower price of  admission so we can go explore the solar system as they dined on iguana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe it's a delicacy somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I got to say, having been to the Galapagos, there are many, many iguanas.  It's not like there's an iguana shortage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In Costa Rica, there are many iguanas.  Many iguanas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I don't think you should eat them.  They're nice.  They're sweet.  They're kind.  Are they sweet?  No.  So are cows.  True.  You know, isn't that funny?  It's very cultural, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pigs are smart.  I stopped eating pork, which is really hard.  Because pigs are nice?  Because pigs are really smart.  And I started thinking about eating something that was that smart.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You shouldn't eat anything smart.  Maybe you should eat more iguana.  They're not smart.  They're lizards.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really don't.  I don't want to eat a lizard.  That just doesn't even look appealing.  I mean, I had snake, I guess, but that was just for fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be fine if they hadn't left like all of the parts on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pull off a little bit.  Let's go back to space travel because this is an important moment I think we've got to  note here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bezos is definitely, okay.  Bezos later declined to clarify how much of his fortune he'd spent on space travel.  But Paulson at the next table said Bezos could spend it all if he leaves enough to take care  of his mother.  Bezos is definitely not leaving mom behind.  She said she's going into space.  She's already been on an ocean voyage to recover F1 rocket engines.  And keep reading.  This is the funny part.  A trip where the crew made accommodations for her as Bezos recounted from the stage.  When we first boarded the ship, the Norwegian captain, a very nice guy, he went to me and  said, Mr. Bezos, I've taken the liberty because of your mother's on board.  We never had a woman on board before removing all the pornography from the common areas.  I hope that's okay with you.  I said, yeah, it's fine.  It's good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry I did that.  To be sure, plenty of great women explorers have made out pretty well in a male dominated  world.  Anyway, they're talking about some women there.  This is Bloomberg technology.  Bezos loves Earth too.  We've sent a lot of probes to every planet in the solar system.  Believe me, this is the best one.  You know, I'm glad to hear him say that because Elon acts as if like, oh, we're going to save  ourselves by going to Mars.  And people-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mars is a terrible place.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Elton John said that, but it is.  And it's very, it would be very, very hard to make Mars into anything habitable for any  reasonable number of people.  So it's not plan B in any normal scenario.  So let's keep our planet okay.  The idea of space as a backup to Earth if destroyed is unmotivating, said Bezos.  I want a world for my grandchildren's grandchildren to live in.  I also want a dynamic world, a world that is expanding and growing.  I do not believe in stasis and this planet's finite.  Well, that's a good, you know what, that's a good argument for exploring.  But don't think it's because we're going to all move there.  I think Jeff has his, he's got a head, a good head on his shoulders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is a moment where we should talk about a space explorer par excellence who  we lost today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're right.  And it's an explorer of the mind and the cosmos.  And brilliant physicist and really an inspiration.  Stephen Hawking, of course, passed away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I just put up links to Yuri Milner who started the, he started the space exploration  saying that like thousands of little tiny spaceships.  Yeah.  I put it up on the link.  Yeah.  He did a tribute to Hawking today.  And then Tony Hendra who sat next to Hawking in elementary school.  I did not know that.  Former editor of...  I love Tony Hendra.  Yeah.  So here's Yuri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  National Lampoon.  Yuri Milner.  Should I read that?  Yeah, just a second or third graph.  Yeah.  I was greatly saddened to hear of the passing of Stephen Hawking when future historians  consider who were the outstanding people of our age.  They will think of Professor Hawking, some of the greatest insights concerning, concerned  the late...  You know what?  I'm going to have to read this directly.  I'm reading, I'm trying to read it off the TV screen.  That's not...  Let me do that again.  Where's the link?  Where's the link?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook.  Albert.  We now believe that the universe does not really forget anything.  And as long as people...  Oh, there it went.  Don't read it off the TV screen.  I told you.  As long as people are doing physics, his contribution will not be forgotten.  So that was nice.  That's good.  Tony Hendra.  He was former editor of National Lampoon.  So he too had a tribute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's reactions to...  I think I have a link here.  The Queen sends a message to Hawking's family, ex-wife deeply saddened.  You saw the wonderful movie.  Here's Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India.  President Obama's tribute.  That's kind of sweet.  This is a picture of President Obama and Hawking's daughter, Lucy.  And Obama posted this and said, have fun out there among the stars.  Hawking's Brief History of Time is a layperson's introduction to deep physics.  And it is highly recommended.  You should also watch the movie with Eddie Redmayne playing Stephen Hawking, the theory  of everything.  Redmayne said, we've lost a truly beautiful mind.  There is an illustrated Brief History that I have that I really like Hawking supervised  this publication of it.  It's expanded and updated, has lots of great pictures.  It's $85 in hardcover.  But this I highly recommend.  Here's a less expensive paperback.  It was really, really gorgeous.  Now I'm going to have to dig it out, put it on my coffee table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if I may, let me read just a little bit from Tony Henry's.  Please.  Tony, as I said, sat next to him.  And they each took the exams for the fancy schools.  And one got into Oxford, one got into Cambridge.  Tony says, considering the scope of his work, there's something felicitous in his dying  on the same day Einstein was born.  In the space time continuum, birth, death and dates are infinitely fungible.  Marvelous if he could somehow also make possible for Hawking to discover that he was also right  about God in the afterlife.  But we will never know.  I do know this.  This scrawny kid who sat in front of me has redefined forever the paltry measures we have  of what it means to succeed.  And by his vast additions to the sum of human knowledge, as well as his demonstration of  the incalculable power of the human spirit to survive, he has left the world a far better  place than most of us ever will.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially the part about God since Hawking was a well-known atheist.  Exactly.  I think so is Tony, I would bet.  He believed in an impersonal God, but not a creator, I think, is how he phrased it.  Wow.  Yeah.  Thank you for reminding me.  Because that is-  No, that's really important.  And well, and you know, he led a rich, full life given his illness and his handicap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've known two people who've had ALS, and the fact that they would survive a year on  that horrible disease is amazing.  And the fact that he survived so long on it is just phenomenal.  But the disease in the wheelchair be damned.  Having nothing to do with that, he was an amazing man.  He also died on Pi Day, didn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  3-1-4.  Yeah.  So Einstein's birthday on Pi Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did he pass yesterday or did he today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, I think they said Monday, I think is what they said, but I don't know.  Oh, Monday.  It might have been Pi Day in the UK.  It might have been Pi Day by then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, today is Wednesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're dicking.  But see, this is a problem with time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell me about time.  What is the problem with time, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's relative.  It's all relative.  Who inherited my Pixel Buds?  Did anybody pick those up?  I gave those away in the big Leo garage sale.  Who was bad at work?  Yeah.  Yeah, I put all my old stuff that I didn't want to keep out on the conference room table,  including the Pixel Buds.  But they have apparently improved controls for the Pixel Buds, which I just never grew  to love.  You can finally double tap to skip songs.  Ooh.  Triple tapping has a new function.  And finally, an in-ear detection feature will pause your music when you remove the right  earbud.  These are all features that Apple's AirPods have.  I'm never going to remember all those things.  Yeah, I never use them on the AirPods, but it's nice to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Once you start using them, you kind of, whatever works for you, you'll keep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll tell you what I do use.  I use the take one earbud out to pause it because that's a very natural thing.  Somebody talks to you, you take out an earbud, it stops, you talk to them.  I never knew that was the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always thought the music was continuing when I talked to somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's phenomenal.  That's an example of where somebody's really spending some energy thinking about how people  use stuff and do the right thing.  By the way, Microsoft cut its laptop prices yesterday on Pi Day by 31.4%.  I wish I'd known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's much more impressive than 3.14%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it could have been 3.14%.  Let's take a break and talk a little more in just a bit.  Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York, BuzzMachine.com, What Would Google Do,  Public Parts, and more.  Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IOT.com and her great podcast with Kevin Tofel who's  watching today.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Now officially the biggest lender in the United States, number one according to Inside Mortgage  Finance, number one online mortgage lender, number one in customer satisfaction according  to JD Power, number one in my heart because they created Rocket Mortgage, a fully online  mortgage approval process.  We're going to the bank, put on a tie, go on down there.  The banker goes through a bunch of rig and roll and gives you a big long form to fill  out.  Then you have to go to the attic and you get all the paperwork, your pay stubs and your  check statements, call the bank saying, I need check statements for five years ago and  on and on and on and on.  And I mean literally, the last time I bought a house four years ago, Lisa and I spent more  than a month gathering paperwork to prove we were eligible for the mortgage.  We got it in the end, but it took us weeks.  Rocket Mortgage, about eight minutes, eight minutes.  You don't have to get off the couch.  You could be at an open house with your smartphone, go to rocketmortgage.com slash twig, answer  a few simple questions you know off the top of your head because they have got trusted  relationships with all the financial institutions.

Rocketmortgage.com slash twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So can I mention one quickly?  Yeah.  So Google just made a change that now if they know you subscribe to let's say The Economist  or The Guardian or The New York Times, it will place that publication higher in ranking.  Oh, that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's a really, a battle is raging.  I'm curious what you think about this because you're the journalism expert.  But it's pretty clear now, Apple just bought Texture, one of our sponsors, which is the  magazine app.  It gives you 200 magazines for 10 bucks a month.  It was founded by Conde Nast, the big magazine publishers, Conde Nast First, Meredith, O'Reilly,  also Rogers.  Yeah.  So it was it was clearly the magazine companies saying, well, we've got to find a digital  platform.  It really was great.  It worked well.  Apple bought them.  Not clear what they're going to do.  Eddie Hugh in an interview said, we're going to put some of it in our Apple News app.  This sounds like, Jeff, a commitment from Apple to good journalism.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what you see happening now is that both Facebook and Google have committed to trying  to help publishers with paywalls.  And we can debate how effective paywalls are for every publisher.  But I guess the magazine is the ultimate paywall, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to subscribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The magazine is there, too.  So this is this is now Apple coming in.  And Apple's, of course, helped publishers for quite some time with paywalls.  So I think you find that happening all across the board now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this in some ways, I think it's the response to the fake news thing.  And I saw a good piece on Monday from Jean-Louis Gesse on his site, The Monday Note, saying  that these companies have to finally admit we are we are more than a platform.  We are publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I'm going to argue against that.  And I wrote about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a side effect to it.  There's a negative side effect because then they're responsible.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, that's part of it is you get to the regulation piece.  But the other part of it is the expectation that sets for what the Internet is.  When you call the net on a platform, a publisher, it brings to mind a packaged, edited, polished  product.  And the Internet is not that.  And so, you know, as I like to say, the Internet is not the New York Times, it's Times Square.  And so when we when we in media try to put it in our square hole, the round peg in our  square hole, we set this expectation of what it is.  Then what happens is when somebody schmutz is on the Internet, then the regulators come  and say, oh, the Internet's ruined.  It's ruining society.  It's ruining everything.  And the moral panic ensues.  So I argue strangeness that it is not a publisher and that that is an old style, old institution  way to look at things.  And it informs nothing to put them in our box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you arguing that, though, just because you're worried about governmental interference  or because they don't really aren't publishers because they truly aren't publishers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's something new and we miss the we miss the opportunity to know what they really are.  There's something in between platform and publish.  We set expectations that are wrong for the Internet.  The Internet's about speech and just the whole notion of scale.  I wrote this the other day that it's the scale of the net and the platforms that enables  everyone to talk to anyone.  It's also that same scale that makes it impossible to package it and clean it up and find that  one ad with rubles because the scale is just so gigantic and the scale is good and the  scale makes it hard.  That's why we shouldn't think, oh, this is like putting out Time magazine.  They should be able to clean this up.  No.  And it's an entirely different thing at a different scale with different use.  And so, no, damn it, they're not publishers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad that they're supporting.  Good journalism, it sounds like they're supporting good journalism by supporting  publishers, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and they're also.  But you have Facebook trying to we've talked about that often.  Google is looking at the authority, reliability and quality of search results.  Facebook is now looking at trying to bring back quality news.  You saw the news that Twitter put out an RFP to get help to figure out how Twitter affects  the health of the public conversation.  So they're all now taking a stand.  Facebook today banned the far right British party for and its and its leaders for hate  speech. This is them trying to find standards.  We valued the openness of the net before we all and people like me and you fought for  the openness of the net and leave it open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then people like Andrew Kean said it's the cult of the amateur.  All these amateur.  He was kind of right.  Wait a minute. Now, he was kind of right.  All these all these people are going to flood in.  The problem with completely democratized media is, yeah, it gives everybody a voice.  And unfortunately, it gives a much more powerful voice to a tiny minority with vile thoughts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because we let them.  That's because because we the system is architected and crop properly.  That doesn't mean that openness is wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I went I went to see Black Panther a couple of nights ago, which, by the way,  I still haven't seen it.  You must. So good.  It's so good.  It's it's and it's good.  I mean, it's a good movie.  It's good. It's good.  Marvel Comics stuff.  But it's good to me for political reasons.  I thought it was very interesting because very strong women without being,  you know, emasculating or angry,  but just being women that are strong and smart and effective and funny.  And then it showed African-Americans Africans, but also African-Americans in a very,  very positive, powerful light.  I didn't know this, but Tana, he said, Coates has been writing  the most recent Black Panther comic books.  I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, he's writing next.  What? Captain America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Awesome. So I thought he's nervous about what I thought.  I'm sitting here watching this and it reminded me, a how powerful,  what a powerful platform movies are, because that movie is going to be seen.  It's already a billion dollar movie.  It'll probably end up being the highest grossing movie,  certainly of the year, maybe of the decade, maybe of all time.  I mean, it's it's it's going to be huge.  It's going to be seen by white people all over this country  and by people of all colors all over the world.  And I think that that is going to have a very strong,  positive effect for human rights.  And so I was.  But then what it made me think is.  It's so powerful because the people using it know how to use it.  And and it's and there's so much power in some of these platforms  that it's OK that it's not fully democratized.  I'm glad the trolls can't make a 50 million dollar movie.  Seriously, Steve Bannon made movies, but no one saw him because they weren't good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's there's that, but there's also kind of the  oh, the acorn videos that what they do is they they don't take Hollywood.  And you could argue actually that what was it?  Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ was kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, honestly, it's not nearly as those things are minor.  They're not as damaging as the kind of dialogue that goes on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gone with the wind.  I mean, you could argue that up until now, we've had movies that have denigrated.  Oh, I agree with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not saying that movies are good.  I'm just saying it is is such a powerful platform  that it's that I think it's not a bad thing that there have been gatekeepers, maybe.  Well, but now admittedly, no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were it was a bad thing that there were gatekeepers.  Yeah, I guess it stopped other people's stories from being told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.  But they're getting told now and they're not getting told now because of YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think I think that  the Internet enabled so many more voices to be heard and valued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's that it helped that this is the culmination of years of democracy, in other words.  So I'm yes.  And Karsten is pointing out he's  he's throwing a nonverbal argument and he's putting student videos from Parkland.  Today, a lot of students walked out of classrooms all over the country  to protest gun laws and to urge gun safety.  And and so this is a good this is a really good example of.  Yeah, you're right. You're right.  Yeah, you're right.  So you could say you could it would be fair to say that Black Panther  wouldn't exist if it hadn't been for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't want to be deterministic, but I think that it has a  additive effect.  I'm doing a lot of research right now, the big pile of books on  on mass society and mass culture.  And if you go back to 1960, the fear and the dread  of what television was doing to the mind, and it was all awful.  And if you go back farther, what movies were doing, of course,  you go back farther was eventually way back was books.  And and this notion that we are incapable and we need these gatekeepers,  we need high culture and high culture has been ruined by this this low stuff.  And it's kind of an anti-Americanism.  And so we're seeing the same thing now.  That's what that's what Andrew Keene does to an extent, right?  It's this snobbish, elitist view.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in a nutshell what Andrew Keene said. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And we're trying to figure out.  But what we're doing is this is why what Facebook and Google  and Twitter are doing is important.  They're now for the first time trying to realize that quality matters.  And they got to figure out WTF quality.  And they don't know. And I don't know either.  But they're trying to say a barrage of crap by people  who are manipulating the platform is no good.  So we're going to have to find some way to variegate here and some way  to figure that out. And they're just beginning.  And it's going to be a hard process because they're going to go too far.  And satire is getting killed in Germany and elsewhere now  because of the new laws.  But they'll figure it out. They'll get there.  We'll get there. We'll see.  Listen, that's a crappy experience for us.  And that's a good experience.  Give me more of the good. OK, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not. But I was all excited because I thought  that this is an example of the power of a mainstream motion picture to change,  I think, to change the minds of millions of people.  Yeah, but Stacey's point is really right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All the stories that never got told. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, as a woman watching movies and having my daughter,  who is way more alert to sexism than I am,  there's so many movies that she is like, yeah, why would I watch this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's crap. Well, you know, generations been subjected to all these Disney  princesses and yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, OK, all I mean, my generation was subjected to Disney princesses.  Well, I'm just glad she could all the words to the Ariel song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm just glad that she's that she's sensitized to it. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my doing. Good job, Mom.  We don't have a lot of boring conversations about gender  inequality at our house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's called Death of the Death of Stalin.  That's a Stalin. Oh, I can't wait to see it.  Hilarious. It's a political satire.  Oh, Armando, you knew you knew she wrote it.  Oh, I love him. Right.  He writes great political satire.  He's one of my favorites.  I was wondering if we'd ever see another movie from him. He did.  He did the movie that TV show that VEEP was based on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that would be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he is.  What was the name of it? I'm trying to remember.  The thick of it, which is a fabulous  sitcom and in the loop with was such a good movie.  Yeah, he's. Oh, I can't wait to see it.  That will be great. OK.  If you can. Well, now we don't have to show a trailer.  Everybody should go see that. And then and then what else?  What was so annihilation? You're going to see that.  What's annihilation? What's that all about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's it's a remake of a not a horror sci fi trilogy.  The movie is supposedly very different.  Stars Natalie Portman.  They go adult book.

Transcript:  Is this another hunger? No, no, this is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a different dystopia.  Get off my log.  There they go into this thing called the shimmer,  where reality is different and something about alien life.  Oh, this looks really good. You're going to see that tonight, huh?  I think so. Yeah, nice.  It's like Andrew's got plans to do something else.  So I'm like, oh, now was it you who told me to get the book autonomous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because usually we're busy.  And my parents, you know, they live in Houston.  They want to see her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why doesn't your daughter join us and interview her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She has not read the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's OK. She can get that.  You feel like some of the themes in the book might be kind of adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little. It's not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's about big pharma.  It's about some amazing autonomous  and indentured robots.  The indentured robots.  Yeah. Very interesting issues that she raises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She is reading what's it called?  Zahara Zahara, The Wind Seeker, which is.  Yes. A really good looking book.

Someone's talking about Red Sparrow, which I don't think you should see.  I saw it. I love the books.  The books. The books are amazing.  I've read the entire trilogy.  They are so good. I cannot recommend them enough.  The movie is like a gorefest of beating up.  It looks like.  Jennifer Lawrence. I don't.  I don't know why she wanted to do that.  It's no, it's I could not watch like it was like she's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looked painful. I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So don't don't watch it.  It's really awful.  But read the books. The books are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you disappointed? We were all excited about the post.  You disappointed that no Academy Awards for for the post.  Those people have plenty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In time, it was a piece in time.  I don't think it was one of the greatest movies ever made.  It was a very good movie, but I don't think it was.  I think it was no.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Shape of Water was good, although it was a little like the creature  from the Black Lagoon, but it was good.  I would have I would have liked less rubber costume more,  but the rest of it was fine.  I really like him as a director.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, since we're doing entertainment corner.  Yes. The cold opened last last week, Saturday Night Live.  Didn't see it. Amazing.  Which one was this? Oh, it was it was Muller Breaks Up with Collusion.  Yes. OK, I will watch it.  We won't do it. Watch it.  Would you have a chance?  Because it was it was really daring and wildly, weirdly different.  Oh, nice. Yeah, it's it's it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you want you stay up late on Saturday? No, no, no.  One does. No one does.  Come on, Howard Stern time does that anymore.  They have a YouTube channel.  I know that's really, you know, it's funny because when YouTube  first started, one of the things that almost killed it was NBC.  It was the thing that made it was clips like this in a box from Saturday Night Live.  And one of the things that almost killed it was NBC furiously suing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And CBS did to the volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And but then then it turned then, I guess, they back down  because they realized, you know, this is actually pretty good promotion.  More people are watching Saturday Night Live than ever have before.  And yet I have to say there's no reason to watch Saturday Night Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they get ad revenue from the whole generation.  They wouldn't get they get ad revenue. They get promotion.  It's and it's just the way the world you can't you can't.  What are you going to do? That long?  What are you going to do? You can't you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although my daughter runs around saying like a boss all the time, like,  and I'm like, have you have you seen that in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's just because it's got part of the culture, but that's it.  It has become it. She's like, no, no, I haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's somebody who sings a song on Animal Jam,  which is one of the games she plays.  Like, OK, well, if you happen to see it and you want to talk to me afterwards,  you know, let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She is one lucky sixth grader. That's all I can say.  She's got a good mom. Look, look, you know what moms like to do  in my neck of the woods? Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been waiting for this.  I wind and pleaded and begged.  Do you know about these guys?  Yeah, yes.  No, I knew about them because I saw Lisa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm the target market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, these bragged about about the way to put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good. This is a great sponsor.  We all said now you're in New Jersey, which has very restrictive rules about  us sending wine, but I think you could still get Wink because Wink is a winemaker.  They're not a wine distributor.  So you're getting it from the winemaker.  It actually was pretty smart of them.  Wink W-I-N-C, which I guess stands for wine club,  is so much better than a wine club.  It is a wine club, but it's I mean, look,  this is for people who probably, you know, well, for sure, over 21  and probably drink wine a little bit.  But maybe you'd like to find a better wine or maybe you're drinking the same wine  every night or every day every week and you'd like to try something else  or you'd like to get a little more sophisticated about your.  I've tried to find a place to put this.  I wanted to show you the box because it comes in this nice box.  Four bottles a month.  You can skip any month.  You can choose the bottles.  Let me actually start with the wine quiz  because that's kind of the fun the fun part about Wink.  T-R-Y W-I-N-C dot com slash twig.  OK, you can go right right now.  And we, of course, have a deal.  You're going to get $20 off your first shipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the fun part about what is that code, Leo?  What is that code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just try Wink dot com slash twig.  Twig.  You'll in fact, if you go there, you'll see at the top says your $20  discount will be applied to check out just by going there.  But here's here's the onboarding that I really love.  And you can do this if you want.  How do you like your coffee?  Strong and black, mild, but nothing in it with cream and or sugar frappuccino.  I don't like coffee.  Jeff, what do you what do you pick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was just going back.  How about you, Stacey?  What do you like?  I say with sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is me to cream and cream and or sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Only sugar, but I will drink it black if I have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, how about you, Jeff?  Oh, mild, but nothing in it.  All right. Well, well, you know what?  This is just a test.  Salt. Do you like salt?  I put it on everything.  I use it sometimes, but it bothers me.  Food's undersalted.  I like the taste, but I don't miss it.  When it's not on my food, take it or leave it.  Don't really like the salty stuff.  You, Jeff, put it on everything.  How about you, Stacey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm use it sometimes.  Bothers me when it's not salty.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Citrus.  The more mouth-buckering, the better.  Like it, don't love it.  Drink the occasional glass of OJ.  Nope, not at all.  You get where we're going here, right?  Do you like earthy flavors like mushrooms and black truffles?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More or less eat dirt.  More or less eat dirt.  Who doesn't love truffles, right?  Blackberries, raspberries, blueberries.  You love berries.  Do you like the flavors, but you like them?  Yeah, I like that one.  Eat them raw.  All right.  Now, don't think wine yet, but you could.  I know, but I like them too much.  Yeah, Barry, I know what you're saying.  I like wine with a little pepper.  Oh, yeah, you like a little pepper?  All right.  So based on what I just kind of made up here,  I gave hybrid answers from the two of you,  so this may not be your package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the Stacey and Jeff amalgamation bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  So now you're going to build your box.  By the way, if you like, you say, I only want red,  you can have four reds and no whites.  You can have one white, two whites, three whites.  You get to choose.  So let's do half and half.  So it's recommending the 2016 Rosa Obscura Red Blend,  Paz Ordinaire Red Blend, the Summer Water Rosé,  which by the way, I'm not a Rosé fan,  but when it gets hot out, you're going to want this chilled.  And they've recommended a cider, the Envy Eplevin Cider.  They do some ciders.  They make all of this themselves all over the world.  So this is called Cape Root.  It's from Western Cape in South Africa.  So this is South African white.  We have a red that we really, really love,  a Pinot that's from the Santa Barbara area.  They pick the grapes at midnight.  Literally, they pick them at night.  This is very good too.  I've had this 2016 Pinot from Santa Barbara.  Here's the one.  I think this is the Field Theory, yeah.  The Field Theory comes in a cool looking bottle.  You can see it and it is, this,  you would know this maybe, it's a Blaufranckisch.  It's a German style, Blaufranckisch.  And it is, oh my gosh, this is delicious.  So here's the deal with Wink.  You sign up, you're going to get, these prices are amazing.  Now admit it, it's not too Chuck,  but this is really great wine from the winemakers.  $13 bottles, I'm assuming.  That tastes like $60 bottles.  My rule is under 15 bucks.  Yeah, these taste like 60 to $100 bottles.  And by the way, you can go and buy individual bottles  or a case, if there's something you like.  We bought a case of the Field Theory.  They work with top winemakers and growers  from around the world to make their own wine.  Each month there are new delicious wines  like the very popular,  as we get closer to the hot month, Summer Water Rosé.  They also partner with, as you can see,  local artists to make beautiful labels.  They're all works of art.  Shipping is covered.  And if you taste it and you don't like it, don't worry.  You don't have to send it back.  I asked them, I said, do I have to send it back?  They said, no, no, no, no, we don't want it back.  Just pour it out, give it to a friend.  We'll send you a new bottle of something you'll love.  No questions asked.  They just go, no problem, it's on its way.  So sit back and relax or celebrate with Wink.  We have become Wink fans.  We had a big box the other day.  We went down, we actually went down to Marina Del Rey  a couple of weeks ago.  I wanted to meet the winemaker  and he told me some really interesting,  hi, here I am in Sonoma County.  I've been here for 20 years.  One of the prime wine growing regions  of California, of the world.  And he told me some stuff about wine I did not know.  For instance, there are a lot of places  where people take their grapes and make their own wine  even though they don't have wineries.  It's very common.  And Wink will do that.  They make their wines all over with grapes from all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you know there's a place in Austin  that lets you make your own wines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even in New Jersey.  You can get New Jersey wine.  Yeah, I had no idea.  It's just a joke, but yes.  Well, I don't think they have any.  By the way, I can get deliveries  of everything except the champagne.  Oh, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, New Jersey has among the most restrictive laws  on wine shipments.  But they'll tell you once you put your address in  whether you can get it or not.  In most cases you can because they make their wine.  So even the most restrictive states like New Jersey,  if you're buying from the winemaker, it's okay.  They just don't want, I guess, you know what it is?  It's probably. It's the distributor lobby.  Yeah, it's the lobby.  Yes it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or the state licensing boards depending on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same reason you can't have a Tesla showroom in Texas.  You know, it's just the incumbents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can have a showroom,  you just can't have a dealership.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, pardon me. Yeah.  Look, get Wink.  And it's a, I mean, if you aren't drinking great wine,  it's not, look, four bottles a month.  I'm not talking about every night,  but getting that nice date night, Saturday night,  if you want to go in to visit friends,  bringing them a bottle of this,  we get lots more invitations out now  because we bring them bottles of Field Theory.  This is so good.  Try Wink.com,  T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com slash twig, $20 off.  Your first order.  You're going to love it.  I really, this is one of my favorite sponsors.  They're all my favorites.  They're like my children.  I love them all, but Wink, my mouth is watering.  I want to do my Wink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like, how long, when are we done with the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  We're going to send you both.  If we can figure it out, I think we can.  We're going to, we'll send you both a little,  something special from Wink.  Looking for the Field Theory on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Do you like pinos?  It's a, it's like a pinos.  It's a little, it's a,  it's a little free from what you described your taste.  I think you would like the Field Theory,  but don't, don't, we'll send you, we'll send you some.  Okay.  Any stories I missed?  I missed a ton of them because we were wandering  all over the place and I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We walked into entertainment,  entertainment weekly kind of territory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Facebook is a streaming 25 major league baseball  afternoon games, games you probably wouldn't see normally.  Estimates are about 30 to $35 million.  Not, not that expensive.  And I think it's for Facebook,  an excuse to try live broadcasting.  Let's just see what happens.  They're all trying to figure it out.  They all want it.  Twitter, Facebook, everyone wants to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's see.  Oh, Android Wear.  Who's still wearing Android Wear?  Cause I saw this and I was like,  really they needed more than a name change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got one I haven't opened yet.  Cause it was only $135.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple Watch just ate the universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean like I'm an Android users  and I use a Fitbit instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you like these new,  what do you think of these new Fitbits?  This is their attempt to compete with Apple.  They're using some of the stuff they got  from Pebble I suspect.  Not the iconic, but the new one that just came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the ladies one is what they-  It looks awfully big.  They said they made it smaller.  I like my, I have a charge too in it.  I like it.  It's a good form factor.  It does everything I need it to be.  You know, I just-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the Fitbit Versa.  Versa, that's it.  And it's really probably Fitbits,  I don't want to say dying gas,  but they are really,  they are starting to lose,  everybody's starting to lose market share to Apple.  Unfortunately, I like to see competition.  Well, I would like to see competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because I'm an Android user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what do Android people do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, Wear OS?  No.  Android Wear?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe try this.  The Versa's 200 bucks.  Yeah, it's fairly inexpensive.  That's kind of a lot more than I want to spend on this.  I just, it's basically an activity and sleep tracker  and a heart rate tracker for me.  So, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, we'll get a review and we'll let you know.  Yeah, it's awesome.  It's awfully big, but maybe it's,  maybe that's, so they have sizes.  Works with Apple, Android and Windows phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it's a focus on women's health.  So they're going to have a, are they,  let's see, period tracking.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I got the Misfit Vapor for 140 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Misfit's not bad.  I used Misfit trackers before.  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I haven't opened it up yet.  It's been here for like three months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were bought by Fossil.  Ah.  So.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh.  Well, but really the story seems to be that wearables,  with the exception of Apple's watches,  are not doing all that well.  It's not a great category.  I think people don't need watches for one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually missed my watch.  I never was one to like look at my phone  because it was always in my bag.  So I always like looking at my wrist to see what time it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what's made a difference for me  is the always on notifications of my,  Pixel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's something, by the way.  Make a difference.  That Apple still hasn't figured out  how to keep the watch on,  how to tell time all the time.  They just can't seem to do that.  So that's a little bit of a drawback.  Yeah, the always on is very nice on the Pixel.  I mean, I could see what time it is  on both my Samsung and my Google phones right here.  I can just look at it.  So you're right.  Who needs a watch?  Except if it's in your purse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If they're in your purse or something like that.  And again, I am the weird person  who doesn't walk around with her phone.  Don't you notice though, when you go to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is it my, I don't go to a lot of meetings,  but when I go to meetings, it seems kind of de rigueur.  Everybody puts their phone on their table  in front of them like that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if I don't have, no,  cause I mean, if I don't have my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, nice people turn it over, but I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you're that guy.  You know, when we're out to eat or dinner table,  the phone is not even around.  I'm old school.  Good for you.  I don't know.  I just, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have Michael, 15 year old,  will sit at the phone with a table  like eating dinner with the phone like this.  And Lisa says, put the phone away.  Actually she starts to take it.  He goes, no, and he puts it in his lap.  And then he spends the rest of the dinner going like this.  And then in his lap, and he's gonna put the phone away  and then it gets in the pocket.  But he's very squirrely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I saw something on Medium  about the dark side of digital persuasion  and how it's affecting kids.  I think Mark Benioff tweeted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody's talking about that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody's talking about it.  You know what?  I just put a quote in today from my research  about the addiction of television and movies  and how awful it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is something to say though.  People go to movies every week now.  I can't believe it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, if you look at what Netflix is talking about doing  with badges for completing shows.  Oh please, oh my gosh.  These kind of efforts, they do have an effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why those shows start up after the first,  after a show ends.  They start right into another show.  They don't wanna give you a chance to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Jeff, I know you're gonna call it techno panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sociologist Vanden Haag.  One may turn to the mass media when lonely or bored,  but mass media, once they become a habit,  impair the capacity for meaningful experience.  The habit feeds on itself,  establishing a vicious circle as addictions do.  They lessen people's capacity to experience life itself.  But Jeff, would you disagree with that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you put down that phone and go see a movie?  But wait a minute, Jeff, isn't that true?  No.  To the degree that you do it,  if you spent five hours a night watching TV,  would that not in fact have that exact?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No?  Yes.  No.  Look at what happens at a dinner.  We're just used to it.  There are so many times when we're out to eat  and we look around and there's home families  just doing this.  And it's distressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe they're talking to their other families.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yes, if someone has a family  that is not supportive of them,  but wouldn't you like to have the chance  to establish that relationship with your family?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure, but I think this notion  that we're now putting phones  in the same category as cocaine  is a definite case of moral panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think I'm putting it in the case of cocaine.  Some are.  Okay, some are.  But I do think this is something  that we need to look at, we need to question,  and we need to say, hey,  do we really want to gamify binge watching for our kids  to encourage them to do more?  Netflix does, sure.  But do I, as a parent, think that's a great idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey kids, get your secret decoder ring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I mean, did people in the internet  and I talked about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just that they've gotten better at it, Jeff.  It's been weaponized.  Do you not think that it could even be considered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Eating a bunch of sugary cereal  has actually caused your generation a lot of problems  to get those secret decoder rings.  So I do think this is an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That you found, that's how we screw up the world.  It's the damn secret decoder rings.  I'm just saying.  And you know what, Stacey?  Those crackerjack secret prizes  and the disappointment that comes  led to a generation of cynics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Might have.  It might have, Jeff.  Doesn't mean it didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The prizes were really crappy.  You always hoped you were gonna get something good.  Zaynep.  And you realized that life was screwed up.  Zaynep Tufiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  YouTube, the great radicalizer, said something,  she's observed something I've observed.  I've been saying for a long time,  one of the reasons you get people like Logan Paul on YouTube  is there is a pressure towards extreme video.  I mean, there has been on TV, too.  We wouldn't have Morton Downey Jr. without it.  But she says, she tried this out as an experiment  and that's all we can do since Google doesn't say  how their YouTube algorithms work.  It's a very insightful piece.  It's a very what?  Insightful piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You agree.  Well yeah, because what it says is,  this notion that oh, you like that?  I'll give you something that's even more like that.  More extreme.  Something that's then very easy to exploit.  And so you make that thing that is more like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's the nature of the YouTube algorithm  and it works, so they wouldn't do it  I don't think these people are evil-ly planning this,  plotting it in their evil lairs.  I think when it gets exploited badly.  But I do think that engineers create algorithms  that optimize for the thing the company wants,  which is more engagement, more viewing,  and that's why you get algorithms  and push it towards more and more extreme videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Makers in turn exploit that.  I mean, the funny example she gave is  you watch vegetarian videos and it gives you vegan.  Right.  You're on to the next step.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's more extreme in every direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They value relevance and relevance is a factor  that can get played very easily.  And so I don't think it's fully true that we think  let's get the whole country into craziness.  Yeah, we'll make money that way.  I don't think they're gonna do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't think they're doing that,  but it's having that.  Do you not agree that it is potentially at least dangerous?  They're unintended consequences.  There are consequences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I think it's intended by,  but not necessarily by the platform in all cases,  it's by the maker of the far right and far left crazy stuff.  They recognize how to do that.  Yeah, but the platform's complicit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  just as it was after the parking shooting.  Sometimes unknowingly, sometimes unknowingly.  I would agree with you that it's completely unknowingly.  I'm not saying that Google and Facebook are,  but they're optimizing.  They're engineers, just as the engineers  at World of Warcraft optimize for maximum playing time,  they maximize for what the company wants,  which is maximum engagement, maximum viewing time.  That has this impact.  And are there not societal and individual consequences  to algorithms that drive you to spend all day  watching more and more extreme videos on YouTube,  as an example?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, but there are also good uses  of that kind of formula for relevance.  Yes.  But that doesn't excuse it.  I'm doing research now, and as I dig through,  I'm buying book after book after book after book  because I see another footnote, I see another thing.  That kind of relevance is the basis of these structures,  and there's a sensible good basis for them.  So what should YouTube do?  I think they should be, you're absolutely right,  we're agreeing here.  I think that they should be aware of,  number one, how it's manipulated,  and number two, how it can be misused by users as well,  and figure out how to not go into a rabbit hole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're saying the vegan video makers  are at fault for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I'm saying in that case,  there's nothing harmful about saying you like vegetarian,  maybe you like vegan.  What's the harm?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  None.  Well, I mean, it could be.  You could become an extremist.  An extreme vegan.  But it also says there are extreme vegans.  I live in Austin.  But at least I'm in Austin.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gee, you like-  You ever want extreme veganism?  The beer plant is a blue pub in vegan place in Austin.  It actually is really good.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go for it.  Move from San Francisco, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, did it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's a joke.  Oh, I'm like, yeah, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All the Californians are coming here anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You saw the science study,  which actually proves something that's obvious  to anybody who's paying attention,  that fake news has more legs than real news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Though be careful about putting,  this was a very smart study,  but it was a very specific study  from Deb Roy at MIT Media Lab.  Right.  Where they took a limited number of Twitter threads.  Right, and which is not that many  when you go right down to it.  But they looked then at people's habits  of sharing things that had been specifically fact-checked,  false versus true.  And people equal to bots shared bad stuff more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, bots did not.  You missed the fascinating, I thought,  side line on this-  I thought when they took the bots out,  it was the same.  No, yeah.  So when bot traffic was added back to the mix,  computer programs spread false and true news about equally.  Oh, about equally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I misread that sentence.  Oh, okay.  Bots-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Equally to, okay.  So the finding is humans rather than bots  are primarily to blame for spreading fake news.  But who didn't know we love fake news?  Yeah, we knew that.  But this is a verification.  The second shooter on the grassy knoll.  I mean, we've always loved fake news.  We've always loved conspiracy theories.  But this proves it.  And what I think was important about this is  you don't just blame bots or the internet research agency  or Russians.  We take responsibility.  Blame humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Patches.  I'm working with somebody,  I hope I'm working with somebody  who is gonna try to do ad campaigns and more about,  this is my phrase, responsible sharing.  We all have a responsibility when we share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do wanna get that Netflix binge watching badge though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I watched all the seasons of Voltron.  Yes.  Which is actually a wonderful remake of the cartoon.  But you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't think Netflix or Google or Facebook  does any of this because they're evil geniuses.  They do it because this is what a business does.  It maximizes attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How sick did we get of four square badges?  It works for a little while.  And then we say, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kids are very different.  Kids are super different.  They collect all kinds.  Have you seen the crap that they sell kids to collect?  One of the reasons.  I mean, I wouldn't, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pokemon cards.  Garbage pail kids.  One of the reasons I don't like marketing  and I don't market us very well is because I,  I'm completely conscious of how we could try  to manipulate our audience to get more viewing time.  And I try not to do that.  What would your best trick be?  Oh, I mean, I could do much more link baity titles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I could have more cleavage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could have more cleavage.  You know, you joke.  But back in the days of tech TV,  when we brought in a big time producer,  the first thing he said is we need more cleavage  on the screen.  No.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, same.  So let me rant momentarily about that.  So today I was watching Katie Ture,  who I think, Ture, who was a great,  I think wonderful TV journalist.  And she was wearing a dress that was a little bit low cut.  No big deal.  And so I was looking for a tweet of hers  and I got creeped out by the men  who were ugly in the dress.  And then I got depressed by the women  who were scolding her for wearing the dress.  It doesn't matter what she wears.  Listen to what she says.  She's really smart.  She's a good journalist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Jeff, you have, I have to say,  you have a particular kind of blindness to the fact that-  What, Stacy, what are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just noticed this, Jeff?  Oh, yeah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Jesus, it was, but on both,  she got it from both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is every woman's life.  I know, and she gets it from both sides.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just, and it would be,  people were doing this in public.  It's one of them, they think it,  but they were doing it.  It's just, I felt for Katie Ture, and every woman, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm sure she is, as are all TV hosts,  bombarded with the message, not necessarily explicit,  that the sexier you are, the better you will do.  No, I-  No, I guarantee you, I know,  I worked in television for many years.  It doesn't have to be explicit,  but it is very much in the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is oftentimes explicit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it can be explicit, but it's there,  and it's a drumbeat, and it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's particularly aggravating  when men can look old and have grotesque,  look schlubby and disgusting, and you're like, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  Yeah, there's no drumbeat for men to be sexier at all.  I mean, maybe for younger men,  but I never felt any pressure to show more cleavage.  I just wanna be clear on that.  Please don't, please don't.  I used to try, but they actually would discourage it.  So, yeah.  And you can't, and so blaming,  you have to a little bit blame the platforms.  You have to do, because-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have to learn how they're used and deal with it.  They have to learn how they're misused and manipulated,  and yes, they have to study that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think it's fair for a platform or a publisher.  I think it's, I mean, I'm not as successful  as I would like to be, or successful enough,  and I choose not to do the things  that I think are morally suspect,  like encouraging, I always went around encouraging,  I would tell the young women who would join Tech TV,  be very careful, try to project a smart image,  not a sexy image, because as soon as you go down that path,  that way lies danger.  And even if it's not quite as successful,  go for the smart person, not for the sexy person.  But it's probably, by the way, bad career advice  in both television and Instagram.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Had you ever told me to go the sexy route,  I would have punched you, like, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but I was sincere in saying,  and by the way, a lot of these young women would, in fact,  wear low-cut stuff, because they knew,  whether consciously or unconsciously,  they knew that was not only what's expected of them,  but that's what would work for their career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But we also shouldn't judge them negatively  for wearing what they want to wear.  No, that's what I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I judge the platform.  Yes.  I judge the publisher.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.  Anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, where do we get, how do we get here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Farhad, I'm a little bit miffed with Farhad.  Ugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  His fake social media cleanse?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I like Farhad, he's been on our shows.  He can drive me nuts at times.  I like him too, but he can also drive me nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For two months, Farhad writes,  I got my news from print newspapers,  here's what I learned.  In what has become now a style of article  from the New York Times, it is really grating on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then only a week later,  the New York Times does it again  with the most ignorant man in America,  the man who turned off all the news.  Yeah.  It's just become this,  it's the worst of the fake New York Times trend story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Trend stories are another kind of cleavage, by the way.  Yes, they are.  Yes, they are.  So what's sad is-  Not always.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not always.  No, not always.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The New York Times, often the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  I was like, I write a lot of trend stories  about really geeky stuff.  No, no, no.  Because it allows me to kick out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a different kind of trend story.  That's a real trend story.  Okay, I was like, no.  I love those stories.  We found two people who do this.  Yeah, these are fake lifestyle trend stories.  That's a better-  Okay, yeah, got it, sorry.  And by the way, Farhan, during the entire two-month period,  he claimed not to be reading Twitter, was tweeting.  Sometimes five, 10 times a day,  often retweeting news stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was even more than that.  It was a huge number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Like 35 times a day in some cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So CJR called him on it,  and the Times wouldn't do a correction  and wouldn't apologize.  The Columbia Journalism Review.  The Columbia Journalism Review, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I read that, I went, oh my God, Farhan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He tweeted perhaps more than 1,000 times in this period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How could you say I got off Twitter and then tweet?  Doesn't that seem like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And what struck me about the other story,  the most ignorant man in America,  it was also the stance of privilege.  Yeah.  Well, I cannot worry about the world.  The fact that people are getting shot in the streets,  well, doesn't affect me, because I'm okay.  I mean, I think that's a reasonable story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If what your reaction is, well, this was a bad way  to deal with the election of President Trump.  That's what this point of this article was.  He wasn't happy about the election,  so he's living a liberal fantasy by disconnecting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's still a fake trend story.  One anecdote of doing this.  One Nazi, one guy, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  Uber has spent $10.7 billion in nine years  to continue to lose money.  Well, Amazon.  Eric, because of the government.  No, Amazon isn't quite that bad.  I know, I know, I know.  Amazon can make money if they want to.  Uber, I don't think, could make money if they wanted to.  Really.  That's not their business model.  Nobody would take Uber if they suddenly had to pay  the actual cost of the ride.  They still have six billion cash on hand,  but they've burned through quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are they biding time until self-driving cars come,  and they're the platform we use?  Is that the game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of the consensus seems to be,  they need enough runway.  That's a lot of runway.  To get to some form of profitability,  not based on what they're doing today.  Like delivering groceries, or like delivering packages,  or like self-driving cars.  If we could just get drivers out of the cars,  we could be profitable, that kind of thing.  It's fascinating to me, and it's not the only company.  Look at Snap.  There's a lot of companies out there  burning through a lot of cash with no real profit.  I mean, Twitter had its first profitable quarter ever,  last quarter.  All right, I think now we've covered all the...  I think Stacey wants to run Taco Bell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we talk about nacho fries?  And try some of those cheese fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And did we talk about the nacho fries?  Do we get those both in?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got the meat sweats and the Taco Bell cheese fries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For the sake of the show, will you go try the nacho fries?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I will, I'm not asking you to...  I only eat one thing in Taco Bells.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's that?  What's that?  It's the soft tacos, the beef soft tacos.  Oh, and the nachos Belgrano.  But I stopped eating those  because they stopped putting things that I liked on them.  They changed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to love the Enchirito back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My favorite story about Petaluma is  there's a Taco Bells, very popular,  and right across the street, literally,  right across the street is the best taco truck in town,  maybe in all of Northern California.  And it's crowded, and I'm happy.  And I love it that they just said,  no, you know what, we're gonna park right here.  We're gonna give you some good tacos.  Give you some good tacos.  Taco Bell was founded by a guy  who didn't want to compete  with the hamburger stand across the street.  The hamburger stand across the street, by the way,  was the very first McDonald's.  And so now you know the rest of the story.  I didn't know that.  My pick of the week is the Galaxy S9 in vivid purple,  AKA, what do they call it, lilac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it ultraviolet, the Pantone color of the year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.  Is that the Pantone color of the year is ultraviolet?  You can't even see ultraviolet.  Okay, it's purple, dude.  It's purple.  That's why it's ultra.  Yeah, this is purple, and it's pretty.  They put, you know what's funny?  They put the fingerprint reader in the right place,  but I'm so conditioned to it being in the wrong place  on all my previous Galaxy phones  that I rub the flash.  I expect the thing to wake up.  It does have face recognition.  They combine face and iris.  It's not quite as fast as Apple's,  but because it combines face and iris,  it's considered to be pretty darn accurate.  Here, I'll show you.  See if you can see it.  You'll see the red light come on at the top  when I press the button, and that's unlocked.  I don't know, could you see that?  Here, do it this way.  Let me do it this way.  You could see it a little bit better.  So the phone is off.  Press the button.  Red light comes on.  I'm looking at it.  Red light comes on.  I'm looking at it.  You know what?  I'm not looking at it.  I'm looking at the TV.  Put your finger.  At that point, you go, okay, I'll use the finger.  That's right.  I haven't had it long enough to give you a full review.  Bixby cannot be turned off.  They have gamified Bixby as they did last time.  I have 500 SIMs.  They're gonna addict you to Bixby.  Bixby, that ain't gonna happen.  Bixby's the worst.  Look at it.  It thinks it's taking dictation,  and it didn't even come close.  Look how slow it is.  However, I do like this.  The phone, as it comes out of the box,  has Google Assistant right on the front there.  Hey, okay, Google.  That works fast and understands what I'm saying.  So it's another one of those things  where Samsung's got two different of everything.  A Samsung service and a Google service.  But I'm gonna probably put a different launcher on it,  disable the Samsung stuff.  This is the unlocked one.  I have to say, at least they made the price competitive  much lower than the iPhone.  It starts at 720 for the S9 and the S9 Plus,  the bigger one, that's what this is,  is $840 unlocked from Samsung.  I think it's gonna be a good phone.  I'll give you more.  You know, it still has this silly side stuff,  which I just can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the silly side stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The edge, the edge thing.  Oh God, it's got a bezel?  I turn that off.  I always turn that off.  Yeah, you slide in from the edge and you get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, okay, I was like, whoa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then unfortunately, when you slide in  from the other end, you get Bixby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, not Google?  Not something useful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but you just put a different launcher.  This is what's great about Android.  You don't like it?  Put a different launcher on, which I will.  Do you get rid of all the crap that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  After launcher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  The only thing that you don't get rid of  is Samsung's slightly different  implementation of the settings.  I actually like it.  And Samsung does add a lot of, I think, useful features.  It's like the sound check, which you do a hearing test  and it adapts the sound for your headphones  to match your hearing.  Things like that are nice additions, I think, to Android.  So I don't dislike what Samsung does with Android.  And if you put your favorite launcher,  I put Action Launcher on.  Is there a regular Android-like launcher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could put Google's own Pixel launcher.  You could put it at Google's.  You can?  Yeah.  Oh.  That's why we like Android.  See, Apple doesn't let you change the user interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You Apple prisoners you.  I use both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, Stacey, you got a thing this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do.  You guys are gonna love it.  Totally.  Let me put the link in, because I forgot.  Looking for the link.  I was trying to get the most up-to-date price,  but so far that's not happening.  But you're gonna love it,  because it is a smart ironing system  that a friend went to the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Thank God you finally got an IoT device  appropriate for your gender.  Oh.  I am gonna smack you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where is my-  Where is the-  Puncher.  In our family, I don't iron.  Andrew irons, because he's actually patient and good at it.  And I am not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who irons in our family?  Nobody.  The laundry.  We send it out.  I'm like, well-  Is this Flipper, the ironing board  that saves 80% of your time?  Not that one?  Laura.  Nope.  That's a Kickstarter.  That's pretty cool.  Laura Star.  Laura Star.  It's not the Minky Super Size Smart Fit  ironing board reflector.  It is not.  So the Laura Star-  It is not the Oslo Smart Iron.  I mean, sorry.  The Oliso.  Oliso.  Oliso.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've actually seen this.  This one's silly.  It doesn't do anything cool.  But this one is really smart.  It's the Laura Star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently there's a big market for smart ironing boards  that you search for that and you get a lot of stuff.  So what does this do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this a smart ironing board or a smart iron?  Smart iron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a smart iron.  So it has a sensor in it and it tracks your motion.  So you have to, when you pair it to your phone,  it will teach you how to iron better  by tracking how you're moving your stuff over your clothes.  It also senses your clothes and it says,  hey, it self adjusts to whatever it's ironing.  Wait a minute.  It teaches you how to iron better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh geez.  Does it have an oh, shut up button?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How hard is it to iron?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Some people have a hard time.  So I will say, like I had a pleated skirt.  Nothing was a bear to iron, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, of course.  Nobody irons pleats.  You also have the wrong equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need a pleat ironer.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, so, but people try.  And a lot of times like when I have dresses or stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anthony Nielsen, one of our great producers says,  he needs this.  He does not know how to iron.  See?  Your mother let you down.  Does his wardrobe show it, Leo?  No, he's wearing, actually it may be.  He's wearing Steve Jobs black jeans  and a black mock turtleneck.  Come here.  People don't believe me.  You look just like Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Laura Star is a Swiss company  and they are super expensive.  Oh boy.  And they also have, and to go with this iron,  you can actually buy an accompanying ironing board  that has like, it's like an air hockey table.  It poofs up your clothes  so they don't crease while you're ironing.  I like that.  How much do all this cost?  About $1,400.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jeez.  Can't you just put the clothes in your expensive oven  and they'll do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Laura Star Go, it's $2,500 ironing board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that is a different one.  That is, again, these are fancy irons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People who can't afford this don't do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I put a towel on my counter and iron on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's crazy.  I'm just telling you,  I am bringing you the fancy connected home goods  that you didn't know that you wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I do use, we don't iron,  but we do use a steamer if we have to get wrinkles out.  I am fond of steamers and they also have those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Laura Star makes some very expensive steamers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Steamers, yes. Sorry, did I call it a steamer?  It's a steam generator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A new way of ironing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought this was kind of cool.  So you don't have to, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you getting it?  No.  Come on.  I don't iron.  Oh, that's right.  There'd be no point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, if it's not what Andrew wanted,  he wants a steamer actually.  Steamers are great.  He's asking for a steamer for our ready,  our 16th wedding anniversary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aw, he is the perfect husband.  I will send you, I did some research on steamers  and I bought a steamer and I will send you,  I can't remember where,  it might've been Consumer Reports,  but the best steamer's like $58 by the way.  Excellent, send it my way.  It's not $800.  And it's good, but you gotta be careful  because it will spit.  You don't want spit because then you get wet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My dryer has the steamer setting,  but I've never used it.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What you do is you hang the clothes on a nice hanger  that has the shape you want  and you don't put the steamer on the clothing,  you just go up and down near it.  And it's beautiful.  The wrinkles go, ooh, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  You know where I learned about steamers  is the wardrobe people in television,  they all use steamers.  That's what they use, they don't iron stuff.  Jeff Jarvis, do you have a number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I do indeed.  So it's like, oops, sorry, there we go, there it is.  Google says it removed more than 3.2 billion bad ads  in 2017.  Wow.  That's like double what it had  and it's nearly double the 1.7 billion the year before.  That's 100 bad ads per second.  So I just want for context here.  Wait a minute, per second?  Per second.  So when you talk about scale, this is a problem of scale.  So when Al Franken, who I like,  but when he went after Facebook saying,  Rubles, but the ads are Rubles, you should have seen that.  That imagine that as Bartleby the Scrivener  taking in the ad order and everybody looking at every ad  order says, oh, Rubles, I better look at this.  They don't know.  100 bad ads, bad ads per second.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The scale of this is amazing.  79 million ads for sending users to malware laden sites,  400,000 malware sites, 66 million trick to click ads  and 48 million ads that promoted,  the prompted rather unwanted software installation.  So thank you, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very interesting.  Friends, we've come to the end of this strange meandering  we call this week in Google.  This festival of oddities and weird facts.  I don't know about you, I like it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I know what I should have picked for my thing.  What?  The new Raspberry Pi with power over ethernet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't this nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it is really impressive.  Raspberry Pi 3B, I think it is, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Model B plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  3B plus, just in time for Pi Day.  Still $35.  Unbelievable.  But dual band 802.11 AC Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got a 1.4 gigahertz quad core.  Quad core, 64 bit.  Bit 64 bit.  And it's got power over ethernet  for your smart home projects if you're excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  POE is really a nice thing.  It is, it's very fancy.  Now you don't have to have a power cord.  Just have an ethernet cord that powers it.  Blue Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it's kind of meaningless,  but if you try to buy a computer  with the power of that Raspberry Pi 10 years ago,  what would it cost?  Oh, that's a good question.  That's a really good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  10 years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, pick a date.  Pick a date.  Beyond a certain point, you couldn't have gotten it.  Right.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's amazing.  I will do that math and come up with it for you next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this particular Broadcom processor is an ARM processor.  And so there wasn't even a 64 bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of hard to.  Capable.  So I'm getting a new laptop before next week.  I'll probably have it,  a Windows laptop that runs on a Snapdragon 835.  It runs on an ARM processor, running full Windows 10.  And this is kind of an interesting transition point  where this is an 845 and this nine plus.  These are desktop class processors at this point.  And so that becomes very, very interesting.  I think.  So I won't compare it to an ARM chip from 10 years ago.  I'll compare it to an Intel chip from 10 years ago,  probably through benchmarks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, a quad core 1.4 gigahertz processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't even do that.  I'm going to have to do like Geekbench and see what the Geek...  If somebody will run a Geekbench on the Raspberry Pi model B plus,  and then we can see what the Geekbench of 10 years ago  to get a comparable Geekbench.  I guarantee you it's thousands, Jeff.  Absolutely, guarantee you.  It's a lot of money.  Yeah.  And it would have run hot.  And it would have run hot.  You'd have to have liquid cooling.  This is for very loud fans.  For sure, yeah.  It is really cool.  It's just really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who started Raspberry Pi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, oh, Eben, Eben Upton.  Eben Upton.  Who, Eben Upton, who is a delightful person  who I have interviewed on separate occasions.  And every time I walk away, just like,  oh, you're what humanity should be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've had one triangulation.  He's a young guy, he's 39.  He wanted to duplicate something that many English kids  have grown up with.  Yep, Sinclair.  Well, the BBC computer, the Acorn, the Sinclair, yeah.  These cheap, Clive Sinclair came up with like a $70  cheap computer.  And he realized what a difference that had made in his life.  And so he created this for schools.  He was director of studies in computer science  at St. John's.  And as well as...  Did he make any money from this?  I don't think so.  No, there's a Raspberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He made a career.  It's a foundation.  It's a foundation.  And now they have like certified teachers  and that sort of thing.  And he's, I feel like,  no, I won't say, I don't know.  I don't feel like anything.  But he says that people always bring him Raspberry pies  and he's actually not fond of them  because Raspberry pie is not as delicious  as other kinds of pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he's like...  Blueberry pie would be better.  Oh, blueberry pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, he talks about it getting all gummy  and kind of the seeds and stuff.  And I'm like, I'm with you, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Raspberry should not be made into pie.  It's like my grandmother, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had her carrot cake once when I was five years old  and said it was good.  The rest of her life, I had to eat the damn carrot cake.  By the way, that happens in my house all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Broadcom makes the chip in it,  but he is now a technical director at Broadcom.  And of course, the other tech news,  which we didn't report on,  that President Trump earlier this week nixed the deal.  Broadcom was trying to buy Qualcomm  and he said for national security reasons,  I'm gonna block that, period.  End of story.  What do we think of that?  It's over.  I don't know what to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't see much analysis of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it was a little, before Trump came in,  is it CFIUS, the committee on,  you know who I'm talking about, guys, right?  Don't.  It's the Committee on Foreign Investment.  They've scuttled other deals.  I'm gonna find out who it is.  Committee on Foreign Investment, yes.  So CFIUS, I don't know.  It's CFIUS.  Oh yeah, because it's got US, so CFIUS, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  CFIUS, yeah.  Yeah.  It's a treasury department.  Well, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they look at these types of deals.  They actually, when, oh, was it,  Huawei wanted to buy 3Com?  They nixed that.  So this is what they do.  So they were actually looking at this and they said,  hey, we have a lot of strategic technology.  Do we want this to go to Broadcom?  Which after it's no longer domiciled,  it's no longer domiciled in the US.  What is interesting to me is Trump actually,  before the deal was announced,  met with Hock Tan, the CEO of Broadcom,  back in October of last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To celebrate the fact they were coming back to the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, to celebrate the jobs  and that Broadcom was doing more here.  So I thought this was like,  it felt very much like Trump doesn't,  he's not aware of it,  and then someone puts it across of his desk  and they're like, this is bad.  And he's like, oh, okay, yeah,  I can see how this is bad, check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think he could make a credible case  one way or the other for why he blocked it, to be honest.  But I'm not sure it's a bad idea.  Broadcom is repatriating,  they're coming back to the United States.  But right now they're headquartered in Singapore.  Qualcomm certainly has many patents.  It has all the CDMA patents and many LTE patents.  And so there might be a legitimate  national security concern.  I'm not against the idea, frankly.  Qualcomm is really two companies.  The company that makes money is the patent holding company.  And the company that makes chips does all right,  but it's not nearly the profit center that patents are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They don't make chips, they design chips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Design chips, pardon me, yeah.  Sorry.  Systems on a chip.  No, no, that's a completely apt correction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So. Oh, guys,  we talked about food too much. Go have barbecue.  Because now I'm starving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go have barbecue.  If I lived in Austin, I'd be on my way.  There is a place out a little bit farther  that we always go when we go to Austin.  We didn't go this time.  That has the best Mexican food and it has wonderful tequila.  It's on that avenue, the Going Out of Town.  I can't remember the name of it, but it's really.  I think I know which one you're reading.  Go there now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And have. The Avenue Going Out of Town?  We have many avenues.  There's Congress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's Brazos, there's San Jacinto.  I can't remember. Oh, is it Gueros?  Yes, Gueros.  Isn't it good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all right.  What's your favorite?  My favorite Mexican food in Austin is probably El Chile  because I like their mole.  Oh, we were talking mole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were talking mole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a restaurant called Las Palomas  that's actually weirdly enough in a strip mall in Westlake.  And that is freaking delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're more sophisticated.  But we did have a tradition of going.  It's on South Congress.  We used to have a tradition of going out to Gueros  every time we went to Austin.  Only a 7.7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just Mexican food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll eat any of it.  It's a tourist.  It's a tourist destination.  I'm a tourist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no.  We used to eat there.  It's not tour.  I mean, now because South Congress is kind of crazy.  It is, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
