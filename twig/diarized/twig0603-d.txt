It's so wonderful to have Stacey Higginbotham back from stacey on iot.com.  Oh, she is not named Matthew Ingram.  We'll fix that in post.  We'll fix that in post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like Matthew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I love him. I thought for a minute maybe you got a new job, but no.  She's at stacey on iot.com, does a great iot podcast with Kevin Toffle.  And of course, her newsletters are fantastic.  There she is.  Hi Stace.  Looks pretty sunny and bright up there in the Pacific Northeast, Northwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. It's going to be very sad to stay on as long.  I'm like, oh, it's such a nice day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. We'll make this a really short show just for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Daylight savings time is like my friend.  It's on my side now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the light is back.  Also, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.  Wait a minute.  Hey.  The Lenin town professor for giant plastic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.  Hello, Jeff.  Hello. Hello.  Hello.  Have you had both?  Good to see you back, Stacey.  You deserted us.  We miss Stacey.  Have you had both shots, Jeff, or just the first?  Yes, I have.  Okay.  I just got my first today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had no reaction the day after my first shot, but I and people might think I'm nuts at this.  I had a 13 day delayed reaction.  My arm was not sore.  It was sore 13 days later.  Wow.  Beaver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of want a reaction because I feel like I'm not.  You do because you want to know it works.  Yeah.  If I'm not having if I'm maybe they gave me the placebo.  Maybe there was some leftover placebo.  Also, no, I want a reaction because that means my immune system is saying, hey, fight this guy off.  Ant Proett is also here.  Hands on photography.  Lots of praise for your most recent episode with the lens rental guy.  Mr. Sakala.  John Sakala.  Yeah.  Roger.  Roger.  Roger.  John.  Roger.  Aye aye, sir.  I don't mean the affirmative.  Aye aye, captain.  Roger.  Roger is his name.  I knew that.  Anyway, it's good to have you.  To it.  The TV slash hands on photography.  I don't know what to start with today.  What do you think?  About Google.  Should we?  Well, that's jinx.  And there's a whole section here.  You're all about Google, but it's all boring.  But they announced a new Nest Hub that will watch you sleeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm very curious what you'll think of that.  I have many thoughts.  I did briefings on it and I'll get a review unit when the time comes.  OK.  So you're the right person to ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I saw you tweeted out to the community about this.  And my response, as well as a bunch of other folks, was isn't this already happening?  Whether it's through FitBit or just the other devices that are out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I didn't order one.  You can order it March 25th.  The nice thing about this little Nest Hub, by the way, there's one right next to me when  I'm sleeping.  It doesn't have a camera.  But it does have Soli, right?  And that's how it's going to do the sleep tracking, which is that radar implementation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to use two things.  It'll use Soli and the microphone.  So it'll measure your snores and coughing.  And then it uses Soli to measure your respiration.  Oh, it's not going to analyze all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not going to work.  How about your movement?  Does it measure that too, Stacy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's measuring the movement of your chest respiration.  That's how it's tracking your respiration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you roll around a lot and measure that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You will calibrate.  So when you, and this is important, when you opt in, you'll calibrate it by lying on your  bed and you'll set it there.  It'll be like, turn me this way.  Turn me that way.  All right, lay here.  And it's a one person to one device thing.  So if you sleep with someone, it's only going to track you in your chunk of the bed and  they get no tracking.  They say it works via even when you have a CPAP or if there are animals who sleep on  your bed, all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, but it is a good question, which is why do we need this when we all have 800 other  ways of monitoring our sleep tracking?  You don't have to wear anything.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do like that.  Yeah.  You don't have to wear like a Fitbit.  You don't have to charge it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I have a thing under a sleep score, a paddle.  Yeah.  It's from Serta under my mattress in between my mattress and box spring.  And there's two of them, one from me and one from whoever's sleeping with me at the time.  And that's always my wife.  And, and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a funny story about one of those, but yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then it actually, I don't know how it does it because it's going through the mattress,  but it seems to do very well.  And then just kind of keeping honest, I wear this aura ring, which also does the same thing.  I should wear my Apple watch one night and see if they all confer.  They sync up.  That would be interesting.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  A lot of people don't have.  I think it was sleep score for hands-on wellness.  And it was just a little device that sat off to the side and it uses the different laser  beams firing out.  And it seemed pretty consistent when I tested it up with like the Wythens smart band, some  other smart band.  They did have a watch.  Yeah, but they were, they were both pretty consistent on what their readings were.  And, and I find it more convenient to not have to wear something at night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why I like this.  It's when I got it was 60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody wants to buy a new bed and Apple bought a company called that.  This isn't a bed.  No, no, no, no, this wasn't a bid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is just a plastic thing.  It was about four inches tall plugged in with the USB-C cable.  And it just sat over there at the corner of the bed, just like what Google says they're  doing with Nest.  Same technology.  So this will compete with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he said lasers, radar and lasers are different.  Well, yeah, radar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry, it's not lasers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I was like, lasers would be a little hard to sleep.  Only Elton John sleeps with lasers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what else did they tell you about this Soli based device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will have thread.  And why will it have thread?  Because one day we're going to learn more about Project Chip, but not today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thread is its home automation radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a radio protocol for a home network or smart home devices.  Apple has thread in the new HomePod mini.  You're going to start seeing it in more places.  Yeah.  And if you've got the HomePod minis and the Nanoleaf Essential light bulbs, that thread  connection, it is so fast.  It is a really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one thing a lot of people complain about.  I do.  The lag between saying, hey, hey, Shlomo, turn out the lights and the time it actually turns  the lights is a few seconds.  And I usually hover in the hall because I'm doing this.  I go to bed to make sure that they get turned off before I go to bed.  And I don't like that hovering.  I would like to just.  You could turn off the switch and it would just happen.  I know.  It's not sold on the whole home automation thing.  I'm sorry, Stacey.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's OK.  You know, I'm not 100 percent sold either.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Micah.  They got to do better.  Micah Sargent in the chat room.  He's saying Stacey and I always get jazzed about thread.  So I have on my bedside table.  I have way too many devices.  I have the current Nest Hub.  So I was thinking of replacing it.  But then I realized.  But I also have the sleep tracker.  I have my ring and I have the AirPod mini there too.  I'm sure there's some other devices I've forgotten all right by my head.  So I'm sure they're all.  But you don't want to keep your cell phone in there.  Oh, the cell phones there.  Both of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm wondering how the Ultra Wideband in the HomePod would react with the radar from Soli.  Yeah.  Maybe interference.  I need to check there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What there.  Might be too much stuff in there.  I'm sure it's not good for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is your bedside table metal?  Because I realized my husband's bedside table is metal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's.  Well, yeah.  Metal and wireless frequencies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but he's a higher up than the table is.  It just means that if you were under the table that wouldn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yes.  But it's, you know, like it's just another thing you got to think about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I, you know, I'm glad I don't have a metal mattress because otherwise the sleep  tracker wouldn't work either.  So actually there probably is metal in the mattress.  There's springs, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I don't know.  Is it a Tempur-Pedic or is it a spring?  Well, old fashioned nuts.  Or a spring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Probably not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you're on Casper.  Casper has springs.  The one we, I think the one we have has springs.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Only one of their mattresses.  It's the mattress for fat boys because the, like the other mattresses, like the rubber,  the foam ones, when you get out of bed, you, the bed gets out of you.  It rolls you out because as soon as you get close to the edge, it collapses and you go  wah!  Right.  So the one we have has an edge so that I can get out of bed.  Otherwise I lie there on my back like a turtle going, get me honey, get me out of bed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's...  Did it come in the little box like the other mattress or did it come in a big box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no, it comes in a box.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I actually saw a story about, about this, of course, that used the headline surveillance.  Well, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's surveilling your sleeping.  All trackers are surveilling you.  You're asking it to, right?  Isn't that his job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  It is.  Well, so there...  Well, okay, no.  Let's, let's talk about this like rational people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least it doesn't have a camera.  Google, it doesn't have a camera.  Although I would say, I mean, radar does track your motion.  So if you think about radar, you could totally tell what someone's doing.  Plus for sleep tracking, it's going to be listening for snoring and things like that.  So all the data is processed locally on the device.  You have to opt in.  There is a visual indicator when that system is turned on and you can delete things verbally  and in the app.  So you can be like, delete last night's sleep.  So those are, that's what Google's done.  But what I will say is saying that you should feel comfortable because there's not a camera  in there is a little bit of a, it's not a red herring.  What is it?  It's just like a diversion in the sense that radar is very, could be very effective at  telling you exactly what, not exactly, actually, yeah, exactly what you're doing.  It's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think what people are worried about with the camera is that it's going to see  you naked or something.  Radar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it can see the outline of you and what you're doing.  Oh.  And yeah.  Never mind.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that, what are you going to do?  I mean, I don't know what people, I don't honestly know why people are worried about  a camera in the bedroom.  Well, and again, all that data, just the results are sent to the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of that data is processed on the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll give you something to worry about.  Oh, it's processed on the device.  What gets sent to the cloud?  Anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The results.  Your REM sleep was this.  You slept this long.  Good.  So it's doing it all in the same room.  You probably were like a train.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing they could do this for a hundred bucks.  And by the way, the screen is great.  I really like having a Nest Hub in the bedroom.  I can watch, you can actually, I could say, because I have YouTube TV, I could say let's  watch CNN and it's got a little screen on my bedside table or wherever it is.  I could sit on the bedside table or watch the ballgame when the football games were  on.  I would have that going.  That's kind of nice.  And music and I mean, I really like the Nest Hub.  It's kind of amazing what they could do for a hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the fear of the camera, I think, is pictures.  Well, it's it's former New Yorker writer.  And so the other the other morning I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  It's former New Yorker writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's his name?  Who got in trouble for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Jeffrey Tubin.  Yeah.  That wouldn't be so well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the other day I was I was watching an Australian academic conference and it was  on Zoom and I was in bed because it was Australian time.  So as soon as I woke up, I turn it on, but I was in bed and I was paranoid.  My life, I was paranoid about making sure the camera was off.  Yeah.  Right.  I understand that.  I understand.  So it's more about accidents, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I'm not crazy about a sleep tracker that uses my noises to like, I mean, I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  my mouth noise as long as it doesn't play it back to you.  Well, I I've been no, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to get your mind out of the gutter.  I tape my mouth shut.  So I don't I'm giving you a very weird picture.  I'm giving you a very weird picture of my bedtime habits.  No, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wrong time to take a drink of water.  So I read this book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good book.  You probably read it, Stacey, because you're up on all this stuff called Breath, right?  By James Nestor.  Have you read that yet?  It's all the rage.  Everybody's talking about it.  It's how we don't breathe right.  And mostly you should never breathe through your mouth.  And one of the things he recommends, because when you're asleep, you can't your mouth fall.  You breathe through your mouth.  One of the things he recommends is you take a little bit of 3M surgical micropore surgical tape and you just put it right here and your mouth closed.  And we ask you to do that certain times on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  During the Facebook segment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't bring up this is a chilling effect because I don't bring up Facebook on this show anymore.  Just don't call me the devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all. That's all.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so you tape your mouth shut and you're worried because it sounds weird when you're snoring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, there are no sounds anymore.  Lisa says it's like there's nobody in bed with her anymore.  She's like sleeping with a mime.  I don't know what the hell sounds I was making.  But it silences all that.  And you just breathe through the whole point really is that you breathe through your nose.  Which you should be doing all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm like even when I'm sleeping, I'm like, so my mouth is shut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I used to have a mouth guard.  You have a guard?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah, yeah. Your mouth bar is good.  You can do this with a mouth guard.  That way you'll neither grind nor snore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exciting.  I'll check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll try it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey chat room, this is what you talk about when you get old.  You got a gaffer's tape for work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, well he said painter's tape is okay.  There are people who do it with duct tape.  I think that's too sticky.  He recommends 3M.  I have an extra roll.  I bought a dozen.  I'll bring it in.  He recommends 3M micro pore surgical tape.  Nestor, the guy who wrote this book, if you haven't read Breath,  it's not breath, it's breath.  If you've not read Breath, I highly recommend it.  What does he say if you have a beard or a mustache?  Well, don't do it.  You don't have to do this.  That's not the whole point of the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know my problem is my CPAP.  This will work with the CPAP by the way, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh it will.  The Google thing.  I see it, Breath, the new science of a lost art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a very good book.  I highly recommend it, Stacey.  It's enjoyable, it's fun, and you'll learn how to breathe properly,  which apparently we don't know how to do.  We breathe through our mouths.  Is it diaphragm breathing?  It's because we eat too much soft food nowadays.  Did you know this from the book?  That ancient skulls, perfect teeth, perfect sinuses,  they don't have any of the issues,  mouth, tooth crowding or anything, because of the diet, they think.  But now in the modern soft food diet, we all need orthodontia.  Oh my God, soft foods, what are they talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I ate a salad last night, it took me like 30 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Compared with what the crow magnate.  A salad is soft food.  Are they grinding rocks?  Yeah, they're thawing on bones.  Bison legs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This course looks delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They may have died at the age of 30, but they had perfect teeth.  That's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, I've got a question for you.  Yes sir.  Could this device sense cardiac arrest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Theoretically, if you stopped breathing, yes.  I mean, it's not tracking your heart rate.  But again, all of this, you train it, right?  So this is just the radar.  So if you trained it to look for cardiac arrest, maybe?  But I don't know.  That would be interesting if it called off for 9-1-1.  Google's not advertising this for SIDS or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's interesting too.  I mean, it would probably come in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also don't think you want an automated device that says he's not breathing and calls 9-1-1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'd rather that be the alternative.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What if it just did a siren to wake you up?  I mean, I have devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, we all have devices we wear to bed.  I wear this ring to bed.  It would know if my heart stopped.  But I don't think that they've said it.  I know they haven't set it up to call 9-1-1.  Well, for my wondering, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Oh, because you have to be really sure.  Yeah, you don't want false heart attack alarms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That really is not good.  I wear the pulse oximeter every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, so you know where your blood oxygen is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you, I mean, are you worried about your blood oxygen level?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, if you're on a CPAP, yes.  Okay, no, I don't know.  I wanted to track it.  I wanted the data to track.  You should read Breast 2, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you'd enjoy this book as well, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I noticed that you told Stacey to stay healthy and read the book, but you didn't tell me.  No, no, you would love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I figured you'd listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This blurb is hilarious.  If you breathe, you need this book.  So there you go.  Okay.  Anybody here not breathing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how you mark it.  It's really good. I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was our first line for Epicurious for people who eat.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Hey, Epicurious is not Bon Appetit.  Yes, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was both Bon Appetit and gourmet.  I was there at the start of it.  So are you following this whole Reply All?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not lately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, so fill us in, boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a big story in the Sunday Times.  Reply All, which is a technology podcast from Gimlet Media, except it's really more about,  they call it a podcast about the internet, sort of, but it's really more about, it's a lifestyle thing.  But they were doing an expose on the racism and sexism, but mostly racism at Epicurious, I guess.  Bon App.  Or is it Bon Appetit?  Well, Bon App, I think it was Repi Bon App.  Because it was all white male editors and by-lined writers, but all the people doing all the cooking and the hard work were people of color.  And they were too...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a hilarious video of a woman who everybody asked every question of, and they never gave her any credit and didn't pay her well.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So that was a bit of a scandal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Reply All is planning a four-part expose of this.  And they didn't make it to the third part.  And the two people who were running it got left, apparently.  And it's...  So if you listen to the most recent Reply All, there's no show.  He just says, hey, I got to apologize.  We've decided not to continue the Test Kitchen series we're doing because, as it turned out,  It turned out Shruti Pinnamamene, who was the host, and PJ Vogt, who was her editor, it triggered a reckoning of their own.  But it was unclear exactly what was going on.  But on Twitter, there were some threads.  Apparently, Ms. Pinnamamene and Mr. Vogt had contributed to a toxic dynamic at Gimlet.  Weirdly, they'd both been critical of unionization efforts.  Like, I think that's allowed.  I think that's kind of a...  Like, legally.  Legally, a free speech thing.  You don't have to be pro-union.  Many people of color felt it was their last chance at creating an environment within Gimlet where they could succeed.  It's one of those things where it looked like they were being honest and forthright, but all it did was it was very unclear and muddy.  And I thought maybe, Jeff, because it's a media story more than anything else.  I didn't follow that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like layers of an onion.  Yeah.  I followed the Bon App closely, but I didn't follow the Reply All.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And of course, I follow it because I'm very aware of Gimlet, which is a very successful podcast network.  Alex Blumberg was at This American Life and created Planet Money.  Somebody said in a recent interview, this all stems from choices made by Alex Blumberg and Matt Lieber, who was a former radio producer and management consultant.  I'm quoting The Times.  Now, former employees of Gimlet and subject to the podcast said they regard the test kitchen as a wasted opportunity to share a sweeping, detailed portrait of racism in the American workplace.  By the way, this is from a section of The New York Times I never thought I'd see called The State of Podcasting.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they just have a bunch of stories and they're theming them under different things.  They've got several kind of broad.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Podcasting, a booming industry, the medium for quarantine, the voices of resistance, growing up on mic and podcast voice.  That's the those are the different pieces.  Anyway, I don't know.  Never mind.  I'm sorry I brought it up.  I thought just because maybe you might because of Epicurious and because of podcasting.  Podcasting is booming.  Will Hollywood help or hurt its future?  I feel like such a bystander.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  Hello.  Hello.  I was there at the beginning.  Hello.  I want to I'm one of the OGs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is how podcasting is that Orville Wright felt when he when he was watching Man Walk on the Moon or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  Online 121 if you want it.  Sure.  Why not?  All kinds of podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll take my mouth and you take over.  Go ahead.  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The question is, is it?  It's not in a green box.  So I'm not sure whether we're allowed to talk about the state of podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  State of podcast listening for 2021.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does the green box mean?  Is that like we must?  I already asked Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I asked Jason because I wasn't getting all the top stories in.  Oh, OK.  No.  The stories that he felt like we really should do with a green box.  And I was supposed to do that too.  But I was judgment is very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My guess is the right ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think actually I didn't I didn't see this.  Tom Webster is at Edison Research.  He's great.  I've seen him speak many times.  We're big fans.  And Edison is probably the only company that does a lot of research on what people are doing in podcasting.  I've seen him do this presentation before.  Yeah.  So just some new numbers on it if you care.  The percentage of Americans 12 plus who say they've ever listened to a podcast.  Wow.  Fifty seven percent.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You guys.  That's a big jump.  Yeah.  That's a lot of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about how, Leo?  I wonder what the percentage is who listens to a netcast.  None.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zero.  Or who have ever heard of twit.  Zero.  No.  Monthly podcast listening.  One hundred sixteen million people listen to a podcast in the past month.  That's up from what I don't I can't read this.  I don't understand.  I can't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't read this.  But I but does this address the the notion that people are actually creating more podcasts now?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I remember Tom talking about that a couple of years ago and I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's something like seven million new podcasts emerge every week.  And of which it's so easy to five hundred are still around in the second week.  Yeah.  It's something it's something like that.  I don't remember the exact numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you go down to the bigger chart to the infographic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, this is a good chart.  This infographic.  Forty one percent of Americans listen to a podcast in the last month.  Twenty eight percent in the last week.  Fifty six percent of the younger folk those age 12 to 34 are monthly podcast listeners in the last week.  U.S. weekly podcast listeners averaged eight episodes and five point one shows.  It's pretty amazing.  His stuff has been most useful for me to understand the difference between people who are new to podcasting who listen in a very different way than people who are longtime listeners.  Most of our audience who've been listening for years for instance.  What's the difference?  The vast majority of newer people listen on a phone and they listen to a stream.  They don't download the show.  They just listen to a stream.  I am trying to remember the details of this of the piece, but I also think I remember him saying they are less loyal.  They don't they don't listen to every episode of a show.  They open their podcast client and they and they just pick kind of all through.  Yeah, they do discover and they listen to the episode here.  Episode their episode here.  Episode there.  But I thought the thing that's really interesting, by the way, Apple has kind of backed this up.  Apple in the new version of iOS, which comes out any day now, probably sometime this month, will stop saying subscribe to a podcast.  And I think this is going to become universal.  Instead, they'll say follow.  But the interesting difference is subscribe.  In many cases would download the episodes to your phone.  Follow will not follow.  And that is a reflection of the fact that most people stream.  They don't write.  That's how we all do it now.  We don't download our shows and then have them on our device.  Ubiquitous high speed Internet and and and fractally the fact that data doesn't cost anything anymore for most people means that they just you listen to whatever the same thing with your music.  You don't download your music ahead of time anymore.  You just write.  How does it notify you?  How does what notify you?  No, they don't do that.  Notify you of what I when I follow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How does it tell me?  Oh, Leo has a new.  That's all it will tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll give you an OK.  Yeah, that's all.  It won't download it.  Yeah, right.  Got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's going to change our streaming is at least you get more data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not really.  No, no.  It looks just like a download to us.  The difference, though, and it's probably OK, but the difference is if people subscribe and they're automatically downloading, we get higher download numbers.  Right.  Just listen.  They just download when they listen.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a lot of hits on the web.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, yeah, I miss those innocent days.  Back to Google Alphabet and their moon shots.  The X projects had something and I thought Stacey might know a little bit about this called Maya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this was the the tri quarter.  Yeah, they were a quarter.  Yeah, sorry.  Not the thing.  Yeah.  Yeah, I vaguely remember this.  So they killed it, though, right?  Yeah.  It's impossible to put that many sensors into something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is the story from nine to five Google.  It was canceled.  It was intended to analyze skin health with light waves.  And I thought it was kind of related to the earlier solely story when they announced it back in 2019.  They said skin health can tell us a lot about our overall health.  For example, Jeff, jaundice is an early sign of liver stress.  I'm pink, not yellow.  Oh, no.  You're pink, not yellow.  You're right, of course.  While the oxygen level of our skin can be an indicator of heart health.  Pink, not yellow.  Today, the way we learn more about our skin and health is with biopsies,  which obviously are invasive and require expert intervention and are often done reactively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not feeling very well suddenly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're pink.  Oh, now he's yellow.  I'm yellow now.  Now he's yellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, I'm getting more and more yellow.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is another moonshot like Project Loon that's been canceled and in this case because  it was too broad and the success was hard to define.  For their moonshot to work, the Maya team, Google says, had to tackle several high risk.  I'm sorry, Alphabet says, high risk, interconnected, hard to know where to start dimensions to  the problem.  So they're going to have to do a lot of work in different areas before they could even  get a sense of when and whether they were making progress.  And so they decided to end the project.  This is too hard.  We quit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also sounds like Ruth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that and if it's, I mean, if you think about a device like this, who is going to  buy it?  How like it is kind of a broad device.  If you think about like, oh, this measures your health.  What's it going to tell you that you're unhealthy?  Do you call your doctor?  Does it give you an indicator?  I mean, like there's a lot of factors with something like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think in a way what they're really admitting is that the premise was flawed.  You know, they had this science fiction idea that, oh, we just take a picture of your skin  and we'll know exactly what's going on.  And Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a more typical Google ADD at the management level.  More of that.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're right.  Although it's inevitable with X projects, these moon shots, most of them don't make  it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Can I just go back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But at least have some sort of action plan or a like a, what is it?  Forecasting where you don't just really benchmark.  You don't really just willy nilly throw stuff up to the wall to see if it sticks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course you do.  But maybe they did.  Maybe they had a little.  Of course you do.  The error is announcing it ahead of time.  No, the error is just telling us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't tell them.  I don't think so.  What were we talking about?  That's what a moon shot is.  It's like, hey, we're going to throw this spaghetti at the wall, see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you're worried about how people are going to react when you cancel it, then  you don't tell them.  But you at least had a thought process about it.  Well, they had a thought.  I'm sure they had a thought.  I'm sure there was a proposal.  How long ago was this announced recently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Two years ago.  See, I envision I envision there's in Mountain View, there's Mount Porat and every month  that comes time on the 15th of the month, you have to find the Virgin to sacrifice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was never a product.  So that's the thing.  I know.  I think you got to have two buckets for this.  Products that get canceled.  I understand because you're using it or somebody's using it and blah, blah.  This was never a product.  They announced something they were going to try.  Didn't work.  So they didn't stop doing it.  That's called research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're right.  We shouldn't.  But sometimes there are products I wish did work.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I won't agree 100%.  They kill products too readily.  Go ahead, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember back Project Soli.  Now this wasn't under moonshot.  This was an ATEP project.  But in 2015 is when they actually introduced Soli.  Project Tango.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Project Tango first, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it was called Soli from the get go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  Because Tango was similar.  They did have a Tango.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  But yeah, they were like, yeah, we'll see what happens with it.  Oh, Tango was AR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Soli was the other way.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Soli and Jacquard were at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why does this sound similar to the latest camera app update where it's sensing what's  going on with your body just from taking a picture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that was, yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what the camera app update is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We talked about it like, oh, you haven't been here.  There's a new recent change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't been here.  It was one of the Google feature dumps.  They do those pixel feature drops.  Pixel line.  And one of the, what is that?  What did you see on my, did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I saw that.  The green.  What the hell was that?  Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's the dock.  No, no, there were some dots.  There were some dots.  Anyway.  Oh, that's the laser, not lasers.  I thought it might be the lidar.  It's the ghost of the machine.  That happens with the camera.  It's the sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the sensors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were going to, they've added to this feature where you can hold it in front of  you.  It'll see how you're breathing.  Actually, it does sound very similar.  It probably is using Soli, which is on the Pixel, there it is again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's on the floor and on the side.  Yeah, that's your sensor.  That's your motion sensor.  Yeah, this is a four.  So four does have Soli on it.  But again, if this is something we're already seeing in this new pixel feature drop, that's  why I say it sounds like a little bit of ADD.  One part of them saying, okay, all right, let's roll this out.  And another part says, I'll scrap it.  And where's the organization here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Right.  This, you could get a heart rate by putting your finger on the camera.  Using the front facing camera, it would measure your overall respiratory rate by detecting  small chest movements as you breathe.  I think that was the March Pixel feature drop.  I think it's a little different because the one they just canceled looked at skin, was  looking at your skin tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maya looked at, yeah, that was many different wavelengths of light.  So it's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Similar but different.  Similar but different.  This is another problem with Google, which is there are many, it's big, it's alphabet,  it's huge.  There's all sorts of stuff they're doing.  Some of it overlaps.  This is another problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another problem.  They're big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it is, don't you think it's hard to manage such big companies and see  them as focused?  For some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, some of them are really good at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You gotta think, Google's gotta throw a lot of spaghetti at the walls because advertising  at a great...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Google must face a suit over snooping in the incognito browser.  It's funny, I've seen people respond both ways.  This is Lucy Coe, US District Judge in San Jose, said, the court concludes Google did  not notify users that Google engages in data collection when the user's in private browsing  mode, Google's incognito mode.  But does anybody have Chrome in front of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I do.  I'm in incognito mode and the spy with the hat and the glasses comes up, but I want somebody  to read what it says because this is what Google tells you when you go into incognito  mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now you can browse privately and other people who use this device won't see your activity.  However, downloads and bookmarks will be saved.  Chrome won't save the following information.  Your activity might still be visible, your browsing history, cookies and site data, information  entered in forms, so on and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your activity might still be visible to websites you visit, your employer or school, your internet  service provider.  So this is every single time you go to incognito mode, that pops up.  To me, that's Google telling you.  It's not incognito, but they didn't have this forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They used it when you went to incognito.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've had it for a long, long, long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm trying.  It's been so long since I've opened an incognito.  Well, anyway, that's the dispute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The judge is saying literally, Google did not notify users that Google engages in data  collection when the user is in private browsing mode.  And I've seen a lot of people say, yeah, it doesn't say we.  Because your internet service provider, your school, your employer, other websites, it  doesn't say we.  Okay, maybe.  Anyway, the class action lawsuit goes ahead.  It'll be interesting.  I've seen a number of people in public forums like Reddit and on Twitter say, what do you  mean they didn't tell you?  It's right there in the thing that pops up every single time.  So anyway, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have to use Google incognito every day because I have my two Google accounts and they don't  live happily together in the same browser.  My product complaint.  So my school is incognito and my buzz machine is me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's going to say, and maybe this is what the jury would have to decide in the lawsuit,  but Google's going to say, we tell you that the only thing you're hiding is from other  people using this browser.  That's the only place.  It says that right there.  But I do agree that it doesn't say specifically.  By the way, Google is going to continue to collect all the data that's always collected,  but they kind of imply that because everybody else is.  How smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess this is going to be incognito mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is, yeah, that's the big mistake is incognito mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like Tesla's autopilot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't name it incognito if you're not.  It's going to come down to maybe this is going to be a jury decision on how smart users are,  how much you can expect from users.  And Google always errs on this because, and in fact, most tech companies, but Google especially,  because they're smart and they're engineers.  And they just go, yeah, well, could you know any idiot?  Any idiot would know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is not like this is not like five pages of documents.  It is a simple thing we just read.  It's very clear.  Yeah, it's here's here's in Google Chrome help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This says how Google Chrome incognito keeps your browsing private.  One sentence incognito mode can help keep your browsing private from other people who  use your device.  That's it.  That's pretty clear.  Done.  And then it has a lot more if you want to know more.  But but you're right incognito kind of implies you're walking through the world without, you  know, Apple calls it private browsing, right?  It's not that Apple does the same thing.  It's not that private.  There's a new private window from Firefox.  You're in a private window.  Firefox clears your search and browsing history when you quit the app or close all private  browsing tabs and windows.  By the way, that's exactly what Chrome does.  While this doesn't make you anonymous to websites or your Internet service provider, it makes  it easier to keep what you do online private from anyone else who uses this computer.  And then look at this.  Firefox is a link.  Myths about private browsing.  Myth one.  Private browsing makes you anonymous on the Internet.  Myth two.  Private browsing removes all traces of your browsing activity from your computer.  Myth three.  Private browsing doesn't display any browsing history.  Myth four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Brave browser has a pretty similar preamble as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they can't anonymize you without a VPN or some other service to your ISP or websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brave actually has Tor built in for that very reason, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have a private session and they also have a private session with Tor.  With Tor.  In quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's heavy duty private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That feels like I could take over a country using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's do it, Stacey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you wanted to take over a country, which country would you take over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, a good one.  Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay.  You're going to have to fight me, Higginbotham.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be a lot easier to take over Canada than let's say Russia.  So I'd go for it.  Well, Russia's huge.  True.  I mean, do you really want to hold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, Canada's also huge.  Canada's huge, but...  Now that I think about it.  Yeah, well.  Very.  Canada's like Australia of the north.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just all down here.  All along the coast.  The border.  It's just the border.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go to Texas.  I know you just got out of there, but let's go back.  This is another suit about Chrome's privacy sandbox.  Google antitrust suit takes aim at Chrome's privacy sandbox.  Texas prosecutors say Google's trying to hide its true intentions behind a pretext of privacy.  Is this about Google's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I couldn't understand if they're pissed because Google's changing the way they're doing something  or if they're mad about the flock effort or what?  What is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want to be mad at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everybody's just mad at Google.  It's popular now to be mad at Google.  It is, absolutely.  15 state attorneys general led by Texas.  December, it's one of three ongoing antitrust cases against Google, including a Colorado  case and the Department of Justice's federal case.  The updated complaint states that privacy sandbox, a Google tool that's supposed to  replace invasive third party tracking cookies with a more limited...  So this is about flock with a more limited system.  This is flock.  Okay.  Designed by Google.  Here's what the complaint says.  Google's new scheme, flock, which is the federated learning of cohorts, federated something of  cohorts.  Google's new scheme is the AG's right, in essence, to wall off the entire portion of  the internet that consumers access through Chrome.  Blocking cookies might broadly be a good thing.  Other browsers have already done it, but Chrome dominates the browser market and it's part  of a much larger Google product suite.  The suit argues that Google's plans would require advertisers to use it as a middleman  so that it's first party, right?  And would make Google's advertising system far more attractive.  That's kind of what we've insinuated or I've insinuated over the last few weeks about flock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a decent case, even though Paxton is bringing it.  Grrr.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's also a can't win case.  You must get rid of cookies.  Oh, OK.  And by the way, third party tracking is awful.  Oh, OK.  Well, no, what they're saying here is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We thought it'd be a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, what they're saying is Google is...  What's not misinterpreting?  What is it saying?  Misleading.  It's misleading people about what it's doing.  And in effect, it's putting itself in a middleman position.  And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's response is, Attorney General Paxton's latest claims mischaracterize many aspects  of our business, including the steps we're taking with the Privacy Sandbox Initiative  to protect people's privacy as they browse the web.  These efforts have been welcomed by privacy advocates.  No one I know.  EFF wrote a scathing article about the flock.  Oh, yeah.  Advertisers or our own rivals.  Ah, as a step forward in preserving user privacy and protecting free content, we will strongly  defend ourselves from A.G. Paxton's baseless claim in court.  So there you go.  There's another one.  It's tough to be a massive multinational tech agglomerate these days.  Life is hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, I pity them as they...  What are their stock prices right now?  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We were talking during Windows Weekly about Microsoft President Brad Smith's, we talked  about last week too on this show, testimony in Congress saying that Australia should go  after Google over this snippet thing.  In fact, so should everybody else, including I think his intent was the U.S. Congress,  to which Google responded.  It was corporate, what do they say, blatant corporate anti-competitive behavior.  They feel like Microsoft's piling on.  I kind of honestly defended Google in that case, at least earlier today on Windows Weekly.  I do feel like it's Microsoft which should be defending big tech, the Internet against  Rupert Murdoch of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They got into bed with Murdoch in this case.  I talked to a council on that committee and a staffer on that committee and a reporter  about it recently.  Brad Smith is there trying to claim credit for bringing Google to the table because he  threatened that Bing would stay in Australia and not just brought Google to their knees.  You can thank us for Google's money.  Jesus Christ, Eddie Haskell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's council called Microsoft's support for the Australian law naked corporate opportunism.  That was the phrase I was looking for.  So right.  I read the testimony before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft is admitted as much if you remember what Brad Smith said about lobbyists.  Yeah, that's what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, surprise surprise, US lawmakers propose Australia style bill for media tech negotiations.  This is by the way a nonpartisan bill, the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act  of 2021.  David Cicilline of Rhode Island, Democrat of Rhode Island introduced the proposal.  This bill will give hardworking local reporters and publishers the helping hand they need  so they can continue to do their important work.  Co-signers include Republican Ken Buck in the House and Mark DeSoliner in the House,  Amy Klobuchar in the Senate and John Kennedy.  Boy, talk about strange bedfellows.  John Kennedy, Amy Klobuchar.  All co-sponsors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've read the law, the bill, and it drives me nuts in all kinds of ways.  It defines a news content creator.  If they can band together and get an exception to antitrust and can then as a powerful force  negotiate against these big evil platforms, well, who would that be?  Well, it's written by the trade association that is controlled by newspapers owned by  hedge funds.  It is meant for the big old, it's just like Australia, a few big old companies versus  big new tech platforms.  So it requires you have a dedicated professional editorial staff that creates and distributes  original news and related content at least a weekly basis.  So all these guys on Substack, screw you.  All these people start in these amazing blogs and new sites to hell with you.  It has to be marketed through subscriptions, advertising, and sponsorship.  So what about public radio?  What about the 19th?  What about other things?  It has to have at least 25% current news.  That's an old postal regulation.  That's how old fashioned they are.  And then who's this against?  It is the online content distributor is defined as any site that does these things that has  no fewer than one billion monthly active users.  So it's Titan V old Titan V new Titan.  That's all this is.  And it is it is anti-competitive as hell because new startups to compete with all these old  fart newspapers that have screwed up the last four decades won't be able to get any of this.  And this is their effort of protectionism.  So that's what I screamed about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you disagree with Microsoft President Brad Smith, who said the problems that beset journalism  today, I don't know how he became an expert on this, but he is the problems that beset  journalism today are caused in part by a fundamental lack of competition in the search and ad tech  markets that are controlled by Google.  You disagree that that's that's not the problem that besets journalism today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It might be the problem that besets Microsoft's Bing today.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I got called by a staffer to perhaps testify, but what are going to happen?  So I did submit a statement to the subcommittee.  It was actually in the record.  I saw that.  I've never done that before.  It's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You posted on Medium as well, so people can this or on your blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I put it on my blog so you wouldn't complain about Medium.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he didn't buy his subscription to Medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did, but I'm glad that Jeff is supporting small local publishers like Buzz Machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, that's right.  We'll get nothing out of this.  So I go through all the international regulations not working, but then I say to grant newspaper  owners an exemption from antitrust would be profoundly anti-competitive for it would  as in Australia entrench the interest of the largest companies on both sides of the table,  media and technology.  Let me play devil's advocate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you never do that.  So I'm guessing that the intent, I mean, it sounds like the intent to create this this  48 months carve out because otherwise it would be collusion.  It would be by the way, this is funny because the sponsor of this bill is the head of the  House Antitrust Committee.  Exactly.  But normally, this would be collusion and trust activity is for the newspapers to all  get together and and join as a force to do collective bargaining with Google and Facebook  over this.  You're saying it favors the big ones, but doesn't this also give our little Petaluma  Argus Courier and other small, maybe even substack and medium a seat at the table too?  That's that's the point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A not really, because it still requires they have, I think, was it minimum staff in there?  So they can't be too small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they can't be too small.  I couldn't.  I couldn't go in and say, well, I'm a journalist.  I'd like to join the negotiations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the problem is this bill was written, as one reporter told me directly, it was written  by David Chauvern, who's the head of the Trade Association, formerly known as the Newspaper  Association, but they realized newspapers have cooties.  They renamed it NLA.  I think it's the one.  No, this is NLA.  Is this NLA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But anyway, Trade Association representatives.  Trade Association, right.  And they're mostly the big boys.  NewsBD Alliance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  NMA.  NewsBD Alliance.  Sorry.  And so it limits.  The other thing is to negotiate what, by the way?  A deal.  Just as.  But what does a deal mean?  Right.  So Google saying will and Facebook are both saying we have products where we will license  news and we're doing that and we'll negotiate with you.  And there it is.  They're already saying that.  So what is it that they really want?  The other thing that the reporter I was talking to was speculating about is it says something  about how they can negotiate.  The negotiations are not limited to price.  Price for what it doesn't say.  And then directly relate to quality, accuracy, attribution or branding and the interoperability  of news.  What I interpret that is, is favor us, not other people.  Favor my members and not other people.  This is anti-competitive as hell.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't, I mean, it doesn't prescribe any solution, right?  They're just saying, look, we're going to let you collude for four years.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And what I was also told in Australia was that there the government was actively negotiating,  which is just appalling.  Right.  It shouldn't be the government's part.  No, but that's what's kind of happening here.  Is it at some point the government's going to say, OK, that's enough.  That's enough.  OK, you got you got enough.  You're high.  Now go home.  Right.  Yeah.  It's my industry.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can't stand them.  Let's take a little break.  We have other things to talk about.  I'm going to raise Jeff's blood pressure by bringing up Facebook in a second.  But first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just don't just don't call me evil.  That's all I ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I never show me the tape.  Why did I say you're evil?  Facebook's evil.  I'm not saying Jeff Jarvis is evil unless you're.  Are you Facebook?  No, no, certainly not.  I do think Facebook's kind of evil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if I say anything in defense of the Internet, then you accuse me of being no league with

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the devil.  I'm in I'm in favor of the Internet.  I don't think Facebook's good for the Internet.  Go to your break.  I'm defending the Internet as as we used to know it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh.  Who's our advertiser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you, sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  3M micro pore surgical tape.  If you've ever wanted to shut Leo up.  A little piece, a little pinch between the cheek and gum.  A little dabble, do ya?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does your dear wife ever threaten you with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she thinks I'm weird.  Well, she she thinks I'm so weird to do this.  I've only done it for three nights, but it's it's you know, at first I thought, oh, I'll  never be able to do this.  I'll be tearing it off or I'll in my sleep all unconsciously.  No, I wake feeling better than ever rested.  My allergies are gone.  My sinuses are clear.  I look forward to taping up my mouth every night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to try it, but I will say I don't breathe through my mouth.  And so this whole book looks silly to me.  I'm reading all the reviews.  You shouldn't breathe through your mouth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good. You're healthy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had to. I've got a deviated septum.  Yes. And he says that's a result of soft food.  Oh, come on.  The caveman did not have C.  It was the boxing match I got in.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he talks about deviate.  Deviated are very common.  Deviated septums where your septum is like this instead of like a like that and like a triangle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is another attack on my catch.  I appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by actually by a very interesting company for the company for our times.  Nareva.  As we think about heading back to the office, you know, you know, it's not going to be the same.  Distance.  It can have big implications for meeting room audio.  It can require that you separate people socially distanced.  Maybe you have a limited number of people in the room.  All kinds of things.  Nevertheless, the most important factor is you got to have good mic coverage even if people are separated in a meeting room.  How do you do that?  Beamforming systems.  Well, they got to be, you know, calibrated and adjusted by expensive technicians and aimed and recalibrated.  Even then, once you get it set up, nobody can move.  This is like there's a dot on this on the table.  That's where you have to sit.  Tabletop systems.  Yeah, but then you need more mics and you're going to have to sanitize in between meetings.  In both cases, participants are going to have to change their behavior like sitting in predetermined spots and where they face and all of that.  That's why Nureva is so cool.  Most conventional audio systems don't give you the flexibility you need to accommodate the modern workspace.  But what if there were a better way to get clear, reliable audio and still let your team act naturally and still feel safe?  That's Nureva.  It's designed for distancing.  In fact, one analyst called Nureva Audio, the first socially distanced mic system, and you don't need a technician.  You don't need to calibrate it.  It's really easy.  You can install every microphone and speaker bar on the wall yourself.  It's really it's basically computational audio.  Nureva's patented.  They have four patents on this microphone mist technology fills the room with thousands of virtual microphones.  So no matter who's in the room, no matter how they're distanced, no matter where they're facing, they all come in crystal clear.  It's brilliant.  It adapts to any room configuration and automatically readdaps as you move things around as people move around as things change.  Nureva and you are EVA audio products have won numerous awards, including the top new technology award at ISE 2020.  That was for their HDL 200 system.  But no matter the size of your room, they have a full line of systems for small, medium and large spaces.  HubSpot uses the next step up the HDL 300.  Jimmy Yan, who's their principal collaboration engineer at HubSpot said we were so impressed with the sound quality, the ease of a stall, the ease of use of the HDL 300.  It was just a no brainer for us to adopt it.  It's kind of cool.  It's really a cool technology.  Microphone mist means everybody sounds good is on mic.  You can understand them.  It really will transform.  And by the way, you know what?  We were talking the other day on one of the shows about Zoom fatigue.  One of the real issues with the fatigue is just bad audio quality.  Nureva solves that.  You can hear what's going on.  To learn more about how Nureva audio is the simple, cost effective way to let your teams distance in meetings and still act and converse naturally, visit Nureva.  N-U-R-E-V-A. Nureva.com slash twit.  Nureva.com slash twit.  What a clever idea.  Solves meeting room audio.  Nureva is designed for distancing.  We thank them so much for supporting this week.  Google.  See Facebook.  I think Facebook.  What do you think of Campbell Brown?  Jeff, do you like her?  Do you think she's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's yeah.  I mean, the full time for full disclosure is that Facebook has funded activities at my school around quality and news.  And that came from Campbell Brown's budget.  I'm paid nothing personally by any of the platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She was a network news correspondent, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And people I'll be blunt when she took she got that job.  People thought a TV person.  What?  But but she is adept at dealing with internal and external politics in this very touchy area.  And she has fought for journalism and news inside Facebook.  So I've come to respect what she does there.  She's global news partnerships at Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And she was she was Campbell Brown who made the announcement this week as writers.  It actually was yesterday as writers, experts and journalists publish.  I'm reading from her post.  Publish more of the work independently.  We're working.  We Facebook are working to better support these efforts and make it easier for these content creators to build businesses online.  Well, Stacey, you're the target for this in the and actually,  anybody does a newsletter, you know, I mean, the cynic in me will say, yeah, they're looking over at Substack and Review,  which is the new newsletter platform Twitter just acquired and saying, I have a new rule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New rule is that all social networks do everything that all social they just copy each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's all it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the coming months, I would not ever host anything on Facebook.  You know, it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, my my antipathy aside, you know, when I when Facebook was a little bit more popular,  but when Facebook Live came out, everybody said, oh, you should stream on Facebook Live.  I'm always reluctant to rely on a platform that you don't control.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, that's the baseline.  I'm like, yep, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think that's the lesson.  And also, I mean, pages I have put in the old days, pages was liked.  I put stuff up on pages, but then pasted pages fell into this repair and now it's coming back up again.  So are they going to promote things that you don't know?  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This sounds attractive, though.  This is what Brown writes.  We'll introduce a new platform to empower independent writers, helping them.  Oh, I said that.  We'll start by partnering with a small subset of independent writers.  I mean, Stacey, you're exactly the kind of person that she's thinking of.  I think the platform will include a variety of support focused on content creation and audience growth, including a free self-publishing tool with robust styling options to create individual websites and email newsletter, sub stack or medium, maybe an integration with Facebook pages.  To enable publishing across various multimedia formats, photos, live videos and stories, the ability to create Facebook groups, nurture community readers.  This sounds a lot like other other initiatives.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't know if I'm the perfect person for this simply because I have my own ad sales and you have your own business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like these people, these are these are basically just trying to make money on journalists, which is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think they would say we're we're trying to share money with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I don't think they're going to make money on this.  I think this is this is a this like much of what the platforms do these days with news is a PR effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then I would just say to everybody who does this, remember Facebook's pivot to video push for everybody.  Yeah, yeah.  The lies and maybe in there I would I would not touch this with a 10 foot pole.  I would not touch this with a 40 foot pole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So just stick to medium.  Essentially stick to medium.  Maybe it's just as bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe it's just as bad because that's their platform.  That's why I always encourage and I think actually Jeff kind of does it right, which is he publishes on medium where there's there's an audience.  But he also cross publishes on his own personal blog.  So you never lose control of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I also sometimes I sometimes cross post on to LinkedIn.  In the old days, I used to cross post on to HuffPost and Guardian comment is free.  I'd be OK with posting onto Facebook, but to make it your home.  Years ago and I did say this years ago and I'll recant now that I think Stacey's right.  You don't want to be too dependent when they can pull the rug out.  I did try to argue years ago that the platform should make it possible for independent journalists.  They should have the package do this.  But I think it's I think the world has moved on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it a generational thing that that they feel like this is a worthy carrot to dangle?  Maybe the younger younger journalists or what have you are thinking this is something right viable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aren't they all on their own wix pages or whatnot?  Is that so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do any of these platforms insist on exclusivity?  No, it's always assumed that you'll be published.  The substack. I don't even do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would like as a journalist, as a working journalist, what I would like is I want to host things on or I want to do things and keep them for me.  So let's say WordPress because I can control it.  I would control it.  And then I want a simple way to automatically cross post and format for LinkedIn, Medium or whatever.  But no one is doing that.  I would actually pay money for that.  That would be valuable.  Because, you know, cutting and pasting.  It's just kind of such a pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, cue our old friend Kevin.  Kevin Marks.  What's the name of that?  IndieWeb.  IndieWeb.  IndieWeb.  Okay, yes.  That's the architecture that he's been proposing or been implementing for ages, which is you should be able to and David Weiner is the same on this.  You should be able to write once, post multiple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course, Facebook's not going to do that.  Substack's not going to do it.  Nobody wants to facilitate you doing it.  They may not require you exclusivity, but they don't want to make it too easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then you're not helping journalists.  Just marketing.  Like the Komen Foundation for journalists.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want to silo as much as they can because that's how they make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in the paid medium thing for which I get about 40 bucks a month.  But there's no mention there of doing it exclusively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'll buy a lot of cachoi pepe.  Yeah, it will.  It sure will.  Basically, they're buying you lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can get fat enough to get another shot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Casey Newton at Platformer.  He's another example of a longtime well-known blogger on big name tech blogs who's gone on his own with something he calls Platformer.  I wonder what he's using.  Is he using Substack?  I bet he is.  I don't know.  Maybe he's smart enough not to use anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have to use something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless you're just going to create like an HTML email and just send it out.  You can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can put up your own server in the basement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks like Substack.  So he has a piece on Platformer most recently comparing Facebook versus Substack.  It's called What Facebook Sees in Newsletters.  Hint, it's all about groups plus Substack fumbles.  So this is a response to that piece I just, the Campbell Brown piece I just told you about.  He says, let's see, I find Facebook's move into newsletters a bit surreal if only because I started a newsletter in 2017 as an end run around Facebook or rather as an end run around the idea of algorithmic feeds in general.  That's an interesting point.  That is an interesting point.  After the better part of a decade chasing audiences from platform to platform, kind of your strategy, Stacy, I set out to build a strong direct connection to an audience that wants to hear from me.  And that's what you've got now, Stacy, on your own site.  And that I can reliably reach no matter how many likes, upvotes or retweets any individual post happens to get.  I'll read between the lines of what he's saying is Facebook's algorithm determines how many eyeballs you get based on upvotes or likes.  And he just wants to have a platform where everybody who comes up level is going to read all the stuff he writes.  No algorithm here.  He says I won't rehearse Facebook's long history with the news business.  It's been rocky and mostly unsatisfying for just about everyone involved.  I'm just trying to see if there's a conclusion here.  Point.  Yeah, I have to say this is the second time I've read through this and I have had a little trouble finding his point.  I did too.  I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's been criticism of some stack that we don't know who they're paying or what the deal is.  So I just put this on the rundown below that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He does raise the before we move on.  He does raise the point.  I do wonder how committed Facebook will be to these creators in the long term.  Because it's the reason people are don't like Facebook is because the platform changes all the time, making it a shaking ground on which to build a business, which we have been exactly saying.  So, you know, you got a question is their motivations and maybe I think it depends on where this is coming from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If this is coming from profit, then the rug is there already pulled out.  If this is coming from let's do something nice from journalists, maybe they'll be nicer to us.  Then there's probably a budget behind it and it'll last as long as that budget lasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't know.  Yes. So don't count on it either way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, don't count on anybody.  He does use an example.  Heather Cox Richardson, the most successful individual on sub stack.  She makes a million dollars in revenue each year.  But he also says most of her subscribers come over a Facebook page page, which has one point million followers.  I mean, maybe that's a good use of it is to use that as the way to do this as publicity.  Drive people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should control your emails and also her audience is I mean, like LinkedIn is a great place for me actually to get new subscribers and find an audience because I write perfect about business.  I am.  Thank you, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  LinkedIn was great for me to get work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're someone like her and it's a little bit more general interest, then Facebook does make a lot more sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I were sub stack.  Oh, I can only read the last two paragraphs from this is again Casey Newton's platformer amidst all this sub stack CEO Chris Best tweeted without any other context, quote, defund the thought police, end quote, seeming to side with the platform's most lucrative edge lords over its more centrist and liberal creators.  I've since received a few inquiries from writers asking whether being associated with sub stack will damage their reputations over the long term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because the question is, who is sub stack, you know, some stack has has Bannon for this one of the newsletters.  Who are they paying for it?  Whose company are you keeping there?  And if you don't know, so that's why the next line has has has something to put up with.  They're still not being terribly forthcoming.  They've said that more than 30 writers have signed the pro deals, the whole bunch of issues, but you don't know who you're next to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So sub stack, which has a model, you know, it's a newsletter platform and the model is you could charge and you make money and they take a cut.  Except that to set to jumpstart it.  We now know they funded a group, you say 30, big name types by saying here, you know, maybe have there's one of them.  Here's a here's money.  Come to sub stack and write and and that makes sense to.  I think Ev did that with medium right at the beginning to kind of generate traffic in the beginning.  He says Casey Newton says if I were sub stack, I would take pains to demonstrate that the platform offers financial support to creators across the political spectrum and draws hard lines around targeted harassment and bigotry.  Tough to do if Bannon is one of your contributors.  I would hire a really good head of communications and give her the passwords to the founders Twitter accounts.  In other words, stop defunding the thought police.  I would lean all the way away from culture Warren toward.  Do you think that Chris Best of sub stack is a cancel culture guy that he's wooing the right idea?  That's kind of a case is implying here that he's lying it.  But I don't know.  He's wooing the right.  Maybe that because well, you know what?  I said this last week.  Talk radio after Rush Limbaugh realized, hey, you want a big audience.  Swing, right?  That's the audience.  Liberals are so namby pamby.  They don't make good talk radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they also liberals.  The whole world is your oyster if you're a liberal in the sense that you you look and listen everywhere.  Right.  But if you're a marginalized viewpoint or you feel under attack, there are fewer places if you believe in that.  You know, and so I think that's one of the reasons why a conservative and having a conservative bent in does so well for these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the story that conservatives promulgate.  I don't know if it's true that the media is liberal.  And so I'm not saying it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm saying it that like my viewpoint embraces any number of like I can read a bunch of books and not be offended.  Right.  I can watch a lot of television.  But can you read Dr. Seuss and not be offended?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you're if you're wealthy, if there's so many things offend you, you're automatically narrowing your options.  And so to find something, do you see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would define I would say I would say it same thing the opposite way, which is one of the reasons.  The reason why conservative talk radio does better than liberal talk radio is because it's the it's the radio of resentment.  And yes, it's the radio.  Yeah, it's it's the yes.  Because really, look at Ron Johnson has gone now on every major news medium to say I've been canceled.  It's like, no, you haven't.  You have just you've just appeared everywhere to announce that you've been canceled.  But that but that that whining resentment and, you know, they're out to get us and all that stuff plays really well.  And it makes a much more interesting talk radio than, you know, hey, we all need to get along and let's let's solve our problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if newspapers are inherently liberal and talk radio is inherently conservative, is the Internet inherently anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  It serves both equal equally any more than electricity is anything.  It's it's a neutral medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we hear people saying the social media is inherently right.  Well, we hear both.  We hear social media.  It's inherently right wing because that's what they push because they get some traffic.  On the other hand, we hear the right say, but they cancel us.  So you don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but the right has always been the party of persecution.  I mean, look at look at the war on Christmas.  So, I mean, this is just plays well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I would it really works well.  If you tell, I mean, in its simplest form, if you tell your audience, you're smart and everybody else is dumb, they're going to like you.  If if you tell your audience, those dummies are out to get us, you know, we're on a team together.  It's a great way to build an audience.  It's a it's probably the best way to build an audience.  Let's you're on our we're on on a team.  You know, go Clemson.  It's a cult.  That's not even a cult.  It's not even a cult.  It doesn't have to be a cult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, would you say Clemson supporters are a cult?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they love Clemson.  Right.  And and and they love Clemson for it by hating everybody else, by hating all the other non Clemsons.  Right.  In the case of college football, it doesn't matter.  It's fun.  Right.  It's a game when it comes to humans and real life.  Maybe it's not so much fun or so much of a game, but it has the same.  It has the same appeal.  Has the same visceral.  Yeah, those guys.  Those are those are the bad guys.  We're the good guys.  We're the smart ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody wants to give you one more point about about marketing with this stuff, which I just so so under the post I put up about about what some of the tax said in response, Matt Keiser.  I don't know if you've seen his newsletter.  It's called What the F Just Happened Today.  Yes.  But he did it for four weeks.  Yes.  He's a former student of mine.  Oh, guy.  He's in Seattle, by the way.  I think Stacey is a good guy.  So he said Twitter doesn't do anything for his newsletter.  He has six figure income, which he talks about from his newsletter.  He said email to email sharing is extremely powerful since it's the only interoperable social media platform.  I found really interesting.  Say that again.  Say that again.  Email to email sharing is extremely powerful since it's the only interoperable social media platform.  That is true.  And unfortunately, but it's it's only because nobody else wants to be interoperable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody else wants to be siloed.  But I agree 100 percent.  Right.  Email was not.  Remember, you you're old enough.  I'm old enough to remember before MCI mail before email was interoperable.  You you were on MCI mail.  You couldn't email anybody on GE mail.  And that was nuts.  But once they figured out make it interoperable, nothing could stop it.  It's the exact opposite lesson that Twitter and Facebook and everybody else is having.  Although maybe Jack has finally got the message since he's proposing this federated blue sky format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know, but I still buy into the idea that your people are going to be wherever you are.  It's not necessarily saying that the newsletter is the best way to go because it may not be the best way to go for you.  It may be Twitter.  It may be medium.  And the way I see people keep throwing these these big old claims out that, hey, this is this is it because I'm making six figures with using this this type of methodology.  That's not always the case.  Some people it just it just doesn't stick on that platform.  There are reasons you have YouTubers that aren't necessarily think it's platform specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like the culture of the platform determines who's going to make it on that platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's just whoever your audience is.  You know, when Stacey Stacey was mentioning previously about LinkedIn, I remember a couple of years ago telling my little tiny circle of friends that I enjoy LinkedIn because LinkedIn got me work.  And I'm not talking about just, you know, being able to put a resume out there.  But if I wanted to have a gig to go shoot something for some people locally, LinkedIn is where I got all of my leads.  It wasn't Twitter. It wasn't Instagram.  It wasn't Flickr.  It was LinkedIn.  It was LinkedIn.  But it didn't work for everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's interesting. Yep. Yep. Yep.  But it doesn't work that way for everybody.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And some people have great success on YouTube and many of us don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep. That would be me, sir.  Which I think you're doing all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't. Don't.  Okay. Yeah, that might be cultural.  I don't know. I mean, that's the big problem, right?  If you have a group of fans, Kevin Kelly says all you need is a thousand.  I don't know if that's true.  But if you have a group of fans.  I actually agree with that.  Yeah, but that's not the problem.  The problem is how do you get more and how do you get discovered?  How do you get growth?  And you're saying the right platform is different depending on who you are and what your content is and that kind of thing.  You got to choose the right place to find that growth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I had to find where my, I hate saying this phrase, but it's where my tribe is.  And most of my tribe is on Twitter.  Right.  And also on LinkedIn.  Is that true for you too, Stacey? Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's where I'm at.  So I get requests.  So I'm on Twitter.  So most people find me there.  And then LinkedIn is where I get most of my growth from.  Oh, interesting.  We've done Facebook.  Yeah, we've done Facebook-y like ad things.  But, and we got some, but most of those people weren't sticky.  So I think that's probably the right.  I go where my audience is, but I also go where like people are interested in talking.  And I find out as much as I can.  And again, my audience is business.  So it's kind of not hard.  I get a lot of requests to be on YouTube, but I have not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have, it's all a mystery to me.  I can't figure it out at all.  I'm just glad I had a cable television show back in the day.  That's all I know.  It's just dumb freaking luck.  I mean, I really do wish I don't have much faith in marketing at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, see, I won't say that because I do believe in marketing yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it makes sense in the premise of it, but I don't know how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know how to do it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not saying I know how, but I'm going to keep trying something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, and that's, I mean, I don't know.  I tweet about my stuff or I post it on LinkedIn.  And then I'm like, oh, look, that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I feel like if I can't be a cheerleader for myself, how can I expect anyone else to be a cheerleader for me if I don't even believe in myself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want to go home and play with my computers.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You are like a walking inspirational t-shirt.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, Ant could be the soft spoken Gary Vee.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He could inspire people.  Is that a contradiction in terms, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A soft spoken Gary Vee.  He tries to be inspired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He could inspire people without yelling at them.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's take a little.  My kids get yelled at enough, so that's where my yelling goes.  Hardheads, get over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hardheads.  Get over here.  You call them hardheads with love.  That's right.  With love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there an origin story to the hardheads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are you willing to say that?  It's pretty much how I grew up.  Everyone in my childhood, if you were a child, you were a hardhead.  No, I don't care what parents said it.  I don't care what adult it was.  Really?  In the neighborhood, everybody called the children hardheads.  Huh.  Not just my parents, not just my grandparents.  The neighbors called us hardheads.  It's just what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that the town or is that regional?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it was just my town, I guess.  It's your town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My mom and papa called my dad and us hardhead.  Oh, really?  Not hardheads like in as a group, but that was a common descriptor for us as children.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like shorty or hardhead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hardheads and youngins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Youngins.  Youngins, I know.  Youngins, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Utes, as Joe Pesci would call them.  Yeah, I think that was northern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to do a new segment of this show called Breathe with Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to tape my mouth up.  We're going to get a new sponsor for that too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moving on to segment four.  I don't know.  I'm getting this up now.  Instagram.  This is in the department of what?  You mean they allowed that?  Instagram will no longer let adults message teens who don't follow them.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who the hell would have ever done that?  They allowed that?  Teen users will also be shown safety prompts when messaging suspicious adults.  Yeah, like stop.  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you know it's a suspicious adult, why aren't you doing more than just that?  What makes an adult suspicious?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  New policies limiting interactions between teenagers and adults to make its platform safer for young users.  I mean, I guess, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they didn't want to admit they had so many young users or that it's a tool for grooming young people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. I would think so.  So they'll be introducing safety response that will be shown to teens when they direct message adults who have been, quote,  exhibiting potentially suspicious behavior.  Oh, this is gross.  This is really positive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People had to build that algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The prompts will remind young users not to feel pressured to respond to messages and to be careful sharing photos, videos or information with someone you don't know.  If you have to do this on a platform, you've got a problem, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, people groom across platforms.  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at the Boy Scouts.  Yeah.  I mean, look at AOL Instant Messenger.  That was like the headquarters of all that stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did they say? Name, age, sex? Name, sex, age?  What was the thing you would type NSA or something and they would have to respond?  I don't remember what the deal was.  So scary.  Yeah, it was scary.  You know how I know because I was on a jury for one of those to catch a predator.  You know, remember that show they did on Dateline to catch a predator?  Oh, you were?  Yeah, because one of the houses that they used to entrap people was here in Petaluma.  So I was on a federal jury trying this guy, a Coast Guard guy, young himself.  He was early 20s, if not teen, who had been lured by an adult pretending to be a kid on AOL Instant Messenger.  And they read us all the transcripts and everything.  It was like, oh, so cringy.  And then we heard the whole prosecution case.  And then at the end of the prosecution's case, the defense attorney goes up to the judge, goes, judge, move to dismiss.  And the judge says, yes, absolutely, we're dismissing this case.  This is entrapment.  Thank you, jury.  Goodbye.  I never even got to hear the defense.  The judge said, no, you entrapped this kid.  Yeah, because it wasn't a kid that was doing the messaging.  It was an adult.  Right.  Age, sex, location, ASL.  That's what it was.  Yeah, ASL, age, sex, location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  American Sign Language.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy.  And I guess it does make sense, especially, I don't know, I don't have Instagram, but Lisa does.  And some of the stuff's on there is pretty sexy.  They've gotten a little less.  And I bet you there are teenagers on there who, you know, they're young.  They don't know any better.  They're putting sexy stuff on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're exploring their sexuality.  Right.  Which is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is normal.  But there's bad people in there, bad men in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bad men.  Let's be honest.  There's also the camp that understands that if you're going to get impressions, likes,  views, whatnot on Instagram, it takes a little bit.  Yeah, you gotta shake it.  It takes doing some edgy stuff.  Yeah, you gotta shake it.  That's why mine is pretty bland.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not the medium for me.  Or you.  No, you love Instagram.  I'm totally fine sharing my work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm totally fine sharing my work there and sharing behind the scenes stuff.  I enjoy doing that because of the interaction there.  Granted, there's more interaction on Twitter, but I still enjoy using Instagram from time  to time just to share what I've been working on and sharing some of my shots.  But I'm not going to be like what I see in my feed most of the time here recently is  just a bunch of selfies and a bunch of look at me's and a bunch of, you know, short skirts  and interesting poses and things like that.  That's just not my personality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is a story that you're going to have to explain to me somebody.  The New York Times, the great Amazon flipathon.  You ever buy a product from Eco Baby or Trail Buddy or Quility or Tape King?  These are among the most popular in their categories on Amazon, according to the Times,  and for millions of dollars in yearly sales, they're all owned and operated by a single  company Thrasio, which is one of a dozen dozens of firms snapping up successful Amazon brands  for millions of dollars.  There's lots of investment in these roll ups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  I put this up here.  Explain to me.  So you decide to start the example they use here is the guy who wanted a better booster  seat for dogs.  Sure.  And it doesn't matter what the product is.  But the point and we've known this for years on the show is is that you don't have to.  You can you can hire a designer.  You can outsource the manufacturer.  You can outsource the fulfillment with Amazon.  It's a virtual company.  It's a virtual company.  You can be one person and you can have everything you need to create a product as long as it  works and you create it.  Well, then you have some value because you now have some asset value.  You have customers and you have ratings on Amazon and so on and so forth.  So those little companies are getting bought up so that what I'm not sure about is what  the value of the roll up is, except that the roll up is even more virtual.  Well, you at least went to the work of creating the doggy car seat.  You did something.  We don't do anything.  We're just going to roll up all these things and sell stuff on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And according to the according to this article, the way you make money is you raise money  based on the roll up.  So you've created a Thrasio, which created this conglomerate of eco baby trail buddy  quality and tape king has now raised seven hundred fifty million dollars in financing.  So there's money in there somewhere, somewhere cash flow somewhere in this pile.  There's there's a pony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this this week's NFT discussion?  It's kind of like that, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's amazing.  It really is amazing.  The world is changing so rapidly.  But the but the quarantine has been huge for these companies.  It also changes.  I mean, Amazon must love it because, of course, it's a lot of revenue passing through Amazon.  Yep, yep, yep, yep.  You know, I see on TikTok all the time little TikToks on how to make millions of dollars on Amazon.  Basically, by going to, you know, Kohl's, buying a bunch of clothes, taking the label,  the price tag off and flipping it on Amazon.  And I mean, I guess that's gone on forever since eBay.  Right. People would do that on eBay.  They buy a pallet of stuff at Costco and sell it one by one and profit.  If you got the time.  Well, and especially with lots of people out of work or unemployed, this is a way to, you know, I think this is the modern.  This is the great American dream now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, even in the media business.  So I have I have a community of practice for commerce in media, trying to get them to have more revenue streams.  And one company had created their own heavy blanket and made a lot of money on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Like a weighted blanket.  Yeah, weighted blanket. Yeah.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now Casper sells them.  So what goes around comes around.  I'm tempted. I don't know if I would I like a heavy blanket, especially if my mouth is.  Do you not have a weighted blanket?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems like I'm headed towards some sort of bizarre fantasy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo can't get up.  The matter is he has him trapped in a heavy blanket and he can't scream because his mouth is taped closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's too damn heavy and I can't yell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the guy the guy with the dog seat, it's a it's actually an instructive story.  He thought this is a good category.  He looked on Amazon, did a search and noticed in the reviews they were all for small dogs and they were flimsy.  So he said, hmm, he actually did some effort.  He went to trade shows and stuff and he found and made, you know, went to actually the China and Import and Export Fair in Guangzhou  and found a well-made car booster seat for dogs.  Actually, maybe not, but he found a supplier who could make something better, even better.  Yeah. He went to a factory anyway on and on.  He eventually flipped this business for six figures, low six figures to an individual investor interested in using his steady stream of income,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is like buying a deli so you can just get the money.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, this is something. Yes.  This is a thing that happens.  I know I wasn't paying attention at first, but yes, this is a my husband actually has an entire book on this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They all feel a little like get rich quick schemes, except they work if you put enough effort and energy into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of like building up back in the day and affiliate marketing.  Yes, it worked and people would buy them.  Yes.  Yes. Passive income stream.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So right. So Stacey, I guess there's let's try this.  You can be wise and just buy other products and then rebrand them and sell them.  You can buy things from stores, which is the one end that go to Costco and buy stuff, or you can design products and make them through manufacturers.  Right. There's a range there, I think. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you just described like all the options of manufacturing or getting a selling a product basically.  That's what's happening now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can do it as one person. You could do it as now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This company, I bet you 20 years Thrasio, which I've just learned about today from this article is going to be like Procter and Gamble.  I mean, this is how these guys started.  They made soap because there was leftover.  This is another great book, by the way, I mentioned before called Clean.  It goes with breath, but it's about the soap industry.  And these guys, these meat rendering plants had a lot of animal fat and they didn't know what to do with it.  They were throwing it out. They turn it into soap.  Now you have to make a market for soap.  And that's why Lever Brothers, Procter and Gamble and all these companies that are huge now.  That's how they started. It's kind of like the same thing.  You see, for instance, Thrasio said everything we buy is a solution to a problem of some kind.  Much of what Joshua Silberstein, the founder, looks for is obvious.  A good product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the long tail that Chris Anderson has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's long tail. Chris Anderson's long tail.  A solid scalable supply chain.  As an example, they talk about Angry Orange, pet deodorizer, an acquisition which they point to as a success story.  Thirty million in revenue last year.  They paid one point four million to buy it two years ago.  Or Trail Buddy, its brand of hiking poles.  For dogs?  Yeah, might as well. Everything should be for dogs.  Or for its extensive listings in bedding, crafting supplies, coolers and thermoses.  It's like you have find and eat and fill it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how are these things found?  Is somebody going in and searching for dog car seat?  Or do they have to buy advertising on Amazon?  I think that's one of the things that's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one of the things that's changed is you can do your market research on Amazon.  You go to China, you get it made and you sell it on Amazon.  I mean, that's how you find a market.  Complete circle.  It's a complete circle.  And by the way, Silberstein says when you're really successful on Amazon, it might make up 95% of your net worth.  You're in a place where it's kind of hard to diversify.  And then what if something goes wrong?  So I guess he's concerned about Amazon.  But what are you going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, one thing about the about the dog seat guy is that is you do get caught in a problem of capital.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, he only sold it for low six figures.  That's a lot of work for one hundred thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, that's kind of a lesson for him.  But the point is that if you don't make enough, then it's an opportunity cost.  If you make too many, then you're stuck with a warehouse filled or an Amazon warehouse filled with dog seat.  Which they probably charge you space for every month.  That's why you build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why you actually just find hot products.  You do the whole virtual storefront instead.  And you just write from Alibaba.  That's that's where the money is.  Or you kickstarter and you use your customers capital.  Or that. OK.  This is the lesson that Andrew learned in his early days was just don't do a business with inventory.  Yeah, never one inventory.  And if you don't have to do fulfillment, all the better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And guess what Amazon does?  Inventory and fulfillment.  All of it.  But you don't want to own an inventory.  No, but Bezos is brilliant because he's just taking a little bit from every one of these companies.  He's making it.  He's facilitating it.  The lesson for us as buyers is buyer beware because there's all sorts of crap on Amazon.  Right. Right.  I just bought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I didn't buy it from Amazon.  I got I think it was I think it was an Instagram ad or a Facebook ad.  I probably is a Facebook ad and it was a hoodie, you know, a lined hoodie.  And I want one more for next winter.  And I got it and it smells awful.  Yeah, that's a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of these Chinese things.  And I didn't look and I didn't see what the return policy was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always looked this time.  I didn't look.  Yeah. And it says we don't take returns because we know it's them.  They said, well, if you take a picture of the problem, how do you take a picture of the problem?  How do you take a picture of smell?  Right.  We'll give you the money back.  You just keep it because we're too small.  We don't want it back.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll just take a picture of you holding your nose and having somebody else go.  Little lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always good to draw little lines coming up.  Yeah.  The kid.  Remember the cryptocurrency hack on Twitter where kid gets on and tweets as Joe Biden  and Barack Obama and Bill Gates and Elon Musk saying, I've decided to give a portion of my fortune  to the needy or to the undeserving.  It doesn't really matter.  And here's my Bitcoin wallet.  Help me out.  Send me some money so we can share it.  I'll double it.  He was 18 years old.  Actually, no, he was 17 years old when he did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank goodness for him, he was 17.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was 17.  Well, maybe not.  He was on a youth program.  He pled guilty to all state charges.  Three years sentence in a juvenile facility in Tampa.  He's 18 now.  We even said at the time, remember this hack?  We were on the air when this happened.  You said it's a kid.  Or it was really clever Russian.  Yeah, it was really puzzling because it could have been so much more.  Of course, it was a 17 year old.  That's why he got 12.86 Bitcoin at $117,000 in the day to the attack.  A little more now.  What does lawyers cost him?  So he pled guilty.  One kind of organized fraud.  17 counts of communications fraud, one kind of fraudulent loose of personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of which he's guilty.  He should have done it.  It's all wrong.  It's really bright.  Imagine if this kid went to college and got a decent career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When he gets out of juvie, he's going to get some job offers, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He'll have jobs.  He'll be fine.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He'll be fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Tampa Bay newspaper said three years in prison.  No, it's juvie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you wouldn't want to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, no.  And then, and by the way, they posted just the scariest picture of this guy.  So I'm not going to say his name because he's a kid.  He's a kid.  He's a ute.  He's a ute.  You know who's not a ute?  Clearly a hardhead.  Elon Musk is a hardhead though.  He's not a ute, but he's a hardhead.  His new title, Techno King, the company's CFO, Tesla's CFO is now designated Master  of Coin.  This found in documents filed with the Security and Exchange Commission.  That's taken it seriously.  In the 8K filing, both executives will also retain the CEO and CFO titles.  But please refer to me as Techno King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think we need new lower thirds.  What do you want?  I was emailing Jason about this.  What do you want?  I don't mind this.  I think you are the pod dictator.  It's not a democracy.  Exactly.  Stacey is the IO Tsar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I like it.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was thinking of Ant as the master of pixels.  Master of pixels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pixels.  Oh, pixels.  And what is your title?  What is your title, Jeff Jarvis?  I don't have one.  I don't have one.  Oh, we got to have a title for him.  How about the Techno Panic King?  Or Mr. Moral Panic?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Arbiter of Panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Arbiter of Panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm totally fine with court jester over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, Jeff can be the keeper of the panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The keeper of the panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John's working hard.  He's got one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Release the panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Release the panic.  I am the panic keeper.  Pod dictator.  Pod dictator.  Actually, it looks like pod dictator.  Pod dictator.  It's not good.  It's not good.  Pod dictator.  IOTSAR for Stacey, the IO czar.  Chief twit.  Yeah.  Well, I am still the chief twit.  I always have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was Zuckerberg's, I'm the CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm CEO, comma, bitch.  I was on his card.  That was kind of funny.  All right.  I'm not going to say anything about NFTs.  We've done NFTs.  This is a great thread.  Wow.  So, we had, last week we had, you missed it, Trey Ratcliff on Stacey, my favorite photographer.  He's doing NFTs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Other than Ant, prove it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like Ant, but I've known Trey for 20 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trey is still Trey.  Yeah, a long time.  Trust me, I'm not jealous here.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  You're a humble man.  So, there's two NFTs stories.  This one is wild.  The artist known as Beeple sold one of his images, actually all of his images in a single  image, the first 5,000 days, for more, it's the third highest sale for any living artist  after Jeff Koontz and David Hockney.  His JPEG, it's a JPEG, not even a ping or a TIF.  This is a lossy format, y'all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a lossy format for $60 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you include Christie's fee, the auction house, $69.3 million for a JPEG, for a lossy  format.  More than everybody except Jeff Koontz and David Hockney.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  Crazy talk.  But who bought it?  Who bought it?  Well, MetaKovan is the pseudonym, but I think it's kind of, we've kind of uncovered who  he is.  And thanks to Amy Castor, who's a blogger, but did I think some good research figuring  out that MetaKovan is actually a well-known crypto entrepreneur, Vignesh Sundarasan.  And I think this confirms what we really thought, which is that a lot of the money being spent  right now on NFTs comes from, is made up money, is found money anyway.  It's Bitcoin or Ethereum.  And promotes their own business.  Well, in this case, MetaKovan actually probably is selling the shares of this to a syndicate  called B20, of which people has 2%, which is bizarre.  And so MetaKovan makes money on this by buying a $69 million painting and then selling shares  to people who, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Don't put your retirement here, folks.  Yeah.  And it's all speculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's all, you know, it's all about, let's make some money.  But the thread that I put that thread in.  Yes, I'm going to go to the thread in just a second.  I do want to, before we leave the Beeple story, I do want to point out another crypto millionaire,  founder of the Tron blockchain, Justin Sun, wanted to spend more.  He tweeted, I tried to update my bid to $70 million in the last 30 seconds.  My offer was somehow not accepted by Christie's system, even though there's 20 seconds left.  He's upset.  He said, I wanted to spend 70.  There's too much money in some people's pockets.  So here's the thread you're referring to from, let's see.  Jonti Wearing.  There it is.  Jonti Wearing.  Do you know who Jonti Wearing is?  No, no idea.  Out of curiosity, Jonti writes, I dug into how NFTs actually reference the media you're  buying in my eyebrows are now orbiting the moon.  Short version, the token you bought either points to a URL on the internet or an IPFS hash.  In most circumstances, IPFS is an IP file system.  It's basically like a distributed network file system.  The problem with the URL is it could go up or down.  An IPFS hash might have some longevity.  In most circumstances, it references an IPFS gateway on the internet run by the startup  you bought the NFT from.  Oh, and that URL is not the medium.  It's not the painting.  It's not a link to the image.  It's a JSON metadata file that basically is your blockchain entry.  Here's the NFT token for artwork sold by people.  Not for quite so much.  Sold via Nifty.  This is the token.  That's it.  That's it right there.  That file refers to the actual media you just bought, which in this case is hosted via  Cloudinary CDN served by Nifty's servers again.  So if Nifty goes bust, your token is now worthless.  It refers to nothing.  This can't be changed.  It's in the blockchain.  But you said some users use IPFS.  Well, let's look at the $65 million people sold by Christie's.  The token refers directly to an IPFS hash.  We could take that hash and fetch the JSON metadata using a public gateway.  So well done for referring to IPFS.  It refers, it references a specific file rather than a breakable URL.  But the metadata links to a website and IPFS gateway run by Makers Place, which is the  NFT minting startup will go bust one day.  So basically what he's saying is all of this relies on ephemeral internet infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which has always been like, I mean, that's the internet.  And if you actually use, and you see actually some really interesting articles like in art  conservation magazines about like conserving digital art that talks about a lot of this.  So, and you know, as someone who's been working on the internet for two decades, you know,  you just got to relax and let it go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  After having spent $69 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all I know is if you're the artist and you get something purchased, you better  collect transfer quickly.  Yeah, and turn it into dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Turn that into real dollars.  So I will tell you, I've my helium router.  It's gotten like the HNTs, the helium network tokens.  They're worth like $8,000.  I've minted that much in HNTs.  And I'm like, convert, I need to convert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the problem.  Convert now.  Will you be like the person who sold this Bitcoin for $5?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I won't because I did nothing and free money is still more money.  But it's $8,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if it were $80,000 or $800,000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's still going to be minting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It can still, you know, it can still mint.  So remember, remember Cranberry Juice guy, the longboard skater who is a tick tock guy.  He's selling that as an NFT.  You could buy this.  No, no, he's selling it as an NFT.  Good on him.  Yeah.  Nathan Apodack will be selling the clip for half a million dollars.  That's the minimum bid.  Buy a house.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, people are like, you should invest that money.  He's like, I'm going to buy a house for my parents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't want to playfully win that out loud anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was an interesting question though.  Can he sell that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's on the tick tock platform.  Isn't it tick tocks too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you can sell it.  That's the beauty of this.  He made the video so he's got the video.  No, it's not about ownership.  It's not about anything.  You can sell anything as an NFT.  Even if you don't own it.  I could sell the Mona Lisa as an NFT.  Now you'd be foolish to buy it because I don't have any connection with the Mona Lisa,  but I still could sell it as an NFT.  And if somebody bought it, the ball starts rolling.  So I don't think anybody cares.  The Ocean Spray logo on the bottle will be blurred out.  And it will not include the Fleetwood Max song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was my next question.  Because he can't sell those to audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's my opinion he can.  But you're not buying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's turned it into art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you're buying that particular rendition of it.  But probably to avoid any...  That makes no sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to know what he's going to do to keep the lawyers away.  If this happens to sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are they going to accuse him of?  Well, again, the Fleetwood Max track.  He's not selling anything.  But he's not...  What is he selling?  When you buy an NBA highlight...  Play, right?  What do you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought you got the ownership of that particular file.  No, you don't know.  Oh, geez.  Well, it's so wacky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The NBA still owns it and can run it and all that stuff.  I don't get it.  He's going to buy a house for his parents and fund a new event center in his hometown, Idaho Falls.  Well, let's see.  I hope he gets it.  We'll see if he gets...  I hope he gets it safely.  I'll say that.  Yeah.  This is...  Yeah, I should really do the change.  But I really want to talk about the Freedom Phone.  Thefreedomphone.us.  I wonder what this is because you can't find out.  What is this?  Oh, this is changed.  Oh, this is interesting.  This was when I bookmarked it had a picture of a phone.  It was obviously an Android phone and all this.  I think it's kind of a scam, but we'll see.  They're selling a phone.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry because the link that I put has changed since I put it in there.  They're selling a phone that for conservatives will come preloaded with Parler and Gab.  Do you want to buy an NFT at a bridge?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll sell you both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I honestly think they're just selling some old Android phone with some apps installed.  The Pablo phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Remember that?  The escobar?  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my gosh.  They said it costs $450 for this phone and it is.  Oh, yeah.  It has Parler.  It's a Galaxy.  But it's an Android phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This isn't it.  This is another story.  California.  I think this is misreported.  It has been widely reported that they have a new regulation banning dark patterns as part  of the California Consumer Privacy Act.  I don't think so.  You know what dark patterns are.  Those are, by the way, be very hard to prosecute people for dark patterns because it's really  in the eye of the beholder.  But these are things that kind of psychological tricks that get you to pay for something or  forget to unsubscribe, something like that.  So it's a way of taking you underhanded strategies that rely on confusing language or unnecessary  steps such as forced clicking or scrolling through multiple screens or listening to why  you shouldn't opt out of their data sale.  This is from the California Attorney General's office.  I don't think the regulation actually does that.  And it would be very hard if it did to say this is a dark pattern.  This isn't.  This is just the Internet.  We'll see.  We'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that similar to like the pop up windows you get that would have the tiny X hidden  sort of up in the corner?  Yes.  Obviously that's a dark pattern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, there's a great site if you want to see a whole lot of dark patterns.  I think it's dark patterns dot org.  Let me just see if that's right.  Yep.  Dark patterns dot org, which has the Hall of Shame.  And there's a lot of them in here.  Lovely.  Yeah.  So if you're curious, the problem is, you know, I don't know how.  I mean, the one the the attorney general offered is pretty, pretty bad.  Here's a window that says, are you sure you want to opt out?  No, take me back.  And then very, very, very light printing underneath that.  Yeah, yeah, I want to opt out.  And then a big, long piece of text, very tiny text saying, if you opt out.  But I don't know, again, I don't know, it might just be consumer protection stuff.  Let's do a Google change log.  Big improvement to Google Maps.  It's kind of getting Waze like.  I know you use Waze, Jeff.  And one of the things that makes Waze so good is its users can add to the maps, can put police in and so forth.  Google now is allowing you to actually draw or new or missing roads on maps, actually draw on the map.  There'll be a side menu button called Edit the Map.  You can select Missing Road.  And now the power to map is in your hands.  What could possibly go wrong?  Add missing roads by drawing lines.  Quickly rename roads, change roads directionality and rear line or delete incorrect roads.  Pod dictator lane.  That's where I live.  Waze figured out how to do this properly.  So I imagine Google probably from the Waze thing is getting this.  There's a lot of nice little features in there adding to Google Maps.  More ways to share photos, reviews, things like that.  That's in the keyword blog.  Maps gets better all the time.  Live captioning is coming to Chrome.  Fabulous feature.  I think it's on Android, most Android phones.  But certainly if you have a Pixel phone, you've seen it at work.  And I think it's one of the coolest, coolest things.  I guess the S20 now has it, the OnePlus 8, OnePlus 9.  And it's going to be part of Google Chrome, a live caption feature.  When you're watching a video, it'll automatically capture it.  Caption, which is helpful, of course, for people who have hearing issues.  But I think in general, sometimes captions are pretty useful.  Captions will appear in a small pop-up window at the bottom of the video.  Oh, that explains it.  I've been seeing those last two days.  I've been seeing the last two days.  Oh, that explains it.  I've been seeing those last two days.  They're really small.  Oh, that explains it.  They've been working on this for a year.  I've started seeing it and I didn't know it.  Oh, now I know why I'm seeing captions everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So can I caption this right now?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, go in Chrome to YouTube or the live stream.  You should be able to caption what I'm reading.  I watch a lot of video.  Zoom, I'm on.  Yeah, probably.  I guess if it's in Chrome.  It's in Chrome, right?  I watch a lot of video at night with the sound turned off  because my lips are taped shut and I can't get out of bed.  And lately, I haven't seen it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you're under 80 pounds of blanket.  YouTube is rolling out copyright checks for videos

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  before they're published.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then we should start using this.  Talk about a chilling effect.  Usually what happens is you upload your video  and you find out later that it's been pulled out.  You've got a strike against you and you can't get it off.  So this is a new part of the upload process.  It's called the YouTube video.  YouTube is a YouTube video.  This is a new part of the upload process.  It's called checks.  It actually analyzes the video before you upload it.  Not before it's uploaded, before it's published.  So you can see if you're going to face any problems.  So there you go.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems like this has been in place for a while  because I would stage some of my uploads  and just put them in unlisted.  And every now and then I'd get a notification  about something being copyrighted.  Oh, that's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is explicit now.  And we will check your video for any issues  that may restrict its visibility or monetization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Ed, did you get strikes against you  for having violations if you did that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, sir, I have no strikes.  And usually when I did get those notifications,  I could appeal it because I did have written consent  from the artists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I was covered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quibi was such a huge success in the U.S.  that now YouTube is rolling out YouTube shorts.  Little shit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sounds like apparel.  Yeah.  You're wearing your YouTube shorts?  Summertime.  Time for my YouTube shorts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, actually, 9to5Google, which had this story now,  says the blog post was dated for Thursday  but has since been pulled.  Let's see if we can see this.  The blog.youtube.com post.  Yep, doesn't exist anymore.  So maybe YouTube shorts are not rolling out.  Watch this space.  The Google...  I still want them.  I want my YouTube shorts.  Google Family Link letting parents set always allowed apps,  get more detailed activity reports.  Family Link is a program you install from the Play Store  from Google that will tell parents how kids are getting  and tell parents how kids are using devices  and let them designate.  Some apps is okay.  Some apps not.  You can even say now there are some apps  that even after the screen time limit is up,  you can use these apps.  So more control in the Family Link app.  The company also launched a site, families.google,  which is a one-stop technology resource  to help you make technology work for your family.  Aww.  If that baby is using technology, you got a problem.  Aww.  Cute.  Kid put flowers in my beard.  What are families asking Google?  How much screen time is too much for my kids?  They've been asking them 217% more times this year than last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, a question considering nobody knows how much is...  Nobody knows the answers.  Too much nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, what's the answer? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People actually sit down and ask questions like that of Google?  Sure, don't you?  No.  Well, I mean, how old is the old port?  If I look at my last Google searches,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they are always stuff like that.  Yeah.  Questionable.  Or they're really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How old is Jane Fonda?  Things like that.  Yeah, we do a lot of that.  And yeah, all the time.  Lisa says, no, no, no, she's older than you.  I say, no, she's not.  Yes, she is.  Yes, she is.  How...  Hey, Google, how old is Jane Fonda?  And the, you know, bets have...  Oh, you jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now a lot of wives around America are going to say,  why were you asking about Jane Fonda?  I see it in your history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I watched the China syndrome the other day.  That's aged quite well with Jack Lemmon,  this crazed nuclear power plant operator  who barricaded himself inside the control room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Inspiration for The Simpsons.  No.  It could have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could have been.  It was a good movie.  Michael Douglas produced it.  He was in it.  Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon.  Brilliant Thread, this sounds like you.  Are you blue?  I put a blue box in there.  I love blue.  Jeff is blue.  You'll like it.  Brilliant Thread on White Clubhouse.  Did we actually close the changelog?  Yeah, didn't we?  Did I play the drums?  No.  And that's, I said it, and that's the Google changelog.  Like it matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does.  Like the universe is never going to be in order again.  It's leaving it open the changelog.  Let's hit all kinds of trolls and nasty animals.  Yeah, it's awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason, if you want, you can just delete Jeff right now.  Just making Jason's life hard.  Let's not do that.  If we didn't have that bumper,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would have been walking a little bit crooked the rest of the day  because I've been off balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see the 1 minute 26 second drone video of a bowling alley  to promote it that got Hollywood all excited?  One Hollywood veteran said,  It adds to the language and vocabulary of cinema.  Wow.  That's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I want Ant's professional view of this.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is using, by the way, get ready because you're going to see a lot more of this.  My son Henry is really into this.  FPV first person video drones.  They are hard to fly.  You have to put on a VR helmet because you're moving super fast through tiny spots.  And so you put the helmet on so you feel like you're in the drone.  Drone racing used it at first, but now they're doing it for video.  And it makes, watch this, it makes dramatic, fantastic video.  Very hard to do.  Henry's been doing a simulator for months to learn because it's so hard to do.  Let me turn on the sound on this too.  So here we go into the Bryant Lane bowling alley.  It's just amazing.  There's no way you could do this with a steady camera.  You have to have an FPV drone.  Oh, it gets tinier too.  So he's flying around the alley.  There's, by the way, really, this is so well done because there's people talking about things from the big Lebowski.  There's all sorts of references.  Look, we're now actually in the pin resetting machinery.  It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like this one better than the one Mercedes did.  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it's just going right through the guy's legs underneath the bowling thing.  It's really, really cool.  And this is a lot of work to do this.  But the thing is, because you're wearing a VR helmet, you could be somewhere completely invisible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's turning around.  It's doing a 360 as it goes.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are doing the lines for the big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're doing the big Lebowski.  You heard that.  This is bowling.  There are rules.  There are rules.  The rules, Donnie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Having that much control.  Great finish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And watch, here comes the ball.  He's rolling, he's rolling.  Strike!  And now the drone.  By the way, that's a thousand dollar drone that's going to get squished by a bowling pin machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Worth it.  That is so awesome.  The skill to be able to do that.  But what people tend to forget is having the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all right.  That was another story about the pilot seeing a UFO.  I don't know why that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead.  The key with those is not only the transmitter, but the goggles, like you mentioned.  You can't have any kind of latency on that.  And I've tried FPV over the years.  5G!  And it was so hard because of the latency.  And I would get sick within a couple minutes.  But take the goggles off and tell me to fly it.  I could fly it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got Henry an FPV drone for Christmas, but he hasn't dared to fly it because they're expensive.  And he's really afraid he's going to crash it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can crash them quite quickly because they're going so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Credit to Jay Christensen, the drone operator on this.  Rally-Studios.com.  He's Jaybird Films.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's because he's...  It was...  In a way because they're...  I mean, that in itself is like being a director because you're organizing...  The whole thing.  You're planning out the shot beforehand and do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's good.  Here is a...  Just if you want to know what it looks like when you're wearing this stuff.  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty cool.  Pretty cool.  That's some real skill.  All right.  I didn't get to all the greens, let alone all the blues.  Are there any stories that I left out that we really want to do here?  Uber?  Uber?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it an Uber story?  I don't know if it's in the doc, but it was in my brain.  Is it green in your brain or is it blue in your brain?  It was green considering we're in California and all of those propositions and stuff that  we just recently fought for gig workers, but now in the UK...  Prop 22.  Yeah.  UK Uber is setting up employees over there and mandatory vacation pay and all that good  stuff.  Is it in the doc?  They basically...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have to.  It isn't in the doc, but it should have been.  You're right.  They're going to get minimum wage, holiday pay and pensions.  And you know what?  God blessed Uber because it said...  Yeah, 134.  It said...  Oh, it is in 134.  They said, yeah, it's time.  The CEO, Dara Khoswohshahi, said this is a significant improvement in the standard of  for UK drivers, but I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step, which  comes after a five-year legal battle.  Remember, he joined after this legal battle was joined.  They have a point, though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change.  So, I hope that's true.  I hope Uber is saying, yeah, you know what?  We owe this to our drivers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, when I read into it more, I thought about how I felt with it being flexible as  a contractor, independent contractor.  I wonder...  I mean, I think they actually said, yeah, we'll still have, air quotes, flexibility  for these employees, but just how far can they go with that?  Because if you're just an independent contractor, you literally just don't even have to turn  the app on to say that I'm going to drive today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At this point, if you're going to get vacation pay and you're going to get a minimum wage,  you might have a requirement.  They might have a requirement for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's a good saying.  And when will the next vote come for over here in the US?  And, you know, they're trying to make that a precedence here to be employees again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think by now, everybody understands that Uber, you know, the whole business model of  Uber is that, you know, you take advantage of the drivers as much as they'll let you.  You know, you can't go too far because they'll stop working for you, but you get away with  as much as you can.  That, you know, you're already losing money.  You're trying to lose less money.  So, you know, it's not like the minimum wage you're going to get is a lot.  It's $12.40.  And it starts the time they accept the ride request.  That's another thing people wanted.  And they drop off the passenger.  Doesn't apply to the time that you're waiting for a request though.  Yeah.  So they're only guaranteeing that you'll make that much.  Oh, I see how they're going to do it.  Uber will pay drivers on vacation 12% of their earnings.  That's not a lot.  But that's the thing.  You know, if you only do it one day a week, well, you're not going to get two weeks pay.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you only do it one day a week, you're not the person that's...  Right.  You're the happy gig worker who's doing it because they just want to make extra money as opposed to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that was Ant's point.  I mean, he's standing up for gig workers.  Yep.  I feel like there should be avenues for both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree.  I mean, you know, Uber has the data.  They know exactly when they need more drivers on the road, right?  And you could have employees cover those shifts and then, you know,  or have employees that are there during that time and then have your gig folks do whenever else, you know?  Anyway, I don't know.  Just ignore me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And again, the employees do have rights.  But if you don't want to be an employee, that's a right you have to.  It's a choice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I will say there are lots of people who are stuck in untenable situations, not just because of Uber.  It's taking advantage of a societal shift that we've gone through.  Yeah.  That means people just don't have good employment anymore.  And I mean, is it Uber's fault for capitalizing on that?  Right.  Well, I mean, let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uber can't make money unless self-driving vehicles emerge.  Drivers cost too much.  And this just makes them even less desirable.  They lose a lot of money per ride because the drivers cost so much.  They can never make money.  Some people say, we'll never make money, by the way.  There's definitely a contingent of people who think Uber has just never been designed to make money ever.  But certainly drivers don't help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  With that said, how were they able to go public?  You know, how were they able to IPO and have that many people believe in them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People's painting for 70 million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Message received, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you believe that Uber is the future, and I can see how people might have believed that,  but I think more and more people are, you know, the shorts are saying, come on.  I'm not going to get involved.  I don't own any Uber stock.  All right. I want to do some picks of the week and let Stacey go and enjoy her meal.  And Jeff, try to find some Cacio e Pepe and take a week.  Pizza week. Yeah, I don't do it every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, I don't do it every week.  I was worried about me beforehand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was salad. Now it's pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it was salad first.  I'm a salad pizza. What's wrong with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what they tell me on Noom.  If you eat the salad first, you'll eat less pizza.  Enjoy and there's no bad foods.  Amen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no bad foods, but but weekly Cacio e Pepe or possibly more often given how much Jeff.  No, it's every other week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's every other week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then the bi-weeks are pizzas now?  There you go.  Now that's living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When is Chicago Hot Dog Monday?  That's the one I want to be there for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's the problem.  You know, I got it once my wife.  So even though I've had the vaccination, I act as if I don't know wife and daughter.  Right. Yes.  When I can when I can escape the bondage of don't tell my wife when I can escape the bondage of the pandemic.  God bless science. Yeah.  I already learned the Taco Bell bean burritos aren't as good as I remembered.  I would love a little pepperoni on a pizza just one just one just one slice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are no bad foods, Jeff.  Just bad people.  No, that's wrong.  That's not the rule.  All right. Coming up, our picks of the week, our numbers of the week.  Prepare your picks.  Let's kick off the picks of the week this week with Stacey Higginbotham's.  We've missed it for two whole weeks.  Thing of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so it is not.  It is not a thing.  OK, actually, yeah, you know what?  I lied to you.  It is a thing.  We're going to do a thing this week.  It's a thing.  I'm like, sure.  I installed the easy to install to 99.  Finn, let me tell you what it is.  It's OK.  OK, I can't spell.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  $299 or $2.99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Come on.  There's a chip in there.  There's a chip.  So I just want to it's the Finn Smart Water Assistant.  And so this device you can install.  Anybody can install it.  You don't need a plumber.  Some of their other devices do.  There is no water shut off, though.  So what this does is this analyzes water use throughout the home.  And it will tell me one, how much water things are using.  It looks for leaks.  And what else does it do?  It notifies me if there are leaks.  And yeah, I like it because so far I've been able to yell at my daughter when she was taking a,  are you all ready for this, a 40 minute shower?  It was like there is like something happening here.  And I was like, dang, what is it?  I'm going around.  It was like it's the shower.  And I go to my shower and then I go downstairs and I hear my daughter singing in the shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm like, that's what it means to be a teenager.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jesus.  Mom, none of your business.  You're surveilling my shower, Mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I inadvertently found a way to fix that, by the way.  I showed my daughter, Abby, Psycho when she was about seven.  And she never took another shower.  Dad of the year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Baths waste a lot more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's operant conditioning.  If she starts to get in the shower, I go, and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So wrong.  All right.  So that is in, and if you want, if you have a plumber and you want to spend the money, you can get one with an automatic shutoff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's rude because then you're standing there with soap in your hair and it's cold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And no, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's for leaks.  Like when it detects the low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, not on your daughter.  I get it. OK, because that wouldn't be nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, if I wanted to, I could go and shut the water off.  But that would be kind of a hardcore thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am so sick and tired of you taking all the hot water.  So that is just you don't have to shut off all the water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and I discovered a leaky toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so what is this thing you're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called the fin smart water assistant to ends in the fin PY no P H Y in.  Well, thank you for spelling it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think I would have found that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Looks like fine to smart water assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you got the P H Y and you got everything you need.  So you put it on one thing and it knows where all the leaks are?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're supposed to put it on like your kitchen sink.  I have to put my I don't have power by my kitchen sink.  So I put it on a bathroom sink.  Oh, you have to put it on everything that might be leaking.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you just put it in one place.  You just have to find the place to put it and then you give it it.  Oh, I like I've had it now for.  I mean, how do we know?  How do we know?  How do we know?  It's algorithms.  It measures the water pressure going through the pipes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I can tell what.  But can it tell where the leak is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  How does it know?  Once it has once it knows what's running in your house.  So it's kind of a.  It's finger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It fingerprints your pipe thing.  Your pipe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it fingerprints what it's.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microscopic water pressure changes.  So it's like 40 times a second.  It measures to recognize the unique voice of each fixture in your home.  I saw something like this at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's another company that does this called Flow.  Yeah, that's what I saw.  Yeah.  With a long O over it.  And they teamed up with Moen.  So I saw it at the Moen booth.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Both of those.  They're the same sort of thing.  And then there's a flu.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moen, flow and flume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a hard.  It's a hard world out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it is flume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is cool.  This is really cool.  So I like the 299.  I mean, look at a water leak can cost you money.  I'll never forget when I was in college, we rented a big house from a nice Ukrainian lady  named Krawchuk.  And there was a toilet in the basement and we didn't know.  We used it like at the beginning of the summer.  By the end of the summer, she had like a thousand dollar water bill and came screaming at us.  And it turned out the toilet, we had flushed it, but it was leaking and it was leaking  all summer.  You know how toilets will run sometimes?  But it was in the basement.  So we didn't know.  I felt terrible when I moved to California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's actually it discovered we had a flapper issue and it was leaking motions.  A flapper issue.  That's exactly right.  So flow logic, flume, and then there's a company called leak defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you have fin, foe, or flume, you'll never have flapper failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Flapper fluctuations?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flapper fluctuations are final with fin, foe, and flume.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is actually good.  And especially out here in California, we can't afford to waste wastewater.  We don't have enough.  So these leaks, we should actually, they should be good.  Actually, they should give us these things.  You could save $70 right now.  Pre-spring sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of insurance companies, if you have AIG or Chubb, oh, those are some fancy insurance companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We used to have Chubb.  Yeah.  They were fancy.  They'll give you a discount.  Yeah, they ought to.  But you've got to get a plumber to install this, right?  Or could you do this yourself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  The one that I have, the 299 one, and that does not have water shut off, that's very important.  So this will let me know, but it is not going to shut off my water.  That one does not need a plumber.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No plumber necessary.  There are ones.  Turn off the water under your sink.  There are ones that.  Unthread the hot and cold water hoses from the supply lines and insert fin sensors.  Connect the device to Wi-Fi and you're good to go.  Well, that doesn't look too hard.  I could probably do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very easy.  You've got a plug socket near there.  Yes.  Does it matter where on the water supply you put it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you just need something with a hot water and a cold water.  And it should be something that's used relatively often.  That's why they recommend the kitchen sink because they use it a lot.  Cool.  But even your, any bathroom sink should work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So fin plus is the one with the shut off.  That needs a plumber probably.  So I'm going to just get the fin.  Yeah.  And then don't forget the coupon.  Let's see if that coupon works.  Discount code.  Paste that in pre spring sale.  Brings the price down to 250 bucks.  Actually 229 before tax.  That's not so bad.  Considering what it's saving you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis.  If you have a leak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you have a leak.  If you never have a leak, what's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you never have a leak.  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  So somebody in the chat room saying, well.  If you have.  Are the sensors going to map these?  Oh, if you have a leak.  Oh, if you install this device and you have a leak at that time.  It's just going to sue.  That's normal.  Yeah.  And a calibration.  No, no, no, no, no.  Right.  It doesn't.  No, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't.  That's how it.  So I installed it and it knew that my toilet was working.  Cause my, my toilet was.  It could tell it was running all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  It was like, yeah, this is not a good toilet basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, okay.  That's worse.  I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's way too cold.  If you have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you leave your faucet running all the time, then maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It might get mad at you.  It did take.  It gave me a couple.  Cause it was like, Hey, we found this.  Is that a, what is that?  And I'm like, uh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Finn Ph.  Y N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How would you then determine how, how would you, you say, okay, Finn, what is it you're  telling me?  You have an app.  It happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the app.  It happened at 2 46 PM.  Uh, you know, how do you then tie the, it's question to finding out the event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, so it only alerts me when it notices weird behavior.  Um, so it's like, Hey, this, this is weird.  Do you know what this is?  You have a daughter and I'll be like, Oh yeah, that was my shower.  Oh, so it doesn't assume it's wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It just says, you know, I noticed this anomaly.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And you'll get, I mean, and it takes it time again to learn.  Um, and when you launch it, you also do, it's not just a calibration thing.  It's a plumbing check where it tries to check your pipes for small leaks.  Um, hold on.  It's trying to talk to me.  The app is a little slow.  I will say that.  Um, and you can, you know, it's nice to be able to see your water usage and,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it can tell you water usage too.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it gives you the percentage of like, we not surprisingly use a lot of water in the  shower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, this is good.  I like this, especially if you're in a drought area like we are.  My tip is do not use SMS for two factor authentication.  If you know anybody who's using it, stop.  Joseph Cox writes for vice for the motherboard section.  A hacker got all my texts for $16.  It, now I have to say Joseph Cox hired the hacker to demonstrate this lucky 225.  And what he did was it turns out there's a company called Sakari that does business text  messaging in order to do that.  They also need to impersonate your phone number because it's, you know, you don't want a  business text message to come from somebody else's phone number.  But all you need is a letter of authorization from the owner of the phone number to do that.  And then you can send and receive text messages to that phone number.  The hacker made a fake letter of authorization.  Sakari took it, said, great.  And he was able to receive all the text messages, go into Cox's phone.  If it had been a real bad guy, would have used that to hack two factor and all sorts  of stuff.  All of this is simple, simple hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know what I'm finding?  Some, I guess you can't call them all merchants, but some things that you log into, they don't  offer you the ability to use an OTP or something like that.  It's either an email or SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  And so what I'm, I know.  And what I'm saying is send them this article from Vice and say, my bank does that.  My bank, the two factor is SMS, period.  There's no other way to do it.  They need to know this.  What's your bank?  I don't want to say the name.  What do you want, Stacey?  The name and phone number?  Is that what you're looking for?  What is your mother's maiden name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, I need your OCR routing number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really, it just shows you, I mean, we've known for a long time SMS is a very poor way  to do two factor.  This just puts it over the top.  Just not, you know, just don't if you can.  And you're right, aunt, a lot of companies do.  So send them this and say, can you stop?  Give me some other, all you have to do is give me, you know, OTP and I'll be happy.  You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you down with OTP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm down, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that, were you doing a song?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was.  Ish.  Down with OTP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Jeff Jarvis, number of the week.  Thank you, aunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Stacey goes back to the past with the water net.  And I'm going to go with whale net.  Whale net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aqua net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Aqua net for Stacey.  That sounds like you, hairspray.  Yeah, exactly.  So a new study published by the Royal Society found that whales changed their behavior over  the years around the world when attacked by humans in the 19th century.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you mean whaling boats?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whaling boats.  And so after humans started attacking whales, orcas were there, was the sperm whales only  enemy was the orca.  And they had a strategy wherein they would circle around and put their tails out to bat  the orcas away.  And that made it very easy for the whalers to kill the whales.  So the whales quickly not only learned but communicated with each other in ways we do  not understand.  So that after a few years, the rate of whalers harpoons fell by 58% according to recently  digitized log books.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it was the first network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That they fished them out or something?  They killed all the ones they could find?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it wasn't just that they killed them all.  It wasn't the first network.  Trees talk to each other.  They've been doing that for millennia.  Did you guys know that Amazon has a Stitch Fix?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's a Stitch Fix?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A personal shopping service?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you just find that out?  Did you just advertise it to me?  And I was like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had for a long time that thing that you take pictures of your outfits.  Didn't I send that to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You sent it to me and they killed it.  They depreciated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No longer can Jeff Bezos judge my fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I assumed that that was a precursor to Stitch Fix, to something that would help you.  Why would they want to take all my pictures of my outfits if it wasn't to suggest something  a little better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe it was to train it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, maybe.  Maybe it's not a stylist.  Maybe it's what's left of that Amazon look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this insider gave Amazon a good review for its custom t-shirts where you take a picture  of yourself.  Oh, and it measures you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was our sponsor.  Boy, they sent me.  I'll wear it next Wednesday.  That was our sponsor.  Remember Taylor's store?  Do you remember that?  Taylor's store.  And they had an app that you put on your phone.  They started with shirts and then they did genos and then they started doing jackets  and suits.  So I ordered a suit from them and I loved it.  I said it came out great.  And they sent me just a few months ago, they sent me a three piece suit.  I'll wear it.  You'll love it.  Wait a minute.  I wore it.  I did wear it.  That was on a Sunday.  That was a Sunday show.  You never dress up for us.  I'll dress up for you.  You only dress up for the big show.  I will wear this suit.  I'll even wear it.  Oh, it's a beautiful suit.  We're the kids show.  But that's cool, right?  That they take a picture.  In this case, because it was an expensive suit, the first one I ordered, not that expensive,  it's fairly expensive merchandise, a few hundred bucks.  They send you a canvas suit that you try it on and then you take more pictures and you  say it's a little tight.  And then they sent me another one after the feedback and that one fit perfectly.  I said, yes, ship it.  But now they have my measurements.  So they sent me another suit.  This is really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it.  That's awesome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I play this Naughty by Nature video or are we going to get in trouble?  We'll get in trouble.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a legit song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OPP?  Yeah.  We'll get in trouble.  You down with OPP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm down with OPP.  I don't want to know what it means.  It is Aunt Pruitt's turn for a pick of the week.  I love that number, by the way, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My pick is this morning we did Floss Weekly and had a pretty important person on there.  You ever heard of Drupal?  Yes, you have because you're a twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're on our website.  You're soaking in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't use Drupal?  Yeah.  Bearte was on the show.  They're cool.  Doc Searles and Catherine Druckmann chatted with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She works at Acquia, which is actually I think the first hosting company we used for our  website.  Yep, Acquia.  It's a Drupal hosting site that Dries founded.  I will listen to this one.  In fact, I will listen to this one.  The last week you did Tiddly Wiki, which is one of my favorite Wikis.  Oh, yeah.  You guys are knocking it out of the park on Floss Weekly.  Yeah, Stacey, we use the twit website's Drupal, Tech Guy Labs' Drupal.  When I first started the podcast network, I needed a website and I looked at all the  content management systems and at the time it was like Drupal 2 or 3.  I picked it and we've been using Drupal ever since.  We have a very sophisticated Drupal setup.  It's called Headless Drupal.  Our API and our workflow are all run by Drupal in the background.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember before I realized that GigaOM was funded by True, which had funded WordPress.  I had suggested Drupal and they were like, no.  No, we'll be using WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were like, oh, we're a WordPress shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should explain Drupal as a content management system, kind of like WordPress.  It's a way of creating a website.  But as I said, we don't have a front end that's running in Drupal, only our backend.  The front end is a Node.js website that gets the data from the Drupal API.  There's a whole description of how that works on the website at twit.tv.  It's really, really crazy sophisticated.  We really love it.  You have another pick too, I think, Ant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes?  Oh, yeah, my other pick because you mentioned YouTube shorts and I was like, oh, yeah, I  still have my short out there that I did on my channel, youtube.com slash Ant Pruitt.  I still haven't gotten around to shooting another one yet, but I want to do more content  like this going forward on my channel.  I forgot, yeah.  And I'll still do some tutorials here and there, but I figured I want to do more stuff  like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You shoot the short in vertical or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no.  I think I shot this with my cine cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's kind of short.  There's somebody sleeping.  Here comes a duck.  I wrote the script.  Did you?  So it's a movie.  You made a little movie.  Here comes a duck.  Here comes a giant duck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to do more like that.  Cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's called Find It, a short film.  Oh, and I'm glad you have video of Kylo.  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, check it out.  It's got a good message to it.  I think this audience would appreciate it.  Very nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.  We will.  Folks, make like a sperm whale and swim around in a circle and we'll be back in a week.  How about that?  Just avoid the void.  Keep the orcas away.  Keep the orcas away.  I don't know.  We do the...  Oh, first, let's say hello to our panelists.
