Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I I I amuse myself and myself alone apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, this is this is not the floor, but I mean it's just a trade show. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So let us uh move briskly  Through these stories because they're actually quite a few  Starting with the story that if you had a pixel phone with a bad microphone  Which I think jeff you did have right many people had no I was actually okay. It was very common

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was a bad microphone. Not a bad screen

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  uh, well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that a different?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a class action lawsuit brought by owners of the original pixel  Okay, oh, yeah, that's the more modern pixel at a bad screen. This is the og pixel the one you had carston

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never had a single problem with until the battery conked out after google. Uh has uh settled

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The judge will decide what the fine could be it could be up to 500 dollars per pixel owner  But uh, the judge again has to decide that  Pixel and pixel xl devices man your manufacturer before january 4th 2017  Are covered  Google admitted there was an issue by march  It said 1 of pixel phones had a hairline crack in the solder connection on the audio codec

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Which caused issues with calling and hardware if the world were just software everything would be okay hardware is hard  And it wouldn't run. I have adams suck. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the court has yet to give its final approval  There will be a link to a claim form  But it's not yet live you can go to the law firm  Which is apparently called chimicals schwarz krinner and donaldson smith  Which is not the best name rolls off the tongue chimicals  Has a site where you can say hey, I had one of those  At chimicals.com c h i m i c l e s  Or maybe it's chimiclees might be chimiclees  dot com  Um, anyway, that's actually surprising and I I it's not going to be a huge loss for google  In fact, you get some sense of how many phones they sold at most at seven and a quarter million dollars. They'll have to pay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow, that is not a lot of not a lot of phones do the math  I'm surprised. They don't have to just exchange

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Supposedly even if you didn't have this problem, you can still get 20 bucks out of this  If you had a pixel, wow, is it worth the trouble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No  Yeah, but that's that's very classist to ask that a lot of people would be like sure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know that no what i'm saying actually is how much trouble will they put you to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because it may not just putting be putting a stamp on a postcard. It might be right. That's that's what i'm saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that is that you know by the time you calculate you do still have your receipt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a proof of purchase

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From 2017 right? Yeah, exactly. Jesus who doesn't save those  I saved those you need to pay me dig into my dig into my files here and find it

Transcript:  Yeah, she's lisa does too everything she uses  honey.com  And a bunch of other things for like she won't buy anything without looking for a coupon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, you shouldn't right? Oh, no, that's  I mean they're on it's online dude. You just google it  It's  There's chrome extensions that do it I know I know she uses them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't I just not me. I don't know why it's just not me, but you're right. It's uh, it's what is it?  Privilegist  It's something-ist  It's i've never had to i'm all worry about money as an old white man. I am all of the above  Nest now I really want stacey's take on this because she covers iot  Ronam audio wrote an article that might be I think considered by some a little bit  um

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Detroit

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah  He went a bit overboard. Maybe he went a little bit overboard  So, uh, in fact florence eyen said i'm doing some she says i'm doing some research on this because I don't know if I buy it  He writes nest the company died at google iot 2019 the nest ecosystem is dead nest accounts are dead nest  Privacy firewall is dead. You remember when google acquired nest tony fidel famously said don't worry. Google's not going to get your information  But there's also of course a works with nest program  And the works with nest program is going to be deprecated  In fact, here's the here's the post on the works with nest site. It's winding down

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's what's going to happen  Google basically at google.io said  It took nest from a series of devices that have  historically had their own intelligence  And agency so it there was a direct api that lets you control them and the nest devices talk to your stuff and vice versa  By killing the works with nest program  And switching it all through the google assistant in google home  What it's done is it stuck the google home in as a middle man. So now  Think of the nest devices as zombies. They are now controlled via the google home  And this is bad news for a lot of companies. It was sudden news for many companies  so  Every company out there that has worked with has done a worked with nest works with nest integration  Now has to go back and basically build a routine through google and that includes if this than that  Includes ift it includes hue it includes lutron it includes it includes amazon anybody who's been controlling their amazon or their nest thermostat  Through their amazon echo  Amazon has to work with google now through this and amazon will get their own  It's not a skill. It's a routine or  some sort of integration  so  This isn't this isn't great. I mean if you don't have a google home  You're going to be like well crap now. I need some sort of home device from google in my house to control my nest

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't use your android device your android phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can but you can't do it when you're away because there's not a device you need a hub at home  Okay, got it. Yeah, that is my understanding now  I don't have my nest stuff because I moved out and so i've decommissioned all that I can't play with this  I would so if you're a person with nest gear and you're like  What does this mean will I lose all functionality  You may lose some functionality in june. You're going to be asked to switch over from a nest account to a google account  Your you shouldn't do that yet though because you have until the end of august august 31st 2019  And I would wait for the integrations that matter to you for those companies to actually announce that they've completed them and tested them  Because otherwise you're going to kill functionality without being able to recreate it just yet

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not stacey will you presumably everybody goes through this if it will work again these things will work again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just once they go through the effort. Yes, everybody has to go through this effort  And the reason why google did this is because now it has greater control over what devices  Access your nest gear beforehand  I was accessing my nest gear through like ift and amazon and all these other things and I would sometimes  Stop those connections and then other things would still try to it was kind of a security  Challenge and it's a privacy challenge  so in relation to this google actually announced a privacy program for their smart home sensor products  and  I have a lot of thoughts on this  So we'll get into that next but ask me any more questions about works with in general

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is this a good and necessary thing or a greedy and horrible thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's both  um  like life  Like life there's two. I mean, yes  It's going to allow google to you'll have one place to go for privacy information and to understand  What devices have access to what data because beforehand google couldn't tell you?  Who had access to your nest thermostat you went through nest and some things still work some things didn't it was all iffy and google couldn't  Google couldn't control the ecosystem  The flip side is google couldn't control the ecosystem and a lot of people like that  Because they want to feel like they're in control of the ecosystem got it. What about privacy though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Aren't some people concerned that now the firewall between google and nest is breached?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean the fact that they had the firewall from the deal in  2013 when it was announced or 20 was it 2013 or 2014 that it closed?  whatever so the fact that it's lived for this long is actually really impressive and  What google's done is they're not using this. Okay, and here's where we get and I wrote about this  So feel free to link to my story on google's privacy thing google put out a privacy policy  Dedicated to sensor devices and in it it did some really great things it said hey  Here's all of our devices. Here's all the sensors in it. Here's what those here's the data those sensors collect, which is something  I think everything should do  Um, and then it said we're not going to use the data collected by those things  for advertising  And it was very clear on this some of that data  All of the sensor home data is not going to be used for advertising  now  That's good. That's what a lot of people are worried about. It is not the end all be all because  Advertising is for the web and this is the smart home the data  They're collecting is going to be valuable not necessarily for advertising  Although it could be used like if they wanted indirectly might be used for advertising. It doesn't matter advertising  Advertising is not the big thing. We need to worry about here. What we need to worry about is having algorithmically generated  Decisions made for us for prices. We pay for goods things like insurance  Access to health care or access to services and that google isn't talking about at all in their privacy policy  They're just like yeah, we're going to keep this data. We're not going to show it to other people  So we're not going to share it. We're not going to show you advertising based on it  So everyone's like, oh good that's the bullet  But really they're not saying that we're not going to use this to build services and products and those services and products  could end up  Could end up putting a consumer in kind of a bad spot

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, give us just one  Sure potential scenario

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's say google has all this information now about the devices in my home. They could come in and say  Hey, would you like electricity service from us?  We can use this data to provide a more competitive rate, which sounds really good  But then once they have that competitive rate, how are they going to behave?  Does anyone else have that access to data? Can they offer a similar product? We know when you're home

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We know when you're not home, right? And of course, we're going to save you money by turning down your ac  So you know you're cold-blooded

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it creates the same sort of monopoly effect or duopoly possibly effect that like  The cable and isp providers have by virtue of owning the pipe by owning access to our smart home data  If it's a single company who has that they can build all kinds of competitive services on top of that that no one else can touch  And though that's one example another example might be  Google could start like a health care  brokerage health or health insurance brokerage, you know and start

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we have to stop thinking that the hazard is that these companies are going to share our private information with third parties  Because that's one of the hazards but it's not the only hazard

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we have to stop thinking about the only hazard is being advertising the web was built on advertising  We're building something that isn't the web. We're building the internet of things and that is going to be  A data you're going to have database service data based services

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the hazards let's be clear is in the eye of the beholder  You may love your low-priced electric service. It's just a question of whether you are informed enough to make a good choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you may love it until there is no other choice and then they check up the prices. Yeah. Yeah, there's that too  The problem with monopoly is not that it doesn't provide great service, but that by virtue of having a monopoly  You eliminate the elasticity of supply and demand pricing the step before the monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, and you may never get to monopoly what what I think I hear stacy saying is that  Is that it's not a question of a monopoly. It's a question of you live in an ecosystem where you have limited information  There may be 10 other competitors. You don't know about them

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you have both limited information and then they have built a wall of data basically around you that  It becomes impossible to leave  It's kind of like what people are talking about when they're talking about regulating facebook and like they're talking about like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple's doing this too every every company seems to be moving into this idea of siloing you  Uh and creating a walled garden that is, you know that works well

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, it'll be it'll be wonderful to be highly customized for you  there's there's benefits and drawbacks to that depending on how you feel about the world, but  at the end of the day  it's a very dystopian vision and I don't  I don't think we want that I would like to keep the keep the competitive  The barrier to

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The yeah, it's the same argument people give against the smart city that google's building in toronto  It's not that a smart city won't have better commute better bus service better electrical service  It's that it will all be owned by one company. You're suddenly in the company town

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well there it's also what is google going to do with that data?  Going to do with that data and how are they going to charge for access to that data for both cities and people and privacy and blah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I for one am building an ark to take me to google island

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For well you might by 80 cubits you might be there by by default you may not have  There's also a short-term pain point which is anybody who has configured an elaborate smart home  You're lucky stacy. You just took yours apart. Yes, you're gonna have to reconfigure it  You're gonna have to start all over again all your scripts all your automated routines and everything  But the good news is they're pulling off the band-aid this you probably once you move into the nice warm embrace  Of the google bath, you won't have to ever leave it  Follow the light show  And it's the exact same promise apple offers and amazon offers and google offers yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I would say  There's gonna be a lot of people who this news is gonna surprise they don't they know they have nest gear  They may have done smart home integrations or maybe like their kids did it or their right a friend of theirs came over and did it  They're gonna get an email sometime in june. That's gonna be like what do I do?  Your nest account is now your google account. They're gonna be like what why what's happening?  so I think there's actually gonna be a lot of confusion and it's not the kind of confusion where a  geeky nerdy people are like  I need a more open ecosystem. They're gonna be like what the hell is happening, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, if you hired somebody to come in and wire your house and set it all up  You're gonna have to hire them again

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there are plenty like uh  Lenar uses oh no lenar uses honeywell  Um, there are companies that have put in like smart home as the amazon home. They're the amazon home  They they are the amazon home. There is a google home, but I can't remember kb home is using google. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that and by the way the reason lenar a big developer and uh  Kb home a big developer does this is because it's a desirable thing consumers go. Hey cool. I got a smart home  It's all configured pre-configured ready to go out of the box. That's that's a selling point

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ironically when I talked to lenar about theirs probably about a year and a half to two years ago  I was like so hey, how are you gonna handle it when people move and they were like, uh, they're never gonna move

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stacey's intimately intimately of familiar with this issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I need to follow up with them and be like hey, so it's been about two years  Has anyone moved out yet? And what did they do? Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you know they're prisoners, they're not allowed go to stacey on iot.com

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because she's written a guide to moving from your smart home and there's stuff you want to disconnect there's stuff  I mean, there's it's not it's not immediately obvious

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, well stacey. I haven't been to ask you  Have you had to do any customer service calls on your house buyers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, she has her own uh, av guy  Oh  We actually offered as part of as part of it. I was like, hey i'll come over for an hour  You know just to help you set anything up. Just give me a call. That's the new thing. You have to have an av guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When you buy a new house. Well leo you have a few yeah, i'm me. I'm me. I'm the av guy  And by the way, i'm not a very good av guy  So each tv has its own particular set of rules  Set of rules

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, oh boy, does your lovely wife feel at you? Oh, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She says I just want to watch tv, please

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You haven't set up like a logitech box or something where you can just say yeah, I try those things those things are you know in

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  some ways worse  Because if they worked perfectly then they wouldn't be but they don't work perfectly and so when they don't work then they really in a  bind  She says she just says you can't die

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, yeah, well that's ah, ah  There's your wall guard a way to yeah way to stay alive. Yeah, I have to live forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right, we had a uh  listener to the radio show call  Uh this week he said because you were talking about how you wrote a manual  for uh  People who came to your house so they could know how to watch tv and it was it was a fairly elaborate guide to using our television set  And uh, and he said you inspired me and I wrote an app for the iphone first. I did it  Myself take pictures make this guide built it in mic and apple's keynote and uh and printed it out as like a  Instruction but then I realized oh, you know, this would be a good app  So he actually has made an app for ios. I think it's called pickstructions  I can't remember where you take pictures of your stuff the app then you can organize it you can put in the instructions  And then you can share a qr code  With your the new tenants or the house sitters and say here's how you operate everything. Is that a good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it is we I I had done an amazon echo blueprint for  uh guide to turning on the tv  That isn't the ask ask madam a to turn it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and I do have the fire tv cube, which in theory you can instruct  but  I don't know  It doesn't seem to be as reliable as just well first you turn on the satellite box  Then you turn on the av receiver. No, that's why you need it. So that's where the logitech harmony actually  I have a harmony hub. I know  Haven't you set it up yet? It doesn't I have and it's a pain in the ass. It doesn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mine I just say ask madam a or ask google to turn on with google  You have to say ask harmony to turn on television  No, actually you don't because you can create a routine that says turn on television. No, we just say turn on television. It turns on  Then we use a roku controller to control the channel. Uh-huh. Yeah, see that's the problem is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't get you all the way there. You can't just say I want to watch game of thrones

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh you can you just need to have so for that you need to have a chrome cast in google assistant or you need to have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A fire tv stick and amazon echo see see this is why living in one ecosystem  Is a lovely and enticing thing for mortals. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unlike you guys right? Well, you have to get your television on so you'd have to say hey google or hey a turn on television  And then you'd say hey a or hey google

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Watch game of thrones give this guy a plug in your on your newsletter. It's called  Picstructions it's only ios right now archersmith llc  And it's really just one guy. He wrote the whole thing and I think it's a really uh clever idea. That's cute  Yeah, isn't that a great idea how to clean the breville tea maker?  Oof is right  Um  Yeah, this is why I really don't really automate that much because I feel like it's just  It's hard I have I have an  Logitech harmony hub  I guess I could try setting it up. The problem is I'd have  We have many tv tv  Stations in the house sets we call them sets. No, no, it's not just a set. It's a whole thing  Including furniture. I think of them more as um  Kind of a station like that you you would go to your the tv station not a channel but like uh, you know  A kiosk. It's a tv. There are tv kiosks throughout the home. There are two of y'all and how many tvs  Well, we just put tv stations put one in the bedroom. There's one in lisa's office. There's one in the gym  There's one in the living room. There's one in my den. There's one in the game room  How many is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a lot of rooms six. I don't know. Yeah, we got at least so many here

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have one television. Yeah, you really it's almost embarrassed. It is almost it is embarrassing to admit honestly

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, yeah, I remember a cable guy saying you got how many yeah, it's kind of but you're a former tv critic

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have an excuse  I did  I'm a former geek

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so yeah the other day I I got home from my trip  And uh, i'm watching tv one of the rooms and it won't work  I can't go on and i'm thinking I have to come buy a tv tonight, of course two new batteries

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or you could just buy a new tv  Um, yeah, we don't normally we were against adverse to the notion of a television in the bedroom  We solve that problem. You can't watch it from the bed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's just where do you watch your do you have like chairs in your bedroom? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a little why why would you want to watch the tv in the bedroom?  And then the bed is in a different part of the bedroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's like torturing you have too many tvs and maybe too much house, you know, I think you live in the good place

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's kind of like the good place. It's it's a big house. There are three of us. There's a teenager as well, but okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they they need at least five rooms

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a kind of a mcmansion. I'll be honest with you and uh, and uh, I think it's almost 5 000 square feet. So there's  You can't you need we have a little golf cart to get around. It's nice. Uh, but anyway  Uh  Jeeves, will you carry me upstairs?  No, it's flat. That's the beauty of it. One of the things one of the goals was no stairs

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you have a golf cart that you ride around outside or i want you to be honest. What's your always joking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have a golf cart. Okay. Have you ever used a scooter inside the house? It's a segway actually. It's a little segway

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh dear

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, no, I actually I just sit on the rumbo. We have the rumba set up to go  Um back and forth like a little shuttle. It's a it's a rumba shuttle and so i'll just sit on the rumba  And it'll take me segways electric bikes  We do have a lot of electric vehicles. We have a significant number of electric vehicles as well  But none of them are in the house  Wow, okay  uh  in fact, I watched game of thrones, uh, the uh, the episode three the dark one no spoilers  No, won't say a thing. I ruined it on sunday. I actually did spoil it by accident. We cut that out  Uh, it was in that it was a slip of the but I did watch it on a number of different televisions to get an idea  Of if it was too dark or if it was the tv and I did find a perfect tv for watching it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that's why it's also your codec was screaming about that. It was very dark just just had a fit  well, and then last sunday the name of the director and and and  Doxed them and went crazy. It was just the stream. The stream was bad. The stream was bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was gonna say it's not your tv. It's your codec and how they were compressed

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was the tv too because the tv was doing some scaling upscaling on it  And so the 4k tv actually did a very bad job of upscaling the tinnitus  Anyway, I have been enjoying game of thrones apparently the the new thing if you're cool and with it is to dis game of thrones  And say  Paris martin. I did this on twitter a few weeks back. I stopped watching when they uh departed from the canon of the books  Because I feel that they haven't lived up to george rr martin's original vision

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's not done with this original vision. You can't live up to it. Well, that's why they stopped

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so that's one of the things in fact, there's a great meme on reddit  Maybe you can find this I can't find it carsten where they have the uh seasons of game of thrones and it starts with a beautifully drawn  Horse's tail and then by the end by season eight. It's like a four-year-old from the fox head and then  years on it  Um, everybody everybody's a critic with game of thrones, but I am enjoying it. I am enjoying it. Um, that's all i'm gonna say  I'm enjoying it. It's fun  Okay, uh, we did the iot thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey out

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How about that easy the coolest thing I saw at google io  Andrew gebhart writes  Is a tiny chip that could eliminate smart home lag

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay  We have to level set here because I don't know andrew gebhart. This is not a story about a chip  This is a story about a software development kit that's sitting on a module

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So andrew andrew andrew, please an stk is not a chip

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think he may be confused because google at google io did something very cool. They announced a  What are they calling?  Stk  There's two things so I think what's confusing him and we'll talk about the stk in a second  But they announced basically a module that has the ability. It's got all the radios. It's pre-certified  Well, that's how you back into google. It's a module. We'll wait though  On it is the local stk, but this the hardware they announced  Is very similar to amazon's  uh  Oh gosh ac uh, alexa connect kit  So they did that in september and that's basically like so you could just throw this pre-certified module into anything and build something that works with

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Madam a so azure has something microsoft says something like that as well, right?  But it's more security focused

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have so they have a module that's pre-certified to work with their uh project azure sphere, but that is security focused. Yeah  Um, it doesn't have voice focus voice

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This seems like a good idea because there are a lot of small chinese iot manufacturers  Who don't have the wherewithal to do it, right for one thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, okay. Yes on the security thing. Are we moving to security or you want well, but it's related isn't it?  Maybe not maybe this is no. I mean that's a pretty common thing to do is to say hey  I'm going to put all the functionality. I mean, it's kind of like what a reference design has been historically

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also what your smartphone is is this it's called a system on a chip  Everything is in this soc

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, okay, so a little bit different  um, not everything you need for a smartphone is on it's more like if  they gave you  the soc for your computing which is what's on your smartphone and  They also did the radio the radios and all the things to make a make it a it does for some but not everything and it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Obviously you're gonna custom. Yeah, it's gonna you're gonna customize it. You're gonna do more to it, but  Qualcomm's socs are a pretty complete package. Is this like that? No for iot. No

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No a system on a chip it has  It can have the radios, but it doesn't always have the radios. It just means you have this  You have like your memory and your processing power and your networking and everything is already on there and in  packaged right  On a single chip when we talk about a module that is a couple of chips packaged together  So what we're talking about here are modules, which is the compute power  It's probably got a accelerator for like language processing. Maybe I don't know  um, it's got and then it's  In the amazon case and I assume in the google case the radios are all pre-certified with the fcc  in any agencies where you  Offer the service so you can literally just throw this in a device. There's no  There's nothing you need to do on the outside  Um, and it would have like the microphones it would have things like that also on it  Soc doesn't have all of that. No, no, this is much more complete than an soc. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what would I add? It's like a board. Okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You might add if you wanted like an extra microphone  You could add that or if you wanted  I mean some people don't add anything some people are like i'm building a clock and I want it to be an  Clock and they just pop that in is it for end users or is it? No, it's for developers  It's for people who want to build products that work with this and think about like with iot  If you want to build if you're a lamp maker and you're really good at building lamps  You just put this in here and now you've got a lamp so it turns any conventional device into an internet of things device  Yeah, I mean you have to have a microphone and speaker stuff. That's also attached to it. Oh, well, no, I thought you said it includes all that  Yes, the chip does but you still have to have  I mean you have to design for the speaker and a microphone on it as well. Yeah  Sorry  I'm like there's there's a lot here. Anyway  But what he's talking about in this story and it is really cool is an sdk the software development kit  That is part of this module. I think I don't again you still need the module. This is just the software control  This is a soft in any way you don't have to have the module to have the sdk  I could actually build a connected device not using the module run the local home sdk  And basically what google's home device will do is it looks for that and will send all of your commands locally if possible  And that just means it's going to be faster in your home your faster resolution between command and action  And then afterwards it's going to report the state back up to the cloud  And it defaults to local but goes to the cloud if the local isn't available

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is it's it's in software. It's like writing a library basically and it's a way of these companies amazon google  Whoever else does such a thing to kind of get you to use their stuff and and make it work with google  It just makes it super easy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is really important in iot because they're not tech people necessarily building this stuff, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the google assistant sdk lets you add hot word detection voice control natural language understanding and google smarts  Ie, I guess ai to your project  Whatever it is  So your project which will include the hardware module or not, but it will have a microphone for instance  It'll capture an audio request like what's on my calendar and sends it to the sdk which then interfaces with the google assistant  Google assistant sends back a spoken audio response which you then render on your built-in speaker that you included

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And kevin says he's they're seeing 300 milliseconds latency with local home. Holy cow. That's super fast a third of a second

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's amazing  There is a uh, it's a raspberry pi if you want you could use a raspberry pi or any linux arm or linux x86  architecture ubuntu desktop  Uh, that's pretty cool. It uses python as the interface language  It does support hands-free activation in other words it understands, okay  Oh that yeah, that was that was sufficient to activate mine, so I guess i'm sorry I apologize  Now I know I could say okay gonna activate my phone  um  Audio capture and playback built in and if you have again that hardware module would do that  conversational state management  timers and alarms playbacks of podcasts and news  We could build a little twit device

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, you could you could build. Oh, you could build a connected bobblehead leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no stacey stacey stacey, you know what we must build

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh queso a crockpot that punching  Okay punch leo  Oh nice  You'll see that our challenge there is the servo to actually do the punch it's not the voice command

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, we know we know how to make it work and uh, i've just paid i've paid  Burke twice what you offered him to keep him from building it  Uh, I have a standing offer for all our engineers whenever anybody asks you to build such a thing. I will pay you twice  What they offer you?  Oh, it has visual output via html5 of assistant responses when you oh, no, that's the service not the library  This is pretty, uh, pretty nifty  So if you have a raspberry pi you can play with it right now

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, see there's that you don't need a chip don't need this chip

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, but and again end users can or cannot buy the google  What are they what do they call the google the module?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, let me get the right words. Um, they gave it away at oh man  But they're gonna it's gonna be available later and it's called google assistant connect. So gac

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good you went to that secret session. You got it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess so  I don't know. I didn't go to the I didn't go to io because I was doing something else last week  Which makes me so sad  Um kevin just sent me the link to the local technologies for the smart home google io 19 video on youtube  So I i'm not on the uh chat so I can't put it in the chat. Sorry y'all  It's not loading for some reason. That's okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, that's cool. I wonder but so do you think they'll ever oh geez louise?  It is working  Reach me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently berk is working on it  I told you i'd pay you twice what stacey's paying you nothing you can pay  There's nothing stay nothing leo can offer him that stacey can't top

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was gonna say my my cheer and happiness all fellas stay on call you will be called upon

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My joy  I want to buy this  Thing though. I want a gac

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Um, I think you have to wait till october and then the local home sdk will be in developer preview soon  As per kevin, so it's not available yet, but then you can download it onto a pi or something like that  And does it google actually has their they have their any a and y  And they have a google assistant any but I don't know how that fits in with any of this  And those were they had a computer vision one and a voice activated one and they were like how you could play with some of google's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nlp technology and then I think this would be you know, I mean I bought the amazon racer that little car  That amazon is offering it's not it'll come in a couple of months. This is a lower level thing  Yeah, I understand but i'm just saying this is a good thing to encourage  hobbyists and people you know to experiment with it, especially kids high school kids and  The like to experiment with it. They should they should make these sort of available  Sell them on the adafruit or something. They just announced it. I mean, right maybe they will maybe they will

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or they'll kill it after a few months and we'll never know  It's google who knows

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, great, but you know, that's a great way. Um  so  a bunch of michael's uh  teenage friends they're all  Sophomores in high school have come to me and said we want to learn programming help us learn how to code  And so i've agreed somehow to figure out a way to do this like every friday we'll meet and we'll we'll do something  and  Honestly, the best way to do something like that is to have some piece of hardware  That they can attempt to write something actually, uh, that's we talked about last week. That's what kevin elkins  Thing is for younger kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, do they want to code or do they want to play with like an arduino?  Because those I mean they want to code I could get an arduino

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They want to code but I just think it's a lot easier. It's less abstract  You can teach somebody to code but it's less abstract if you're coding and something does something  But but you're right we could absolutely uh  In fact what i'm thinking of doing is sitting down and we're going to watch harvard's  CS50 their introductory computing science class, which is online for free at edx.org  And watch the video every friday night and then we'll do the assignments through the week and then  I'm thinking of just doing that that would take some of the onus off me. I think they're smart kids  They're at least as smart as a harvard freshman, right karsten  Absolutely  When you're a freshman, you're really not that bright. No, you're not that you're not that bright when you graduate  Well, I don't know about that  After a long wait sonos is readying the google assistant update for next week  So if you've got a one of the more new like a sonos one or the sonos beam  Oh, it's today you could uh may 14th  It's this moment this this moment in time. You could be doing it. I have a sonos one at home. I bought  The sonos not the beam but the other one the one that sits under the tv. I wonder if that's beam like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that the beam or is that the sound bar? That's the sound beam is the little sound bar

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the little sound bar, but then they also have the  The one that's like you put the but I think it's probably just a beam in a box  I don't know  So that's cool still buying sonos  You know somebody asked me should I buy sonos and I feel like  Sonos is over

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  honestly, we just sold our sonos amps for  A pretty chunk of money not as much money as we paid for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I was surprised but would you recommend somebody's buy new sonos? Obviously not you got rid of yours

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I got rid of mine because I I moved out of my house with the in  Ceiling speakers. Oh, I didn't need to drive them anymore. Um  but probably I  The sonos ones are nice kevin actually reviewed the sonos one google implementation. He discovered that  um  You can't you can only pick one

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like the highlander. You can only have one you can't have both echo and google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you have to choose one when you set it up  That's a bummer now. You can go back in afterwards and set it up the other way change your mind  It's a software defined preference  Interesting I thought it was um, so that may be a limit that may be a limitation of the  It could be your computational power available for listening for the wake word but it  But they designed it for that. So I don't think that would be it actually see

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I just bought a play bass for for our new tv kiosk  And uh, I don't think it's I think it's more like the old one. Not the new one  Um  That's gonna be a bummer. I do have a sonos one though in my closet along with  Along with the echo spot so I can I can have a conversation with both  I'm a very very busy closet  I'm an idiot. I'm just saying that out loud  Oh, we should mention this just in real briefly  That if you bought the titan security key to secure your google stuff  You might want a replacement google's now announced that the titan security key can be exploited  And they are offering a replacement version  There's a misconfiguration on the titan security key pairing protocol  This affects the battery powered fob not the physical usb key. Of course, you get them both in a bundle  If an attacker is physically close to you within 30 feet  Uh, they can communicate with your security key  Well, that's not seems kind of obvious  that's well, I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it could be anything from a radio exploit. I mean bluetooth is not

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Notoriously secure

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is not it relies. I mean it's  Up until iot though  The risk model was that a you weren't using it quite as much and b it was you had to be physically close  But now it's everywhere  Oh, and it also has to be at the moment of pairing although  It used to be that most devices paired kind of more automatically than they do today

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The the scenario as attacker, uh close enough to you within 30 feet could use their device to masquerade as your  Security key connects to your device the moment you're asked to press the button on your key  So it's kind of an intercept  After that they could attempt to change their device to appear as a bluetooth keyboard or mouse and then take actions on your device  So this would be something like in a coffee shop. You'd have to be careful  Uh also the other hacker's convention or you don't take don't take it to the hacker's convention

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you take your ub key to defcon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Or not ub key your ub key safe. Yeah, it's the bluetooth the ble key  When you're trying to sign into an account on your device  You're normally asked to press the button on the security key to activate it  Again, a nearby attacker can potentially connect their own device to your affected security key before your own connects  And in this case the device the attacker could sign into your account using their device  If the attacker somehow already obtained your username and password and could time these events exactly in other words  It's a tough. It's not an easy hack still google is offering  Replacements so if you're using the bluetooth titan security key mighty big at google get the replacement  Um, yeah, what was I gonna point to something do you I actually want your opinion on this one?  Uh buzzfeed had a a shocked i'm shocked article about soph  YouTube's newest far-right foul-mouthed red-pilling star is a 14 year old girl  Uh, it said oh whatever you do. Don't go watch her videos  uh  But actually they said don't imagine it watch it it's already here  Uh, she says she's a comedian. I watched them. She's very funny  But if you didn't know that it was tongue in cheek  It'd be a little scary. I don't it's a it's kind of profanity laden  I'm not sure  Well, we can oh  Oh, well look at that this video has been removed for violating youtube's policy and hate news  So I thought she was kind of funny. She's it's the kind of humor a high school sophomore  Which she is  A very very smart high school sophomore might  Do to mock, you know the current?  zeitgeist  Um, and she says some hateful things, you know, but uh hateful in satire in satire. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, um, does she read any presidential tweets? No

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She does not sorry  So you haven't seen it so and now you can't so never mind I can't  What buzzfeed is saying and I think this is not wrong joseph bernstein's reporting  Is that this is the kind of video that exists and gets promoted on youtube?  and  And she by the way has 800 000 subscribers. So she's clearly benefited from  you know, uh  Automatic promotion of her videos  Uh, he says it's because youtube deliberately ignores toxic content as a growth strategy  Soph scripts which she says she writes with a collaborator are familiar a mix of hatred towards muslims anti-black racism  Byzantine fear-mongering about pedophilia tissue thin in cell evolutionary psychology  And reflexive misanthropy that could have been copied and pasted from thousand different 4chan posts  Of course, it's all presented in the terminally ironic style popularized popularized by boundary pushing comedy groups  Like the influential million dollar extreme and adopted late by white supremacist mass shooters in christ church in san diego  What it seems to me is the what it points up is the difficulty  For anybody especially youtube of figuring out is this satire parody or real

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so watch out here comes the jeff spiel watch out. I knew that's why I brought this up. I wanted a jeff  Here comes it. So I I spent  Last week after I left you in la for my get ready  Transatlantic high-level working group on content moderation and freedom of expression  Oh, that sounds um  Well, it's actually fascinating actually very good. Take it a batch and then and then I know I know I need a sash  And I'm on the transatlantic working group out of the way, I want you to add it to the lower third and member of yes  So then then yesterday was yesterday what day is but this is exactly the stuff I presume you deal with  Yeah, it is. So then then two more things about this. So I was in I was in the senate  on on tuesday  Meeting with a senator and various members of congress on on similar issues and I was and then today I interviewed  Uh vice president of safety for facebook at a facebook safety  Conference, so i've been on this stuff a lot lately  And there's a new concept has entered my head. It's very hard to get it in there  It takes a takes a major mallet to get it in there  But in the discussion of the high-level working group  um, not just a working group a high-level working group, um  I've come to be convinced that  One should note should not regulate content but should instead regulate behavior

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now that I didn't that made it didn't make it I like that no I like that because that solves this free speech problem  Well, it doesn't solve it doesn't you know, it's still the fire shouting fire fire in a crowded theater  Uh is still the troubling one, right? But um, right but but past that if you're if you're trying to regulate speech  Yeah, it gives you kind of a bright line

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does so so so one of the one of the constructs in this group was  ABC actors behavior content and where do you where do you tackle? It could be actors you could say, you know  Extremists we want to get rid of them, but that's hard  It could be content but just in this case, you know, try to judge the content itself  whereas if you go after behavior and say that there is  evidence of an effort  to  Uh falsify and manipulate the form of formation of public opinion by these nasty means and mechanisms that you go after their behavior  and um, so so so the problem with  um  The german law about hate speech is you've got to define the content  And the problem is the company has to do it the government doesn't the courts don't do it  The problem with where the uk government is going with its online harms report is to say that the content is harmful

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, all right, let me give you an example and see how your abc model works  Mm-hmm. So among other things and this may have been the one that got her pulled down  Sof  Uh again, this is a 14 year old  uh  middle schooler  Making these videos  Uh when I mess with her in the lunchroom when youtube deactivated comments on her videos  Uploaded a 12 minute video in which she said  Susan referring to youtube ceo susan wodziski susan i've known your address since last summer  I've got a luger and a mitochondrial disease. I don't care if I live why should I care if you live or your children?  I just called an uber you've got about seven minutes to draft up a wheel. I'm coming for you  It ain't going to be pretty now that sounds like a death threat

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm sure because youtube gets those and someone actually came into their head  That

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think it's probably intended as comedy. I know it is she didn't do it  Where how do you how do you address that and and what's the difference between?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Behavior and content when the behavior is posting inciting violence. Well, yeah, there's posting content, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the behavior. That's the behavior not actually shooting anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, carsten harvard boy  the uh  Sorry  He he he for off air last week carsten got in like three zingers on me

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I gotta try to get a zinger it really did it was it was amazing. He was he was whoa  He was just one two. He went to that uh dutch that we had  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  um  so, uh, no the behavior isn't isn't as as as um  Literal as that the behavior is trying to swing an election by lying to people  That's a behavior

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Uh, and it's content based but it is posting on youtube is not a behavior  Well, what about what this what I just read to you which seems pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that goes to it. So then there's two there's two layers here, right? One is terms of service in the other word is legality  on um  Terms of service. I would just say that if if you run a civilized decent service you would say, uh, um  Killing people is not funny  Don't threaten it and we don't want that on our service. Yeah, period. So youtube did

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  after after  Being contacted by buzzfeed youtube did pull that particular video and issue her a strike  But they didn't pull any of the other videos they have since obviously because I just went to see it and it's not there anymore

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, so on may 14 and I think this is her account, uh at sewer nugget  Uh, I just got another strike get on bit chute before i'm gone i'll make more updates there and on patreon

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's it's you know  Does does it does a comedian have an obligation?  To stay away from anything like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Comedians go too far. Yes, they can  Uh now it all depends on whom you ask right if you watched the white house dinner last year some people thought  uh  A line was crossed. I didn't  But the server here's the hard part for these services. They are they have no choice now but to make decisions like human beings  And they hate doing that. They don't want to do that. Um, I understand why they don't want to do that  But they've got to decide this either fits that we're the ones with the cops  We're the only ones with the power to turn things on and off  So we're going to take this down now. Now. Meanwhile you have  um  I'm going to go to a a working group. No, it was this a workshop  next week on facebook's  new  Uh effort to create kind of a an appeals court  They're holding these things trying to learn how to do it  Right now is that a cop-out is that facebook saying somebody else should do it?  It's a cop-out by government. I already think his government's not doing it, but there'll be some appeal structure

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To go to by the way, so sof's account is still there. She now has 900 000 subscribers  So the strisand effect takes right in. Oh, yeah, um that video is gone. So is the one that buzzfeed writes about  um, but you know, I it's clear to me it was clear to me, um to me that she  Is uh, this is comedy  she's 14, so maybe not fully understanding the  her responsibility  um, but uh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's intended as commentary an absolute right to say we don't want jokes about killing people. It's too close to home

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, you're off service has the right to do that. Oh, there's no well, there's no question  The service has a right to do whatever it wants  Right. I mean clearly it can ban her it doesn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not just the issue of banning  I think what this buzzfeed article talks about and what's something that we're we have been talking about and should be talking about  That google absolutely or youtube absolutely has the thing to think about is  they've been  algorithmically pushing people towards this content that helps indoctrinate other people  And that's he's holding this up as an example of a way to get into that  So it's not just regulating like what people can say and who can say what and all of that. It's that  I think that once you click on something like this you get further and further down the rabbit hole  It's kind of how I took some of this article

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the intent is not I don't think soph's intent is to indoctrinate. I think it's to  uh paradise

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, which does indoctrinate right? Yeah, you start with that and then you go further  And maybe it'd be fine. I mean she may have been radicalized in order to get more and more subscribers

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, she's got hundreds of thousands of views on all our videos  Um, so she  There's certainly some incentive some perverse incentive  Just by her viewers to maybe go more and more radical radical, but I long on patreon is soph is creating a generation of dissidents  I can't you know, I was 14 once many years ago and I understand  There's a certain kind especially among precocious and very smart  Kids and you know at that age there is a like a  Screw the world kind of anarchy kind of sense of humor. I kind of get it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I overdosed on mural acts and now i'm terrorizing youtube from hell says her paper  I think she's hysterical to be honest with you if you want to prevent gen z from becoming like millennials  Keep me off the streets and away from crack and be mildly entertained while the world as you know it comically crumbles away  Please consider surrendering a couple of your precious shackles to the channel

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So there's a sense of humor to it. Obviously she's precocious and very bright  I mean maybe maybe I you know, do we let now are we gonna  Want to live in maybe we have to live in a world where there's just certain things you can't  Certain boundaries you can't go out of even if your intent is pure and the comedy is there you just can't go there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you just  You're tasteless  As my mom would say that that's not funny. That's just tasteless stacy. Yeah, but who enforces the taste who decides the tastemaker?  the point is  You know if if you decide something's tasteless with youtube or with yeah with youtube just  They don't they could decide that they could be like, yeah, we don't want to be the home for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're not deciding that they haven't decided that they should decide that I think that I don't know if they need to be an arbiter

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of they kind of just decided that today with the yes, they did when they took her down  They're like, oh everybody's upset about this  And that's I think the issue  And that's why I don't like talking about this issue because that's like asking these content providers to be an arbiter of taste in some  ways if we don't have a  Clearly defined thing. I think it's legit to talk about clearly defined rules like you are jeff with your abc or ac whatever  Um, but I do think the more interesting issue and the thing that the platform should focus on is how not to  To use hate as a growth generation

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, absolutely agree stacy. Yes, it's it's it's it's whether the platform exploits it further  Uh or digs you in further. I agree and that's and that that is most definitely a decision by the platform itself  That's the platform's activity agreed  So so today I was at uh, this this facebook thing and I asked, um  The executive I was talking to uh, you know two weeks ago or so you took down alex jones and farah conan  Everybody asked me what took so long what took you so long?  and their argument is  That this was streamed live. This is nothing secret their argument is that they  um that they have levels of punishment  And the the highest level is to is to forbid a person from coming onto the platform and that they judge off platform behavior  Which kind of struck me as a little bit odd in a way  that then facebook is not just a judge of  Activity on its platform, which is its full right and it's its right to do whatever it wants to in any case  But now it becomes a judge of your life outside

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they're what they're trying to do which is the most difficult thing of all is to judge intent  And so they're using whatever data points they can find  Uh, I would imagine soph is pretty much anonymous  This buzzfeed reporter did apparently track her down and her father, but uh, she her intent is clearly to be a not mostly anonymous  Um, and it is a challenge and I think the high level working group  Has its job cut out for it. Absolutely. I like the abc. I like that. I think you know actions

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there was a matrix. Yeah, it was actor behavior content across the top and on the left was legal and illegal  And different things get picked in on each of those right the legal you've heard me do the spiel in the show before a few weeks ago  Uh, there's been a proposal for what is now being called an e court, which I wrote about at length on medium  Uh an internet court and that when things are in dispute legally that should be done with due process in public  And and that's a matter of equality when it is legal  Uh, the uk harms report once again said they wanted their platforms to get rid of  Legal but harmful content which is to say that once they tell the platform you get rid of it or else your ass is grass  Then it's illegal

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a back door a back door illegality and that is absurd. Yeah  So it's challenging. I mean should patreon  YouTube is not closed soph's channel, but they have taken down selectively taken down some videos her patreon page is up and  You know, it's full of all sorts of  Creepiness it's creepy. I'll i'll grant you that there's definitely it's what she's doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Creepiness so I was talking to people staffers at congress  And they were arguing they were praising reddit  to the hilt really and their argument was  Uh, well, yeah, it has some weird stuff on there, but you gotta look for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're they're using reddit as an exemplar of how it should be done

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, because they say that the the moderation comes down to each of the of the subreddits

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But also reddit will pull stuff. That's really reprehensible reddit will you really?  Really really represents. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  really  Interesting so I don't know that reddit is a great model  The other interesting thing about all this is that I don't know if you saw this. Oh, this is this is actually  So france announced a new regulatory regime  three days ago  And the guy who created it was is in the high level working group and was kind of influenced by our our talk  And so I was with him in congress as well benoît luttrelle  brilliant wonderful guy  and  um  So the way that france is is constructing this regulator is that they're not going to go after  They're not going to try to change content on a platform. They think that's wrong  They think they think the platform is media. I argue with him about that and they don't want to but they don't want to  Manipulate or manage or edit media instead what they want to do is get accountability  and transparency  And so their view of regulation is they go for the platforms and tell them they have to have as we've discussed in the show before  a  Standard that they set with the public each each one can be different. Yeah, uh, that makes sense and then and then here to provide  they have to adhere to it they have to provide data to the  um regulator and the regulator has a stick  And if they are if they fail at their obligation or if they fail at the transparency

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Stick overhead it's the analog of a privacy policy except it's an acceptable speech policy, but it's enforced the same way

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of two things about this one is that  Uh, the regulator did a six month or about a four month role playing exercise  With facebook, so they were kind of embedded in facebook  Where they  Um  Had a small team on both  Uh, the facebook executive said that they had called it a pizza team  You know the standard thing and no more people than can eat one pizza. I said it should be called a quiche team  And and and so they role played without the regulation behind it  But what what would the relationship be like? What would the process be like?  What were they going after and that yielded this fairly sensible regulation?  Regulation and listen to me saying that listen to me. I don't say that very often. Well, I would it's good

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's find means to create sensible regulations  um, that actually does sound pretty good if  How could youtube be more like reddit in that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  regulators, they would have uh in in in their view and I don't agree with this but in in in the  congressional staffers view they would have  Sub-communities that have moderators some power moderators and power over that so it's not just one model  I have to say what stacey was saying a minute ago. Do you want one singular monolith to make singular decisions for all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's where we are with youtube and facebook you could the big difference to me between youtube and reddit  Is the recommendation engine? I mean reddit has horrible stuff  As he as you pointed out he said well, but you don't see it. It's hidden away in the corners  And if it gets too horrible, they'll ban it, but there's lots of stuff that's you know, just borderline  YouTube could do the same thing the the problem we have we keep breaking up bringing up is the recommendation engine

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's it's people versus letting a computer do it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but if they didn't recommend extremist stuff, it would just kind of die away, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you if you had people or moderators who actually recommended content you would probably get more appropriate content  So if I go look up  Something about vaccines like i'm a kid doing a report  I probably if a person's picking my next video  It's probably you know, maybe it's the life history of louis pastore or something like that versus like  I don't vaccines cause autism twitter is now

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  fighting a vaccine misinformation by redirecting people who search for  vaccine tweets to  A post from the united states department of health and human services  and vaccines dot  Gov  Know the facts they say before you be sure make sure you get the best information on vaccinations  From the us department of health and human services. That's kind of an interesting way to  To handle that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, but there's always going to be people, you know  There's that whole contingent of people who are like well the government of course the government doesn't want to tell us

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're responsible for chemtrails. We know that  so um  I honestly  What what would be what if youtube got rid of recommendations?  Would that really harm their business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but here's the problem leo that my complaint with youtube as a user is that I can't find anything on it  Yeah, so I actually why their recommendations just aren't very good  That's interesting facebook's recommendations are much better and and by the way again  I I say I say this again and again and again  I go down my facebook and I don't find a single nazi or a bad thing on it  I find good stuff. I'm on there a lot. I follow a lot of people. It's all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good. What if though lias if I mean it's up to creators  To find a way to market themselves  Do they I mean, I don't know what if they what if it feels like youtube sticks its thumb on the scale?  And and in doing so uh brings a lot of burden on itself

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or it's just worse or it's just it's just it's just it's it's so simplistic that it says oh you like fire  Uh, i'll give you 9 11. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and they also tend I mean as part of their engagement things  I know that people were looking and they send you to longer and longer content right and I will say  You know well done service journalism or well done informative content  Some of that is designed to be consumed quickly because people probably don't want the nitty nitty gritty

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They just want to understand something right? Well algorithmic recommendations are always going to do the wrong thing  I think in the long run because they're going to optimize for profit  Well, no, no, because they're going to optimize for engagement and profit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't have to though. That's the beauty of an algorithm. You could you could optimize for having someone walk away  Better informed like able to take a test on this topic and get a higher score  You could actually build a system that optimizes for that  But we don't because why not we're going to make money. Oh, okay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the problem is capitalism

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well  The problem is and you could even you could also optimize in a secondary, you know  Maybe you optimize for engagement, but you dump things that don't lead to a better informed consumer  We just we haven't gotten that sophisticated yet like for I know we feel like we're smart at ai, right?  But it's a really blunt instrument right now to be like this is how we make money

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thus, do you think this is a particular thing? You think the platforms are working hard to make make it work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. I think they're having those discussions. I mean, it's hard to know  How to do something in a way that's realistic because they they also have to do this in a way that's cheap

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think to implement I think mark zuckerberg is probably at this point if he's telling his team anything is let's figure out how to optimize  not for profit  Or maximizing engagement but for some other value  Whatever it is whether it's your value to be become way better informed or

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you shift to privacy or is basically about building services a layer for services to happen on the platform  Then what you're looking at is his optimization strategy will change

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually my favorite  uh  suggestion  For facebook that i've seen yet  And we we talked about chris hughes saying it's time to break them up and of course many democratic candidates are starting to think about this  uh comes from john cons josh constein at uh  tech crunch he says it's it's simple  Just require facebook  To let you export your social graph your friends list  friend portability is the must-have  well  The thing is the thing that keeps people from trying to write a facebook competitor is  Oh is because you don't have that I see right. I can't export my friend graph to that new thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, so so I I like that's that's the wordpress model  That there is there is an open source something  Upon which others can build and facebook has the advantage of being the first to build but I can build it too. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That sounds like kick remember when kick was like export your friend graph  I mean like what if I don't want to be on your new social network?  You can't export my data. You can't make me no no no no stacy, but but all I want to do is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Give me my friends

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but as a friend of someone maybe I don't want to be well you don't and then I would send you an invite saying

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd like to invite you to my new i'm leaving facebook, but I found something better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I get those all the time and I think that's  I don't know that that's really the answer. I guess is what i'm saying. I mean  There's I mean, how many times do you get invited to like the next?  LinkedIn or the next whatever for through people's contacts. I mean, that's kind of what this is  And if i'm i'm not trying to be obtuse i'm i'm genuinely like I just don't understand why they think here's why I like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  First of all, it's something that can be easily done with governmental regulation  The technology that exists without as far as I could tell any hazard. It's merely giving  it's giving  every user of facebook  Some of the information that is in their account which right now they can't easily extract  He says the ftc must require facebook to offer truly interoperable data portability for the social graph  Government should pass regulations forcing facebook to let you export your friend list to other social networks in a privacy safe  way  The social graph on facebook is not your contact list stacy. You know, it's more than that  My contact right right or maybe not maybe your contact list is that social graph

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's it's their posts and that sort of thing as well. I assume

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I don't think it includes well, it could include content, but I don't think it has to  I think the his thinking and my thinking would be to include. Well, it would need to include enough so that  I could go to another platform  So what is what is makes what it makes facebook an insurmountable wall what gives them an insurmountable advantage  All my friends are on it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what you say, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead. Sorry stacy. Sorry, but your friends are actually on it  so if you really want to make something competitive what you do is you create some sort of like  A jabber protocol for your social network updates and then anyone could actually create a social network update on whatever  Format or not format. Sorry platform they choose and post it and then if I want to be your friend on my own  personal  Email client or social network client then I could pull in all the relevant data  And we don't have to be on the same platform that would make it truly interoperable  But that's not what they're talking about  But if I don't participate  Then I don't understand how having your social graph if i'm in your social graph  But you can't see me or my information and I don't want to be on your platform. It doesn't matter

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, then you don't want to be my friend and so then that's fine  No, I mean seriously

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it just means I don't want to be your friend on a social net on that social network. You don't want to be our friend

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't want to be anyone's Facebook definitely sees this as a threat because they have such a thing it's called fine friends, but that  Is they've blocked competitors from using it twitter vine voxer message me  They block

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they think it's two professors have written about this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From the university of chicago luigi zingales and gary rolnik  And this is their op-ed from two years ago a way to own  your social media  data  And that's where josh refers people to this idea  I mean, yeah, I mean that's one problem is you can't just export  I can't just bring all my friends to some new social network  Unless maybe it's an interoperable social network so that I can be on it  I don't it could be a one-way street  I could I mean in a way isn't that what people do when they take their twitter feed and they post it to their facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Feed it's like well look at the other way leo is that all of these social networks will allow you to import your contacts not export  Right, so it's it's pretty pretty basic. Yeah, basically you just need an xmpp for social networks  Yeah, yeah  That I mean I have like google plus content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All right, well I thought it was a good idea but you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I it may be I mean again you guys i've only had like three hours of sleep last night  So I could just be stupid about this. I just don't I just fundamentally you're right. You raise an interesting point

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  um, and maybe it isn't sufficient  to  Create new competitors to facebook, but it doesn't seem to be too much to ask. This is after all my social graph

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean and if you want to take that he says you can export your social data though

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think so like who your friends are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you're you don't want your friends would object at some level

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, i'm like, why would I want my friends if they're not actually going to communicate with me on this then it's like a yearbook  I just what do they say? I don't want to be known

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stacey, I don't want it known that i'm your friend  Uh-uh. So stacy don't you take that elsewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I agree your preference would be then to fix facebook rather than to try to make it easy to have competition for facebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you want I I guess my my point is if you want competition for facebook, you need an xmp for social networks

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that could be designed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but and then you would have to force them to use it. Ah, well, that's that's kind of what we're talking about in a way

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's provide access. That's not what we're talking. Well provide access somehow  To your social graph you're you're saying they'd also have to accept input data as well as it'd have to be a two-way street. Yeah  Okay  I'm willing to accept that addition to the josh constein theorem

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then it becomes a chat client basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, it can be whatever you want it to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. You could you could add extra features to build on like kind of like apple or  One of the many google messengers has done with you know, sms. You could actually build some neat things  and  Then you're then you're competing on the services that you've built around the social graph as opposed to  The lock just the lock in the wall  Oh my god, you guys i'm gonna go get a cup of coffee. Y'all keep talking amongst yourselves

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's talk about the christ church call to action facebook  Uh has signed this  It's a joint statement in support of the christ church call to action to eliminate terrorist and violent extremists violent extremist content online  We come together  Resolute in our commitment to ensure we are doing all we can to fight the hatred and extremism that leads to terrorist  Violence this is the one that president trump would not sign would not sign right  Facebook did though. So I think that's maybe more important

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But but so the the trump argument  Is that this could violate the first amendment, right? I don't see how because it's not government  I guess oh, I guess unless government if he signs it it would oh, I see  Well, no, but but it doesn't all it's it's not it's not a law right it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, just fight hatred and extremism. That's all we ask it's guidance  I can understand why any government might be reluctant to sign on to that but certainly private enterprise  should  Uh, however, it is governments

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well  Government's gonna pass lots of regulation  Uh telling the platforms to do lots of things  Um, I don't know. I gotta I want I want to talk some lawyers about this. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Technology companies also committed to a nine-point plan that sets out concrete steps they will take  To address the abuse of technologies. Of course facebook is ground zero for this because the christ church  Slaughter was broadcast on facebook live

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Meanwhile facebook made some other changes to live. I think today that I don't fully understand yet  But they think will help prevent that they think will help  Well, yeah, it would have if you've had any complaints against you on facebook  You can't you're you're blocked out alive and that would have prevented the christchurch guy because there were some  unstated complaints against him in the past. Well

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't stop somebody from creating a new account. I mean, I don't true that if there's if they're killing a million a day

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very hard. Shouldn't do you think you should have buffering on something like that? Um, just because

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of a 40 minute delay or something an hour delay, but not a 40 minute delay like a five minute delay  Well, but it took longer than an hour for somebody to complain and longer than that. Yeah, here's the problem stacy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not going to be I thought about that, but it's not going to be reported until someone can see it, right?  Well, that oh your algo your algo might try to look at but the algo looking at videos is is is really right  Yeah, so you're right. Okay  No good point on the public. Oh, oh, oh  Carson put that in the rundown stacy said I had a good point. I will I will

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I
